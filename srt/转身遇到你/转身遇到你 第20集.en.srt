1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,160
Go and get some rest.

3
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,600
Is that Huaming?

4
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,919
Xinxin, I don't think you need to be like this.

5
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,160
There's nothing wrong with him liking you.

6
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,960
I just feel that

7
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
I went a bit too far today.

8
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,760
No, this has nothing to do with you.

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,540
You did nothing wrong.

10
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Ah.

11
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,020
You must never get so worked up again.

12
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,610
We're lucky nothing serious happened today.

13
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,960
Don't worry.

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,280
Huaming won't come around anymore

15
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,600
to disturb our lives.

16
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,680
Xiaogan and I will always take care of you.

17
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,440
Xinxin, I've been waiting so long to hear you say that.

18
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,040
Could you stop calling me auntie from now on?

19
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,960
Mom.

20
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,600
Xiaogan.

21
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,400
Quickly, call the lawyer

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,530
and tell him to come here right now.

23
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,130
I want to change my will.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,520
Mom, focus on getting better first.

25
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,360
This can wait. Don't rush.

26
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,240
No.

27
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,760
Although I know my own body well,

28
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,920
today was really too close a call.

29
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,800
What if one day I can't catch my breath

30
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,010
what will happen to you two?

31
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
What about my grandson?

32
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
Mom, you...

33
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,890
Please don't say such unlucky things.

34
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,400
Okay, Mom. I'll call right away,

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,120
but it's so late now.

36
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll ask him to come first thing tomorrow.

37
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,520
No.

38
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,960
He must come immediately, right now.

39
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,640
Go quickly.

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,720
Okay.

41
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,680
Hello?

42
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,940
We're about to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

43
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,460
What are you doing?

44
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,120
You scared me to death!

45
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,650
I thought you were Qin Gang.

46
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,220
Why are you still hanging around here? Let's go.

47
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,159
What's wrong?

48
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,360
Look, it's almost 5 o'clock now.

49
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,280
That bastard will definitely go find Liu Wei after work.

50
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:58,960
Brother, don't worry.

51
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,760
This time I'll definitely get photos of them together.

52
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,160
We'll wipe away our previous humiliation.

53
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,120
Learn from your mistakes.

54
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,960
He knows we've photographed him before.

55
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,640
Would he stay here and let you take pictures freely?

56
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,200
Wait, what does that mean?

57
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,120
Give up?

58
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,560
Who said anything about giving up? This is a strategic retreat.

59
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,920
We'll let him lower his guard.

60
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,480
Make him think the danger is gone.

61
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,080
Then he'll slip up on his own.

62
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,640
Let's go.

63
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,040
Just like that?

64
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,680
What's wrong?

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,960
Here he comes!

66
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,360
Hey!

67
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
Hey, Xinxin.

68
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,040
How's my mom doing?

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
She's much better today.

70
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,720
I'm planning to take her out for a walk this afternoon.

71
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
What would you like to eat?

72
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm fine with anything.

73
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,880
Hold on a second.

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,159
Dr. Hua.

75
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,040
Dr. Hua, where are you?

76
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,920
He's at the company.

77
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,720
At the company entrance?

78
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,880
Why is he there?

79
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,880
Now Dr. Hua and Xu Ke...

80
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,680
He's my knight in shining armor.

81
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,400
Yes.

82
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,520
He takes me to work on time.

83
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,040
And waits for me after work.

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,640
Put him on the phone.

85
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,120
Don't be angry.

86
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,320
There might be a misunderstanding between Dr. Hua and me.

87
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,800
We just need to clear things up.

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
Don't let my mom know.

89
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Her blood pressure will spike again.

90
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,120
I'll go buy seafood now.

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,650
Wait for me to come back.

92
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,040
Alright, bye-bye.

93
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,240
Dr. Hua.

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,240
Why are you giving me such a hard time?

95
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,520
Permission.

96
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,920
Why are you here?

97
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,240
I'm... taking portrait photos.

98
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,080
No, actually...

99
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,400
I want to buy a new car.

100
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
Right, this dealership is for buying cars.

101
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,600
But you...

102
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,360
Can you afford such a nice car?

103
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,170
Is it expensive?

104
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,480
I think it's affordable.

105
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,960
The car is nice, but this dealership...

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,820
And this person...

107
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,120
Not so great.

108
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm asking if you can afford it.

109
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,320
If I can't, I'll borrow money from you.

110
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,000
Fine, I'll lend you some. Let's go.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,260
Let's go get the money.

112
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,360
Let's go.

113
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,320
Wait.

114
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,800
Dr. Hua.

115
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,920
I'm warning you.

116
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,600
If you...

117
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
keep interfering with my life like this,

118
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
I won't be so polite anymore.

119
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,600
You don't stand a chance.

120
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,760
You can't beat him.

121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,880
Ming.

122
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,120
Xinxin.

123
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,920
Mom.

124
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,640
Why are you up?

125
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,040
Where's Bao?

126
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,490
He just fell asleep.

127
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,920
That's why I came down.

128
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,720
Come, sit for a while.

129
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,840
Why don't you rest a bit longer?

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,920
What's the point of lying down?

131
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,040
This is my old condition. I know what's happening.

132
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,360
Someone like me

133
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,600
might not make it through one day.

134
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
That's just how it is.

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,860
Auntie, that's not even considered an illness.

136
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,240
Didn't the doctor say

137
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,200
you should stay happy

138
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,280
and keep your blood pressure stable?

139
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,680
The key is to avoid getting emotional.

140
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,810
Then you'll be fine.

141
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,000
I know.

142
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,720
By the way, that medication I've been taking,

143
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,960
the blood pressure medicine prescribed by the doctor here.

144
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Ni...

145
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,360
Nifedipine.

146
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,760
It's similar to what I took in America.

147
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,720
Works very well.

148
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
That's great!

149
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,920
But you can't just rely on medication.

150
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,720
You need to regulate yourself and stay in a good mood.

151
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,320
Of course I'm happy.

152
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
You and the baby are back.

153
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,120
Our family is reunited.

154
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,720
I have no reason not to be happy.

155
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
As long as that Huaming doesn't come to cause trouble,

156
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,450
I absolutely won't have anything to worry about.

157
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,000
Auntie, when the baby wakes up later,

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
could you look after him for me?

159
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
I need to go out for a bit. I'll be back soon.

160
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,250
Where are you going?

161
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm going to buy some things. I'll be back shortly.

162
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,160
Okay.

163
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,420
So you still remember to come find me.

164
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,240
I've got this big problem I can't shake off.

165
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
That Hua Ming is really determined to fight me.

166
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,640
He wants to challenge me.

167
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,280
He really thinks he's somebody important.

168
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,880
When will this ever end?

169
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,040
Don't worry. Soon.

170
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
I met with the lawyer today.

171
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,730
I'll be taking over the family business soon.

172
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,720
Soon, soon. You always say soon.

173
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,280
I can't just stay at home all day like this.

174
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,480
It's suffocating.

175
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,640
I have a pile of work at my company.

176
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,680
I can only handle everything remotely by phone.

177
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,400
What will happen to my magazine if this continues?

178
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,360
Forget the magazine, I need you.

179
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,000
The family business is huge.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I need someone to help me, right?

181
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,040
If it weren't for that troublemaker Hua Ming,

182
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,480
making my mother sick with anger,

183
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,740
all this would have been resolved by now.

184
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,880
But you can't just let him

185
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,680
keep causing trouble like this.

186
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,280
What can I do? We live in a society with laws.

187
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,600
I can't exactly challenge him to a duel, can I?

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
We need to think of a long-term plan.

189
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,420
Let me think of a solution for you.

190
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,040
What's your idea?

191
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,490
Make him disappear for a while.

192
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,540
Then no one will be causing you trouble anymore.

193
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,680
Why are you back?

194
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,100
Have you eaten? I'll make you something.

195
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,780
Watch some TV. I'll be done cooking soon.

196
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,380
What exactly are you trying to do?

197
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,840
What's wrong?

198
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,500
Are you still pretending to be clueless?

199
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,880
You were the one who told me to move back.

200
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,760
The Qin family is wealthy and powerful.

201
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,240
After your brother returns to the Qin family,

202
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,360
he'll get a better education.

203
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,480
Really, it's a good thing.

204
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,760
I finally accepted him

205
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,000
I was living with his family

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,560
and starting a new life.

207
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,080
Now that I've gone back home,

208
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,920
you keep going there causing trouble.

209
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,780
What exactly are you trying to do?

210
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,730
I think something's wrong.

211
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,980
What do you think is wrong?

212
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,680
Ever since that incident at the car dealership,

213
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,080
you've been saying something's wrong.

214
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,280
That the whole situation is suspicious.

215
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,880
If there's a problem, why don't you just say it?

216
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,880
I don't know.

217
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,370
I just feel something's not right.

218
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,720
Are you okay?

219
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,200
You're a grown man, yet you go there making scenes every day.

220
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,080
Don't you know that Mrs. Qin

221
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,680
has been hospitalized?

222
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,040
Do you want her to die from anger?

223
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,420
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

224
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,280
I won't go to their house anymore.

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,160
I hope in the future

226
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
you'll stop disrupting my life too.

227
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,880
This is my choice.

228
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I won't regret it.

229
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,840
I regret it.

230
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm telling you I regret persuading you to go back.

231
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,920
I want you to move back in with me.

232
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,280
You regret it?

233
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,200
Saying this now, don't you think

234
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,840
you're being ridiculous?

235
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,040
What do you think I am?

236
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,480
Someone you can summon and dismiss at will?

237
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,440
What's the point of saying this now?

238
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,080
Xinxin.

239
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,120
Everything I've done

240
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
was to help you and Bao.

241
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,480
I came here today to tell you

242
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,000
I've decided to remarry Qin Gang.

243
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,640
Are you sure?

244
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,760
Yes, I am.

245
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,840
Don't you want to say something?

246
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,480
No.

247
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,120
Fine.

248
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,280
I know you're a good person.

249
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,290
You've been good to both me and Bao.

250
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
But I can never figure you out.

251
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,760
I never know

252
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,000
what you're really thinking inside.

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,480
That door of yours is always closed to me.

254
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,960
I can never open it.

255
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,920
It's not just me. Any woman

256
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
would feel insecure.

257
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,960
Can't you change?

258
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,640
Wan Xinxin.

259
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,400
Since I met you,

260
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,920
I've changed a lot.

261
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,580
Then I guess I don't know you well enough.

262
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,170
Or maybe I'm just not the right person for you.

263
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,520
I hope

264
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,570
you find the right person someday.

265
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,480
Let me nibble those little feet.

266
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,120
Look at those tiny feet.

267
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,960
Look at him.

268
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,560
So handsome and beautiful at such a young age.

269
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,000
He's little Xiao Gang now.

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,320
When he grows up, he'll be big Xiao Gang.

271
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,720
Mom, when Xiaobao starts elementary school,

272
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,580
we should send him to America.

273
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,640
Why? Why send him away so young?

274
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,880
You haven't lived abroad, so you don't understand.

275
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,480
The whole world is looking to China now.

276
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,240
Everyone is learning Chinese.

277
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,720
He must go to school here.

278
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,319
When he grows up, it will be his own choice.

279
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,480
Okay, Mom. Whatever you say.

280
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,520
What do you think?

281
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,200
What's your opinion?

282
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,760
Xinxin.

283
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,400
When are you two

284
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,080
going to have a proper wedding ceremony?

285
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,000
Mom, how could you ask Xinxin about this?

286
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,280
You should ask me.

287
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,880
Xinxin.

288
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
None of you need to worry about this.

289
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,700
I'll take care of everything.

290
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,440
What if Xinxin doesn't agree?

291
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,370
Mom, stop talking about it.

292
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
It's supposed to be a surprise, you know?

293
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,720
I haven't even proposed yet. How could she agree?

294
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,160
Xinxin, don't worry.

295
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,600
I promise to give you

296
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,120
an unforgettable, perfect wedding.

297
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,400
Hmm, I'm not worried.

298
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,240
Xinxin.

299
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,360
So, you agree to remarry Xiaogang?

300
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,840
I

301
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,360
Look at grandma.

302
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,840
I'm not talking to you.

303
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,640
I only want to speak with Wan Xinxin.

304
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,600
Let me tell you, don't push your luck.

305
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,920
You keep coming back to disturb my life.

306
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,320
Do you know how inappropriate your behavior is?

307
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm going to

308
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,200
teach you a lesson.

309
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,320
What are you doing?

310
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,680
Why are you here again?

311
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,600
Let's talk outside.

312
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,480
Let's go.

313
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,560
Don't scare him. It's fine.

314
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,920
What's going on?

315
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,120
Mom, it's nothing.

316
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,290
You dare threaten me? You must be tired of living.

317
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,680
Don't pull me. It hurts.

318
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,170
Where are you taking me?

319
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,600
Are you crazy?

320
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,460
Can I have some peace and quiet for a few days?

321
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,400
What's all this fuss about?

322
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,530
Who's making a fuss?

323
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,720
Wait, are you really getting back together with that scumbag?

324
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,880
Falling into the same trap twice.

325
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,210
Are you out of your mind?

326
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,040
What's wrong?

327
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,380
He's treating me well now.

328
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,760
His mother is nice to me too.

329
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,040
They're both good to Xiaobao.

330
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,520
Have you lost your memory? He's good to you?

331
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,040
Have you forgotten how he treated you before?

332
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,760
Cheating on you like it was his job.

333
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,920
You were raising the child while he was fooling around with other women.

334
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,780
Taking no responsibility at all.

335
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,380
Do you dare to love him?

336
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,120
Why wouldn't I?

337
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,560
Don't give me that.

338
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,440
Let me ask you seriously.

339
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,560
Do you actually love Huaming?

340
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,900
Can love put food on the table?

341
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,920
What do you mean 'can love put food on the table'?

342
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,320
What kind of talk is that?

343
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
No, you're saying that now

344
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,280
you'd rather cry in a BMW

345
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,010
than laugh on a bicycle, right?

346
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,920
No, what's happened to you?

347
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,960
What are you thinking about all day?

348
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,250
Are you still the Wan Xinxin I used to know?

349
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,120
The one who was decisive,

350
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
the one who took responsibility for her actions?

351
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
Where did she go?

352
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
She's dead.

353
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,320
What right do you have to judge me?

354
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
You think I don't want to go back to the past?

355
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,880
Back to before Qin Gang cheated?

356
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,640
But reality is, we can't go back.

357
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,400
I have a child now.

358
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Qin Gang cheated.

359
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,210
Have you forgotten?

360
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,720
When I was with my son,

361
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,980
how miserable those homeless days were.

362
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,410
You know that very well.

363
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
I don't want to go back to those days.

364
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,160
Then I don't understand.

365
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,120
If you don't want to go back to the past,

366
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,320
why are you getting back with this jerk?

367
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,780
Men always make mistakes.

368
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,250
He knows he was wrong

369
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,400
and is trying hard to make up for it now.

370
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,120
Why can't I forgive him?

371
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,680
Besides, I'm doing it for my child.

372
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,900
I lost my parents when I was young.

373
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,960
Other kids made fun of me.

374
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,560
I don't want other children

375
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,890
to make fun of my son too.

376
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,880
At least now my son

377
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,800
can be with his father and grandmother.

378
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,440
I'm giving him

379
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,370
a healthy environment to grow up in. Isn't that good?

380
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,040
Wan Xinxin.

381
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,920
You've really changed. You've matured.

382
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,880
But I don't know if this kind of maturity

383
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,200
is good or bad for you.

384
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,080
Don't you think sacrificing your own happiness

385
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,600
and missing out on a beautiful relationship

386
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,160
is being irresponsible to your own life?

387
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,290
Do you realize that?

388
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,880
What beautiful relationship am I missing?

389
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,880
Huaming?

390
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,360
Does he love me?

391
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,480
He...

392
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,600
I really can't figure him out.

393
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,520
It's like there's a wall between us.

394
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,560
He's always pushing me away.

395
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,080
He has never given me

396
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,520
a clear answer.

397
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,480
Okay.

398
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,800
So you're saying

399
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,160
as long as he gives you a clear answer,

400
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,800
you'll feel at ease, right?

401
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,370
I don't know.

402
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't want to deal with this right now.

403
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Wan Xinxin, let me tell you,

404
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,320
you're just afraid to face yourself.

405
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,920
You're afraid to be with the person you love

406
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,450
because you're scared of getting hurt again.

407
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,600
You're a coward.

408
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,360
Wan Xinxin, I'm telling you,

409
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,040
if you dare to remarry Qin Gang,

410
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,240
don't consider me your friend anymore.

411
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,120
Xu Ke, if you keep pushing me

412
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,520
don't consider me your friend anymore.

413
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,600
You're serious?

414
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,480
Fine.

415
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,380
Let's end our friendship.

416
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,560
Xu Ke!

417
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,600
Don't talk to me.

418
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,800
Fine, let's end it then.

419
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,300
Stop drinking.

420
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,090
You're something else.

421
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,480
Don't get drunk.

422
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,540
What? Acting like nothing happened?

423
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Why do you look more relaxed than me?

424
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,800
Didn't you say you wanted to fight

425
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,160
that bastard Qin Gang?

426
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
So fight him!

427
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,560
Out of ideas now?

428
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,410
You'll lose your senses if you drink more.

429
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,520
I don't care.

430
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,360
Damn Wan Xinxin.

431
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,760
Fine.

432
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,890
If you keep drinking like this, you'll really get drunk.

433
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
How will you improvise with me then?

434
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,720
Improvise?

435
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,000
I couldn't come up with anything even if I had 72 transformations.

436
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,930
I'm out of ideas.

437
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,080
Whatever she wants.

438
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,320
Handsome, can we join your table?

439
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,120
Join what? Can't you see we're talking?

440
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
Let me say something.

441
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,690
Look behind you.

442
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,940
Don't be so obvious when you turn.

443
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,480
Those two people behind us have been watching us for a while.

444
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,810
Have you considered that in such a big bar,

445
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,160
those two women specifically came to our table?

446
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,760
Something's definitely up.

447
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,160
Then let's leave.

448
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,400
Stay seated.

449
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,680
Didn't I tell you? We need to improvise.

450
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,760
Huh?

451
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,240
Improvise what? Are you crazy? What are you doing?

452
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,900
Just sit still and don't move.

453
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,480
What's going on?

454
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,600
Drink up. Aren't we here to drink?

455
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,040
Have you two decided?

456
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,560
Yes, we have.

457
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:26,880
Let's drink?

458
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,560
Mm, sure.

459
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Order whatever drinks you want.

460
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,800
Waiter, bring us drinks!

461
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,730
Please sit down.

462
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,080
Mister, you're so sexy.

463
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,040
How can you be so sexy?

464
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
I'm getting old. Only have one ab left.

465
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,240
What's going on?

466
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,320
Honey! That's him!

467
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,240
He was hitting on us

468
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,160
and being a creep. He even made us drink with him.

469
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,760
Hitting on my wife? You're asking for trouble!

470
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,600
Let me explain! Why are you pulling me?

471
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,130
No, wait.

472
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,000
Sir,

473
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,600
I'm sorry. I'd like to apologize.

474
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,920
I didn't know she was your wife.

475
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,480
And also,

476
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,000
we're just having drinks in a bar. Nothing happened.

477
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,240
Drinks my ass!

478
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,080
Don't get physical!

479
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,560
Talk it out, don't use your fists.

480
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,620
What's wrong with getting physical?

481
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,680
He hit someone!

482
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,520
Fighting, huh?

483
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,180
Security! They're fighting!

484
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,720
No, security! They're hitting people!

485
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,040
They're fighting!

486
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,800
They started it!

487
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,880
Stop arguing!

488
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,240
Everyone stop arguing!

489
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,960
Even if I hit someone, you can't handle this.

490
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,220
Let's call the police.

491
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,600
Call the police now!

492
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,280
Call the police! Hurry up!

493
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,160
Xu Ke.

494
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,780
Take my phone and follow those two women.

495
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,690
Follow those two women.

496
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,360
I'm the one who hit him. I'm right here.

497
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,040
Let's go!

498
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,880
Hurry up, driver.

499
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,280
Follow that taxi ahead.

500
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,440
Okay, stop!

501
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,280
I'll go.

502
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,560
It's done. How will you thank me?

503
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,600
I'm coming to see you now.

504
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,930
Still awake?

505
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,120
Yeah, not sleepy.

506
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Are you thinking about what happened with Xu Ke today?

507
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,480
They might have some misunderstandings about you.

508
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,740
Don't take it to heart.

509
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
It's okay.

510
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,440
As long as I can be with you,

511
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,460
I don't care about anything else.

512
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,720
I'm just wondering

513
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,280
if they keep

514
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,930
causing trouble like this,

515
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,560
when will it ever end?

516
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,440
I've already told him

517
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,200
not to disturb my life anymore.

518
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,640
Xinxin,

519
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,880
are you not ready

520
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,000
to be with me yet?

521
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
You answer it first.

522
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,440
I need to pick up a client at the airport.

523
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,400
Qin Gang.

524
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,440
Let's go get our marriage certificate.

525
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,960
Are you sure?

526
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,200
If they don't hear this news,

527
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,560
they'll keep making trouble.

528
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,240
I won't be able

529
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,200
to start my own life again.

530
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,220
You're not doing this reluctantly, are you?

531
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,920
It's my own decision.

532
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,040
That's wonderful!

533
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,130
I've been waiting so long to hear you say that.

534
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,960
When should we go?

535
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,460
The sooner the better.

536
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,840
Great. How about tomorrow?

537
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,880
It's okay. Go ahead and answer it.

538
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,940
You can share the good news with them.

539
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,260
I have to go now. I'm running late.

540
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,640
I'll have some drinks with them tonight

541
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,600
to celebrate.

542
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,460
If you drink, don't drive. Get a designated driver.

543
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,560
Go to bed without me.

544
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,050
What's up, Huaming?

545
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,160
It's me.

546
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,290
Why are you using his phone?

547
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,360
No, we were at the bar

548
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,610
and got into a fight.

549
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,200
Is he hurt?

550
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,680
What's the situation now?

551
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,560
He's fine,

552
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,620
but he's been detained by the police.

553
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,080
Why are you two so immature?

554
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,540
Can't you grow up a little?

555
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,120
It's not what you think. Listen to me.

556
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,920
About this matter,

557
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,280
Xu Ke, stop talking.

558
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,960
Tell Huaming

559
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,240
I'm getting my marriage certificate with Qin Gang tomorrow.

560
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,560
You can't go there.

561
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,040
It's all their setup.

562
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,680
Stop talking.

563
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,580
Don't call me anymore.

564
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,040
Goodbye.

565
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,120
Hello? Hello?

566
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Why didn't you bring your key again?

567
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,320
Look how pleased you are.

568
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,160
You're happy.

569
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,280
Tomorrow I'm going to get the marriage certificate with Wan Xinxin.

570
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,960
Now my mom can finally relax.

571
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,890
Hua Ming has been detained.

572
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,300
Now there's no obstacle between you two.

573
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,200
This is all thanks to you.

574
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,340
I just wonder if certain people, after getting remarried,

575
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,040
will forget all of this.

576
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,040
I won't. I'm very rational.

577
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,360
It's just that

578
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,640
I feel a bit sorry for Wan Xinxin.

579
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,360
Don't be angry.

580
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,880
Because she'll be taking care of my child after all.

581
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,800
I'm thinking that after I get the money,

582
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,840
I'll give her a bit more,

583
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,040
as compensation.

584
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
I knew you would be like this.

585
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,760
I'm doing all this for us.

586
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,560
Easy for you to say.

587
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,740
Haven't I told you before?

588
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,960
If you just want to be with me,

589
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,680
we can get married.

590
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,480
Why are you acting

591
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,080
like a spoiled princess now?

592
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,440
How can I be with you in my current situation?

593
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,560
Wouldn't that be going back to square one?

594
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,160
How could it be?

595
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,360
I have money and a green card now.

596
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,240
How could it be the same as before?

597
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,720
Your money is yours.

598
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,010
As for me, I'm still the same as before,

599
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,730
just a minor shareholder in a car dealership.

600
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,880
What do I have to keep your heart?

601
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,560
After some time,

602
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,560
you'll get tired of me and leave.

603
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,160
You know I won't. I don't care about these things.

604
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,720
But I do care.

605
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,880
If I don't have my own career,

606
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,120
if I don't have financial stability,

607
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,200
I always feel inferior in front of you.

608
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,480
I feel insecure.

609
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,920
How many times do I have to tell you before you understand?

610
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,880
Alright.

611
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,810
Let's not talk about this anymore.

612
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,160
You know.

613
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,400
You're the one I love most in my heart.

614
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,400
I'm doing this so we can have

615
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,560
a better life together

616
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,040
without any worries.

617
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,800
But whenever I think about

618
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,640
you two getting remarried soon,

619
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,130
I feel terrible.

620
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,480
Don't worry. I'll keep my promise.

621
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,240
Open the door!

622
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,000
Wait, how did you get up here?

623
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,720
Just open the door first. We'll talk after.

624
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,600
No way.

625
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,000
You think you're Spider-Man? Did you climb up here?

626
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Listen to me. Come with me right now.

627
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,040
Can you all please stop making a scene?

628
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,440
The old lady will get upset again if she wakes up.

629
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,480
Did Huaming send you here?

630
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,880
Tell him it's over between us.

631
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,120
When he pushed me into this situation,

632
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,600
why didn't he think about the consequences?

633
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,440
Fine.

634
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,280
I don't care about you and Huaming.

635
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,120
But I must intervene with you and Qin Gang.

636
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
What right do you have to interfere?

637
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
I just came from Liu Wei's place.

638
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,560
I saw her with my own eyes.

639
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
She never left.

640
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
You don't believe me, do you?

641
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,720
Come with me.

642
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,320
Surprise!

643
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,680
What are you doing?

644
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,680
Qin Gang,

645
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,520
get out of my house right now!

646
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,380
Don't touch me!

647
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,760
I'm calling security!

648
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,360
Who's making all this noise?

649
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,490
Thank goodness!

650
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,880
I'm so glad you're here.

651
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,560
Xinxin, it's not what you think.

652
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,620
Qin Gang, are you okay?

653
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,360
Qin Gang, are you alright?

654
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,160
Does it hurt?

655
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,520
Is it broken?

656
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,440
I meant her heart.

657
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,690
She deserves it.

658
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,240
Xinxin.

659
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,960
Are you okay?

660
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,580
Be careful!

661
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,600
Mom, you...

662
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,560
Xinxin isn't in your room.

663
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,960
Xinxin?

664
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,260
She's not home.

665
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,810
It's okay. I'll go look for her.

666
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,280
She left without telling me.

667
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,340
Weren't you together?

668
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,050
We weren't together. I went to see Liu Wei.

669
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,080
Liu Wei?

670
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,840
Didn't Liu Wei go to America?

671
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,080
Mom, please don't be angry.

672
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,530
Please don't be upset. Let me explain.

673
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,120
Liu Wei wanted to see me one last time before leaving.

674
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,840
But while I was with her,

675
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,240
Xinxin happened to see us.

676
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,480
She misunderstood the situation.

677
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,800
You idiot!

678
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,620
How could you go see her again?

679
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,280
Go! Find Xinxin and bring her back!

680
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,200
Don't come back if you can't find her!

681
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,920
Go now!

682
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,610
I'm going right now.

683
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,170
No, Brother Ming, something's happened.

684
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,720
Why did you just come to bail me out?

685
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
No, something happened.

686
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,800
What happened?

687
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,920
I took Wan Xinxin to Liu Wei's place

688
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,520
and caught Liu Wei with Qin Gang in the room.

689
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,280
Xinxin went crazy when she saw them

690
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,040
and then she ran away.

691
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,240
I couldn't catch up with her.

692
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,800
You're a grown man and you couldn't catch up with her?

693
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,280
No, I was arguing with Qin Gang

694
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,800
and when I turned around, she was gone.

695
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,440
Do you think she might do something stupid?

696
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:51,840
She...

697
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,570
What are you talking about?

698
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Of course she's devastated by this.

699
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,000
Did you take photos with your phone like I told you?

700
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,600
Take photos of what?

701
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,860
What do you mean what? Of those two women.

702
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,760
You gave me your phone.

703
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,120
I thought you wanted me to call Wan Xinxin.

704
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
No, I called her many times but she didn't answer.

705
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,680
I went straight to her room and dragged her out.

706
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,040
Okay, okay.

707
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,280
Let's split up and search for her.

708
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,720
Check

709
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,080
any mutual friends, colleagues,

710
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,940
and places she might have gone to.

711
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,000
Phone.

712
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,880
My phone.

713
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,800
Yours, yours.

714
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,040
But what am I supposed to use then?

715
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,760
Buy one.

716
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,440
Come on, I just paid your fine

717
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,920
and I'm broke now.

718
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,280
Hello, I'm looking for Mr. Qin.

719
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,120
Okay.

720
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,720
Madam, someone is here to see you.

721
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,360
Thank you.

722
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,970
Sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Qin.

723
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,520
Has Xinxin come back?

724
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,680
Mrs. Qin, I need to talk to Qin Gang outside.

725
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,800
Come out for a moment.

726
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,040
You really can just sit at home like this.

727
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,240
Have you looked for her?

728
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
Of course I have.

729
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,500
Where did you look?

730
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,960
Why are you interrogating me like this?

731
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,680
Is it appropriate for you to come to our home and cause trouble now?

732
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,400
Fine. This is between us.

733
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,890
Let's talk about Wan Xinxin first.

734
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,700
Who have you asked?

735
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,400
Everyone you know, everyone I know.

736
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,280
I've asked everyone we both know.

737
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,900
No one can find her.

738
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,450
So you just gave up when you couldn't find her?

739
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,240
Fine. What time did she leave?

740
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,700
Around midnight, I guess.

741
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:53,760
Okay.

742
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,720
Listen carefully. Now it's between us.

743
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,640
Whether I find Wan Xinxin or not,

744
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,840
whenever I find her,

745
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,530
I will come back for you.

746
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,080
Sis.

747
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,120
Xuke.

748
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,050
Where's Xinxin?

749
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,080
She didn't come here.

750
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,120
She didn't come to see you?

751
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,880
No.

752
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,640
What's wrong? What happened?

753
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,880
She didn't come home last night.

754
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
I've been looking for her until now.

755
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,840
What should we do? Where could she have gone?

756
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,280
Don't panic.

757
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
Come with me, let's search together.

758
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:31,720
Okay.

759
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,400
Is that alright?

760
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,600
Then I'll change my shoes.

761
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,840
Alright, hurry up.

762
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Wan Xinxin!

763
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,520
Xinxin!

764
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,360
Wan Xinxin!

765
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,280
Xinxin!

766
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,480
Xinxin!

767
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,760
Can I help you?

768
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,370
I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.

769
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,020
But it's not specific enough.

770
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,960
Remember, don't be conceptual.

771
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:12,400
Be specific.

772
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Okay, no problem.

773
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,000
Hey, Mr. Shi.

774
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,000
What?

775
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,290
You didn't answer my calls.

776
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,800
Have you seen Wan Xinxin?

777
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Wan Xinxin?

778
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,460
What is she doing here?

779
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,560
Okay, I got it.

780
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li!

781
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,440
Jiang Qiaohua!
