1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,720
I may have found Wan Xinxin.

3
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
What? Wan Xinxin has been found?

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
Send me the address right away.

5
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,259
Okay, I'll send it to you soon.

6
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,080
Slow down.

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,560
Okay.

8
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,400
Watch your step.

9
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,160
It's fine.

10
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,640
Where have you been?

11
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,160
You weren't home when I got back.

12
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,320
You scared me to death.

13
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,560
You're still alive.

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
Since your friend is here,

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,120
go home and get some rest. Come on.

16
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,600
These are all mine. Take them quickly.

17
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,860
Spending money again.

18
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,610
Shut up. Just take them inside.

19
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,720
Um.

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,040
Miss Wan, about your foot,

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,700
don't use hot water or hot compress for 24 hours.

22
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,500
After that, just spray some Yunnan Baiyao on it.

23
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,800
Mister.

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,840
Thank you.

25
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,920
Here.

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,520
Is the child asleep?

27
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,720
Yes, already asleep.

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,690
What happened to your foot?

29
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,360
Never mind my foot. Just push these in quickly.

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,960
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,880
Go to bed now.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,330
Why are you still awake?

33
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,220
Hug me. You need to comfort me.

34
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,200
Come here.

35
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,160
Let me ask you something.

36
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,120
What is it?

37
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,640
What's going on with this?

38
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,640
Well, it was too long on me so I cut it.

39
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,480
Wait a second.

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,920
This is still mine, isn't it?

41
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,840
Yes, it's yours.

42
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,800
No, I mean why are you wearing my clothes?

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
Well, I didn't have anything else to wear.

44
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,760
No, you just bought new clothes.

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,200
I didn't buy anything for myself, only for him.

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,920
What? You have the nerve to blame me?

47
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,000
It's because you didn't answer your phone.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,320
You locked me out because you wouldn't answer.

49
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,440
I was outside in those clothes.

50
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,520
Had to crash at someone else's place for the night.

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,960
And you have the nerve to blame me.

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Look, no matter how close we are,

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,520
we can't share everything, right?

54
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Who's sharing pants?

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,700
Aren't you wearing my underwear?

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,880
As if! You even own underwear?

57
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
I heard you've been

58
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,410
giving that guy across the street a hard time.

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,640
By the way, remember tomorrow

60
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,000
to pay him back for the coffee machine.

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,410
This job was for nothing again.

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Why am I so miserable?

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,360
The wife isn't mine but I have to support her.

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,159
The son isn't mine but I have to raise him.

65
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,159
I could be on 'Touching China' for this.

66
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,560
That's what you get for being my guy bestie.

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,280
Besides, when my brother has money

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,080
he'll pay you back

69
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,200
double.

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,450
I'll be waiting.

71
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,120
Let me ask you something.

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,240
Did Qin Gang really

73
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,040
hit on other women right in front of you?

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,770
Don't mention that beast to me.

75
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,530
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,200
I'm here to take Xiaobao.

77
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,400
Xu Ke, hurry!

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,920
You beast! How dare you come to my house!

79
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,760
Xu Ke, go for it!

80
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,960
Bite him! Come on!

81
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,360
Xu Ke, keep going!

82
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
Bite him!

83
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,340
Xu Ke, you can do it!

84
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,240
Bite him!

85
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,720
Xu Ke, don't give up!

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,320
Brother, you came just in time!

87
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,120
Hold him.

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,000
Come on!

89
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,760
Hit him!

90
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Well, Wan Xinxin.

91
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,240
You've got quite a few boyfriends.

92
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,500
So what? Not as many as your girlfriends.

93
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,240
Listen, stop this nonsense.

94
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,400
What if you disturb the neighbors?

95
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,480
What if the child gets hurt?

96
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,240
Everyone stay still.

97
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,160
This child is mine. He calls me dad.

98
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,400
Nonsense. He's not yours.

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,330
Then whose is he?

100
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,440
He's his father.

101
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,400
Right, he's my dad.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,160
No, I mean him.

103
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,400
He calls me dad.

104
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,780
Unbelievable, right?

105
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,840
You think any woman who marries you

106
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,170
would have a baby after just three months?

107
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,280
Then why did you marry me?

108
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,600
Why?

109
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
For that little money in your vault.

110
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,780
What did you think?

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,440
Can you compete with him in looks or physique?

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,330
No need to look. I can't.

113
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,480
You pay when we eat.

114
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,280
And get a free cuckold's hat.

115
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,120
Stop it.

116
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,440
Fine, Wan Xinxin.

117
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
You really are the type of woman Liu Wei described.

118
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,840
A scheming woman.

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,320
What? Can't accept it?

120
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
If you can't accept it, let's divorce.

121
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,840
Fine.

122
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,120
Let go of me.

123
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Brother.

124
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,450
Let go. I promise I won't fight.

125
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
Alright, Wan Xinxin.

126
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,330
See you at the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,200
Go to hell!

128
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Behave yourself.

129
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,800
Brother.

130
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,520
Brother, let him go.

131
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,880
Let him go.

132
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,560
Are you going to move?

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,480
No, I won't.

134
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,280
Let him go.

135
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,370
Brother.

136
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Thank you.

137
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,880
Well, I'll definitely treat you to a meal.

138
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,800
I'll treat you to dinner.

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,880
Another day.

140
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,480
Our family of three will treat you to dinner.

141
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,240
Thank you.

142
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,020
No, Miss Wan, what is all this?

143
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,280
You young people are so chaotic these days.

144
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,520
Your Majesty.

145
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Your Majesty.

146
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,040
Your Majesty, it's done.

147
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,450
It's all done, baby.

148
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,960
Congratulations.

149
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,660
Why are you glaring at me? I'm not the one divorcing you.

150
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,800
What are you doing? Don't leave.

151
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,930
We agreed last night to stand up to him.

152
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,800
I can't keep pretending anymore.

153
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,520
You can't hang your head now.

154
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,120
Your crown will fall if you do. Don't let tears flow.

155
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,000
The bad guys will laugh.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,130
You must look happy. Happier than him.

157
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,160
Look around at others.

158
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,760
See how they look when they step in dog poop too.

159
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,360
Watch.

160
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,520
Stop.

161
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,000
What's wrong?

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
It's broken.

163
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,160
It's flat.

164
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,860
I haven't thanked you yet.

165
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,420
Qin Gang, thank you

166
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,040
for raising my son all this time.

167
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,160
It wasn't easy. You've worked hard.

168
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,020
Why don't we have a meal together?

169
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,480
Don't be angry.

170
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,720
Don't be so petty.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
You spent over a hundred thousand on that postpartum center,

172
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,520
didn't you?

173
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,800
You might as well get something back from me, right?

174
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,040
You can choose from so many restaurants.

175
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,880
Honey.

176
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,480
Car.

177
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,960
You're being too cruel.

178
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Look at Mr. Qin.

179
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,800
His face is turning green. How can he eat anything?

180
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,080
This is so inappropriate.

181
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,440
How is it inappropriate? I think it's fine.

182
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
When dealing with beasts...

183
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,920
I mean, people like Qin Gang.

184
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,960
This is exactly how we should treat them, right?

185
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
This works.

186
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,490
How about it?

187
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,360
Why treat him to any meal?

188
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,800
We should spend the money on ourselves.

189
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,480
Lobster, abalone, shark fin - whatever we want.

190
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Or save it for my darling.

191
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,360
But definitely not for him.

192
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
You're absolutely right.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,960
Car...

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,600
Gifts...

195
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,040
Car.

196
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,320
Mr. Qin.

197
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,600
Mr. Qin.

198
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,380
Here's a breakup gift for you.

199
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,800
A car.

200
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,500
Here's the receipt. If the size is too small, you can exchange it for a bigger one.

201
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,200
Don't be angry.

202
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,970
Darling,

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,480
why don't you go home and cook for me?

204
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,640
I love your sweet and sour ribs the most.

205
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,400
Of course.

206
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,560
Steamed mandarin fish and braised mantis shrimp too.

207
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,960
You know, men who can cook these days

208
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,040
are really hard to find.

209
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,360
Exactly.

210
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
It's so hard to find.

211
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,520
Rich people never cook.

212
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,400
What do you think?

213
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,320
How can you be so virtuous?

214
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,810
What's wrong with that?

215
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,800
Why are you here?

216
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,640
Who is this?

217
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,840
Who else could it be?

218
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,240
I was worried you might be upset after your divorce.

219
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,840
So I came to keep you company.

220
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,130
I'll come find you after I change the tire.

221
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,410
Next time just give me a call for things like this.

222
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,440
We haven't had

223
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,840
a meal together for days.

224
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,800
I've already reserved a table at China Grand Restaurant.

225
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,330
Let's go.

226
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,880
Let's go.

227
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,920
Qin Gang!

228
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,370
Stop right there, Qin Gang!

229
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm sorry. I'm a new driver.

230
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,640
New driver? If you can't drive,

231
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,040
then why are you driving?

232
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,040
Why are you even behind the wheel if you can't drive?!

233
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,680
Do you even know the difference between gas and brake?

234
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,340
You could've killed someone!

235
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,420
Right, she could've been killed.

236
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,370
It's completely over between Qin Gang and me.

237
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,200
Hello?

238
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,520
Gangzi.

239
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,120
Don't call me anymore.

240
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,220
Well...

241
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,400
Eating.

242
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,520
Just like in the movies.

243
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,320
When a woman faces heartbreak,

244
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,920
she immediately turns into a foodie.

245
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,450
Why shouldn't I eat? I have every right to eat.

246
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,760
Besides, after this meal,

247
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,000
who knows where my next one will come from?

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,130
You know you brought this on yourself.

249
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,800
Why did you leave with nothing?

250
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,120
The marriage law clearly states

251
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
you're entitled to half of the assets.

252
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,560
Nobody in the country would object,

253
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,720
so why didn't you take it?

254
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
Did I marry him for money in the first place?

255
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,240
Fine, you innocent, lovesick girl.

256
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,880
Oh my, I'm touched.

257
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
Alright, from now on,

258
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,440
I'll take care of you.

259
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,740
You'll take care of me?

260
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,080
And there's still your brother.

261
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,240
You've had enough fun playing dad.

262
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,960
So now you look down on me?

263
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,520
But,

264
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,800
I've really caused you a lot of trouble lately.

265
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Right now,

266
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,240
I can't make it up to you.

267
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,730
When things get better,

268
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,680
I'll definitely make it up to you.

269
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,610
Enough, enough.

270
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,640
Don't talk like that. I'm not used to it.

271
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,080
Let me tell you, Wan Xinxin,

272
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,000
I was born to be your burden.

273
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,000
I swear,

274
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,880
for all the ways they've bullied you today,

275
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,140
I'll pay them back tenfold in the future.

276
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,600
I'm now,

277
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,040
I'm a bit scared now.

278
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,800
Since I first met Qin Gang,

279
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
I've always considered him

280
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,500
the most important person in my life.

281
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,080
But now,

282
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,160
it's gone. Everything's gone.

283
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
Alright, alright.

284
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,000
Just stop.

285
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,240
Brother,

286
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,440
it's good that you're divorced now.

287
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,640
You need to step back into the sunshine,

288
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,480
you must live beautifully

289
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,740
and show that bastard.

290
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,320
That's right.

291
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,560
Why shouldn't I bloom? Why shouldn't I shine?

292
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,400
Why should I stay in the darkness?

293
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Exactly!

294
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,720
What are you doing?

295
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,400
Are you going crazy?

296
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,560
This is what that bastard gave me.

297
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,200
Starting today, I need to be independent.

298
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,720
Starting tomorrow, I'll go to work.

299
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,120
I don't believe it.

300
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,920
I can support myself and my baby.

301
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,240
Tell me,

302
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,480
should we go with a light-colored bedsheet

303
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,920
or a patterned one?

304
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,120
Why aren't you saying anything?

305
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,440
You got divorced and now you miss her?

306
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,040
No.

307
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,420
Why aren't you answering your phone?

308
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
I don't know how to tell my mother.

309
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,400
What's so hard about telling her?

310
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,530
It's not your fault.

311
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,960
A grown man

312
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,220
who lived with his wife for so long

313
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,200
only to just find out

314
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,660
that his son isn't his biological child.

315
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,010
You still think of her as your wife?

316
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,600
My mom still thinks

317
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,460
she's really getting a grandson.

318
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,920
Don't worry.

319
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,560
I'll have a child for you.

320
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,080
Slow down.

321
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,360
Xinxin, you're really living here.

322
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm living at his place now.

323
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,320
Sis,

324
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,960
stay out of our family business.

325
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,960
Xinxin, come with me.

326
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,400
Where are we going?

327
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,720
Home, of course. What's wrong with you?

328
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,800
I don't have a home now.

329
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,680
You need to come back.

330
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,120
How long are you going to keep this up?

331
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,200
If you continue making trouble like this,

332
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,960
Qin Gang will definitely divorce you.

333
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,360
We're already divorced.

334
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,400
What?

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,960
Sis, have some water.

336
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,120
Don't worry. This matter actually...

337
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,770
Please leave first.

338
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,240
I need to talk.

339
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,200
Okay. I'll go downstairs.

340
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,840
Xinxin.

341
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,500
I think you've lost your mind.

342
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,800
You think eligible bachelors are everywhere?

343
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,160
You think just because you're Wan Xinxin,

344
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,840
you can grab anyone and get married?

345
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,640
You can't just throw one away and get another.

346
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,700
A woman can't afford to get divorced.

347
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,040
A man after divorce, as long as he has money,

348
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,079
can upgrade his life in no time.

349
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,359
A divorced woman is just considered damaged goods.

350
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,480
I simply cannot tolerate a cheating man.

351
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,640
I just had a baby,

352
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,880
and he's already seeing another woman behind my back.

353
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,800
Do you think I can still live with him?

354
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,319
Is what you're saying true?

355
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,579
Why would I divorce him if it wasn't true?

356
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,359
That bastard! That heartless man!

357
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,180
I'm going to confront him.

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,960
Forget it.

359
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,880
We're already divorced. What's the point of confronting him?

360
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,340
Well...

361
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,840
So, did you get the house?

362
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
And how much child support

363
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,660
did you negotiate?

364
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,120
I didn't ask for anything.

365
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,440
I left with nothing.

366
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,880
You're insane!

367
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,320
Have you completely lost your mind?

368
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,040
You had a child with him,

369
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,720
he wronged you,

370
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,120
and you left with nothing?

371
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,050
How will you and the child survive?

372
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,520
If I could give birth to him, I can raise him.

373
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:58,960
What's wrong with that?

374
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,520
The child is mine alone now.

375
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,480
Qin Gang has absolutely nothing to do with him.

376
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
I'm telling you.

377
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,920
You didn't even consult me about such a big decision!

378
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,360
Alright, don't get upset.

379
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,680
Look, it's my business. I don't need your help.

380
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,800
I can make my own decisions.

381
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,520
Fine, you're so capable.

382
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,120
My ideas are old-fashioned. You think you can manage with a child.

383
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,480
So now you think you're independent,

384
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,200
you don't need me anymore, is that it?

385
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
Fine. I'm telling you right now,

386
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,800
one day you'll regret this.

387
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,240
Stay back! Stay back!

388
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,440
Come any closer and I'll hit you!

389
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,570
I swear I'll hit you!

390
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,360
Calm down.

391
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
I... I...

392
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,480
Stay away! Stay away!

393
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,890
What are you doing here?

394
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,760
I'm here to settle scores with you!

395
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,820
Get her out of here!

396
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Stop right there!

397
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,480
If you come any closer,

398
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
I'll jump off the building.

399
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,010
Stop this nonsense.

400
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,120
That's enough. Please leave first.

401
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,800
Let's go.

402
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,480
Say what you need to say quickly.

403
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,610
What is there to say?

404
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,680
You're just a shameless bastard.

405
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,600
I'm letting you speak. Can't you be more polite?

406
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,200
How can I be polite to a beast like you?

407
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,520
Let me ask you.

408
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,320
Why did you abandon our Xinxin?

409
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,650
Why did you divorce her?

410
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,560
You should ask Wan Xinxin about this.

411
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,040
Whether she insulted me

412
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,680
or I mistreated her.

413
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,640
You must know what she did.

414
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,020
She brought this divorce on herself.

415
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,930
I can't believe you'd say that.

416
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,640
And you call yourself a man.

417
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,120
Your thick skin,

418
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,320
why hasn't the government studied it

419
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,970
to make bulletproof vests?

420
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,360
This is between the two of us.

421
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,680
Please stay out of it.

422
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,320
If you keep causing trouble like this,

423
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,440
I'll call the police.

424
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,560
Let me tell you, I can see you've made up your mind.

425
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,720
Fine. Then I'll make things clear.

426
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Give me the money.

427
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,220
What money?

428
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Compensation for wasted youth, child support,

429
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,570
emotional damages. Pay it all.

430
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
So that's what this is really about.

431
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,380
But unfortunately, you're too late.

432
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,820
We've already got our divorce certificate.

433
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,450
Qin Gang, you're really cruel.

434
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,560
It's one thing to abandon your wife,

435
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,640
but you're even rejecting your child.

436
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,680
How are they supposed to survive?

437
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,200
That child isn't mine.

438
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,080
What did you say? Say that again.

439
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,640
That child isn't mine.

440
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,480
Wan Xinxin admitted it herself.

441
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,280
The child is hers with that bastard Xu Ke.

442
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,680
What did you say?

443
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,250
You must come and babysit for me tomorrow.

444
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,240
Sis.

445
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,520
Fine, I'll just tell you the truth.

446
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,260
What's wrong? That child is mine and Xu Ke's.

447
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,640
I've told you so many times.

448
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,920
Those super high heels.

449
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,730
You're walking like on stilts.

450
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,240
You know very well about that female devil.

451
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,080
Xu Ke.

452
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,160
After I gave birth,

453
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,560
have I gotten fatter?

454
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,360
Just a tiny bit.

455
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,080
I want to die.

456
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,160
I was asleep. Just fell asleep.

457
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

458
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,960
Stop it. Stop it.

459
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,240
I really admire you.

460
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,260
You really dare to go back to work.

461
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
What else can I do?

462
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,600
We're both broke.

463
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,060
Now we have him to support.

464
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,160
What should I do if I don't go back to work?

465
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,640
Right, honey?

466
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,680
What time is it now? Is your sister coming or not?

467
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,800
I've booked the studio. It's almost time.

468
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,600
She should be here soon.

469
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,960
She's here.

470
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,280
Sis, you finally made it.

471
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,220
The baby just fell asleep.

472
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,010
We slept in separate rooms last night.

473
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,240
The child.

474
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,080
Just fell asleep.

475
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,000
Well, I need to get to work now.

476
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,440
Xuke, wait!

477
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Give me a ride.

478
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll just

479
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
take a taxi later.

480
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,280
No, why would I take a taxi?

481
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,680
Xinxin, come back here!

482
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,320
What?

483
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,720
I'm asking what's going on between you two.

484
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,160
Oh, sis, I really don't have time.

485
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,280
I need to get to work.

486
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,440
Tell me clearly

487
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,080
whose child is this?

488
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
No matter whose child it is,

489
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,440
you still need to help me watch over them.

490
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,080
I'll tell you when I get back from work.

491
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,880
I'll tell you when I'm back. Bye!

492
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,840
Going to work, mister?

493
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,920
About the coffee cup I broke at your place,

494
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
and the coffee machine,

495
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,480
I'll definitely pay you back for them.

496
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,280
Don't worry about it.

497
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,360
Why not?

498
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,800
I found a job.

499
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,280
Today is my first day at work.

500
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,480
I'll pay you back when I get my paycheck at the end of the month.

501
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,960
Weren't you going to testify?

502
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,490
Take me with you when you do.

503
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,210
No need. I can handle it myself.

504
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,960
Hey.

505
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,320
What's wrong? Are you upset?

506
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,680
Cheer up.

507
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,000
Be more positive.

508
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,400
Smile for me.

509
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,890
Then I'll smile for you.

510
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,380
The elevator's here. Let's go to work together.

511
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,840
You go ahead. I'll wait for the next one.

512
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,840
Creepy guy.

513
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,600
Hello everyone.

514
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,600
I'm back again.

515
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
Xinxin, you're back.

516
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,480
Xinxin.

517
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,760
Why did you come back?

518
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,760
I missed you all, of course.

519
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,120
Didn't you escape this misery to become a boss's wife?

520
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,080
That's right.

521
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,640
You, the wife of Fu Auto's boss, coming back to see us.

522
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,120
Are you here to hand out celebration eggs?

523
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,160
Come on, tell us.

524
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,720
Well, I was so bored at home.

525
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,220
Nothing to do, being taken care of every day.

526
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,000
I thought I couldn't

527
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,960
just let myself go like that, right?

528
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,280
So I had to come back.

529
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,540
But most importantly,

530
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,320
I missed you all.

531
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,080
Thank you. We missed you too.

532
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,560
Hey, why are you all acting like this today?

533
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
Shi Lu has resigned.

534
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,960
If that's true, I'd be thrilled.

535
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,450
You don't know. The devil boss's flight was delayed yesterday.

536
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,610
She only got back after 6 this morning.

537
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,360
If she can still come to work,

538
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,020
that would be miraculous.

539
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,280
I come back to such good news.

540
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,240
Happy?

541
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,440
Let me take off my heels quickly.

542
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,480
I'm exhausted.

543
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,760
She's coming.

544
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,340
She's here.

545
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,160
Director Shi.

546
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,200
Yesterday's meeting minutes

547
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,800
are here.

548
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,480
For the hotel venue setup,

549
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
find someone to check it in advance.

550
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,560
Zhang Hao

551
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,240
Here.

552
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,160
Go check on the food samples.

553
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,520
Make sure the quality is guaranteed.

554
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,800
There can't be any mistakes.

555
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,040
Okay, don't worry, Manager Shi.

556
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,240
Before 4 p.m.,

557
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,880
I want to see progress reports from all departments.

558
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,520
Okay.

559
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,680
Did you schedule a meeting with the new editor from Frontier?

560
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,320
That woman is really arrogant.

561
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,380
She doesn't even look at us properly.

562
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,040
Why shouldn't she be confident?

563
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,840
Frontier Magazine is

564
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,520
the most high-end and influential

565
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,400
luxury goods promotion platform in the market.

566
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,280
Director Wu specifically wants to be featured in their publication.

567
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,800
Okay, I'll keep trying to schedule it.

568
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,460
Go quickly.

569
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,120
Wan Xinxin.

570
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,400
There's quite a resemblance.

571
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Who do you think the baby looks like?

572
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,760
The nose looks like Xinxin's.

573
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,360
But the eyes are like Qin Gang's.

574
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,360
The ears are a bit big.

575
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Who do you think they take after?

576
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,340
Anyway, the baby doesn't look like that brat at all.

577
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,760
You're upset now.

578
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,730
Are you listening to me?

579
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,530
You're pouting now?

580
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,560
I'm not pouting.

581
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,600
Fine, you're a rich kid.

582
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,040
He even demanded a paternity test.

583
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,920
Now he's shot himself in the foot.

584
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,520
After hearing the news,

585
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,000
Zhang Tao caught her immediately.

586
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,210
You don't seem to need to come to work anymore.

587
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,880
I was on maternity leave before,

588
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,600
but I'm still an employee of Ledi.

589
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
I'll do anything you ask.

590
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,720
You just had a baby and you're already back at work.

591
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,000
Does Mr. Qin have no objection?

592
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,260
Don't worry about him.

593
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,760
I mean, he doesn't interfere with my affairs.

594
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,120
I think I should learn from you.

595
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,800
As you said, a woman's youth is already so brief.

596
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,400
I don't want to waste this fleeting youth

597
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,360
on things like raising children

598
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,840
or dealing with trivial matters.

599
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,000
I believe women should rely on themselves,

600
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,680
right?

601
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Hello, Lady Company.

602
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,320
Great! I was just looking for you.

603
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
Our company would like to establish

604
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,330
a partnership with your media company. Would that be possible?

605
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,120
I understand.

606
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,520
Do you really want to come back to work?

607
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,320
Yes, I do.

608
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,880
Perfect. Our company

609
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,800
needs to establish a partnership with Frontier,

610
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,720
and they specifically requested you for the negotiations.

611
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,480
Me?

612
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
They said they've seen your previous proposals

613
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,780
and they admire your work.

614
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,240
I, Wan Xinxin, won't say much else,

615
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,480
but I do have some influence in the industry.

616
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,440
The important thing is that you need to secure a page from Frontier.

617
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,760
Don't worry, Director Shi.

618
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,960
With my quick wit,

619
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,000
graceful demeanor,

620
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,760
and silver tongue,

621
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,730
I'll definitely secure it.

622
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,220
Who are you?

623
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,480
Let go! Let go!

624
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,280
Are you crazy?

625
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,480
You're the crazy one.

626
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,280
You don't even recognize your own child.

627
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,800
Anyway, I have evidence now.

628
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,640
I'll prove this child is yours.

629
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,890
Come on, get her out of here.

630
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,140
Don't touch me.

631
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,760
I'm holding a baby.

632
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,600
If the baby gets hurt, you'll be responsible.

633
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,730
I'll leave on my own.

634
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,290
Get out of my way.

635
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,800
Mr. Qin, are you alright?

636
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,610
Crazy woman.

637
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,440
Supervision hotline: 5975060

638
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,170
Supervision hotline: 5975060

639
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,920
Wan Xinxin, you must work hard and keep going.

640
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,280
Hello, who's this?

641
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,400
How rude of you.

642
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,880
You should at least say hello.

643
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Wait, who are you?

644
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,320
You have no professionalism at all.

645
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,480
I'm the one who called you for business.

646
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,530
Oh, Manager Liu!

647
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,820
I'm so sorry, Manager Liu.

648
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,840
There are so many scam calls these days.

649
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,570
I didn't recognize the number.

650
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,200
I'm already downstairs.

651
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,170
Are you here yet?

652
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,640
Are you suggesting

653
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,050
that I'm late and kept you waiting?

654
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,520
No, no, no. That's not what I meant at all.

655
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,490
I can wait for you as long as needed.

656
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,560
Please get me a coffee.

657
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Sure, no problem.

658
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,040
There's a café on the first floor. Would you like a mocha or latte?

659
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,240
Such poor taste.

660
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,880
Is that even real coffee?

661
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,480
There's a Moore Coffee House to the east.

662
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
I only drink their musk coffee.

663
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,960
That coffee place? It's

664
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,360
two blocks away.

665
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,280
What? You think that's too far and too much trouble?

666
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,320
No, no, Manager Liu. That's not what I meant at all.

667
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,280
I'm just worried you'll have to wait for me to come back.

668
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,560
Remember, I like my coffee hot.

669
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,980
Okay, no problem. I'll go right away.

670
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,120
Hello?

671
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,120
Hello, Mr. Liu. I'm already downstairs.

672
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,050
Are you here yet?

673
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
What? What necklace?

674
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,040
Turn around.

675
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,800
That sign?

676
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,640
I don't see it.

677
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,980
Look over there in those flowers.

678
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
In the flowerpot.

679
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,920
Yes, right there.

680
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,890
Come up. It's fine if you can't find it.

681
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,240
Dr. Hua!

682
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,480
Dr. Hua!

683
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,320
Old sir,

684
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,280
Dr. Hua.

685
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,120
Please take a look at my precious pet.

686
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,250
I'll let you work. I'll go ahead first.

687
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,200
What's wrong?

688
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,930
It hasn't eaten or drunk anything for three days.

689
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,520
Let me take a look.

690
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,760
Mr. Liu, I'm sorry.

691
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,610
I spilled your coffee because I was in a hurry.

692
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,520
Wan Xinxin, so you can apologize to me too.

693
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,440
Why is it you?

694
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,120
You may not know much about me,

695
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,560
but Qin Gang told me everything about you.

696
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,280
Having fun, aren't you?

697
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,680
You didn't call me here today for business, did you?

698
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
It is business.

699
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,460
Would you have come obediently if it wasn't?

700
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,960
I bought the coffee and I'm here.

701
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,760
What else do you want from me?

702
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
You're angry.

703
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,600
You feel humiliated.

704
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,400
That's just how society works.

705
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,320
If you have desires, you must pay the price,

706
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,980
whether you like it or not.

707
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,200
You're right.

708
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,130
My company sent me here to ask for your help today,

709
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,120
so I'll tolerate your games.

710
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,360
Let's talk about personal matters instead of business.

711
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,040
That's even less necessary.

712
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,160
This coffee does taste good,

713
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,240
but I don't want to stay here

714
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,960
and waste another second with you,

715
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,080
because seeing you makes me sick.

716
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,370
I just want to ask you one question.

717
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,980
Why did you lie to Qin Gang?

718
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,770
Where did you get this from?

719
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,440
Wan Xinxin, you're not naive enough to think

720
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,840
that I went to the hospital that day

721
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,970
just to explain things to you, are you?

722
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,560
What exactly are you trying to prove?

723
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,800
A young woman in her prime

724
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,320
would actually bear a child for

725
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,480
a man she's only known for a few months.

726
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,760
Of course,

727
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,090
a woman like you could never understand that.

728
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,040
Wan Xinxin, if you promise me

729
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,690
not to tell Qin Gang that this child is his,

730
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,780
I can sign a long-term contract with you right away.

731
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,300
Wan Xinxin,

732
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,480
as long as you agree

733
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,340
to leave this city with the child,

734
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,770
I can give you another million.

735
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,580
Ms. Liu,

736
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,400
someone as pathetic as you

737
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,480
is truly rare.

738
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,000
You treasure Qin Gang,

739
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,719
but I couldn't care less.

740
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,239
I won't participate in your

741
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,040
melodramatic schemes anymore.

742
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,000
I will continue on my path to happiness

743
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,080
and get further and further away.

744
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,239
I hope you sink deeper and deeper

745
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,920
in your soap opera drama.

746
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,760
Dr. Hua.

747
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,840
How is it?

748
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,280
I just did

749
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,800
a full-body X-ray.

750
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,640
There's a massive tumor

751
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,880
in its kidney area

752
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,490
and it has spread throughout the body.

753
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,090
The situation is critical.

754
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,360
Is there any hope?

755
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,840
Well, it's like this.

756
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,880
Even with surgery,

757
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,620
it might only live for two more weeks.

758
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,760
Dr. Hua,

759
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
please perform the surgery.

760
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Even if it can live just a bit longer.

761
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,240
Banban is already very old

762
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,440
and extremely weak.

763
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,040
This surgery requires general anesthesia

764
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,100
and cardiac protection injections.

765
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,420
It might not even survive the procedure.

766
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,800
I'm sorry.

767
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
After my spouse passed away,

768
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,960
it has been with me for 17 years.

769
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,720
Every birthday

770
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,760
it has been there with me.

771
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,880
My birthday is coming up soon.

772
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,520
I don't want

773
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,880
to spend it alone.

774
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,660
Hello, Mr. Shi.

775
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm sorry. I messed up.

776
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,160
I'd like to resign.

777
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,600
Hello.

778
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,000
I've had such a terrible day.

779
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,740
Can you buy me an ice cream?

780
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,930
Why are you here?

781
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,720
Didn't you say

782
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,280
I could come anytime when I'm feeling down?

783
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,840
I did say that, but as you can see,

784
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,680
I'm in the middle of surgery now,

785
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,800
so please leave.

786
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,170
Master Hua, what's wrong with you lately?

787
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,120
What did I do to you?

788
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,000
Why are you giving me the cold shoulder?

789
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm not. Can't you see?

790
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,240
I told you I'm performing surgery.

791
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,040
Please go now.

792
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,300
Fine, I won't bother you anymore.

793
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,480
Banban.

794
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,760
Banban, what's wrong?

795
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,600
Are you in pain?

796
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,720
Sir, I'm about to perform surgery on Banban.

797
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,940
You can wait in the lounge for a while.

798
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,360
Wait.

799
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,440
I've made up my mind.

800
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,280
I can't let him go through

801
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,170
another surgery because of me.

802
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,240
And suffer again.

803
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,240
We shouldn't be too selfish, you know.

804
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,360
Don't you think?

805
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,800
Banban.

806
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,520
You've been with me for over ten years.

807
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,400
Now it's my turn to be with you.

808
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,080
I want to help you.

809
00:39:59,080 --> 00:39:59,560
But I...

810
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,280
I don't know how to help properly.

811
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,840
If you want to sleep,

812
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,100
just take a nap.

813
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,140
I'll stay with you.

814
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,480
What's wrong?

815
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,400
It says its eyes can't see clearly anymore.

816
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,420
Wan Xinxin.

817
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,960
Wan Xinxin.

818
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,040
Banban.

819
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,000
Its name is Banban, right?

820
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,720
Banban.

821
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,800
Banban.

822
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,360
It says it can smell that I'm a stranger.

823
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,970
It's afraid I might hurt it.

824
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,400
You can understand what it's saying?

825
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,560
Yes. My father is a biology professor at university.

826
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,960
Every animal has its own language.

827
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,000
Young lady, could you please listen to what else

828
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,660
it's trying to say?

829
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,520
Banban, I won't hurt your dad.

830
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,440
Tell me what you want to say.

831
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,840
It says

832
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,530
it's just tired and wants to sleep for a while.

833
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,530
That's good.

834
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,360
That's good.

835
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,160
It says

836
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,880
thank you for bringing it into this family.

837
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,600
Walking with you and basking in the sun every day,

838
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,890
lying at your feet watching TV,

839
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,460
these were the happiest moments of its life.

840
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,160
What?

841
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,000
It also says

842
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,460
it might not be able to stay with you anymore.

843
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,050
You need to learn to take care of yourself.

844
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,920
When it's gone,

845
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,300
don't always stay home alone.

846
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,680
When you feel lonely,

847
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,200
call your children to keep you company.

848
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,440
What?

849
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,120
Do you know what expression it loves to see on your face?

850
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,560
What?

851
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,520
It's when you come home every day

852
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,400
and smile while calling its name.

853
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,560
Banban.

854
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,880
Thank you.

855
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,720
Banban.

856
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
Sir, please take it slow.

857
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,700
Young lady,

858
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,040
thank you.

859
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,800
Li.
