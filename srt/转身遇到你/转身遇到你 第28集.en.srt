1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,759
Do you know why you regret it?

3
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,960
Miss Wan Xinxin, you gave up

4
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,440
this precious opportunity to be alone with me.

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,200
Understand?

6
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,890
They've already moved out.

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
No, why did you make them move out?

8
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
I didn't make anyone move out.

9
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,360
They thought they were giving us space.

10
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
They're all kind people.

11
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,370
Don't think so badly of others.

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,039
Why should I go back?

13
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,840
Aren't I just your tenant?

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,380
What do you mean 'go back'?

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,080
Right?

16
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,040
Xinxin.

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,450
You're going to France?

18
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,040
Yes.

19
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,500
This is the opportunity Jiang Xiaoyu got for me.

20
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,280
But once I go, I'll be gone for a long time.

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,890
I might never come back.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,960
Maybe we won't see each other much longer.

23
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,930
Xinxin, can you promise me something?

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,079
No matter what decisions you make in the future,

25
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,160
anything, good or bad,

26
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,040
tell me first.

27
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,000
Why are you overreacting?

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,760
Because I'm afraid you'll leave without saying goodbye.

29
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,290
I'm afraid you'll suddenly

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
disappear from my sight.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,840
You're lying.

32
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Then why do I feel like you've been avoiding me lately?

33
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,880
Listen to me.

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,680
I really have no intention of remarrying. Really.

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,560
But I still feel

36
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,600
you have so many secrets

37
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,120
Why can't you tell me any of them?

38
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,180
Everyone has secrets.

39
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,220
You have them, I have them.

40
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,520
I'll find the right time and opportunity

41
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,460
to tell you everything, okay?

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
Do you love me?

43
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,079
I do.

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,640
Xiaoyu, I'm sorry.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I know you've secured

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,080
an incredible once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me.

47
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,400
But I've reconciled with my boyfriend.

48
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,440
So I won't be going to Paris.

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,280
I'm really sorry.

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,760
Thank you.

51
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,560
You're so unreliable.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,320
Fine.

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,760
I wish you happiness.

54
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Xinxin.

55
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,480
Can you promise me from now on

56
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,810
no matter what happens,

57
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,100
you won't leave without saying goodbye?

58
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,810
Didn't I already promise you that?

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,159
What?

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,400
What do you mean 'what'? No one's around to see me kiss you.

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,140
Come on, give me a kiss. Quick.

62
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,240
Kiss you?

63
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,040
Where?

64
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,560
Stop! Someone's coming!

65
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,560
Mind your public behavior, will you?

66
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,890
Scared now, aren't you?

67
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,240
Idiots! Morons!

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,040
The contracts were already negotiated.

69
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,240
All you had to do was stamp and sign them.

70
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,840
And you just watched as these orders

71
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,920
were snatched away from us.

72
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,840
What's wrong with you?

73
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,440
Did you take the wrong pills?

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,600
We couldn't do anything about their decision.

75
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,760
No way? No way?

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,420
All you had to do was wine and dine these clients,

77
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,280
negotiate their commission in advance,

78
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,240
and offer them some benefits. Wouldn't that work?

79
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
Even Jiang Kaiyang knows how to handle this,

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
why don't you?

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,840
Then I'll try to talk to them again.

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,720
Talk my ass!

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,370
The contracts are already signed.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,500
Get out! Pack your things and get out!

85
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
Why are you so angry?

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,930
These college graduates are useless.

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,260
Not even as good as Jiang Kaiyang.

88
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,960
Then why don't you invite Jiang Kaiyang back?

89
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,200
After all, he's different.

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,880
Wan Xinxin and the others don't have what it takes.

91
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,320
Enough. Don't talk about this now.

92
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,840
How about this?

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,720
Let me see the company files.

94
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,680
I'll familiarize myself with the business.

95
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,080
Then I can recommend someone for you to try.

96
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,620
Ask my secretary for them.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,400
Okay.

98
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,240
What's up?

99
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,360
Being proactive, I like it.

100
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,090
Can I ask you for a favor?

101
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,680
So there's a catch. Thumbs down.

102
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,040
No, come on. Considering the thumbs up I just got,

103
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,840
please ignore that thumbs down.

104
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Here's the thing. Huarui needs to change schools,

105
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,000
and I need to prepare some new documents.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,640
Xiaqing and I need to go mail them,

107
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,500
so could you watch her for a while?

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,960
Me? Watch her?

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,800
But that little schemer is always clinging to you.

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,840
Would she even want to stay with me?

111
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,360
I just had a fight with her mother.

112
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,080
She's in her room video chatting with classmates.

113
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,320
Just keep an eye on her for a bit.

114
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,159
I'll be back in two hours, tops.

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,960
Don't worry. I can handle it.

116
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,440
I trust you completely.

117
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,159
You take such good care of Bao.

118
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,840
Thank you.

119
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,720
Stop with the sweet talk.

120
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,040
Hey.

121
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,960
Some people's parents aren't home,

122
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,320
left all alone at home.

123
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,840
Some people even got ditched

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
by their boyfriends.

125
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,880
Want some?

126
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,080
Bribing me won't work.

127
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,880
Good things should be shared.

128
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,930
While they're away.

129
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
No matter how nice you are to me,

130
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,170
I still won't approve of you being with my dad.

131
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,520
Well, your opinion doesn't count.

132
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,380
Only your dad's opinion matters.

133
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,160
Childish.

134
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,600
Think about it. My dad and I

135
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,520
are blood-related, his real daughter.

136
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,480
You? You're just a girlfriend at best,

137
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,000
and a second-hand one at that.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
If we both fell into water at the same time,

139
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,480
who do you think he'd save first?

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
I can swim.

141
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,540
Don't worry, I won't need your dad to save me.

142
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,460
I don't want it.

143
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,210
Really, I don't.

144
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Then I'll eat it.

145
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,520
I love ice cream.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,880
Vanilla flavor is so delicious.

147
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,720
Childish.

148
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,480
So you're saying you're mature?

149
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,600
Yes, at least more mature than the people around me.

150
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,480
Come on, eat it.

151
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,970
Quick, before your mom comes back.

152
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,480
Let me open it for you.

153
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,440
Delicious, isn't it?

154
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,480
So how are you mature?

155
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,200
My mom won't buy me things I like.

156
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,840
Tell me about it. What things?

157
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,600
The other day, my mom and I

158
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,380
passed by a clothing store called Smiling Baby.

159
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,760
It's a clothing store

160
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,840
right at the corner by the café.

161
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,280
But

162
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,920
mom said the clothes in there were too mature for me.

163
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,600
But I really want them.

164
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,040
I've been sneaking over there to look at them these days,

165
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,900
but it's useless. My mom still won't buy them for me.

166
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,520
So do you want them?

167
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,160
Stop.

168
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,560
You don't need to bribe me. I already told you.

169
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,800
After my parents get back together,

170
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,970
I'll have my dad buy them for me.

171
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
What if your dad marries me instead?

172
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,490
Impossible.

173
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,200
I won't allow him to marry you.

174
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,680
You won't allow it? You're not your dad.

175
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,280
You don't get to decide that.

176
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
If your dad is dead set

177
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,120
on marrying me, I can't help it.

178
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,920
When we have our wedding,

179
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,680
I'll definitely invite you to be there.

180
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
Don't feel pressured.

181
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,100
You don't have to call me stepmom or anything like that.

182
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,850
You can just call me sister,

183
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,600
or think of me as your friend.

184
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,720
Stop daydreaming.

185
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Listen, the future is still uncertain.

186
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Didn't you say I was childish?

187
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,400
So just let me dream a little.

188
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,720
I hate you.

189
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,400
Hey, Money God.

190
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,970
Everything's ready, don't worry.

191
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
I'll bring it to you tonight.

192
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,640
If I'm not reliable, who is?

193
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,880
Just wait and see.

194
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

195
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,850
Tastes good, right?

196
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,850
Have some more quickly.

197
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,690
You keep eating. I'll go check on the baby.

198
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,120
Dressed so neatly. Found a new job?

199
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,560
I, Jiang Kaiyang, would never

200
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,620
hang myself on Qin Gang's tree alone.

201
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
Right? Well,

202
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,960
I can easily find a new job.

203
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,120
I just haven't decided yet.

204
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,320
But why do you seem

205
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,000
not very happy?

206
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,400
Director Liu, if you have something to say today, just say it.

207
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,160
It's okay.

208
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,400
I've been checking accounts for Qin Gang recently.

209
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,960
But as I looked through them, I got confused.

210
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,920
Why do all the maintenance records

211
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,580
only show parts replacement?

212
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,760
This is normal. The part is broken.

213
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,720
Of course it needs to be replaced.

214
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,800
I don't really understand your line of work,

215
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,080
so I specifically consulted a mechanic

216
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,800
about this.

217
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,080
Look here.

218
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
The fender has a slight deformation

219
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,210
that just needs a minor repair.

220
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,120
But you told your mechanics to tell customers

221
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,180
it affects safety and requires complete replacement.

222
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,960
There are quite a few similar cases like this.

223
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,890
Look, I've had them all listed out.

224
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,440
What do you think would happen

225
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,120
if I handed over this information

226
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,040
to others?

227
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,080
Director Liu, to be honest with you,

228
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,320
this kind of thing is very common.

229
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,600
Manager Jiang, you must be pocketing

230
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,320
quite a sum each month this way.

231
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,400
No, Director Liu,

232
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,920
you're mistaken.

233
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,000
Let me be straightforward with you.

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,720
This kind of practice happens

235
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,120
in every shop.

236
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,840
It's nothing special, just common practice.

237
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,200
Besides, the small amount I make

238
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,960
wouldn't even catch your attention, right?

239
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,640
And at the company, you see,

240
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
I work very diligently,

241
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,640
everyone can see that.

242
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,720
I've closed quite a few deals recently.

243
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,040
Of course, Director Qin is aware of that.

244
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,800
And right now his company

245
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,480
really needs someone to help manage things.

246
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,840
Alright, Director Liu. I'll do as you say.

247
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,160
Just say the word,

248
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,560
as long as I can return to the company,

249
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,160
I'll work even harder than before.

250
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,090
Smart people are easy to work with.

251
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,840
I'll talk to him about it for you.

252
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,400
Good, thank you.

253
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,720
As for this ledger,

254
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,640
I'll keep it with me for now.

255
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,450
You never know when it might come in handy.

256
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,280
By the way, when you came to see me at the company last time,

257
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,560
what was it about?

258
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,280
Director Liu,

259
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,720
regarding the matter between Wan Xinxin and Director Qin,

260
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,580
if you need my help with anything,

261
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,120
just let me know anytime.

262
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,920
I'll help you get back to work first.

263
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,080
If there's anything I need your help with,

264
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,880
I trust you won't refuse, right?

265
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,690
No, absolutely not.

266
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,520
Then I can rest assured.

267
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,320
Wait for my call.

268
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,880
Okay, sure.

269
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,840
Ruirui, Ruirui.

270
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,520
Have you seen my painting?

271
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
What painting? I don't know.

272
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,560
No, when I just came in,

273
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,480
I was carrying a painting

274
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,720
and I put it right here. Did you see it?

275
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,160
The painting.

276
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,840
This is so strange. There's only the two of us here,

277
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,800
and it couldn't have grown legs and walked away.

278
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,530
Maybe you put it somewhere else

279
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,500
but you forgot.

280
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,360
Did you hide it from me?

281
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,400
No, you're wrongly accusing me.

282
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,120
That painting is very important to me.

283
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,920
If you took it, just give it back.

284
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,840
You're just blaming me for nothing.

285
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,240
I'm going to tell my dad.

286
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,880
Ruirui, don't cry.

287
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,760
Don't cry. It's okay.

288
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,580
There, there. No more crying.

289
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,240
Xinxin.

290
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,520
Really, think about where you might have put it.

291
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,250
No, there are only two of us in the room.

292
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
How could I be wrongly accusing her?

293
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,380
Am I wrongly accusing you?

294
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,480
Wan Xinxin.

295
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,599
Hold tight.

296
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,200
Ruirui is fine.

297
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,920
No, can you think about it carefully?

298
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,650
Did you leave it at the gallery?

299
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
No, why don't you believe me?

300
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,720
Don't be so sensitive.

301
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,600
I didn't say anything.

302
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm just asking if you might be mistaken.

303
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,440
Maybe you put the painting somewhere else.

304
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,280
I put the painting there as soon as I came in.

305
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,720
There were only two of us in the room.

306
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,180
Where did the painting go?

307
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,040
Just the two of us.

308
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,700
Did it grow wings and fly away?

309
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,240
Xinxin, I need to talk to you about this.

310
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,200
You never have a system for putting things away.

311
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,480
I'm always cleaning up after you.

312
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,440
You need to fix this habit.

313
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,160
Can you please stop getting angry for no reason?

314
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,040
No, Huaming.

315
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,760
Last time when Ruirui fell down,

316
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,280
you thought it was my fault.

317
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,120
And now this happens again.

318
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,040
Do you think

319
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,360
if she kills me someday,

320
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,760
you'd believe I committed suicide?

321
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,200
Can you please not talk like that?

322
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,840
Is it appropriate to talk like this in front of the child?

323
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,770
Do you think she took the painting?

324
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
Ask her yourself.

325
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,440
Fine. I'll handle my own daughter.

326
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,200
Is it okay if I ask her?

327
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,400
Go ahead and ask her.

328
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,040
Ruirui.

329
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,760
Ruirui, come here, be good.

330
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,920
Come to daddy.

331
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,120
Look at me. Look at daddy.

332
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,280
Don't cry now. Look at me.

333
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,000
I want to ask you something.

334
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,680
Did you hide your sister's painting?

335
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,520
No.

336
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,120
I'll ask you one more time.

337
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
Did you take sister Wan Xinxin's painting?

338
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,800
Good girl. I believe you.

339
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,720
I asked.

340
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,600
If she cries, you believe her.

341
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,330
I would've cried a river by now.

342
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,800
You're accusing me? I didn't hide your painting.

343
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,480
Dad, she's wrongly accusing me.

344
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
That's enough, Ruirui.

345
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,120
Okay.

346
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,600
I didn't take it.

347
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,960
Daddy believes you.

348
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,000
It's okay.

349
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,130
Alright, come here.

350
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,120
It's fine, Huaming.

351
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,920
Come here.

352
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,800
Give me a hug.

353
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,480
There, there.

354
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,000
Good.

355
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Good, lie down.

356
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,280
I know you didn't take it.

357
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,100
Wan Xinxin, come here.

358
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,240
Xinxin.

359
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,920
Really, it's just a painting. If you really want it,

360
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,480
even if it gets lost,

361
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,810
you can just paint another one, can't you?

362
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,570
No, it's easy for you to say.

363
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,860
What do you mean 'paint another one'?

364
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,080
Do you know that Jiang Xiaoyu

365
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,480
worked hard to get this opportunity for me?

366
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,480
It's a major French art dealer.

367
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,740
I need this painting for the exhibition.

368
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,760
Okay.

369
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,140
You still want to go to France, right?

370
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,400
This has nothing to do with whether I go to France or not.

371
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,440
I just need to find that painting today.

372
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,160
But about that painting, I just asked Ruirui.

373
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,960
She says she didn't take it, and you say you lost it.

374
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,920
What I'm discussing with you now is

375
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,160
whether you're going to France.

376
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,120
Have you decided to go to France?

377
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,760
I actually already told Jiang Xiaoyu that day

378
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,280
I didn't want to participate anymore.

379
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
But she worked so hard to get this opportunity for me.

380
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,800
I don't want to give it up.

381
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,240
Listen, Wan Xinxin.

382
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,080
We're all adults here,

383
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
and we're not stupid, right?

384
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,480
You don't need to tell me

385
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
that you've changed your mind now.

386
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,240
You don't need to tell me whether you want to go to France.

387
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,040
Just be honest with yourself about your real decision:

388
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you want to go to France

389
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,720
or stay here and live with me?

390
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,920
You just need to be clear with yourself.

391
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,760
Okay?

392
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
I don't want to discuss this issue with you today.

393
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,440
We're discussing who took that painting.

394
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,400
Just now...

395
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,250
Fine, just keep spoiling your daughter then.

396
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,640
Yes, I'll admit I had my own agenda.

397
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,160
I kept a draft copy at that time.

398
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,960
I do want to participate in the exhibition.

399
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,360
In case one day our relationship doesn't work out,

400
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,690
I'd still have a way out.

401
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,740
Satisfied now?

402
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,140
What if one day things get too hard

403
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,280
and we haven't even been together

404
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,040
to truly start our life together?

405
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,240
This requires trust.

406
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,520
You don't even trust me at all right now.

407
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,800
Do you trust me?

408
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,160
Trust is mutual.

409
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,840
Have you ever trusted me?

410
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,600
I'm like an open book in front of you,

411
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,520
but you never tell me anything.

412
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,960
You never open up to me.

413
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,360
Do you call that trust?

414
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,040
That takes time, Xinxin.

415
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,280
Your lack of trust in me now

416
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,810
is the biggest blow to a man.

417
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
You bringing your ex-wife and child to live in our home

418
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,400
is also the biggest blow to me.

419
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
They're my family. I have to do this.

420
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,970
Since we're being honest, let me tell you.

421
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,920
Yes, I've wanted to go to France for a long time.

422
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,320
Paris is my dream.

423
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,560
For any artist,

424
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,840
it's their dream.

425
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,570
I should thank you for helping me make this decision.

426
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,000
Alright. I wish you well.

427
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,130
I don't even know why I came back today.

428
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,440
Xinxin!

429
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,440
Wan Xinxin!

430
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,760
No, listen to me.

431
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
What's going on? What happened?

432
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,680
You were crying so hard on the phone.

433
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,640
What's wrong?

434
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,280
Honey.

435
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,600
Give me a hug.

436
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,680
I missed you so much.

437
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,760
Xuke, my bestie

438
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,760
Jiang Xiaoyu.

439
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,200
Hello.

440
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,680
What's wrong with her?

441
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,880
Talk to her. She's been crying for ages.

442
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,800
Go chat with your friend.

443
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,080
Don't treat him like that.

444
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,730
I miss him. Let me see what's wrong.

445
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,240
No, I mean...

446
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,720
I'm not criticizing you.

447
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,520
Why are you angry with the child?

448
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,500
No, what do you mean I'm angry with the child?

449
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,480
Look, put yourself in his shoes.

450
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,920
If your baby brother was crying and making a fuss,

451
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,450
you'd definitely go crazy.

452
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,800
You'd lose your mind too, you know?

453
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
So everything Ming said was just out of anger.

454
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,500
Don't take it to heart.

455
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,320
No, Xu Ke.

456
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,560
Whose side are you on now?

457
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,120
It's Brother Ming this, Brother Ming that.

458
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,880
Brother Ming this, Brother Ming that.

459
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,120
You've been getting along well with Brother Ming lately.

460
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,800
No, I came here to talk some sense into you.

461
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,520
Why are you mad at me?

462
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,840
I don't think this is about the child at all.

463
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,440
I think he just doesn't trust me.

464
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,240
And he never tells me anything.

465
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,440
He keeps everything bottled up inside.

466
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,080
Tell me, how am I supposed to communicate with him?

467
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,520
Look, men don't easily show their tears, you know.

468
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,960
Same goes for their pain.

469
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,680
So sometimes you have to...

470
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,000
You have to give in to him.

471
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,360
Haven't I given in enough?

472
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,280
How much more should I give?

473
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,560
You need to treat him like...

474
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,220
A child who needs coaxing.

475
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,740
Just like Brother Bao.

476
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,480
But he once told me that...

477
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,640
A man's highest level of treating a woman...

478
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
The ultimate way to treat a girlfriend is...

479
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,370
To treat her like his daughter.

480
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,800
Do you know what's a woman's...

481
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,720
Highest level of loving a man?

482
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,050
Do you know what that is?

483
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,000
It's motherly love.

484
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,680
You need to treat him like your son.

485
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,800
Just like Brother Bao, you understand?

486
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,960
Wait, but...

487
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,320
Isn't that incestuous?

488
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,920
What incest? That's called emotional intelligence.

489
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,200
You better learn this well.

490
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,560
Otherwise how will you handle your husband in the future? Honestly.

491
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,320
He might not necessarily be anyone's husband.

492
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,600
Let me take you out of here, okay?

493
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,560
Let's go.

494
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,340
The plane is about to take off.

495
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,320
Xiaoyu.

496
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,740
Xiaoyu.

497
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,140
Um, is there still a way to fix our situation?

498
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,760
Fix what?

499
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,360
The trip to France.

500
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,640
So you want to go again?

501
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,360
Didn't you text me the other day

502
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,640
saying you weren't going?

503
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:52,920
Yes.

504
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,320
I've made up my mind now. I want to go.

505
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,480
You've changed your mind several times today.

506
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,880
Who am I supposed to listen to?

507
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,610
Is there still a way to fix this?

508
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,080
I don't know.

509
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,400
I can only pull some strings to help you apply for an extension.

510
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,120
You must help me this time.

511
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,160
So you've really made up your mind this time?

512
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,280
Yes, I must go.

513
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,720
I can't give up such a great opportunity.

514
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,400
Xiaoyu, you have to support me this time.

515
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay, I'll definitely support you.

516
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,920
Dad.

517
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,440
Let me flick your forehead.

518
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:04,920
Flick.

519
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,250
Let me flick your forehead. Come here.

520
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,940
Haven't practiced piano for a while, right?

521
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,200
But you can still enjoy thunderous applause.

522
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,280
Applause like a tidal wave.

523
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,920
Dad.

524
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,520
I know you had a fight with Xinxin today

525
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,200
because of me.

526
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,680
Are you still mad at Xinxin?

527
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,080
You little smarty.

528
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,360
No.

529
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm not angry with her.

530
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,400
Xinxin just has a bit of a childish temper

531
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,060
and couldn't find her things.

532
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,800
She just got a little upset.

533
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
It has nothing to do with you.

534
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,680
You're Daddy's little princess.

535
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,000
I have cleared your name.

536
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,400
If anyone bullies you in the future,

537
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,660
I will stand up for you.

538
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,120
Anyone who bullies you is a little monster,

539
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,800
and I am Ultraman.

540
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,620
Ultraman will fight the monsters for you, okay?

541
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,440
Daddy, do you love me?

542
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,680
I love you the most.

543
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,320
Do you like Xinxin more

544
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,640
or do you like me more?

545
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,520
Ruirui, in my heart,

546
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
you will always come first.

547
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,280
Xinxin is my girlfriend now.

548
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,840
At least for now.

549
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,400
Xinxin also praises you behind your back.

550
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,280
She says Ruirui is like a little adult

551
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,440
and very sensible.

552
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,800
Even if I and Xinxin get married in the future,

553
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,560
you will still be our center, I promise.

554
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,360
Really?

555
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,680
Of course, I promise.

556
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,410
Pinky swear?

557
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,000
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

558
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,560
How I wonder what you are.

559
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,640
But now Xinxin and I might

560
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,960
not make up.

561
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,080
Why?

562
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,320
Why won't you make up with Xinxin?

563
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,540
It probably won't happen.

564
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,400
Dad, it breaks my heart to see you like this.

565
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,940
That old fox Jiang Kaiyang

566
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,240
has spoiled all the clients

567
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,450
so no one else can take over.

568
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,890
Then why don't you invite him back?

569
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,560
Are you playing dumb with me?

570
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm not playing dumb.

571
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,610
I think you should be the one playing dumb.

572
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,360
Look, you're just like this coffee spoon.

573
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,280
Just a tool.

574
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,840
In the end, you're still the one drinking this coffee.

575
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,700
You've really convinced me completely.

576
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,560
Actually, it doesn't matter who you bring back.

577
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,890
What matters most is making money for you.

578
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,040
I'm waiting for

579
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,760
you to achieve your dreams soon

580
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,920
and marry this poor woman.

581
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,320
How can you be poor when you have me?

582
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm just a woman

583
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,160
begging you every day to marry me. Isn't that pitiful?

584
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,360
Don't worry.

585
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,770
I'll definitely fulfill what I promised you.

586
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,120
This Jiang Kaiyang...

587
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,020
Let me handle the situation with Jiang Kaiyang.

588
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,400
Okay.

589
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,560
How did this painting end up with you?

590
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,720
I hid it on purpose.

591
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,360
Because she said she wanted to marry Dad.

592
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,760
I got angry and hid the painting.

593
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,440
Come here.

594
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,640
Mom's asking you. Did you really hide it?

595
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,920
Ruirui, Mom understands.

596
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,760
You don't like Dad being with Xinxin.

597
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,440
But you can't lie.

598
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,400
Mom.

599
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,920
I just saw how sad Dad looked.

600
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,040
I know I was wrong.

601
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,760
Mom.

602
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,920
I know you don't want Dad to be so upset either.

603
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,700
Please help me talk to him.

604
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,080
Otherwise, when he learns the truth,

605
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,400
he'll stop loving me.

606
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,040
Silly child. Dad will never stop loving you.

607
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,880
There, there.

608
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,680
But you can't lie anymore, okay?

609
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Ruirui, you need to understand.

610
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,840
Xinxin isn't a bad person.

611
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,840
I know. I know.

612
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,240
So you know what you need to do next.

613
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,040
Apologize to Wan Xinxin.

614
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,880
But...

615
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,280
I don't know when,

616
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,560
but I damaged the painting.

617
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,260
Get ready to go to work.

618
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,840
What did President Qin say?

619
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,100
He won't say anything.

620
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,320
You should go back to being a sales manager.

621
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Oh, remember to give him a way to save face.

622
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,600
He really cares about his reputation.

623
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,680
I understand.

624
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,840
I've already helped you.

625
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,720
Director Liu, I understand.

626
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,180
I'll definitely repay what I owe you double.

627
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,520
President Qin will need you for important tasks in the future.

628
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,240
Don't always dress so cheaply.

629
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,720
Here.

630
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,280
This is for you.

631
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,800
Consider it a congratulatory gift.

632
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,000
Thank you so much.

633
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,360
I'll be going now.

634
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,520
Okay. Take care.

635
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,220
Be careful.

636
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Drive slowly.

637
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,880
Alright, go in.

638
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,760
Mom, can you come in with me?

639
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,010
I'm a little scared.

640
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,720
This is something you did yourself.

641
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,720
So you need to face it on your own. Go.

642
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,300
Mom will wait for you here.

643
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,320
Go on.

644
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,320
Sister Xinxin.

645
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,400
Why are you here?

646
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,420
Sister Xinxin,

647
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,360
I know I did something wrong.

648
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,020
I'm returning this to you.

649
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,480
I accidentally tore it.

650
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,760
But I drew another one myself.

651
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,880
You drew this?

652
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,520
Sister Xinxin, please don't be angry.

653
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,840
If you're angry and my dad finds out,

654
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,370
he won't talk to me anymore.

655
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,280
What should we do then?

656
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,810
I can't use your drawing for the competition.

657
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,199
Do you want to make it up to me?

658
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,440
Yes.

659
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,810
There is one way you can compensate me.

660
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,480
France is now hiring child laborers.

661
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,810
Maybe I should sell you there as a laborer.

662
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,760
I won't go! I won't go!

663
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,800
Xinxin, I won't lie anymore.

664
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,520
If I lie again, I'm a puppy. I swear.

665
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,239
Really?

666
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,800
I swear. If I lie again, I'm a puppy.

667
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,280
Your little hands are dirty.

668
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,010
A good child knows how to correct their mistakes.

669
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,320
Xinxin,

670
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,480
you've forgiven me. That's wonderful!

671
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,960
I was just jealous that Dad loves you so much,

672
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,440
but now I understand.

673
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,240
How did you figure it out?

674
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,680
Dad talked to me.

675
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,800
He said you actually like me too.

676
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,280
Even if he marries you in the future,

677
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,240
he'll still love me just the same.

678
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,400
He also said you would love me too, right?

679
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,480
Of course. You're so adorable.

680
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,840
Did your dad really tell you that?

681
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,200
Xinxin,

682
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,480
even if you and my dad make up,

683
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,640
will you still go to France?

684
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,520
These are grown-up matters.

685
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,000
You don't need to worry about us.

686
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,300
Even if I make up with your father,

687
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,090
I still need to go to France.

688
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,880
You asked me to come here.

689
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
It can't be just to offer me coffee, right?

690
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,280
Children don't know better.

691
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,480
She took your things.

692
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,360
Seeing how generously you forgave her,

693
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,250
I'm really grateful to you.

694
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,440
It's nothing.

695
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,880
I can understand, actually.

696
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,440
You've been raising Ruirui abroad,

697
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,520
and suddenly she comes back to find a strange woman

698
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,560
taking her father away.

699
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,690
I wouldn't like it either if I were her.

700
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,720
So I won't hold it against her.

701
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,360
It's good that you can think that way.

702
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,560
Actually, you can feel it without me telling you -

703
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,960
the difference in how Huaming treats Ruirui compared to you.

704
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,760
Ruirui is his only focus and his center.

705
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,120
Do you really want to be with

706
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,520
a man who has a daughter

707
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,400
like this?

708
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,360
If you love a man,

709
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,040
you must love everything about him.

710
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,880
Including his strengths and weaknesses.

711
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,520
And of course, his ex-wife and daughter too.

712
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,920
I love Huaming.

713
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,560
So I can accept and embrace all of this.

714
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,810
I think Ruirui is really adorable.

715
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,720
I believe we'll get along well in the future.

716
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,580
Hearing you say that puts my mind at ease.

717
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,250
What's this? Are you planning to hand Huaming over to me?

718
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,320
Don't worry,

719
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,610
I absolutely won't betray your trust.

720
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,880
But I heard from Ruirui

721
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,960
that you're still determined to go to France. Why?

722
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,160
To be honest with you,

723
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
I'm really afraid that Huaming and I

724
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,520
will end up badly.

725
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,200
Since you came back,

726
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,680
I've seen the unspoken understanding between you and Huaming

727
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,010
that he and I don't have.

728
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,970
I don't know if our trust

729
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,880
is enough to last a lifetime.

730
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,490
So I decided to give each other some space.

731
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,600
I think this way we might be able

732
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,060
to make a rational choice.

733
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,330
Is this why you decided to go to France?

734
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
Aren't you afraid

735
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,560
that a long-distance relationship with Huaming

736
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,620
might lead to a complete separation?

737
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,610
I was quite worried before.

738
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,080
But now I'm not worried anymore.

739
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,480
Because I believe if two people truly love each other,

740
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,080
no matter what obstacles they face,

741
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,880
they will still end up together.

742
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,250
Actually, I have a different view.

743
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,080
I think a person

744
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,840
should be true to their inner feelings.

745
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,440
If you truly love him, you should persevere

746
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,330
no matter what external pressures there are.

747
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
Because this is a woman's

748
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,440
necessary path to happiness.

749
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,380
Are you trying to persuade me to stay?

750
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,400
I have no right to persuade you of anything.

751
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,640
I just wanted to say what I needed to say.

752
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,120
What you actually do is up to you.

753
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,580
Thank you for telling me all this.

754
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,720
But France -

755
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
I still have to go.

756
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,600
The client has issues with our proposal.

757
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,120
We need to make adjustments quickly,

758
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,320
otherwise they might

759
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,850
switch to another company.

760
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,200
I think

761
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,490
simple adjustments won't solve the problem.

762
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,800
Xu Ke, are you determined to go against me?

763
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,380
I've already said we need to make adjustments quickly.

764
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,400
Would you please stop causing trouble here?

765
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,640
I have a new proposal.

766
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,420
Okay, go ahead.

767
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,880
I think our previous

768
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,340
approach was fundamentally flawed.

769
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,000
It's not about making minor adjustments

770
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,560
that will solve the problem.

771
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Cut the nonsense and get to the plan.

772
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay.

773
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,580
We sell children's products.

774
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,960
Most of our customers are

775
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,450
pregnant women and young mothers.

776
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,400
So when we promote our products,

777
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,160
we must make them feel

778
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,820
that they are being cared for.

779
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,680
Not just cold sales pitches.

780
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,680
So my plan is just two words:

781
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,240
Warmth.

782
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,440
Go on.

783
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,200
That's it.

784
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,120
Just those two words.

785
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,840
What exactly are you trying to do, Xu Ke?

786
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,360
Don't throw things at me!

787
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,600
I'm a shareholder. I have the right to speak.

788
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,600
What shareholder? You're just here to cause trouble.

789
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,320
Fine. I'm going all in today.

790
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,650
Everyone, let's vote by show of hands.

791
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,440
Alright, everyone has heard his proposal, right?

792
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,900
Come on, raise your hands.

793
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:34,900
Democracy.

794
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,940
You're voting for such a terrible proposal?

795
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,480
Mr. Shi, his proposal is actually quite good.

796
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,160
Xu Ke.

797
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,260
I'll give you one week.

798
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,090
Turn these two words

799
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,660
into a detailed proposal and submit it to me.

800
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,010
Otherwise, I will definitely return your shares to you.

801
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,520
No, what should I do?

802
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,000
Please help me out

803
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,900
with this baby products case.

804
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,320
Didn't you work on

805
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,490
a similar case at Lady Company?

806
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,280
Something like that.

807
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,800
You

808
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,160
could come up with an idea in no time.

809
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,220
Quickly, help me think of something.

810
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,240
I'm talking to you.

811
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,960
I'm listening. Go on.

812
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,060
Look, Shi Lu gave me a new project.

813
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,120
It's about baby products.

814
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,980
Can you help me come up with a plan?

815
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,960
No, but

816
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,000
I can barely keep up with my own work right now.

817
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,840
You'll have to figure it out yourself.

818
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,520
Let me tell you,

819
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,280
I've been tortured by that little devil lately.

820
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,600
It's really been tough.

821
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,200
A painting I finished

822
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,320
that was supposed to go to France for exhibition,

823
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,280
she ruined it.

824
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,440
Now I have no choice but to paint a new one

825
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,000
and rush it to France,

826
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,080
otherwise I really won't be able to go.

827
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,140
Wait, are you really going to France?

828
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,320
Yes.

829
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,840
The French Academy of Contemporary Art

830
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,770
has already sent me an invitation.

831
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,560
That's amazing!

832
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,200
You're going from rags to riches.

833
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,840
Who are you calling Cinderella?

834
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,520
Rich friend, we must stay connected.

835
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,440
What about...

836
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,640
Is Ming going with you?

837
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,800
What's wrong?

838
