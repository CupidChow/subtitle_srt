1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,479
When are you leaving?

3
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,759
Well,

4
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,050
the day after tomorrow.

5
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
Wait a second.

6
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,079
Don't be careless in the future.

7
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,640
I prepared a first aid kit

8
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
you might need it.

9
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
You don't want it?

10
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,250
If you don't want it,

11
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,500
I'll throw it away.

12
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,720
I thought after all these changes,

13
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,320
my heart would never race again.

14
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,640
But then I met you.

15
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,280
Yet I no longer believe in love.

16
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,760
It's not that I don't want to love despite being hurt before.

17
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,360
Who can predict what fate has in store?

18
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,080
It's not that I don't want to love.

19
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,120
Driver,

20
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,920
please turn around.

21
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,000
Perhaps I'm destined to wait a lifetime.

22
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:22,240
It's not that I don't want to love despite being hurt before.

23
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
I've been searching for so long without finding it.

24
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,000
Who can predict what fate has in store?

25
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,720
It's not that I don't want to love.

26
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
I found it!

27
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,159
I don't want to miss you again.

28
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,080
As long as we're together,

29
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,840
whether you go to America or anywhere else,

30
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,680
I'll wait for you.

31
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
Whether it's 3 years, 5 years,

32
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,120
10 years or 30 years, I'm willing to wait,

33
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,920
as long as we can be together.

34
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
You said you believe in fate.

35
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,360
But this time I don't want to let heaven

36
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,680
decide for us.

37
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,760
I want to fight for my own happiness.

38
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Marry me.

39
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,880
Please give me a chance to love you.

40
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Like a gentle breeze blowing through my heart,

41
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,320
melting away past attachments.

42
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,320
A maple leaf falls,

43
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,760
scattering my vision, taking away my longing.

44
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,920
If fate is meeting a stranger,

45
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,400
that familiar feeling comes in an instant.

46
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:12,360
The heart flutters and stays, as we fall in love.

47
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,280
I want to just

48
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,160
snuggle up beside you,

49
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,600
forgetting about time.

50
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,480
If love can be limitless,

51
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,320
only after turning around do I realize

52
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,360
your

53
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,480
my

54
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,640
path to happiness

55
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,000
is right beside me.

56
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,440
I want to just

57
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,800
stay in your world from now on,

58
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,640
forgetting about place.

59
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,280
If love has no boundaries anymore.

60
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,080
If every day, you're there, I'm there,

61
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,520
in our hearts.

62
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,080
Love never changes.

63
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,820
Let's get married.

64
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,740
We'll register tomorrow.

65
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,720
Then we'll have the wedding.

66
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
What kind of wedding should we have?

67
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,920
I don't care what kind of wedding it is as long as you're there.

68
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,799
Who's there?

69
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,600
Who's there?

70
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,040
Open the door!

71
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,400
Xinxin!

72
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,400
Quick,

73
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,000
sis!

74
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,560
You,

75
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,290
come in quickly!

76
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,920
Weren't you going to the airport?

77
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,080
You didn't leave?

78
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,680
Yes, I changed my mind at the last minute.

79
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,800
You're giving up so easily?

80
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,560
Study hard in France.

81
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Maybe our family will have a celebrity,

82
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,120
who's both famous and rich.

83
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm waiting to enjoy the benefits of your success.

84
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,280
Tell me,

85
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,560
didn't you already make up your mind?

86
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,520
Yes,

87
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,040
but I'll miss you.

88
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,160
You're quite the sweet talker.

89
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,400
It's not because of Huaming, is it?

90
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,920
Don't be foolish.

91
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
He has a wife and child.

92
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,200
The three of them are living in America.

93
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Alright, I've been holding it in the whole way.

94
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,400
I need to use the bathroom. I'll talk to you in a bit.

95
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,080
Why are you here?

96
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,780
Xinxin, take this.

97
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,720
Come over here. I'm going to the bathroom.

98
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,160
Okay.

99
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,290
I'll talk to both of you in a minute.

100
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,320
I've missed you so much.

101
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
No, my sister is here.

102
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,360
Your sister is here?

103
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,760
It's fine. Why worry if your sister's here?

104
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,680
Stop it.

105
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,200
Sis!

106
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,880
Huaming.

107
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,520
Sis.

108
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,960
You haven't been mistreating my sister, have you?

109
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,760
Sis, how could I ever mistreat Xinxin?

110
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,690
I wouldn't dare.

111
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,360
I must say, you move pretty fast.

112
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,040
We just got back from the airport and you're already here.

113
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,600
Weren't you supposed to be with your wife and child,

114
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,800
living in America?

115
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,880
No, sis.

116
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,800
It's a long story. I'll tell you the details another day.

117
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,600
Anyway, we've already decided.

118
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,960
We're getting our marriage license right away.

119
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,400
Getting married right away.

120
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
What about your ex-wife?

121
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,520
Sister, I've made things clear with my ex-wife.

122
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
I went to America to accompany my child for school,

123
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,920
not to get back together with her.

124
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,720
Huaming, I've always had a good impression of you.

125
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,760
You cannot mistreat our Xinxin.

126
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,650
You need to follow through.

127
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,520
Don't worry, sister.

128
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,960
I will definitely treat Xinxin well.

129
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,200
I'll take full responsibility.

130
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,920
You're getting your marriage license tomorrow, right?

131
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,320
Good, then I'll go with you tomorrow.

132
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,160
Why do you need to come?

133
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,240
To supervise!

134
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,840
What are you, the neighborhood committee? Supervising me?

135
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,600
Xinxin.

136
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,960
Your sister is part of our family.

137
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,120
When we get our marriage certificate tomorrow,

138
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,320
having a witness present

139
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,640
who is also family makes it so special.

140
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
Thank you, sis. Sorry for the trouble.

141
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
Alright. Tomorrow then.

142
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,920
We'll meet at the entrance

143
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,680
of the Civil Affairs Bureau tomorrow.

144
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,320
Sis, you don't need to go tomorrow.

145
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,360
Why shouldn't I go?

146
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,920
I'll leave these things here. I'm going now.

147
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,360
Alright.

148
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,240
Take care, sis.

149
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,010
Should I take this suit?

150
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,730
Never mind, take it.

151
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
I'll leave a few days later.

152
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,760
No, we go together.

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,400
I said I'll leave a few days later.

154
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,800
No, I said we go together.

155
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,680
Ruirui.

156
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,280
Ruirui.

157
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,960
Ruirui, Daddy needs to ask you something.

158
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,580
Why didn't you want

159
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,580
your mom to marry someone else back then?

160
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,760
I wanted Mom and Dad to be together.

161
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,680
Ruirui.

162
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,960
Because of the relationship between us adults,

163
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,000
your mom and I

164
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,290
can't be together anymore.

165
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,760
Ruirui is a big girl now.

166
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,960
There's one thing I hope you understand.

167
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
No matter when,

168
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,930
no matter what happens,

169
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,840
Mom and Dad will always love you.

170
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,240
That will never change.

171
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
Dad, are you not coming to America with us

172
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,370
because you want to be with Sister Wan Xinxin?

173
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,440
Ruirui, tell your father everything

174
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,240
you told me.

175
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,090
Hurry up.

176
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,360
Say it.

177
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,400
Say it now.

178
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Are you stupid? Didn't you tell me

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,520
that our family of three should always stay together?

180
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,560
Tell your father. Quick.

181
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,440
Didn't you say I couldn't marry someone else?

182
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,520
If I married someone else,

183
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,280
you would kill yourself, right?

184
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
Now tell your father. Hurry up.

185
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,920
He can't marry Wan Xinxin.

186
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,200
If he does, you'll kill yourself.

187
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,600
Tell your father.

188
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,520
Xia Qing, please don't do this.

189
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,480
What am I doing?

190
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,840
Mom.

191
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,320
Mom, I think I've grown up.

192
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,080
I believe what Dad said is true.

193
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,040
No matter what happens,

194
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,440
the fact that Mom and Dad love me

195
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,600
will never change.

196
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,560
So this is your adult business.

197
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,090
I won't interfere anymore.

198
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,200
Ruirui

199
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
Ruirui

200
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,200
Huaming

201
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,000
I won't let you marry Wan Xinxin.

202
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,720
Huaming, you can't go.

203
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,360
Xiaqing

204
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,940
For more than three years,

205
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,880
you've never said you wanted to remarry me.

206
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,160
Now Ruirui has agreed.

207
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,890
I hope you won't interfere with my life, okay?

208
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,760
Thank you.

209
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,680
I don't have to remarry you,

210
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,080
but you can't marry her either.

211
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,600
Why?

212
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,920
No reason.

213
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,880
Listen to me just this once. I'm really doing this for your own good.

214
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,740
You absolutely cannot marry her.

215
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,000
Give it back to me.

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,160
I won't give it back to you.

217
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,000
Xiaqing, give it back to me.

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,460
I won't give it back to you.

219
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,930
Then I think you're just being unreasonable now.

220
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,840
Huaming

221
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,640
Huaming,

222
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,400
you can't go.

223
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,560
Huaming, please, I'm begging you,

224
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,040
don't go marry her.

225
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,320
I already hurt you once three years ago.

226
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,360
I know how you've been getting by these three years.

227
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
So I'm begging you,

228
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,880
you can't marry her.

229
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,180
I won't let you get hurt again.

230
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,920
Xiaqing

231
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,720
We are family and friends.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,330
That will never change.

233
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,210
When you left with Ruirui three years ago,

234
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,610
I didn't try to stop you.

235
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,420
I hope you won't try to stop me now.

236
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,600
Huaming.

237
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,400
What are you doing, Xiaqing?

238
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,720
Do you know how dangerous this is?

239
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,680
Just listen to me this once.

240
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,800
Please don't go today.

241
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,660
No. Can you stop being so selfish?

242
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,720
I must go today.

243
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,200
Fine. If you insist on going today,

244
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,000
you'll have to run me over first.

245
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,840
I can't believe how unreasonable you're being.

246
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,160
Let me tell you,

247
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,560
even if I can't drive, I'll walk there today.

248
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,640
I'll walk if I have to.

249
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,000
If you really marry her,

250
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,240
the pain she'll cause you

251
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
will be unbearable for the rest of your life.

252
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,640
Why?

253
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,860
Huaming, listen to me.

254
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,940
Come back to America with me, please?

255
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,780
Are you hiding something from me?

256
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
I don't want to say.

257
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,640
Tell me.

258
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,160
Tell me.

259
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,160
Do you remember three years ago,

260
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,320
what made you

261
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,460
put down your scalpel?

262
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,840
We're leaving. We're going to find Mom.

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,920
Xinxin.

264
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,120
Sis.

265
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,080
We're going to find Mom.

266
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
Wait, you actually came.

267
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,280
Why did you bring Bao here too?

268
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
I want Bao to witness Mom's happiness.

269
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,810
Isn't that nice?

270
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,800
Why isn't Huaming here yet?

271
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,660
I hope he's not getting cold feet.

272
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,880
Can't you wish me well, sis?

273
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,119
Call him quickly.

274
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,720
It's almost our turn.

275
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,319
He's driving.

276
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,440
You insist I call him.

277
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,119
I'll send him a message instead.

278
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,280
Hey sweetie, where are you?

279
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,319
My sister and I are already here.

280
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,560
Drive carefully.

281
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,120
Waiting for you. XOXO.

282
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,560
Yang.

283
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,120
Dr. Hua.

284
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,720
What brings you here?

285
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,080
Could you help me with something?

286
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,400
Please go ahead.

287
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,530
I was just an intern when you were here.

288
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,520
Could you help me check some records?

289
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,920
The surgery I performed on June 4, 2012.

290
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,200
Sure. Just give me a moment to find it.

291
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,800
Thank you.

292
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,000
Dr. Hua, here are the records.

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,920
There's water here. Take your time.

294
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,200
Okay.

295
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,800
I'll head back now.

296
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,360
Thank you.

297
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,280
Goodbye.

298
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,800
Did he reply to the WeChat message you just sent him?

299
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,760
Not yet.

300
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,880
Why don't you call him?

301
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,760
Don't call. He's driving.

302
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,080
It's dangerous to talk on the phone while driving.

303
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,560
If you won't call him, I will.

304
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,880
Fine, I'll call him.

305
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,360
The number you have dialed is powered off. Please try again later.

306
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,240
What did it say?

307
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,200
His phone is turned off.

308
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,240
The young man's condition is more serious.

309
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,680
But he's a criminal.

310
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,520
This is a hospital. Do we discriminate based on identity?

311
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,920
I'll perform the second surgery after I finish the first one.

312
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,480
Tell Dr. Chen.

313
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,800
I'll go in and perform his surgery right away.

314
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,600
Dr. Hua, Dr. Chen asked me to tell you.

315
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,280
The patient, Wan Quanyou,

316
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,200
shows no vital signs anymore.

317
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,040
Coming.

318
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Where is Hua Ming?

319
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,320
He's not here.

320
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,880
Hua Ming!

321
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,690
Hua Ming isn't here.

322
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,360
Hua Ming!

323
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,960
Huaming.

324
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,760
Where is he?

325
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
I've already told you, he's not here.

326
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,240
Where have you hidden him?

327
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,560
Wan Xinxin, can you be more mature?

328
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,880
Huaming is a grown man.

329
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,240
Do you think I could hide him even if I wanted to?

330
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,800
He didn't show up today when we were supposed to get our marriage certificate.

331
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,360
What did you say to him?

332
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,200
What did I say?

333
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,760
If not you,

334
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,880
who else could pressure him?

335
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,440
Fine.

336
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,920
Since you insist, I'll admit it.

337
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,200
I told him not to get the marriage certificate with you.

338
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,440
Why, Xia Qing?

339
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
Why would you do this?

340
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,680
Do you know how hard it was for us to get to this point?

341
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,800
You're so naive.

342
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,160
Do you really think

343
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,000
a mature man like Huaming would have the heart

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,240
to abandon his child and his wife

345
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,600
for some so-called love?

346
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
Let me tell you something, Wan Xinxin.

347
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,810
Although we're divorced on paper,

348
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
in reality,

349
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,040
we never gave up on each other.

350
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,250
That's impossible.

351
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
He told me himself that you two were over.

352
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,560
Then why didn't he show up today?

353
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,960
I think that's your answer.

354
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,900
Then let Huaming come out.

355
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,840
Let him tell me himself.

356
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,890
Wan Xinxin, I admit,

357
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
during the time when Ruirui and I were away,

358
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
Huaming did feel lonely and empty,

359
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,160
which is why you were able to enter his heart.

360
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,240
But now I'm back,

361
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,560
and I came back to remarry him.

362
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,960
Do you think your few months of feelings

363
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
can compare to our

364
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,250
years of marriage and shared history?

365
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,530
Even if what you say is true,

366
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,980
could you let me see him one last time?

367
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
It's not that I won't let you see him.

368
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,640
He doesn't want to see you.

369
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,570
No matter what kind of wedding,

370
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,560
as long as I have you, I'm willing.

371
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,720
I did what I had to do.

372
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Honey, I don't want to miss you again.

373
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,320
Whether it's 3 years or 5 years,

374
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,120
10 years or 30 years, I'm willing to wait,

375
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,280
as long as we can be together.

376
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,400
You're still pressuring me.

377
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
In such a short time,

378
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,120
where am I supposed to find that much money to pay you back?

379
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Qin Gang.

380
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,290
You don't really love me that much.

381
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,320
Then don't blame me.

382
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,720
This matter is quite serious.

383
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,800
But please don't worry.

384
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,520
Just give me a little more time.

385
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,800
I'll definitely pay it back. No problem.

386
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,400
Jiang Kaiyang, come to my office later.

387
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,440
Yes, of course.

388
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
Right away.

389
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,960
No rush.

390
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,360
Alright, I'll call you later.

391
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
Come in.

392
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,160
Director Liu.

393
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,440
Jiang Kaiyang.

394
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Do you know why I called you in today?

395
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,160
Yes, I do.

396
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,520
Director Liu, I promise next time,

397
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,720
I absolutely won't make personal calls during work hours.

398
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,160
I hope you can give me another chance.

399
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,720
Do you think I would call you in

400
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,180
for such a trivial matter?

401
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,840
It's not about the phone calls?

402
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,720
See? You scared me to death.

403
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,160
I'm planning to promote you.

404
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
Give you the position of Acting CEO.

405
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
And also have you serve as CFO.

406
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,840
Really?

407
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,440
What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

408
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,360
No, it's just...

409
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,600
I didn't process it right away.

410
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,240
You should know that when you came back to work,

411
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
I put in a good word for you with Qin Gang.

412
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,360
And now you're getting promoted.

413
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,720
What I value is your character

414
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,850
and your abilities.

415
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,480
I know, I understand.

416
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,200
Thank you for your trust and support, boss.

417
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,400
Thank you, but...

418
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,200
But what?

419
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,920
Does Mr. Qin know about this?

420
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,040
Of course.

421
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,360
Do you think I would promote you without approval?

422
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,160
All of this was arranged

423
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,520
when I advocated for you to Qin Gang.

424
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,120
You're a smart person. You should understand.

425
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,480
I understand.

426
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,220
I understand, well...

427
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,160
I get it now.

428
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,640
From now on, I, Jiang Kaiyang, will

429
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,040
be absolutely loyal to Director Liu.

430
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,560
Alright, enough with the formalities.

431
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,800
By the way, earlier

432
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,720
I accidentally overheard your phone call.

433
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,380
Are you short on money lately?

434
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,320
It's like this, Director Liu. You see...

435
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,920
My child is studying abroad,

436
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,360
and my wife is quite materialistic.

437
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,560
She insisted on buying a bigger house,

438
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,960
so the mortgage payments are substantial.

439
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,000
The pressure is quite heavy.

440
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,040
The bank is demanding payment.

441
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,880
It must be tough for you.

442
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,940
Carrying such a heavy burden.

443
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,360
Tell me, how much do you need?

444
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
About 40,000, I think.

445
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,090
Okay, send me your card number.

446
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,000
No, I can't possibly accept that.

447
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I should solve this problem myself.

448
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,120
Come on, stop pretending.

449
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,250
Just send your card number to my phone.

450
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,960
Thank you. I'll take this

451
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,640
as a loan from you.

452
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,640
I'll definitely pay you back.

453
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,320
Huaming.

454
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,090
Let's say goodbye here.

455
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,120
Ruirui told me yesterday

456
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,250
she can't bear these farewell scenes.

457
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,520
One person inside security,

458
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,120
one outside. It feels like a final goodbye.

459
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,360
It does feel pretty awful.

460
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,080
It's not that serious. What final goodbye?

461
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,680
I'll be joining you in a few days anyway.

462
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,840
By the way,

463
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,200
how are you planning to handle things with Wan Xinxin?

464
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,440
I'll tell her the truth.

465
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,680
Can you really bring yourself to say it?

466
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,410
I can't keep hiding it from her.

467
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,560
I'll tell her when I get back.

468
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,280
If you can't handle it,

469
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,370
come find us in America.

470
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,010
Thank you, Xiaqing.

471
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,000
Ruirui.

472
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,800
No matter what happens,

473
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,200
as long as we hold hands,

474
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,360
we'll always be a family.

475
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,560
Whenever you need me in the future,

476
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,440
I'll be there for you.

477
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,240
Trust me.

478
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,080
Huaming.

479
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,040
Promise me you'll take care of these hands.

480
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,720
When Ruirui and I come back,

481
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,820
I hope you'll be back at the operating table.

482
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
Okay. Thank you.

483
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,320
Stop drawing.

484
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,400
I said stop.

485
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,360
What's wrong, sis?

486
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,800
What are you drawing? You're just wasting materials.

487
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,040
Huaming is such a jerk.

488
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,610
Tell me, if he wants to remarry, why is he tormenting you?

489
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,840
How did you ever fall for him in the first place?

490
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,040
This kind of man is nothing but trouble.

491
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,450
No, I think something's fishy about this.

492
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,120
Huaming isn't that kind of person.

493
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,200
His ex-wife must be scheming behind the scenes.

494
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,360
Otherwise, how could Huaming possibly

495
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,960
not even see me in person?

496
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,000
Look at the situation now, and you're still defending him?

497
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,040
No, Huaming is

498
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,840
a reliable man.

499
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Are you completely stupid?

500
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,900
There should be a limit to your foolishness.

501
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,290
I think he's just taking advantage of you.

502
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,520
He sees that you have no parents,

503
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,100
a widow with children, so he bullies you.

504
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,840
Come on, don't be sad.

505
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,080
Look at this mess. Clean it up.

506
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,320
Huaming.

507
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
Stop right there!

508
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,340
Xinxin.

509
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,160
I thought you were dead.

510
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,000
Where did you go on our wedding day?

511
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,730
Why did you turn off your phone?

512
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,170
Why are you avoiding me?

513
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,600
I'm sorry.

514
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,410
Don't tell me you're sorry.

515
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,000
Did Xiaqing give you a hard time?

516
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,720
Wan Xinxin, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

517
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,450
I don't want to hear apologies.

518
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,040
I just want to ask you now.

519
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,850
Do you love me or not?

520
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,360
I do.

521
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,120
But...

522
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,840
No buts.

523
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,160
I don't allow any buts.

524
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,360
Love means being together, right?

525
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,920
Wan Xinxin.

526
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,450
I know I'm not as caring as Xiaqing.

527
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,080
But during this time,

528
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,440
I've been learning to accept and grow.

529
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,920
I've been becoming part of your life.

530
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,610
I'm willing to accept everything.

531
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,160
But you...

532
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,380
Unless you can't let go in your heart.

533
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Is that it?

534
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,000
That's not what I meant.

535
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,640
Huaming.

536
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,640
Why can't we be happy together?

537
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,480
If my father were still alive,

538
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,120
he would definitely give my hand to you.

539
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,840
I believe he would bless us.

540
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,480
Give me some time.

541
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,240
I'll remove all the thorns from myself.

542
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,480
Don't leave me.

543
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,800
None of you leave me.

544
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,600
Xinxin.

545
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,580
Wan Xinxin.

546
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,679
I'm sorry.

547
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,880
Huaming.

548
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,960
Xinxin, come back.

549
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,679
Huaming.

550
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,719
Xinxin.

551
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,679
What are you doing?

552
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,840
You still want to chase after him?

553
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,370
Such an ungrateful person.

554
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,760
Not worth another word.

555
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,639
Let's go back.

556
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,010
You're back.

557
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,800
What's wrong? You look unhappy.

558
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,810
It's those two nutcases, Wan Xinxin and Hua Ming.

559
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,159
Hua Ming called me.

560
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:57,840
He said he dumped Wan Xinxin.

561
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,740
He's going back to America with his ex-wife.

562
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,320
This guy is such a phony.

563
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Talking about this and that with me.

564
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,960
He even told me to be nicer to Wan Xinxin.

565
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,320
Does he really need to tell me that?

566
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,160
I think we can't be careless.

567
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,360
It's a critical time now.

568
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,020
We need to keep the old lady happy.

569
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,920
That reminds me.

570
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,930
My mom keeps calling me lately.

571
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,840
Asking how things are going with me and Wan Xinxin.

572
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,360
And her tone is strange.

573
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200
I'm really worried.

574
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,980
She might suddenly show up in front of us.

575
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,640
She's not really planning to come back, is she?

576
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,300
Hard to say.

577
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,760
I'm afraid if she sees

578
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,290
that we're still together.

579
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,690
Well, maybe I should go back to my place for a few days.

580
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,600
What will I do if you leave?

581
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,800
Just stay by yourself.

582
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,760
All alone and miserable.

583
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,080
No wonder there's no housekeeper left.

584
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,640
Mom.

585
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,200
Auntie.

586
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:27,760
Thank you.

587
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,080
The conditions aren't great. Just make do with it.

588
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,040
It's fine.

589
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,880
Look, having a place to sleep is enough.

590
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,680
You know what?

591
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,240
You gave up your place to her,

592
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,840
yet she insists on staying at the gallery.

593
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,570
How long are you two going to keep up this charade?

594
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,880
It's my fault.

595
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
I don't have the courage to tell her.

596
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,580
I can't bring myself to say it.

597
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,440
If you really can't say it yourself,

598
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,240
maybe I could hint at it to her.

599
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,440
No need, brother.

600
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,240
I need to tell her myself.

601
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,650
You have to keep this secret for me.

602
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,090
Alright.

603
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,960
You haven't slept well for several nights.

604
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,840
Get some rest. I'll be going now.

605
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,960
Okay, thanks.

606
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,660
Director Chen.

607
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,360
Xinxin.

608
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Where is Huaming?

609
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,120
Huaming?

610
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,930
I haven't seen him. Haven't seen him for days.

611
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,680
But that nurse outside said

612
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,320
you two were just together.

613
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,560
That can't be right. She

614
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,820
must have mistaken someone else for him.

615
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,020
Do you really not know where he is?

616
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,680
I really don't know.

617
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,100
I have something to do. I'll go first.

618
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,520
Huaming

619
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,560
Huaming

620
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,400
Huaming

621
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,880
Sit down.

622
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,680
Miss Liu, please have a seat too.

623
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,480
Miss Liu, you're a smart woman.

624
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,000
I like talking to smart people.

625
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,200
No need to beat around the bush and waste our breath.

626
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,530
Since you went to America alone back then,

627
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,520
and broke up with my son,

628
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,450
what's done is done.

629
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,080
Why bother coming back?

630
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,980
You've made a very basic mistake.

631
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,900
A good horse never eats the same grass twice.

632
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,360
I know my son well. He's not your type.

633
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,040
Mom.

634
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,000
Auntie.

635
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,200
Qin Gang and I are sincere about each other.

636
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
If you're so sincere,

637
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,440
then what did you do back then?

638
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,780
You went to America on your own

639
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,600
and even married someone else.

640
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,120
You made my son wait painfully for years.

641
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,640
Am I wrong?

642
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,440
If you're truly sincere,

643
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,280
you should want what's best for my son.

644
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,520
But instead, you selfishly came back

645
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,280
and threw yourself at my son.

646
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,600
She forcibly broke up his family

647
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,770
and left my son without his wife and child.

648
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,480
Mom, you don't understand Liu Wei.

649
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,800
She's not like that.

650
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,520
Shut up!

651
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,620
If you had any sense at all,

652
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,520
you wouldn't let her cling to you again.

653
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,440
Auntie,

654
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,200
you just got back. Please get some rest.

655
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I'll be going now.

656
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Stop right there.

657
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,160
Hey, Jiang Kaiyang.

658
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,080
Did you receive the email I sent you?

659
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,560
Yes, the one about the 4S dealership.

660
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,880
Well, Manager Liu.

661
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,410
I'll come to your office right away to report.

662
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,040
I'm out of the office now.

663
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,120
Take a close look at those materials.

664
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,580
I'll get back to you later.

665
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,240
Okay.

666
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,720
Mom, you might have misunderstood Liu Wei.

667
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,480
I've failed as a mother.

668
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,360
Mom, what do you mean by that?

669
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,560
Qin Gang,

670
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,160
when will you finally grow up?

671
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Mom, don't worry.

672
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,220
I'm already a father. How can you say I haven't grown up?

673
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,120
Yang Ming.

674
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li.

675
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,080
(Yingyun)
