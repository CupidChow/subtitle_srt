00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm here today to share some good news with you.

3
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,640
Look what I brought you.

4
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,180
Let's have a good drink together.

5
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,640
Here.

6
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,080
This can is for you.

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,160
Come on, let's have the first one.

8
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,460
I haven't been this happy for a long time.

9
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,720
You know what?

10
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,400
That huge weight on my mind

11
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
has finally been lifted.

12
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,480
The judge said

13
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,360
Baobao will be in my custody until he turns 18.

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,450
No one can take him away from me now.

15
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,640
Actually, today I

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,329
wanted to discuss something with you.

17
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
I just wanted to

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,480
ask for your opinion.

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,690
What do you think

20
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,079
of him?

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,760
Really?

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,079
You think he's really great?

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,800
I think so too.

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,000
Although he's a bit older.

25
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,010
Sometimes he can be a bit moody,

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,160
but he's still nice to me, right?

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,840
Alright then.

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,600
So you agree?

29
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,540
I'll win him over tonight.

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,180
Cheers!

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,200
Xinxin, are you ready?

32
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,760
Ready.

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,840
Let's eat.

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,320
Hi, sir.

35
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,520
My name is Anna. What's yours?

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,400
Huaming.

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,520
Come here, baby.

38
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,400
Sit down.

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Listen to me.

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,200
Thank you for your help.

41
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,480
I am a woman.

42
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,280
And...

43
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,200
And...

44
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,079
And...

45
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
We are family.

46
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,920
Yes,

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,720
you make me feel the warmth of home.

48
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,720
Don't laugh. What are you laughing at?

49
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,320
No, can you speak Chinese?

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,400
No, I was just trying to be romantic.

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,720
I was just trying to express myself.

52
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
You're like family to me. I feel warm.

53
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,560
This is already very romantic.

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,700
Really, it is already very romantic.

55
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Did you understand what I just said?

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,760
Please sit down.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,400
Well, then I won't translate that.

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,360
Everything else is pretty good,

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,800
just the 'as home' part.

60
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,760
Just don't run 'as home' together when you read it.

61
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,520
I'll stop talking about it.

62
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,600
Come on, let's eat.

63
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,440
Even though you bought the steak,

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,640
I'm sure I'll like it.

65
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,760
Wait a moment.

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,480
As we always say, before eating

67
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,080
we should have a drink first.

68
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,280
Absolutely.

69
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
No sipping.

70
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,360
Bottoms up!

71
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,240
No big deal.

72
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Good.

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,240
Here's

74
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,320
the second glass.

75
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,040
Second round.

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,160
You're the one who got me back on the path of painting.

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,690
I should thank you for that.

78
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,160
Xinxin.

79
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,820
About you returning to painting,

80
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,840
you shouldn't be thanking me.

81
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
This is an investment for me.

82
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080
I've always believed

83
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,720
that you will be a great artist,

84
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
a famous painter,

85
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920
a renowned artist.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,720
You will definitely become one.

87
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
So your paintings will be worth a lot in the future.

88
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,560
By then, I'll be your agent.

89
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,480
As your agent,

90
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,760
when you sell your work for a lot of money,

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,159
I'll get my share of the profits.

92
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,120
You old fox,

93
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,400
why are you always like a thermos bottle?

94
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,640
Burning hot inside

95
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,720
but on the outside,

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,280
you act so serious.

97
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,920
Am I serious?

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,040
Anyway, let's drink up.

99
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
Look at what you're wearing.

100
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
Another one.

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
No big deal.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,800
Alright.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,760
Here.

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,800
Third glass.

105
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,520
For our little treasure,

106
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,560
we must have a drink.

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,620
You take such good care of him.

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,560
For our little treasure, I think we should drink this one too.

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Do you know why?

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,000
When I hold our little treasure,

111
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,280
I feel like I'm melting.

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,520
I am the most, most, most

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,260
happiest person in the world.

114
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,610
To our little treasure's healthy growth.

115
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,960
Here

116
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,000
old buddy.

117
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,720
One last drink.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,760
Okay.

119
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,840
Dad, I love you.

120
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,480
I told you today

121
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,480
that Huaming would drink with you tonight.

122
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,160
Could you toast my father?

123
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,200
My dad says he really likes you.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,960
Just have a drink with him, okay?

125
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,360
Alright.

126
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
I should stand up for this toast.

127
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,520
Uncle.

128
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,440
First, thank you for saying you like me.

129
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,400
And I also want to thank you

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,120
for raising Xinxin

131
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,120
such an angel-like daughter.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,840
And Xinxin gave birth to

133
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,880
an angel-like little boy.

134
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,920
Having them by my side

135
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,360
makes me feel extremely happy.

136
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,880
Rest assured, I'll take good care of them.

137
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,720
Uncle, wherever you are,

138
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,800
I wish you well.

139
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,200
Cheers to you.

140
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,520
Let's eat.

141
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,520
Cured pork.

142
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,720
Thank you.

143
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,360
Let me see what you have here.

144
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,840
Good, it looks beautiful.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,880
Alright,

146
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,200
let's eat.

147
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,640
Okay.

148
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,440
Good.

149
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,799
Although you bought this,

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,400
you arranged it all yourself.

151
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,440
So I

152
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,120
love eating it.

153
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,160
You caught me again.

154
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,140
I'll learn to make steak for you someday.

155
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,160
Stop drinking.

156
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,960
You're still thinking about Wan Xinxin.

157
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,720
I lost.

158
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,040
I was completely defeated by Wan Xinxin.

159
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
So you don't want to marry me either.

160
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Don't make things worse for me here.

161
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,280
I'm frustrated enough already.

162
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,480
Look at me. I'm a man.

163
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,040
I need some dignity when I'm with you.

164
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,480
So you must get the family inheritance.

165
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,000
That's not it.

166
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,200
I want to prove

167
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,680
my own personal abilities, okay?

168
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,960
I hope one day

169
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,920
you will look up to me.

170
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,840
Actually,

171
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,920
if your aunt really values children that much,

172
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,280
we could get married first.

173
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,960
We could have our own child.

174
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
Forget it.

175
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,460
Just this one child now

176
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,840
has already driven me crazy,

177
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,680
and you want another one?

178
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
You want to push me to a breakdown?

179
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,280
I'm already in a dead end now.

180
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,680
Stop coming up with these

181
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,160
ridiculous ideas, okay?

182
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,960
If you really want to help me,

183
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,120
then help me figure out

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,200
how to get the child back.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,120
You've barely eaten but drunk so much. That's enough, don't you think?

186
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Old bacon.

187
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,040
Do you remember

188
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,480
when we first met?

189
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,360
See, you don't even remember.

190
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,560
We first met on the beach.

191
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,040
You pretended to be a mermaid.

192
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Then you rescued me. Have you forgotten?

193
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,200
What mermaid?

194
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,720
No, no. The first time we met

195
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,600
wasn't on a beach with a mermaid.

196
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,160
It was in my, what's that vehicle called?

197
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,040
Dog car?

198
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,620
What dog car? Pet vehicle.

199
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
Pet vehicle.

200
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
You and Bao

201
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
were sitting in my trunk.

202
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,120
I didn't know you were in there.

203
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,520
Then I was driving.

204
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,530
Suddenly there was a voice saying,

205
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,050
'Could you close the window?' And I said, 'Sure.'

206
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,400
It scared me

207
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,880
to death.

208
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,450
No, really. Back then I thought

209
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,240
you were a vet driving a pet vehicle.

210
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,880
And I thought

211
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,320
you were so caring and kind. Really.

212
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm not a vet. I used to be a doctor,

213
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,800
but they said I was a murderer.

214
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Do you love me?

215
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,240
Do you love me?

216
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,760
Do you love me?

217
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,760
Do you love me?

218
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,960
Come on, finish this drink and I'll tell you.

219
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,760
No excuses.

220
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,560
Do you love me?

221
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,760
Do you love me?

222
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,760
Yes, I do.

223
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,320
My love for you is endless.

224
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,920
I don't want this.

225
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,840
I want to shout to the sky that I love you.

226
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,240
Not this, not this.

227
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,930
Do you really love me or not?

228
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,920
No, get up first.

229
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,520
Get up, please.

230
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,280
Do you love me or not?

231
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,320
Get up.

232
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,120
Get up.

233
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,880
You've been sitting here all night.

234
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,680
You're not talking properly.

235
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,280
Come here.

236
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,440
Maybe you need a smack first.

237
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,320
You bought so many things. What a waste.

238
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,920
Right? Even if you have money, you shouldn't waste it.

239
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,440
She's had three bottles of alcohol and hasn't eaten anything.

240
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,760
Do you love me?

241
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,680
What?

242
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,160
Do you love me?

243
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,520
Yes.

244
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,460
Where are we going?

245
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,460
Aren't we going to my room?

246
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,360
King-size bed.

247
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,640
What? What are you saying?

248
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,880
King-size bed.

249
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,720
Okay, king-size bed.

250
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,680
A room with a king-size bed.

251
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,540
Okay, a room with a king-size bed.

252
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,380
It bounced back again.

253
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,600
Wan Xinxin.

254
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,480
What's wrong?

255
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,200
I just remembered I didn't tell my sister

256
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,360
where I put the baby formula.

257
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Maybe we should go back and tell her.

258
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,480
That's easy.

259
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,360
Just call her.

260
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,160
No, let's go back.

261
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,400
Let's go.

262
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,640
How is it?

263
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,840
It looks pretty good.

264
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,440
This is too...

265
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,210
What's wrong with this one?

266
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,480
It looks really nice.

267
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
Too revealing.

268
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,140
What kind of taste is that?

269
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,320
This one is good.

270
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,880
This one is good.

271
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,600
Stop pretending. I saw you falling asleep.

272
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,280
I didn't.

273
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,800
I saw them all. That floral one, that one was too revealing.

274
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,960
This one is especially nice.

275
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,160
Fine, I'll try this one.

276
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,340
No falling asleep.

277
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,160
Come in.

278
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,680
Mr. Qin.

279
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,319
Mr. Qin.

280
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,839
Mr. Qin, are you feeling unwell?

281
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,880
Cut to the chase.

282
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,200
Mr. Qin, I'm reporting on my work.

283
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,220
Please take a look at this.

284
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,800
These are orders from three companies.

285
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,480
If this deal goes through,

286
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,319
our store's sales will double.

287
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,920
I believe in my abilities.

288
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,040
Mr. Qin, you've seen what I can do,

289
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,920
so when can I move to a new position?

290
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,520
Fine.

291
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Then I'll officially announce now.

292
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,080
You're fired.

293
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,960
Mr. Qin, you're joking with me again.

294
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,520
I'm not joking with you. I'm serious.

295
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,240
Let me tell you again.

296
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,480
You're fired.

297
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,200
Mr. Qin, you're the boss,

298
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,560
but you can't do this.

299
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,480
You're breaking your promise.

300
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,440
You said

301
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,440
if our sales doubled,

302
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,080
I could become the store manager.

303
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,240
I changed my mind.

304
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,520
Why?

305
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,040
Because you're Wan Xinxin's brother-in-law.

306
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
No, Mr. Qin,

307
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,520
this isn't fair. She's her and I'm me.

308
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm the boss, so I am fairness itself.

309
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,080
No, how can you do this?

310
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,040
Mr. Qin, please look at me.

311
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Go handle the handover immediately.

312
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,040
Your compensation will be handled according to policy.

313
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,560
No, Mr. Qin, you know these

314
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,040
these orders...

315
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,610
Let's go to that one.

316
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,000
Hurry up.

317
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,720
Xinxin.

318
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,480
What are you doing?

319
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,640
I'm sorry, miss.

320
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,570
I didn't know someone was in there.

321
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,320
Excuse me.

322
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Wan Xinxin.

323
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,120
Wan Xinxin.

324
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,880
How is it?

325
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,640
What do you mean?

326
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,920
There was another girl in there just now.

327
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,880
She almost had me arrested as a pervert.

328
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,610
Why act like a pervert when you have a girl at home?

329
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,360
Hurry.

330
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,880
There's a tag in the back that's really bothering me.

331
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,120
Help me take it out.

332
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,800
No, in this place you're really...

333
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,760
You're really...

334
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,560
If someone sees me putting my hand in there, they'll think...

335
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,520
Weren't you brave enough last night?

336
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,090
Last night I was drunk. That's enough.

337
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,360
So it was the alcohol that made you so forward?

338
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Alcohol gives courage to the timid.

339
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,640
Do you love me or not?

340
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,280
Come on, do you really want to talk about this here?

341
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,800
Yes.

342
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,880
You really want to discuss this here?

343
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,680
Yes.

344
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,840
You really want to talk about it here?

345
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,520
Fine then. Let's talk about it right here.

346
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,440
Wait, what are you doing?

347
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,960
What am I doing?

348
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,840
What do you mean? Why are you backing out now?

349
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,760
You were just acting all confident.

350
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,720
Come on.

351
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,440
Okay, okay. Phone, phone.

352
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,800
Hello?

353
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

354
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
What's wrong?

355
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,640
There's a critical patient at the hospital.

356
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,280
I need to get there immediately.

357
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,480
What about me?

358
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,360
Well, with all these things...

359
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,440
Take a taxi home.

360
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,400
I have to take a taxi alone?

361
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,320
I'll make it up to you.

362
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,080
But...

363
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,160
You're home early today.

364
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,000
What's wrong?

365
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,160
It's all because of your sister.

366
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,320
What about her?

367
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
Chunli.

368
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,520
Tell me, don't I work hard?

369
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,560
I'm so dedicated.

370
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
I drink with clients meal after meal.

371
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,480
I was throwing up the entire way home.

372
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,240
Why do I do it? For this family.

373
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,520
But

374
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,640
I got fired.

375
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,360
Qin Gang has gone too far.

376
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,200
Even if he doesn't get along with Xinxin,

377
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,560
work is work. He should separate the two.

378
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
I'll go talk to him.

379
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,720
Enough.

380
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,600
Chunli, sit down. Let's talk.

381
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,320
Go ahead.

382
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,400
This life has to end.

383
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's get divorced.

384
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,080
Why are you talking about divorce again?

385
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,200
So we argue sometimes.

386
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,960
Why bring up divorce?

387
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,760
What's the point of divorcing?

388
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,280
I've realized, Chunli,

389
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,360
as long as I

390
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,760
am involved with your family,

391
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
I'll never get ahead in life.

392
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,340
It's really like that.

393
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,720
So,

394
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
just sign the papers.

395
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,280
No. I won't sign.

396
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,610
I won't divorce you.

397
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,120
Whether you sign or not, we're getting divorced.

398
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,560
At worst, we'll separate for three years. After that,

399
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,020
we'll still get divorced.

400
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,480
It's your choice.

401
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,480
Kaiyang, please don't go.

402
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,660
Enough. I'm doing this for our child too.

403
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,000
You can even sell the house. I'll go along with whatever you want.

404
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,760
Please don't get a divorce.

405
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,040
Wherever you go, I'll follow.

406
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,200
We can rent a place and still make a life together.

407
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,400
Enough. This divorce is absolutely necessary.

408
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,000
If we don't separate, neither of us will be okay.

409
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,440
You and your sister are the bane of my existence.

410
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,800
It's not like that.

411
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,520
Haven't I told you before?

412
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,120
Qin Gang just wants the child to fight for the family inheritance.

413
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,240
Once he gets the inheritance, he'll marry Liu Wei.

414
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Liu Wei is behind all of this.

415
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,200
Liu Wei?

416
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
Qin Gang wants the child to fight for the inheritance.

417
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,840
And after he gets the inheritance?

418
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,280
He'll marry Liu Wei.

419
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,360
So you're saying Liu Wei...

420
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,080
If she helps Qin Gang get the child,

421
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,560
then she won't cause any more trouble?

422
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
You've got me completely confused.

423
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm going out for a while.

424
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,130
Where are you going?

425
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,680
We're not getting divorced.

426
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,080
Editor Liu.

427
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,560
You're Wan Xinxin's brother-in-law, right?

428
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,240
Yes.

429
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
What is it?

430
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,120
Can we talk in private?

431
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,240
Mr. Qin fired me.

432
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,040
What does that have to do with me?

433
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Of course it does.

434
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,520
I hope you can persuade him

435
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,370
to keep me on.

436
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,720
And after that,

437
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,400
I want to be the manager of this store.

438
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,500
I can't help you with that.

439
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,420
I'm not the manager of this store.

440
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,320
Mr. Liu.

441
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Look, I'm Wan Xinxin's brother-in-law.

442
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,080
It's like this. From what I understand, you want

443
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,400
to have a child, right?

444
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,440
I think I can help with that.

445
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,720
If Mr. Qin gets custody of the child, wouldn't

446
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,520
everything be easier to negotiate?

447
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,000
Who told you all this?

448
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,680
It's completely untrue.

449
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,880
And also,

450
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,760
I'm warning you. Don't harass me again.

451
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,360
How annoying!

452
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,520
Xinxin.

453
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,370
It's fine if I made too much and we can't finish it.

454
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
What are you doing?

455
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,400
Aren't you very busy?

456
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes.

457
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,840
I really wasn't running away, Xinxin.

458
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,120
The project situation was quite complicated.

459
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,800
And also,

460
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,120
there was a real emergency at the hospital. I had to leave.

461
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,960
I understand. I really do.

462
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,200
It's a matter of life and death.

463
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,880
I'm not that unreasonable.

464
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,640
Let me tell you,

465
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
you're warm inside and out,

466
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,240
like a little sun, so understanding.

467
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,760
That's exactly the kind of girl you are.

468
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,600
Enough. Stop flattering me.

469
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,810
I don't want to be that understanding.

470
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Really, Xinxin,

471
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
I'm really in a hurry here.

472
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,480
I need to prepare several plans.

473
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,080
No, no.

474
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,760
I finally understand

475
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,640
what Eileen Chang once said:

476
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,080
When you fall in love with someone,

477
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,640
you have to fall into the dust.

478
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,360
Yes, I admit it.

479
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,800
If there were more responsible doctors like you,

480
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,060
my father would have been fine back then.

481
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,200
Xinxin.

482
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,530
Go ahead with your work.

483
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,600
Huaming.

484
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,960
Senior, how did it go?

485
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,000
No problem.

486
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,120
The interventional surgery was very successful.

487
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,400
Almost all the backup plans were used.

488
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,800
A master is always a master.

489
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,560
Huaming, I'm impressed.

490
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,920
That's good.

491
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,480
I believe you'll always overcome difficulties.

492
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,040
In the future, the position of lead surgeon

493
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,580
will definitely be yours.

494
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
No one can surpass you.

495
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:37,440
I'm telling you, I'm always so happy to see you.

496
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,570
Does that make me seem materialistic?

497
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,200
As an artist, if you talk like that,

498
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,850
it's quite inappropriate.

499
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,840
But as a woman,

500
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,000
there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.

501
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,960
I've transferred the remaining payment to you.

502
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,160
I got it, Xiaoyu.

503
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,680
This is a domestic order.

504
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,640
This client keeps asking to meet you in person.

505
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,800
I told him you already have a boyfriend.

506
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,920
Oh, don't do that!

507
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,720
What if he's really handsome?

508
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,200
He is quite good-looking actually.

509
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,000
See?

510
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,440
He's 63 this year.

511
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,960
Then... then you can have him.

512
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,760
You should just treat your boyfriend well, okay?

513
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,640
I have good news today. Want to hear it?

514
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,080
Hurry up!

515
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,680
I heard from my brother that

516
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,920
his surgery today was successful.

517
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,280
Why don't you quickly prepare

518
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,040
a candlelit dinner to celebrate?

519
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,920
Really?

520
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,120
Yes, really!

521
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,720
Xiaoyu, could you watch the gallery for me?

522
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,040
I need to get home right away.

523
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,640
If there are no customers, just close the shop.

524
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,840
Thank you. Thank you.

525
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,120
Let's go, darling.

526
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,240
I'll go first then.

527
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,040
Go ahead. Go ahead.

528
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,000
Bye-bye.

529
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,720
Don't worry.

530
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,360
I'll sell this painting secretly later.

531
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,160
Sell it if you want. I don't care.

532
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,240
Xinxin.

533
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,600
Congratulations, Dr. Hua.

534
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,160
Congratulations on your successful surgery.

535
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,760
Oh right, I brought champagne.

536
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,080
It's so heavy.

537
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,450
Your darling is asleep.

538
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,050
I've already sent my darling to my sister's place. Here.

539
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,440
Xinxin.

540
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,520
I have a bit of a headache today. I can't drink.

541
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,040
Let's do it another day.

542
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,960
Come on, don't be such a killjoy.

543
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,680
The surgery was successful.

544
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,690
I'll take a shower and go to bed.

545
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,360
I know, I know. Xinxin.

546
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,600
No, what's wrong with you?

547
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,760
Wasn't your surgery quite successful today?

548
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,440
The surgery was successful.

549
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,840
But it had nothing to do with me.

550
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,170
I only prepared the surgical plan.

551
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,840
Even that was just Dr. Chen being nice to me.

552
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,080
Anyone could have done it.

553
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,200
Until now,

554
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,440
I'm still just

555
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,960
a useless doctor who can't hold a scalpel.

556
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,800
Everyone goes through this phase.

557
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,520
It's okay.

558
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,000
It will get better gradually. Trust me.

559
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,810
I know you believe in me,

560
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,200
but I don't believe in myself.

561
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,040
I'm like a chef

562
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,400
who has lost his sense of smell.

563
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Like a basketball player who has lost his legs.

564
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,730
I still have the nerve to go to work at the hospital every day.

565
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,720
It's shameless.

566
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,680
I just want to tell you,

567
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,360
whether you can recover or not,

568
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,880
in my heart,

569
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,960
you're always the best.

570
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,640
You're just like my darling now,

571
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,680
both of you are the most important to me.

572
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,720
The thing is,

573
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,320
I love you so much.

574
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,040
What are you doing?

575
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,370
I need to take this call.

576
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,920
Hello?

577
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,840
You're back.

578
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,760
Xinxin.

579
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Xinxin.

580
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,159
What's wrong now?

581
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,600
Pouting like a little pig.

582
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,000
Acting like a hipster from the 90s generation?

583
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,400
I am from the 90s generation.

584
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,640
I am a hipster.

585
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,400
Fine, hipster from the 90s.

586
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,210
Just bear with it for a few days.

587
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,800
I don't agree.

588
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,640
Why do I have to pretend to be a tenant?

589
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Look, she's just a child.

590
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,600
She needs time to accept this, right?

591
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,880
You're divorced from your ex-wife, aren't you?

592
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,480
So am I now

593
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,680
your legitimate girlfriend?

594
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,640
Yes.

595
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,400
Then why are you being so secretive about it?

596
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,800
Making me feel like I'm the other woman.

597
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,600
No, why would you say something so harsh?

598
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Xia Qing actually has

599
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,720
a boyfriend in America and they were about to get married.

600
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,600
But Ruirui ruined it.

601
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,640
You don't want our relationship

602
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,170
to be killed in its infancy, do you?

603
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,360
Your daughter...

604
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,800
Wait, the way you describe her,

605
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,920
she sounds like a little demon.

606
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,680
Well, let's do this.

607
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,400
Try not to meet her.

608
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,720
If you do meet, follow my lead.

609
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,370
So treat me like I'm invisible?

610
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,120
Keep me silent, right?

611
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,320
Silence is golden.

612
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,080
Come on, let me tell you.

613
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,320
If I don't explode in silence, I'll perish in silence.

614
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,680
You'll be in trouble.

615
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,720
Yes, I'll be in trouble.

616
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,120
Because you're like a big pancake wrap.

617
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,600
You're my most delicious pancake wrap.

618
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,480
Before I finish this pancake,

619
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
I need to make you Mrs. Hua.

620
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,440
Dream on.

621
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,730
Don't be angry anymore.

622
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,660
Well, I'll go pick them up now.

623
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,480
They don't live here.

624
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,920
What are you talking about? How could they stay here?

625
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,880
This place is for us.

626
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,010
I've booked a hotel.

627
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,680
At least you have some conscience.

628
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,640
Let's go.

629
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,600
Tell me now.

630
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,080
What am I to you?

631
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,840
Come closer.

632
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,120
Friend.

633
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,800
What?

634
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,520
Girlfriend.

635
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,240
That's more like it.

636
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
Muah.

637
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,880
Let's go.

638
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,840
What are you

639
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,160
doing?

640
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
What do you think?

641
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,700
I'm changing clothes to pick them up.

642
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,440
Attention all those meeting passengers.

643
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,920
Flights from New York, San Francisco and Shanghai

644
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,120
arriving in Beijing.

645
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,040
Hey.

646
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm at the parking lot. Where are you?

647
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Put your hands up.

648
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,400
Okay.

649
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
Turn around.

650
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,080
Slowly.

651
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,520
Okay.

652
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,760
Slowly.

653
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,800
Okay.

654
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,520
Alright.

655
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,530
Sweetheart.

656
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,640
Daddy, you should lie down like a mermaid.

657
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,120
I love you.

658
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,960
Daddy.

659
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,360
Daddy.

660
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,320
Daddy.

661
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,960
Daddy, I missed you.

662
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,920
I missed you too.

663
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,760
I missed you so much.

664
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,480
Daddy,

665
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,160
Mom is over there.

666
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,160
Mom.

667
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Long time no see.

668
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,050
You're looking more energetic than ever.

669
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,680
Men and women are just different.

670
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,760
Men bloom at forty,

671
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
unlike women,

672
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,000
who go downhill after thirty.

673
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,600
Your dad is in his prime now.

674
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,640
Must have lots of girls chasing him.

675
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,370
Daddy, you can't date anyone else.

676
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,210
Besides, Mom and I are back now.

677
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,220
So we should be together forever,

678
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,560
okay?

679
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,840
Good. Ruirui, from now on,

680
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,280
we'll always stay with Daddy, okay?

681
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,440
Okay.

682
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,360
Ruirui, watch out for cars.

683
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,200
Tell me about your girlfriend.

684
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,440
You still think you can hide it from me?

685
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,240
After all these years,

686
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,360
nothing escapes my eyes.

687
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,360
The moment I saw you at the airport,

688
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I knew you were in love with someone.

689
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,140
You didn't tell me because you were afraid I'd mind, right?

690
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,180
It's because Ruirui was here.

691
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,780
Do you still have feelings for me?

692
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,560
Xia Qing.

693
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,760
When you left with Ruirui back then,

694
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,880
I think we made everything clear.

695
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,200
So now,

696
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,920
I don't need to explain anything to you, right?

697
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,840
Has your hand not recovered yet?

698
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,600
Let's go. Ruirui is waiting.

699
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,280
We're here.

700
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,330
You little piggy, you've gotten so heavy now.

701
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,400
We'll stay here.

702
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,200
Please take our luggage to room 1201.

703
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,000
Sure.

704
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,520
Dad, we haven't been home for years.

705
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,200
And you're making me stay in this cold hotel?

706
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,520
Is this hotel cold?

707
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,400
This is a very upscale hotel, okay?

708
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,440
Don't you want to stay in a suite?

709
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,360
Dad booked a really beautiful suite.

710
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
The benefits of staying in a hotel:

711
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,720
First, you don't have to clean up yourself.

712
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,880
Second, whatever food you want,

713
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,800
you can order anytime. Isn't that great?

714
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,760
But I want to eat what my dad cooks.

715
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,700
Did you really sell the house?

716
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,440
You said you were selling the house

717
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,000
to come find us in America.

718
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,280
Didn't you say

719
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,140
you were going to get your medical license in the US?

720
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,820
Dad has some things he can't get away from right now.

721
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,280
If you can't get away,

722
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,340
then I should stay with you even more.

723
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,560
Dad, please take me and mom home.

724
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,420
We can cook for you together. Wouldn't that be nice?

725
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,420
Let's listen to our child.

726
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,810
I don't like staying in hotels either.

727
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,040
Right now, there's nowhere for us to go back to.

728
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,880
Where are you living now?

729
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,840
An apartment.

730
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,090
Wang Yaping.

731
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,140
Li Wengang.

732
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:50,770
Qiaohua.

733
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,640
(Yeng Yun)
