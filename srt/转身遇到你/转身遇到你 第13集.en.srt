1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,920
Durian cake

3
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,320
Durian cake

4
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
Durian cake

5
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,920
Auntie, I never eat durian cake.

6
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,180
How can that be?

7
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,160
Xiaogang told me

8
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,920
your favorite soup is black chicken soup

9
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,240
and your favorite dessert is durian cake.

10
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,120
He doesn't know me at all.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,960
I never eat either of those things.

12
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,160
He doesn't know me. I never eat them.

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,090
But these are Lao Hua's favorites.

14
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,760
Come on, Hua, have a bite.

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,730
I love durian cake so much, Auntie.

16
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,560
Is it good?

17
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,280
Auntie?

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,160
Auntie, this durian cake is delicious!

19
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,450
Where did you buy it?

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,320
Give it to me.

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
What's wrong?

22
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
It's so delicious!

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,079
Auntie, please tell me where you bought it.

24
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,200
I want to save some for a midnight snack.

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
I need to go to the kitchen to throw up.

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,600
No, my free-range chicken soup will be ready soon.

27
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,079
Xinxin.

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
Don't see me off. You should go back.

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,520
Okay, auntie. Take care.

30
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Xinxin, how about

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,890
we go shopping together tomorrow?

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,620
What a coincidence. I've already made plans for tomorrow.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,370
Where are you going?

34
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,760
I'm taking Bao to the amusement park.

35
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,370
Amusement park?

36
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,600
The one with roller coasters?

37
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,260
And pirate ships, Ferris wheels.

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,440
We didn't have these things when I was young.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,200
I've always wondered

40
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,240
what's so fun about them.

41
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,180
I'll go with you tomorrow.

42
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,720
No, it's dangerous and high.

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,660
People your age don't dare to ride those.

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,340
What's there to be afraid of? I'm going with you.

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,360
Fine.

46
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,079
I'll be going now.

47
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,920
Mister.

48
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,240
Help me up.

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,490
Are you okay?

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,640
Sit down, please.

51
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,800
I'm so sorry.

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,930
I never thought a durian cake would...

53
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,700
I won't mention it.

54
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,960
Please don't be like this. It's my fault.

55
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,159
I'll work like a slave to take care of you.

56
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,040
My lady,

57
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,600
no, I'll kowtow to you.

58
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,530
You don't need to slave away for me.

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,640
Just don't mention those words again.

60
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,300
And that auntie won't be coming anymore, right?

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
She still has to come.

62
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Still coming?

63
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,280
Tomorrow.

64
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,560
Tomorrow we both need to go to the amusement park with her.

65
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,800
Amusement park? What amusement park?

66
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,000
Why do we need to go to an amusement park?

67
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,800
I just walked her downstairs.

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,160
She invited me to go shopping tomorrow.

69
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,920
Then I said that you and I were going to the amusement park.

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,800
I thought she wouldn't want to join us,

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,330
but she wants to come along.

72
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,120
You should have just agreed to go shopping with her.

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,780
At the amusement park, there'll be all those...

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,880
Ferris wheels and roller coasters.

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,960
What's the point of that?

76
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,220
But that's so much fun!

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,690
Most men are afraid of heights.

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,810
You're not scared, are you?

79
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm afraid of durian cakes.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,760
Just look at my physical condition.

81
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,560
How could I be afraid of heights?

82
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,180
So that settles it.

83
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,560
Let me tell you.

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,360
It's just too childish.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,800
You already agreed to act for me.

86
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,920
See it through to the end.

87
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,600
You promised me.

88
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,640
Please put up with it one more time.

89
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,400
Besides, I haven't gone out for fun in ages.

90
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,159
Fine.

91
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,280
I'll agree to go with you,

92
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,520
but you...

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,680
When you go on the rides,

94
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,800
I'll just watch you from below.

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,460
How's that?

96
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,040
Should I throw away that durian cake or keep it?

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,520
Wan Xinxin!

98
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:08,980
I'll go.

99
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,520
Could you do me a favor and take that...

100
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,800
that durian cake in the fridge,

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,460
either throw it away or eat it.

102
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,640
Mom, your shoulder is so stiff.

103
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,760
Please don't run around all day.

104
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,690
It's too tiring.

105
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm running around

106
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,880
only because I have to clean up your mess.

107
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,400
If you didn't treat marriage like a game,

108
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,920
would I have to work so hard?

109
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
I'm just worried about you.

110
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,940
If you care about me, go yourself.

111
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,840
Fine, I'll go.

112
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,220
and watch them showing off their love in front of me.

113
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,340
You think they truly love each other?

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,260
They're just putting on a show for me.

115
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,420
They think I can't see through it.

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,920
I want to see

117
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,980
how long they can keep up this act.

118
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,960
Mom, why do this?

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,960
Just let her have the child if it comes to that.

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
You can visit him whenever you want.

121
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,480
Why do you have to take him away?

122
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,400
Nonsense!

123
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,920
Your father

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,520
abandoned us just like this.

125
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,220
I still hate him for it.

126
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,120
So I don't want someday

127
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,370
your child to hate you the same way.

128
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,440
We can't just keep walking around like this.

129
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
Auntie, let's go on that ride.

130
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,290
The pirate ship.

131
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,180
Yes, Auntie. Let's try it.

132
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,360
It's really fun.

133
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,250
Let's go.

134
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
No, no, no.

135
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,360
Please don't.

136
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,960
What's wrong?

137
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,240
At my age, I'm scared.

138
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,120
You two go ahead.

139
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll sit here and wait for you.

140
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,320
Alright, fine.

141
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,780
Go on. Leave your bag here.

142
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,040
Okay. Xinxin,

143
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
I'll stay here with Auntie. You go enjoy yourself.

144
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,320
Wait, why are you staying here?

145
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,680
Go have fun by yourself. I'll keep Auntie company for a while.

146
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,840
Come with me, will you?

147
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,600
I'm not going.

148
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,280
Hey.

149
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,490
Please come.

150
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,320
Let's go.

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,160
No.

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,100
Come on.

153
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,440
We're leaving, auntie.

154
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,040
Okay. I'll wait for you here.

155
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,600
Hey.

156
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,640
What's wrong?

157
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
I think my blood pressure

158
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,780
might be a bit high. It's nothing.

159
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,800
It's okay.

160
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,720
You're fine now.

161
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,000
And you said you weren't scared.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,330
Look at you, your head is covered in sweat.

163
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,080
It's over.

164
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,460
Why are you holding me?

165
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,890
Are you okay?

166
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,490
Oh my god!

167
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,320
You're sweating so much.

168
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,840
What's wrong?

169
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,960
Did Xu Ke send me a message?

170
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's go back.

171
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:24,960
Okay.

172
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,520
We haven't taken a selfie yet.

173
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,920
Let's take one together.

174
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,820
We've already finished the ride.

175
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,970
Make a peace sign and smile.

176
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,320
Auntie!

177
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,260
Auntie!

178
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,320
Huaming!

179
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,580
How did you get in such a state?

180
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,610
Please sit down.

181
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,840
Well,

182
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,360
I used to ride these a lot but now I don't,

183
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,560
so I got temporary high blood pressure.

184
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,080
I wanted to take a photo of you two earlier,

185
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,040
but you were far away and moving around,

186
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,160
I was afraid it wouldn't turn out well.

187
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,640
Why don't I take one for you now?

188
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,200
That's not necessary, Auntie.

189
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,660
We just took many selfies.

190
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,280
Well,

191
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,600
how can selfies be better than photos taken by someone else?

192
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't you trust my skills?

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,640
No, no.

194
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,360
Thank you for your help, Auntie.

195
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,720
Yes, let Auntie take the photo.

196
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
Here, Auntie. Thank you.

197
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,540
Auntie, please include the pirate ship in the background.

198
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,200
You two aren't close enough.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,720
Peace!

200
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,880
Done.

201
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Thank you, Auntie.

202
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,860
Take a look.

203
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,480
Thank you, Auntie.

204
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
It's great.

205
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,340
Thank you, Auntie.

206
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,240
Not intimate enough.

207
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,360
We're taking it step by step, Mrs. Qin.

208
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,080
Where are you?

209
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,080
Lonely shadow.

210
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,880
Wait a moment.

211
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,080
Okay.

212
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,010
Still not intimate enough.

213
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,560
In my opinion, it's still not intimate enough.

214
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,440
Mrs. Qin, you asked for intimacy, so here it comes.

215
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
I don't know if you can accept this.

216
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,720
Where are you going?

217
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't let the transparent mirror shatter all over the ground.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,660
Mrs. Qin, we're starting now.

219
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,880
I can't be without you.

220
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,120
Can I hold you tight?

221
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,480
Don't let such beautiful scenery lose its meaning.

222
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I can't be without you.

223
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
If we're kissing, don't make a sound.

224
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,560
How is Mrs. Qin supposed to film this?

225
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,880
Who's breathing so loudly?

226
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,280
Because of you, I have memories.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,600
I love you.

228
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,210
That's enough. That'll do.

229
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,100
Please come in.

230
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,240
Sis,

231
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,640
you're back.

232
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,690
Have some water.

233
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,600
This is the baby's grandmother.

234
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,640
I know.

235
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,920
Mrs. Qin, have you been well lately?

236
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,840
I'm doing fine.

237
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,280
I need to thank you

238
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,700
for taking care of our baby all this time.

239
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
You're too kind.

240
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,080
We're family, no need for such formalities.

241
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,410
I'll go make dinner now.

242
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,680
Sis, don't work too hard.

243
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,960
I've prepared all the soup ingredients.

244
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,490
They just need to be boiled.

245
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,320
No need.

246
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,340
We don't need to make soup.

247
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,080
While you were playing earlier,

248
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
I already called someone to make the soup.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,080
It'll be delivered soon.

250
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,800
What kind of soup did you order, ma'am?

251
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,930
Black chicken soup.

252
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,120
Black chicken soup.

253
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,560
Ma'am, I know you brought this black chicken soup

254
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,920
not because I like it,

255
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,520
but because Xinxin likes it.

256
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,600
However,

257
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,680
I want to make it clear that from now on,

258
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,120
I'll be making all of Xinxin's soups myself.

259
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,800
He can cook?

260
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,980
My cooking is delicious. Ask Xinxin.

261
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,140
He's such a caring guy.

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,530
Go ahead.

263
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Alright. Please have a seat, ma'am.

264
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Auntie, please have a seat here.

265
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,400
The soup is ready!

266
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,920
Here.

267
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,480
Auntie, try my cooking.

268
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,540
Careful, it's hot.

269
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:34,960
Okay.

270
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
Try the dishes first.

271
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,290
Huaming.

272
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,720
Your cooking is really good. Delicious.

273
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,040
These are all dishes

274
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,970
that Xinxin particularly enjoys.

275
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,720
You take such good care of me every day.

276
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,160
I wish you were my own daughter.

277
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,040
Why don't you just treat her

278
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,500
as your own daughter then?

279
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,680
No, that would be too confusing.

280
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,000
Alright, I've had a taste.

281
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
I should be going now.

282
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,760
Please don't go, auntie. You've barely eaten anything.

283
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,220
I've been thinking today.

284
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,700
I've been causing you trouble all this time.

285
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,360
Not only have you never complained,

286
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,560
but you've treated me with such warmth.

287
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,160
To be honest, I'm already very content.

288
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm tired from playing today.

289
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,400
Sorry, I'll head back first.

290
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,890
Auntie, let me walk you out.

291
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,640
Mrs. Qin, take care.

292
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,080
Xinxin.

293
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,520
Huaming is a thoughtful person.

294
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,080
I can see that.

295
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,370
To be honest,

296
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,440
with him taking care of you and the baby,

297
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,700
I feel quite relieved.

298
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,720
But no matter what,

299
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,890
you still need a proper family.

300
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,370
With his financial situation,

301
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
how can he marry you?

302
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,530
How will he support you and your child?

303
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,320
So I still hope you

304
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,780
think about it carefully.

305
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,570
As I've said before,

306
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,520
my door is always open to you.

307
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,440
You can come back anytime.

308
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,490
Go on now.

309
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,040
Take care, Auntie.

310
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,000
Mom, you're finally back.

311
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,800
Haven't I already told you

312
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,530
not to worry about this matter?

313
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,320
I've already made the first move,

314
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,980
but she won't give me a chance.

315
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,900
If you want to win Xinxin back,

316
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,740
you really need to put in some effort.

317
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,240
Outdo that Huaming, understand?

318
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,760
Mom, did I hear you right?

319
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,040
Why does it sound like

320
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,770
you're taking Huaming's side?

321
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,640
This Huaming is just

322
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,080
a calculating older man.

323
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,930
He just plays mind games and sweet-talks,

324
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,120
and Wan Xinxin actually believes him.

325
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,240
Easy for you to say.

326
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,360
I've seen it with my own eyes.

327
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,660
He takes such good care of Wan Xinxin,

328
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,200
and he's extremely attentive.

329
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,560
His behavior

330
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,080
All women would appreciate

331
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,680
and gladly accept.

332
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,360
These are clearly things you should be doing.

333
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,800
I just don't understand.

334
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,840
How is Xinxin worse than Liu Wei?

335
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,380
She's kind, innocent, and sensible.

336
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,770
Of course, she has her little tempers sometimes.

337
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,520
But that's hardly a flaw.

338
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,300
The key point is she's the child's birth mother.

339
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,520
You need to pay attention.

340
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,940
Hurry up and find a way to win her back.

341
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,160
If you wait any longer,

342
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,890
she'll really become Huaming's woman, you know?

343
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,370
Who is it?

344
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,490
Why are you here?

345
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,170
Look at the state you're living in.

346
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,920
I'm getting by.

347
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,880
Come on. I'm here to help you out.

348
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,080
No need.

349
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,280
Ming already gave me a card.

350
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,210
That card is for paying back interest.

351
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,280
How will you manage in the meantime?

352
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,210
Eating instant noodles every day?

353
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
I told you I can make do.

354
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,640
Make do? You can't compromise with your health.

355
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Health is your most valuable asset.

356
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,840
Or as you'd say, health is essential for picking up girls.

357
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,810
You might die before Shi Lu even chases after you.

358
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,330
And no one would even know how you died.

359
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,800
Well...

360
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,840
You're giving me all your money.

361
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,500
It's a loan.

362
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,520
If you lend me all your money, what about you?

363
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,520
I'll manage. Just be frugal.

364
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,090
What about the baby formula money?

365
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,770
Alright, stop being dramatic.

366
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
I still have money for baby formula.

367
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,960
Take this money and buy yourself some decent food.

368
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,290
I'm going home to check on the baby now.

369
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:09,920
Um...

370
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,600
Isn't Ming watching the baby?

371
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,160
So...

372
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,080
How about I treat you to a late-night snack?

373
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,940
I'll take you out for skewers.

374
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,820
Never mind.

375
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,210
You're really treating Hua Ming like a nanny.

376
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,850
I'm leaving.

377
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,530
Spend it wisely.

378
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,480
Thank you.

379
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,700
I'm so thirsty in the middle of the night and can't find water to drink.

380
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,290
What's with that phone call

381
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,120
last night? You were talking past 3 AM.

382
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,800
Who was it?

383
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,560
Well, the situation is...

384
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,120
After drinking too much last night,

385
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,800
when everyone got home,

386
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,850
we just checked in with each other.

387
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,680
Was it Mr. Qian? CEO Qian?

388
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,040
Yes, CEO Qian.

389
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,320
Stop lying.

390
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,960
I just made up a random name

391
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,360
and you took the bait.

392
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,320
Made up?

393
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,120
What a coincidence!

394
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,800
The CEO we were drinking with last night

395
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,660
is actually surnamed Qian. His name is Qian Duoduo.

396
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Fine, I'll give him a call then.

397
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,200
No, you can't. If you make that call,

398
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,600
the business deal will be ruined.

399
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,720
It would be embarrassing.

400
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,840
Then you call him.

401
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,840
Xu Chunli, you can't do this.

402
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,410
Don't touch my phone without permission.

403
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,500
Do you understand?

404
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,140
Let it go if you can. If not,

405
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
hand over your bank card.

406
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,960
What the hell?

407
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,300
He always gets the upper hand.

408
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,040
I'm wrong again.

409
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:36,960
Hello?

410
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,120
Hey honey.

411
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,600
I don't have anything planned tonight.

412
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
I'll come home early.

413
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,680
So...

414
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,880
Could you make some braised pork for me?

415
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,320
Add extra sugar. Make it sweet.

416
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,880
What for?

417
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,680
What else? To eat.

418
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,210
We can have some drinks together tonight.

419
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
Why are you suddenly in the mood for drinks?

420
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,740
No, there's actually a reason to celebrate.

421
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,400
I got my bonus.

422
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,680
You're giving me such a big surprise.

423
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,340
I don't know if I can handle it.

424
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,210
This is just the beginning.

425
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
So there's an even bigger surprise coming?

426
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Alright.

427
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,960
I'm busy now so I have to go.

428
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,320
See you tonight, okay?

429
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,060
Here, try this.

430
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,120
This one should be to your taste.

431
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,530
Did we run out of dark soy sauce?

432
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,840
I added more already.

433
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,280
The color isn't dark enough.

434
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,080
This braised pork needs a certain color.

435
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,610
It needs to be deep and rich.

436
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,140
Otherwise, it's not appetizing.

437
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,420
Well...

438
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,000
Didn't you say you'd give me a surprise?

439
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,640
What surprise?

440
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,480
You said so yourself.

441
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,400
I did?

442
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,440
I said this was your surprise for me.

443
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,120
You said this was just the beginning.

444
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,520
I asked if there was an even bigger surprise coming.

445
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,380
And you agreed.

446
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,360
I agreed? What did I agree to?

447
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,400
Let me tell you something. Life is just...

448
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
about living ordinary days.

449
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,200
There aren't that many surprises.

450
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,320
Hurry up and eat. We need to sleep after dinner.

451
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,850
I have an important client meeting tomorrow.

452
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:31,920
You...

453
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,660
Say that again.

454
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,690
What do you mean?

455
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,050
Are you having one of your episodes again?

456
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Just eat your dinner.

457
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,560
Then tell me,

458
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,730
what were you doing at that clothing store today?

459
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,960
What clothing store?

460
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,920
Stop pretending.

461
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
I took pictures of you there.

462
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,200
Xu Chunli, you followed me?

463
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,780
You followed me again. What are you trying to do?

464
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,920
Do you know what's most important between husband and wife?

465
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,780
You don't know.

466
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:05,920
Trust.

467
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,610
If there's no trust,

468
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,720
whether we stay together or not,

469
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
I really don't care anymore.

470
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,560
You... you're threatening me with divorce?

471
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,440
I'm not threatening you.

472
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,160
I'm serious.

473
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,440
Hello, Lady Company.

474
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,840
Mr. Shi, I only have one week.

475
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
If I can't see Wan Xinxin,

476
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,290
then we're done.

477
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,370
You know her personality well.

478
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,050
Then figure something out.

479
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,440
You think I really care about

480
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,640
that stupid car show?

481
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,560
What I care about is Wan Xinxin.

482
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
I need to see her.

483
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,410
I need to see her regularly.

484
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,160
Fine, I'll try again.

485
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,040
But how the meeting goes is between you two.

486
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,890
I'm only responsible for getting her to meet you.

487
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,560
Alright.

488
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,440
Come in.

489
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,720
I actually wanted to see you too.

490
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,960
Who do you think you are to speak to me like that?

491
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,680
What did I do?

492
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
You walked in here with an attitude.

493
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,080
You're doing the same thing.

494
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,360
You look upset too.

495
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,900
Go close the car show deal.

496
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,250
Pay back what you owe me.

497
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,300
No, Mr. Shi.

498
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,960
Are you insisting

499
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,680
that I work on this car show project?

500
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,040
Yes.

501
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,340
If that's the case,

502
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,600
then I'm really sorry.

503
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,760
I have no choice.

504
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,040
I can't sell my dignity

505
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,160
for a project.

506
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,850
Don't you agree?

507
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,120
I'll find a way to pay you back what I owe.

508
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,050
I'm leaving now.

509
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,160
I got fired.

510
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,440
What else could I do? Wait for her to fire me?

511
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,400
What am I going to do without you?

512
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,290
I won't receive yellow roses anymore.

513
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,420
You heartless person!

514
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,960
I thought you'd miss me.

515
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,880
Dream on.

516
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,840
But don't worry.

517
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,290
Someone's thinking about you.

518
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,770
Bye-bye.

519
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,340
Who sent me these flowers?

520
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,260
Liu Beibei.

521
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,250
These yellow roses are for you.

522
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,560
Thank you.

523
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,940
No, I mean the yellow roses I gave you before.

524
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
You don't need to bring me flowers every day.

525
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,240
And stop pressuring me

526
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,970
to take on your boring project.

527
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,360
Just so you know, I quit.

528
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,800
No, no, wait.

529
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,440
Why did you quit? Don't be impulsive.

530
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,120
I wanted you to take this project

531
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,320
just to help boost your performance

532
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,600
and earn more money.

533
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,640
Of course, I also wanted to see you more often.

534
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,040
Well, I'm sorry,

535
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,840
but I can't fulfill your wishes.

536
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't have time to play games with you every day.

537
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,960
Seeing you now just makes me feel suffocated.

538
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
No, please don't.

539
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,330
Don't be angry, Xinxin.

540
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,080
I know some of the things I did before

541
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,320
were really inappropriate.

542
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,050
I feel very guilty about it.

543
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,320
So I hope you can give me a chance

544
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,520
to make it up to you.

545
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,440
What's wrong with you? Been reading romance novels lately?

546
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,720
Aren't you embarrassed saying such things at your age?

547
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,120
Fine.

548
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,500
Let's get to something more practical then.

549
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,040
There's a car in the garage. This year's model.

550
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,880
You've been taking the bus to work,

551
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,480
which must be quite uncomfortable.

552
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,640
You should drive instead.

553
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,160
I've already quit. What do I need a car for?

554
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,980
Well, you can still use it in your daily life.

555
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,490
If you had done this six months ago,

556
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,120
I would have been moved to tears.

557
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,480
But now,

558
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,400
nothing you do can make up for it.

559
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,130
In my heart, you're just a jerk.

560
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,360
Xinxin, how can you be so cold-hearted?

561
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,020
I'm being ruthless

562
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,540
because your character is terrible.

563
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,600
Car.

564
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,660
Stop following me.

565
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,920
Hello.

566
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,480
Shi Lu.

567
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,410
Hello, Miss Shi.

568
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,380
Please have a seat.

569
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,200
I wasn't sure what you'd like to drink. Is this okay?

570
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,880
Thank you.

571
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,200
Xu Ke gave you my number.

572
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,240
Yes.

573
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,840
Since you have my phone number,

574
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,100
why couldn't we just talk over the phone?

575
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
I'm here to ask for your help.

576
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,600
You know our company

577
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,060
is negotiating a partnership with Qin Gang's 4S store, right?

578
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,120
I've heard something about it.

579
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,010
I'll get straight to the point.

580
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,210
Qin Gang specifically wants Wan Xinxin to handle this project.

581
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,420
Otherwise, he won't work with us.

582
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,450
But Wan Xinxin absolutely refuses to take it.

583
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,520
I want you to help persuade Wan Xinxin.

584
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,120
Our company really needs this project.

585
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,120
I believe Wan Xinxin needs this project too

586
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,690
to prove her abilities.

587
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,880
Well, Miss Shi Lu.

588
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,560
I don't really know much

589
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,160
about your company's situation.

590
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,200
But Wan Xinxin is doing very well right now.

591
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,770
I don't think she needs to prove anything.

592
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,660
You're her friend.

593
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,800
Don't you want her to make money?

594
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,200
Of course I do.

595
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,860
I think making money is great,

596
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,240
but this involves her ex-husband.

597
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,000
So I think it's not appropriate for you to say too much,

598
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,860
or for me either. Don't you agree?

599
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,040
I'm just thinking of her too.

600
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,920
I understand.

601
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,440
You also want what's best for her.

602
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,600
How about this -

603
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
let her make her own decision, okay?

604
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,160
Fine.

605
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
By the way, since you're here,

606
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,810
I have something I'd like to say to you.

607
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,460
But I'm not sure if it's appropriate.

608
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,160
What is it?

609
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,720
Xu Ke borrowed money to buy you a necklace,

610
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,520
and then something happened.

611
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,720
Of course, I may not know Xu Ke very well,

612
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,760
but from our brief interactions,

613
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,600
I feel that Xu Ke is

614
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
a very emotionally sincere person.

615
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,000
He really likes you.

616
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,600
So if you think he's right for you,

617
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
you should tell him.

618
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,040
Or if he's not right for you, tell him that too.

619
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,370
I'm mainly worried that

620
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,720
if things continue like this, something bad will happen.

621
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,620
Who told you this? Was it Xu Ke?

622
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,540
Let me tell you,

623
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,160
it's not appropriate for you to meddle in my affairs either.

624
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,760
Yes, yes.

625
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:08,920
Take care.

626
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,960
Alright, now

627
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,560
let's proudly present

628
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,210
our third auction item.

629
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,560
According to the description here,

630
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,960
it's a sapphire necklace from South Africa.

631
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,400
South Africa.

632
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,530
Miss, let me take a look at this.

633
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,920
This looks familiar.

634
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,640
This was recently

635
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,320
sold at another auction.

636
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,600
But even though it's beautiful, the lady rejected it.

637
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,160
Starting price is 100,000,

638
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
with minimum increments of 20,000.

639
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,490
Let's begin.

640
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,960
200,000!

641
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,320
Good. Any bids higher than 200,000?

642
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,400
400,000!

643
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,240
Good. The gentleman in the back,

644
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,480
I see your bid for 400,000.

645
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Alright, 400,000 once.

646
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,140
Any bids higher than 400,000?

647
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,120
400,000 twice.

648
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,890
400,000 for the third time.

649
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,640
Sold!

650
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,170
Boss, I've finished the task you assigned me.

651
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,440
Mr. Shi.

652
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,160
You can go now.

653
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,340
You helped me buy this.

654
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,610
Where did you get the money?

655
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,320
This is all the working capital my company has right now.

656
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,120
Are you crazy?

657
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
The company has no money now.

658
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,900
Did you mortgage the company?

659
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,460
Just to repay my favor?

660
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
Yes, I want to pay you back.

661
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,220
I'll gradually pay back the rest too.

662
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,680
I don't owe you anything.

663
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,360
Have you

664
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,160
fallen in love with me?

665
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,160
Nonsense.

666
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
If you don't love me,

667
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,970
why do you care about me so much?

668
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,820
You're overthinking.

669
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,210
Fine, I'm being presumptuous.

670
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,800
But honestly,

671
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,560
you don't need to rush to pay me back.

672
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,880
I know the company really needs money right now.

673
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,340
Really, I'm not in a hurry.

674
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,280
I can owe anyone else, just not you.

675
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,820
What's that supposed to mean?

676
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,260
Xu Ke, listen to me carefully.

677
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,440
I hate it most when people spectate my life.

678
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,010
You're really foolish.

679
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Knowing all men are the same,

680
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,900
you're just a bit more naive than others.

681
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,880
I thought being naive meant being more honest.

682
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,010
I never expected

683
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,880
you would take the fact that you're pursuing me

684
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,540
and brag about it everywhere.

685
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,720
You think it makes you look good?

686
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,480
I...

687
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,180
Let me tell you,

688
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,610
you and your friends

689
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,540
should never spectate my life again.

690
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,020
Was it Hua Ming or Wan Xinxin who told you?

691
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,210
Stop knocking! I'm coming!

692
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,260
Stop knocking!

693
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,800
Open the door!

694
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,440
Who is it?

695
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,640
Liar!

696
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,360
Xu Ke!

697
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,200
Liar!

698
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,600
Wait, have you been drinking?

699
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,200
Liar!

700
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,740
Come here and sit down.

701
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,360
Don't touch me!

702
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,650
Keep it down.

703
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,520
You big liar!

704
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,000
Let me tell you.

705
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,880
You've completely deceived me.

706
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,400
Honey.

707
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,240
Why did you drink so much?

708
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,680
Honey.

709
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
What's wrong?

710
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,280
Why did you drink so much?

711
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,160
Go inside. This doesn't concern you.

712
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,280
Go inside and stay there.

713
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
It's nothing. He's drunk. Don't listen to him.

714
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,240
It's fine. I...

715
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,280
Xu Ke, do you have something to tell me?

716
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,410
It's between us men.

717
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,440
Listen to me.

718
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,040
Okay.

719
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Thank you so much.

720
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,760
I thought you were helping me out of kindness.

721
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,090
I really appreciate it.

722
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,520
No, you...

723
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,850
But I don't understand.

724
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,920
Why did you go to Shi Lu?

725
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,490
Shi Lu contacted me.

726
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,840
Shi Lu?

727
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,160
You're mocking me, aren't you?

728
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,800
No, Shi Lu...

729
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,560
Xu Ke, Shi Lu contacted me.

730
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,640
You're definitely mocking me.

731
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,440
Shi Lu contacted me.

732
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,080
Don't speak. Listen to me first.

733
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,000
Fine, I'm listening.

734
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,400
Do you know what Shi Lu fears most?

735
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,730
She's terrified of people finding out about our relationship.

736
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,960
What did you say to her?

737
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,080
Xu Ke, I didn't...

738
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,480
After what you said, she broke up with me.

739
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,360
She doesn't want me anymore.

740
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,530
Have some water.

741
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,160
I don't want any.

742
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,010
Xu Ke, blame me then.

743
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,210
But listen to me.

744
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,700
What I meant was, Shi Lu asked me to come over.

745
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,980
All I said to her was...

746
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,640
There's nothing wrong with pursuing love, Xu Ke.

747
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,760
But selling your house and borrowing money...

748
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,480
Love obtained this way isn't real love.

749
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,640
Am I wrong about this?

750
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,560
How is it any of your business?

751
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,600
You're right, it's not my business.

752
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
That's my own business.

753
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,320
What does it have to do with you?

754
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,880
Fine.

755
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,280
I was wrong. I apologize to you.

756
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

757
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,960
What good is an apology?

758
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,120
She's already broken up with me.

759
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,040
She doesn't want me anymore. What's the use?

760
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,200
Can you lower your voice, you're supposed to be a mature man.

761
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,060
I won't listen.

762
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,480
Let me tell you, it's all your fault.

763
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,520
I'll be quiet.

764
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,480
The child is sleeping. Can you please keep it down?

765
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,600
It's your problem. You're wrong.

766
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,320
Get out.

767
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,640
I'll leave.

768
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,000
Get out of here!

769
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,560
I'll get you!

770
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,400
Are you sober now?

771
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,720
What's wrong with you?

772
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,580
Huaming helps you and you hit him?

773
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,680
You drink a little

774
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,040
and you use it as an excuse to act crazy, right?

775
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,300
Forget it. He's drunk.

776
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,880
No, stay out of this.

777
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,920
Get up.

778
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,240
Get up!

779
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,300
Don't touch me!

780
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,540
Wan Xinxin, you're taking his side, aren't you?

781
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,000
What do you mean?

782
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,480
I'm not taking his side, Xu Ke.

783
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,800
Do you know what you've become?

784
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,000
You've become like this over a woman.

785
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,080
Who would like you now?

786
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,610
Wan Xinxin, let me tell you.

787
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,240
All these years, whenever you got into trouble,

788
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,920
how did I help you?

789
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,960
And now, for this guy,

790
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,360
you want to end our friendship

791
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,820
and pretend I don't exist?

792
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,280
Fine.

793
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,760
I'm cutting ties with you too.

794
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,600
Don't come to me with your problems anymore.

795
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
I don't want to see you again either.

796
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,920
Say that again, Xu Ke.

797
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,520
I don't want to see you.

798
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,440
Say that again.

799
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,240
You don't want to see me? I don't want to deal with you either!

800
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,800
No, Wan Xinxin, let him go.

801
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,160
What do you mean?

802
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,880
Okay, okay. Calm down.

803
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,140
Why should I let him go?

804
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,400
Come back here, Xu Ke!

805
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,060
Wan Xinxin.

806
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,400
Don't you need to take care of Bao?

807
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,130
Wait here. I'll go out for a bit.

808
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,850
Where are you going?

809
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,560
I'll go check on him.

810
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,920
What if something happens?

811
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,880
Send me a message when you've safely taken him home.

812
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,680
Okay, got it. You look after Bao.

813
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,280
I'm cutting ties with you too.

814
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,240
Don't come to me with your problems anymore.

815
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,840
I don't want to see you again.

816
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,850
Are you going to drink this?

817
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,120
Did you hear what I said?

818
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,120
Sis, please stop bothering me, okay?

819
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm drowning in problems right now.

820
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,360
Look, I've lost my job.

821
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,160
Qin Gang keeps bothering me all day.

822
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,690
Even that bastard Xu Ke has fallen out with me.

823
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,360
You're my only emotional support now.

824
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,400
Can't you give me a break?

825
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Just say yes to me.

826
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,500
Then I'll stop bothering you.

827
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,160
I... I...

828
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm not a savior.

829
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,400
Can't you find someone else for this?

830
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,400
Your brother-in-law definitely has issues.

831
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I just haven't caught evidence yet.

832
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,770
If you don't help me,

833
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,760
do you want to watch your sister's

834
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,600
marriage completely fall apart?

835
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,400
How can I help?

836
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,690
Should I ask Hua Ming to spy on my brother-in-law?

837
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,660
Would he even listen to me?

838
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,000
You're his girlfriend.

839
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,840
If he doesn't listen to you, who will he listen to?

840
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,240
We were just pretending.

841
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,000
It was all for old Mrs. Qin.

842
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,680
I don't care if you were pretending or not.

843
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,280
You have to help me with this.

844
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,570
I really can't help.

845
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,420
Well...

846
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,330
Then I won't help you with your child anymore.

847
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,450
You're threatening me?

848
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,080
You don't care about what happens to me.

849
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,400
You call this a threat?

850
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,760
Sis, I've noticed that

851
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,490
you're being even more unreasonable than me now.

852
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,220
Fine, I'm leaving.

853
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,920
I won't come tomorrow.

854
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,600
I won't come the day after either.

855
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,400
Take care of the child yourself.

856
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,760
Sister, how could you do this?

857
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,290
Please come in, auntie.

858
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,460
Sister,

859
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,340
we're not eating here.

860
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,620
Everything's ruined.

861
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,700
How can I even think about eating?

862
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,440
What happened, sister?

863
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,300
What's broken?

864
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,380
No, the pot. The pot is broken.

865
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,200
Why did you two come back together?

866
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,860
I ran into auntie downstairs.

867
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
How about this, auntie?

868
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,320
It doesn't matter if the pot is broken.

869
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,580
I can make something simple for us to eat.

870
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,800
No need.

871
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,800
If the pot is broken, I'll treat you to a meal outside.

872
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,640
My sister has already left. There's no one to watch the child.

873
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
Bring the child along to eat with us.

874
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,400
Grandma, order something to eat.

875
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,000
Did you get everything down?

876
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,530
Okay, that's it for now.

877
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,840
Xinxin.

878
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,170
Are you feeling unwell?

879
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,090
No, I'm fine.

880
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,820
I probably didn't sleep well last night.

881
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,340
We've known each other for some time now.

882
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,140
You can't hide things from me.

883
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,810
Whatever is bothering you,

884
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,320
you can always talk to me about it.

885
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,080
Personal or work issues, tell me everything.

886
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,680
If Huaming is bullying you,

887
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,140
I'll deal with him for you.

888
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,200
He wouldn't dare bully me.

889
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,740
Right, I wouldn't dare bully her.

890
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,520
I don't think you would dare either.
