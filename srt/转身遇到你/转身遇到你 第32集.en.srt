1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Mom, you might have misunderstood Liu Wei.

3
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I've failed as a mother.

4
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,039
Mom, what do you mean by that?

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
Qin Gang.

6
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,840
When will you finally grow up?

7
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,240
Mom, don't get upset.

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm already a father. How can you say I haven't grown up?

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
This is my fault.

10
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,259
I raised you by myself since you were little.

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,330
I was afraid of letting you suffer.

12
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,840
So I've always spoiled you.

13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,760
Food, clothes, expenses, education, everything...

14
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,940
I gave you the best of everything.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,620
I just hoped you wouldn't fall behind at the starting line.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,760
And you didn't lose at the starting line.

17
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,280
You're still standing at the starting line.

18
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,680
You never even moved.

19
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,840
I gave you money to open a car dealership.

20
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,970
But what have you made of it?

21
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
Although it hasn't gone bankrupt...

22
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,480
It's barely surviving.

23
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,240
But that's not the point.

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,460
The point is...

25
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,200
I failed to instill a sense of responsibility in you.

26
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,920
Xiao Gang, I can't be with you forever.

27
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,560
If you don't wake up now, it will be too late.

28
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,480
Really, I'm afraid that one day...

29
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,410
Between you and Xiaobao...

30
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,760
The father won't act like a father, and the son won't act like a son.

31
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,800
He'll hate you and resent you.

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,040
Just like how you resent and hate your father.

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,100
Do you understand?

34
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,329
That's impossible.

35
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,760
Xiaobao is my own son.

36
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,240
Xiao Gang, I don't have time...

37
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,770
To struggle with you anymore. Do you understand?

38
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,640
Let me be honest with you.

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,000
The American doctors have given me their verdict.

40
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,700
I only have three months left.

41
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,160
Mom, you're just trying to scare me, right?

42
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,620
I'm telling you the truth.

43
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,720
Mom.

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,840
Those doctors are talking nonsense.

45
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,100
We won't believe them.

46
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,840
Science is so advanced nowadays.

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,200
What disease can't be cured, right?

48
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,680
We don't lack money.

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,680
We'll definitely find a way to cure you.

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,279
This isn't a problem.

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,089
I'm not afraid of dying.

52
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,040
But what I worry about

53
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,320
is you.

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,000
Xinxin

55
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,080
and my grandson.

56
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,080
My only wish

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,520
is that the three of you

58
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
can live well together.

59
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,400
If that happens,

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,200
even if I die,

61
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,480
I'll be content. Do you understand?

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,560
It's a user-friendly design.

63
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,290
This will run through our entire promotion plan.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,120
This will not only help you

65
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,560
clarify your product positioning.

66
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,320
It will also allow buyers

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,480
when purchasing the product,

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,360
to

69
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,440
feel our care

70
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,500
and thoughtfulness from head to toe.

71
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,640
I believe you three executives

72
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,600
now have a better understanding of our company's capabilities.

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,840
If there are no questions,

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,000


75
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
Alright, let's do it.

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,490
Mr. Shi, this contract signing went quite smoothly.

77
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Thank you.

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,410
It's been a pleasure working with you.

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,440
Mr. Xu, let's celebrate together tonight.

80
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,240
No problem.

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,700
Excuse me for a moment.

82
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Lulu.

83
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,320
They're too rowdy.

84
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,360
They mentioned celebrating tonight.

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
Let's go together.

86
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,960
You go have fun. I'm not going.

87
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you have something else to do?

88
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Don't bother me.

89
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
What's wrong?

90
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,320
We signed such an important contract today.

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,520
Why aren't you happy?

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
I've never felt like such a failure before.

93
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,960
How did we fail?

94
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,200
We succeeded today.

95
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,760
That was you, not us.

96
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,520
You did everything.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,120
Now they all see you as the leader.

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,720
No. So what?

99
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,560
This company is yours.

100
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,090
No matter how well I perform, it's all for you.

101
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
I don't need that.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,960
No, Lulu.

103
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,040
Go. Go enjoy your success.

104
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,480
Dr. Jia.

105
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,040
Is my mother's condition really that serious?

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
I've been in contact with specialists in America.

107
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,160
It is indeed very serious.

108
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,420
Please do everything you can to save her.

109
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,040
Medical experts have already reached their conclusion.

110
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,440
I wish I could do more, but my hands are tied.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,530
Let me give you some advice.

112
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,040
During this period, you must ensure

113
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,970
that Mr. Qin stays in good spirits.

114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,920
If Mr. Qin experiences any significant emotional distress,

115
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,220
he could be in serious danger.

116
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,240
Okay.

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,560
Good.

118
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,240
I've reviewed all the contracts.

119
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,170
You did an excellent job this time.

120
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,640
Great.

121
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Of course, I must treat you to a meal.

122
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,760
Sure. You pick the place.

123
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,160
Alright.

124
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,840
Let's leave it at that for now.

125
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,120
Sounds good. Bye-bye.

126
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,560
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,520
You haven't done anything wrong.

128
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,560
Why apologize?

129
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,360
I'm apologizing on behalf of my mother.

130
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,559
You are you, and your mother is your mother.

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,059
I don't need your apology.

132
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,640
Silly.

133
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,280
I know everything your mother did

134
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,480
was for your own good.

135
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,960
Although she has some misunderstandings about me,

136
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I understand her.

137
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,600
That's good.

138
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,080
I came today to tell you that

139
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,100
my mother wants me to get back with Wan Xinxin again.

140
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,920
This time I have to take some action.

141
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,400
That's nothing new to me.

142
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,330
Isn't that what you've always been doing?

143
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,220
I mean I have to get serious this time.

144
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,540
My mother only has three months left.

145
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,680
I don't agree.

146
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,280
I know.

147
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,160
You want to pursue Wan Xinxin

148
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,320
just to get control of her property.

149
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,320
But none of that really matters.

150
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,240
Let your mother give her money to whoever she wants.

151
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,760
As long as we're together,

152
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,600
as long as we love each other, money isn't an issue.

153
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,820
You've always understood me before.

154
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,800
Could you for once

155
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,080
think from my perspective?

156
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm a woman too.

157
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,560
I get jealous and upset too.

158
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,560
Every time I see

159
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,400
you with Wan Xinxin,

160
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,880
do you have any idea how I feel?

161
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,920
Don't you know?

162
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,800
We can find

163
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,480
the best doctors in the world to treat your mother.

164
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,280
I don't believe it's incurable.

165
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,800
Give me some time,

166
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,000
I can make her accept me again.

167
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,920
But I really don't want to keep pretending anymore.

168
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
I'm so tired.

169
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,200
I must win Wan Xinxin back.

170
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,360
I have to do this.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,520
Hello?

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,740
No need to come to the office. Let's meet at the usual place.

173
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,520
Wan Xinxin.

174
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,660
Why are you here again?

175
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,370
I need to ask you for a favor.

176
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,900
I won't agree to it.

177
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm already annoyed enough.

178
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,080
Would you please leave?

179
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,360
Can you let me finish?

180
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,620
How do you think my mother treats you?

181
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,560
Why bring that up?

182
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,440
I'm formally asking you

183
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,640
to remarry me.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,920
Are you okay?

185
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
Huaming and I are about to get our marriage license.

186
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,160
No. Just go on with your life.

187
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,320
Go marry your Liu Wei.

188
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,980
Why did you ask me to come here?

189
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
You got your license?

190
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,440
Even if we haven't,

191
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,250
it's none of your business.

192
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,360
If you haven't gotten the license, then I still have a chance.

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,440
Even if you have,

194
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,400
I still have a chance.

195
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,080
You can divorce him and then remarry me.

196
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,600
Okay?

197
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,340
What are you saying, Qin Gang?

198
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
What kind of person do you think I am?

199
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
You come to me when you need me,

200
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,080
and when you don't,

201
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
you just kick me aside.

202
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,480
I really don't want to talk to you anymore.

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,960
Let me finish.

204
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,840
I, Qin Gang, have never begged anyone before,

205
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
but this time I'm truly begging you.

206
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,580
My mother only has three months left.

207
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,730
The doctors have given their verdict.

208
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
After three months, you'll be free.

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,400
Name your price, whatever you want.

210
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,780
Please, I'm begging you to help me. Will you?

211
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,860
Are you telling the truth?

212
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,040
Based on my assessment,

213
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,040
I think this company is very irregular.

214
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,800
It has obvious flaws.

215
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,610
The acquisition doesn't make much sense.

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Indeed, experience counts.

217
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,320
You spotted so many issues from such limited information.

218
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,380
You've really put your heart into it.

219
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,760
Director Liu treats me so well.

220
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
If I, Jiang Kaiyang, don't show my gratitude,

221
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,970
how could I face myself?

222
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,960
I was right about you.

223
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,440
However, my opinion is exactly the opposite of yours.

224
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,520
I believe it's precisely because they have so many flaws

225
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,050
that we have the opportunity to acquire them.

226
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,280
That's true.

227
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,580
Let me kiss these little feet.

228
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,240
These little feet smell so nice.

229
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,600
How can they smell so good?

230
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,480
Wonderful.

231
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,940
I'm going to nibble on you.

232
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Such sweet-smelling little hands.

233
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
And such sweet-smelling little feet too.

234
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,640
What a sweet-smelling grandson I have.

235
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,200
Auntie.

236
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,560
He smells so good.

237
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,840
I'll leave the baby here with you.

238
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
I'll be going now.

239
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,720
I'll come back for him later.

240
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,320
You're leaving?

241
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,220
I'm heading to work. I can give you a ride.

242
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,960
No need. I can go by myself.

243
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,880
No, absolutely not.

244
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,060
What's wrong with you?

245
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,360
I've never seen you so eager to work before.

246
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,320
Today,

247
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,500
I'm making the decisions.

248
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,920
No one is allowed to talk about leaving.

249
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,640
Xinxin,

250
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,080
stay and keep me company, will you?

251
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,640
Xinxin,

252
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,840
it's been so long since we've all

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,120
been together like this.

254
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,690
You don't know how my heart has been

255
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,480
in limbo all this time.

256
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Seeing you and the baby today,

257
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
my anxious heart

258
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,480
is finally at ease.

259
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm just happy, that's all.

260
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,520
I know you've been missing Bao.

261
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,600
It's okay.

262
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,360
Bao can stay here with you.

263
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,080
I'll come back for him later.

264
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,040
It's not just Bao I've been missing.

265
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,320
I've missed you too.

266
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,720
About Mr. Liu,

267
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,000
whatever you do, don't mention

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,120
my sister-in-law.

269
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,060
I heard from her sister

270
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,120
that Huaming played her.

271
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,960
Her sister wants me to get revenge for her.

272
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,450
But think about it, I'm almost divorced from her sister.

273
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Do I have time to care about her problems? Right?

274
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,920
Weren't they quite close with Huaming?

275
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,320
Exactly.

276
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,560
This Huaming is a real piece of work.

277
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,720
Let me tell you,

278
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,000
before he gets what he wants,

279
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,040
he's like a leech, sticks like glue,

280
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,840
all over the person.

281
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,570
But after he gets what he wants,

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,130
he changes faster than turning a page.

283
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,520
Look, these are all from Mom.

284
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,360
Xinxin.

285
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,480
I don't know if you'll like them.

286
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,700
This one...

287
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,880
If you don't like it, I can exchange it.

288
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,840
I really have something tonight.

289
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,320
I won't stay for dinner.

290
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,960
I'll come back later to pick up Bao.

291
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,840
No, Xinxin.

292
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,240
I have something to tell you.

293
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,640
Why don't you wait until I finish before you decide?

294
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,720
Xinxin.

295
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,880
I think Xiaogang has already told you

296
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
about my current health condition.

297
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,920
Auntie.

298
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,560
You really look well this time.

299
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,520
Sometimes those doctors

300
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,240
just exaggerate things to scare you.

301
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,960
Don't overthink it.

302
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,080
A long illness makes a good doctor.

303
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,520
I know my own body.

304
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,000
Xinxin, my greatest wish

305
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,200
is for you and Bao to move back in.

306
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,640
Stay with me for a while, would you?

307
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,000
But Auntie...

308
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,640
I'm not asking for an answer right now.

309
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,120
I'll give you time to think about it.

310
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,680
Xinxin, my mom has made this request.

311
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,980
Could you please consider it?

312
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,660
Could you give us a moment?

313
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,020
I want to have a private word with Xinxin.

314
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,440
Auntie.

315
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,480
It's really not convenient for me to move in now.

316
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
Things are complicated enough already.

317
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,440
Please try to understand my situation.

318
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,400
I understand.

319
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,359
You see, I'm getting old

320
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,300
and I've become a bit selfish.

321
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,210
Always thinking about myself.

322
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,760
You and that Huaming...

323
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,599
We're doing well.

324
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,120
We're getting married soon.

325
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,800
That's good.

326
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,840
Auntie.

327
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,640
Please take care of yourself.

328
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,840
I'll come back later for Bao.

329
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,880
I should go now.

330
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,440
Okay.

331
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
Xinxin, you forgot your bag.

332
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,800
You...

333
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,480
I'm sorry.

334
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,440
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

335
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
Please try again later.

336
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,560
Huaming, if you dare avoid me, do it for life.

337
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,960
Let's go.

338
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
You scared me! What are you doing?

339
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,240
Don't be afraid.

340
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,080
I'm not a ghost.

341
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,720
Take this.

342
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,720
How could I not be scared when you appear so suddenly?

343
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,760
No, I was waiting for you to get off work.

344
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,290
Why were you waiting for me?

345
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,940
Have you lost your memory?

346
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,520
Didn't I always wait for you after work before?

347
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,400
Then we'd eat. Where should we go?

348
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,800
This kind of talk usually goes in one ear and out the other.

349
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,120
Anything is fine.

350
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,650
What should we eat tonight?

351
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,410
I really don't know what to do with you.

352
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,040
Turn off the lights and lock the door.

353
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,680
Okay.

354
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,280
Wait a moment.

355
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
Hello? Who's this?

356
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,360
Hello? Is this Huaming?

357
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,240
Hello, Mrs. Qin.

358
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,920
Mrs. Qin, what can I do for you?

359
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,640
I...

360
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,440
I'm sorry, I'd like to have a word with you

361
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,680
in private.

362
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,130
Sure, go ahead. I'm listening.

363
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,660
It might be difficult to explain over the phone.

364
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,040
How about this? I'll find a place to meet

365
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,490
and call you once I've made arrangements.

366
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,980
That works.

367
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,280
Just give me a call when you're ready.

368
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,760
Okay.

369
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,000
Thank you.

370
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,440
Mrs. Qin.

371
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,340
Why are you investigating me?

372
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,360
Dr. Hua, I'm a businesswoman.

373
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,080
A businessperson always maximizes profits.

374
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,260
Even with charitable donations.

375
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,850
They can't just go down the drain for nothing.

376
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,240
Donations?

377
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,770
You're the founder of Huaming Online, right?

378
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,720
Yes.

379
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,520
Did you receive

380
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,320
a substantial donation?

381
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,560
Yes.

382
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,040
You decided to use this money to take some patients

383
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
to the United States for treatment.

384
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,520
That's right.

385
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,840
I'm the donor of those funds.

386
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,080
Wasn't it Mr. Lin?

387
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,800
Mrs. Qin, what's going on here?

388
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,120
Not Mr. Lin. It was me.

389
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,200
It's not a small amount of money after all.

390
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,520
So I apologize, but I had to investigate you.

391
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,480
It's fine.

392
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,840
The donation amount is quite substantial.

393
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,680
The investigation is completely understandable.

394
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,040
Better to be clear about everything.

395
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,770
Mrs. Qin, I want to express gratitude on behalf of

396
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,520
all the beneficiaries of your donation.

397
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,600
And also,

398
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,640
I want to thank you personally.

399
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,560
Helping more people through Huaming Online

400
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,960
has always been my dream.

401
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,820
You've helped me realize this dream. Thank you.

402
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,930
There's one more thing.

403
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
If I didn't know, I would let it go.

404
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
But now I know.

405
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,360
I must be the villain who meddles in others' affairs.

406
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,490
Because this matter

407
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,000
concerns my grandson's mother,

408
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,120
Wan Xinxin.

409
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,920
Mrs. Qin, what does this have to do with Xinxin?

410
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,220
Have you eaten yet?

411
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
I'm not hungry. No appetite.

412
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,000
I saved some food for your brother-in-law. I'll go heat it up.

413
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,360
You need to eat something.

414
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,320
No need, sis.

415
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,490
I have something to do tonight.

416
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,080
I'll leave my little boy with you tonight.

417
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,200
So where are you going?

418
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,320
I'm going to Huaming's place.

419
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,250
I don't believe he won't come home.

420
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,480
Don't go.

421
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,920
Huaming has broken up and gotten back together with you so many times.

422
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,160
And he never gives you a clear answer.

423
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,440
That's why I need to ask him face to face.

424
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,080
I need to get an answer.

425
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,680
Think about it. A man who

426
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,440
runs away on your wedding day

427
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,120
clearly has no intention of marrying you.

428
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,480
But he told me himself

429
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,080
that he loves me. I believe him.

430
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,000
He just said

431
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
I need to accept his past.

432
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,920
And his past is just

433
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,580
his ex-wife and child, right?

434
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,960
I can accept that.

435
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,760
So I don't understand

436
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,960
what's still standing between us.

437
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,360
That's just fate.

438
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
You two aren't meant to be together.

439
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,520
Now I see clearly.

440
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,250
This thing called fate is just one-sided effort.

441
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,840
Xinxin, listen to me.

442
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,360
Sis.

443
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
I understand all the reasoning.

444
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,600
Even if it kills me, I need to know the truth.

445
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,200
Listen.

446
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,440
Go ahead.

447
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,960
Oh my, really.

448
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,600
In Wan Xinxin's life of over 20 years,

449
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,370
there have been two events that hit her especially hard.

450
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,160
The first was when her father

451
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,640
tried to help someone in danger,

452
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,170
but encountered a doctor who refused to help,

453
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,480
causing the father she depended on

454
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,200
to pass away too soon.

455
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,360
The second thing

456
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,200
was when my foolish son divorced her.

457
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,080
What I want to do now

458
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,960
is to do my utmost to minimize

459
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,490
the pain these two events have caused Xinxin.

460
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,160
Auntie, since you've already investigated me,

461
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,000
I believe you must know

462
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,890
who that doctor was, right?

463
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,040
Yes, I know.

464
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,720
So I want to know,

465
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,160
I'd like to hear

466
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,400
Dr. Hua, about this matter,

467
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,760
how do you think you should explain it to Xinxin?

468
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,240
I plan

469
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,160
to find the right time to tell Wan Xinxin myself.

470
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,140
You want to tell her yourself?

471
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,920
Don't you think that's selfish?

472
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,320
Let's put ourselves in Xinxin's shoes for a moment.

473
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,250
Three years ago,

474
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,480
because of an irresponsible doctor,

475
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,610
she lost her father.

476
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,440
Three years later, she falls in love with a man,

477
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
and this man happens to be that very doctor.

478
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,380
Have you thought about it?

479
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,480
If Xinxin learns about all this,

480
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,520
I can't even imagine

481
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,010
what her reaction would be.

482
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,520
If it were me,

483
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,760
I would never tell Xinxin any of this.

484
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,120
Never.

485
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,960
This should remain a secret.

486
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,360
Wan Xinxin has the right to know the truth.

487
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,600
And Auntie, I need to tell you,

488
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,520
I believe my decision three years ago wasn't wrong.

489
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,920
As a doctor,

490
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,280
I made the most correct judgment at that time.

491
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,240
I haven't regretted it to this day, really.

492
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,440
Fine, so you tell Wan Xinxin,

493
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,800
you pass this burden to her,

494
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,640
letting her make the choice herself.

495
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,080
You'll be free.

496
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,280
But what about Xinxin?

497
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,080
She'll live in your shadow for the rest of her life.

498
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,920
Then as an elder,

499
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,200
tell me what I should do now.

500
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,480
Take this secret and leave Wan Xinxin.

501
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,400
Never let her know about it.

502
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,280
The further away you go, the better.

503
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,080
Auntie, I love Wan Xinxin.

504
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,570
Xinxin loves me too.

505
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,200
Leaving her would also hurt her.

506
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,000
Choose the lesser of two evils.

507
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,080
Rather than letting Xinxin think you're heartless,

508
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,000
which is just stabbing her once,

509
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,120
if you let Wan Xinxin know the whole truth,

510
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,600
it would be like stabbing her twice.

511
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,080
Of two evils, choose the lesser.

512
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,200
Rather than letting Xinxin think you're heartless,

513
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,050
this is just stabbing her once.

514
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,240
If Wan Xinxin learns the whole truth,

515
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,680
it would be like stabbing her twice.

516
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,520
When President Qin arrives,

517
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,360
brief him about the situation

518
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,720
with that 4S dealership.

519
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay.

520
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,520
I'll tell him exactly that.

521
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,840
I'll say this 4S dealership

522
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,560
is currently not performing well.

523
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,960
But after we acquire it,

524
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,820
the prospects will be excellent.

525
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,860
Just like that.

526
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,880
What is it?

527
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,660
It's like this.

528
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,260
Manager Jiang has some work to report to you.

529
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,480
Mr. Qin, the situation is this.

530
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,080
I've been checking out this dealership

531
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,050
and they have several talented salespeople.

532
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,520
They're also interested in changing jobs.

533
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,280
So I was thinking of bringing

534
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,210
all of them over. What do you think?

535
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,280
Qin Gang.

536
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,360
Qin Gang.

537
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
I've been in a terrible mood lately.

538
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,560
I don't have the energy to manage company affairs.

539
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,040
Why don't you handle these matters instead?

540
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,440
I'll go prepare an authorization letter for you right now.

541
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,000
Okay.

542
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,320
Bao.

543
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,120
I'm going all out for your grandmother.

544
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,880
Let me be the bad guy till the end.

545
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,480
Hello, Dr. Hua.

546
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,640
Hello, ma'am.

547
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,280
Are you available? Could you come to my place?

548
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,580
Sure, I'll be right there.

549
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
Thank you. I'll be waiting.

550
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,920
Xinxin, it's me.

551
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Are you free?

552
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,940
If possible, could you come home?

553
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,380
If you're not busy, please come back now.

554
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,360
I've written all the instructions on the blackboard.

555
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,880
Alright, I believe everyone understands clearly now.

556
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,760
I'll be on a business trip for a few days.

557
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
During this time,

558
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,840
if you have any questions,

559
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,000
you can ask Mr. Xu.

560
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,080
Zhang, come with me for a moment.

561
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,160
Mr. Xu.

562
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,000
Ms. Shi seems to be going on a business trip.

563
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,300
Business trip.

564
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,880
Yes.

565
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,560
Where to?

566
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,280
America.

567
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,160
Ame-

568
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,520
What else did she say?

569
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,650
Ms. Shi said the company will be in your hands from now on.

570
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,640
The company will be managed by you from now on.

571
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,920
In your hands.

572
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,400
The company will be managed by you from now on. Goodbye.

573
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,080
Huh?

574
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,000
Please have some water.

575
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,600
Thank you.

576
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,640
Have a seat, Huaming.

577
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,360
Dr. Hua.

578
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,480
I've heard that when raising a child,

579
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,640
the child will gradually resemble

580
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,330
the person who raises them.

581
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,360
But no matter how I look at my grandson,

582
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,240
he still resembles his biological father, Qin Gang.

583
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,320
It's good that he looks like Qin Gang.

584
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,200
He'll grow up to be handsome too.

585
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,240
Auntie.

586
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,360
About that donation, please rest assured.

587
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,050
I'm currently working at a private hospital.

588
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,840
I'll have their finance department

589
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,120
prepare detailed records

590
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,960
of how the donation is being used

591
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,920
for your review.

592
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,520
Entrusting you with the donation

593
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,380
was definitely the right choice.

594
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,580
Thank you, Auntie.

595
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,690
You're welcome.

596
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,720
You've been very thorough in every aspect.

597
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,920
I'm very satisfied.

598
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,320
Huaming.

599
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,530
Why are you avoiding me?

600
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,930
Why are you avoiding me?

601
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,890
Let's talk outside.

602
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,880
Don't disturb the child.

603
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,780
Ma'am, I'll be right back.

604
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,720
Xinxin.

605
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,650
Aren't you avoiding me and refusing to see me?

606
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,080
Why don't you hide yourself better then?

607
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,140
Just make sure I can't find you at all.

608
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Why are you so inconsistent?

609
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,800
First you say one thing,

610
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,840
that I need to accept your past for us to be together.

611
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,760
Then you say you're not worthy of my hatred.

612
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,090
Asking me to forget you.

613
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,800
What exactly do you want?

614
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,200
Xinxin.

615
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,520
You're having difficulties, right?

616
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,980
Just tell me what they are.

617
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,060
I'm willing to face them with you.

618
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
Why avoid me?

619
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,120
I get it. It's about Xiaqing and Ruirui, isn't it?

620
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,040
They're forcing you to remarry her, right?

621
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,330
No one is forcing me.

622
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,060
If no one's forcing you, why are you avoiding me?

623
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,720
Huaming.

624
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,560
You can't be like an ostrich,

625
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,440
always backing away.

626
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,200
Whatever difficulties you face, just tell me,

627
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,920
and I'll face them with you.

628
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,679
Do you have so little faith in me?

629
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,800
You once promised me

630
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,320
that you would protect me and my son,

631
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,320
and never let me suffer.

632
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,300
But today I'm telling you,

633
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,800
my son and I aren't afraid of suffering.

634
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,159
Even if I have to suffer,

635
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,760
I still want to be with you.

636
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,639
No matter how big your problems are,

637
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,639
as long as you tell me,

638
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,520
we can face them together.

639
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,159
I, Wan Xinxin, am not a coward.

640
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,120
I'm willing to go through hell and high water with you.

641
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,760
I'd even risk my life for you.

642
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,400
Say something!

643
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,120
Xiaqing.

644
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,760
I will keep my promise to you.

645
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
I'll go to America

646
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,450
and remarry you.

647
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,480
You, me, and Ruirui -

648
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,560
our family of three will never be apart.

649
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,960
Huaming, what are you saying?

650
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,490
Goodbye.

651
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,440
Wan Xinxin.

652
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,840
Wan Xinxin!

653
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,900
I don't believe it.

654
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,040
Call her again. Try one more time.

655
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,440
Get a grip, Xinxin.

656
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,760
Xinxin, I like you.

657
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,490
I also care about your brother.

658
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,560
I truly loved you.

659
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,000
I genuinely wanted to marry you.

660
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,900
I wanted to take care of you and your brother.

661
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,080
But that day, on the way to the registry office,

662
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,940
while driving, I was thinking...

663
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,880
I'm 40 years old.

664
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,160
Middle-aged now,

665
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,980
how should I spend the rest of my life?

666
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,240
When Ruirui and Xiaqing came back this time,

667
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,900
I really...

668
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,480
I asked myself if I could give them up.

669
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,280
I can't.

670
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,160
Really.

671
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,840
Don't cry.

672
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,920
Really, there's no need to cry.

673
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,320
Your life can go on.

674
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,400
Honestly, I'm not worth your tears.

675
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,260
I've made my decision now.

676
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,160
I don't believe you.

677
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,800
You've always cared about me.

678
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,440
Why are you saying this?

679
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,760
Why won't you admit it, Huaming?

680
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,720
I won't let you leave.

681
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,650
I simply won't let you go, Huaming.

682
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,720
Huaming!

683
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,200
Open the door!

684
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,240
Open up!

685
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,120
Open the door!

686
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,720
Huaming, open the door!

687
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,720
Huaming.

688
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,080
Auntie, tell me,

689
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,660
what was Huaming doing here just now?

690
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,010
Huaming created an online platform called Huaming Online.

691
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,520
He needed money.

692
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,320
So I gave him some

693
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,080
financial support.

694
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,400
Is it just financial support?

695
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,200
What else would there be?

696
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,960
Xinxin,

697
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,290
you don't think I'm trying to ruin your relationship with Huaming, do you?

698
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,480
I hope not.

699
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,720
But let me be clear,

700
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,160
if anyone tries to ruin my relationship with Huaming,

701
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,720
don't blame me for being ruthless.

702
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,380
I will be their enemy for life.

703
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,360
I thought I would never love again.

704
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,640
Spring flowers don't bloom for me.

705
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,640
Yet I happened to meet you.

706
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,320
In this bustling crowd.

707
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,520
I don't dare face her,

708
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,970
no courage to face love.

709
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,380
Is that all you've got?

710
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,220
Is that all you've got?

711
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,000
Never again will my heart race.

712
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,880
Yet I happened to meet you.

713
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,120
Okay, stop.

714
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,120
But I no longer believe in love.

715
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,400
It's not that I don't want to love,

716
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,400
even though I've been hurt before.

717
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,960
Who can predict the arrangements of fate?

718
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,280
It's not that I don't want to love.

719
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm weak. I have no courage.

720
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,770
Midlife crisis.

721
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,440
You deserve that. Well done.

722
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,770
I've made up my mind.

723
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,880
Actually, I think you

724
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,760
really don't need to do this.

725
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,000
First of all,

726
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,120
I don't have the courage to tell Wan Xinxin about this.

727
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,800
And I just found out

728
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,720
that Mrs. Qin has terminal cancer.

729
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,680
She's used donation money to save so many people.

730
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,240
I think she deserves help now.

731
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,360
So I'm going to the US to find Dr. Wei

732
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,760
to work together on

733
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,360
an effective treatment plan for her.

734
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,820
I need to leave right away.

735
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,770
Your Majesty

736
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,120
I'm at the airport.

737
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,920
I just saw your husband.

738
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,720
Xu Ke, stop him right now.

739
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,040
I'll be there soon.

740
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,080
Qin Gang, can you take me to the airport?

741
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,800
What's wrong?

742
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,040
Hua Ming is at the airport.

743
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,760
Wait, he's at the airport now?

744
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,160
We definitely won't catch up with him.

745
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,960
I'll take a taxi by myself if you won't drive me.

746
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,720
Hurry up! Go now!

747
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,920
Quick! Go!

748
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li

749
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,680
Yaping

750
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,160
Li Wenwang
