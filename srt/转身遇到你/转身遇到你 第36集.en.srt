1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,240
Come on, let's go to bed.

3
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
I'm tired.

4
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,570
It's unbelievable.

5
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,040
I visited her just a few days ago and she was fine.

6
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,970
And now she's gone, just like that.

7
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,720
Yes, who could have imagined.

8
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,840
Sis, when you went to her house the other day,

9
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,280
was she alone?

10
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,760
Yes, just by herself.

11
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,160
I even said to Qin Gang,

12
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,890
why didn't they find someone to keep her company?

13
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,520
I remember Huaming told me

14
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,480
she recovered really well after the surgery.

15
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,480
If she didn't experience any emotional distress,

16
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,210
she could have lived for at least 2 or 3 more years.

17
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,280
Do you think it was because

18
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
I upset her and made her angry last time?

19
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,320
Don't talk nonsense.

20
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
It wasn't your fault.

21
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,940
What's wrong, sis?

22
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Nothing.

23
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,079
Don't blame yourself for this.

24
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,410
It's not your fault. It has nothing to do with you.

25
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,060
Why don't you go lie down in your room for a while?

26
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,680
Dr. Jia is here. Please come in.

27
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,040
Okay.

28
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,920
Dr. Jia, thank you for coming.

29
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
I just got back from out of town.

30
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
Mr. Qin, my condolences.

31
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,940
Thank you. Please have a seat.

32
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,040
I just want to know

33
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,970
why my mother suddenly collapsed.

34
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,620
There are two possibilities.

35
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,880
One is surgical complications.

36
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,720
The other is that she was upset

37
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,050
by emotional distress,

38
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,720
triggering a stroke or heart attack.

39
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,640
Liu Wei.

40
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,520
Has my mother contacted you recently?

41
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,120
No.

42
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,820
Why are you asking me this?

43
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,600
I just want to know who could have upset her.

44
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,159
You suspect me?

45
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm just asking.

46
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,480
How could you ask me

47
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,409
such questions at a time like this?

48
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,800
You even came looking for me at home that day.

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,280
I was home all day.

50
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
How could you ask me this?

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm just using process of elimination.

52
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,650
If you haven't contacted her, then forget it.

53
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,020
Huaming told me the surgery was successful.

54
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,400
If things go well,

55
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,880
she could live for two or three more years.

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,409
But emotional stress is the biggest concern.

57
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,850
Who would dare upset her in her condition?

58
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,330
Everyone stayed far away from her.

59
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,920
Maybe it was just complications from Huaming's surgery.

60
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,220
That's also possible.

61
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,850
But he doesn't think so.

62
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,880
He suspects I'm the one who upset his mother to death.

63
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,000
I told you I'm just using process of elimination.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Then I should be the first person you eliminate.

65
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,640
Of course I have to suspect you.

66
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,800
My mother was fine right after surgery.

67
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,880
How did she suddenly end up like this?

68
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Someone must have upset her.

69
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,880
Who else but you could upset her?

70
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,280
Qin Gang.

71
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,560
How can you say that about me?

72
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,890
The person you should suspect is Huaming.

73
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,920
Why?

74
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,120
Maybe there was a problem with his surgery.

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,159
Think about it. He's a quack who has killed patients before.

76
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,960
What kind of skills does he have?

77
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,800
A disease that even American experts couldn't cure,

78
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,330
yet he claims he can cure it?

79
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,640
I bet he just wanted to use the surgery

80
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,480
to scam your mother for money.

81
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,140
For that lousy website of his.

82
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,320
Do you even know how qualified he is?

83
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,680
Have you investigated him?

84
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,240
What right do you have to suspect me?

85
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,600
That's not what I meant.

86
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
Yes, it is.

87
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,280
You are suspecting me.

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,920
Qin Gang.

89
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,880
If I were the kind of woman who could do such a thing,

90
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,720
I would have done it long ago.

91
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,360
Would I have waited until today?

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
I've had enough.

93
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,170
Where are you going?

94
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,460
Can you try to understand me a little?

95
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,960
My mind is in chaos right now.

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,290
Of course I'm going to have wild thoughts.

97
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,660
What you said makes sense.

98
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,640
I'll get to the bottom of this.

99
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,850
You're leaving?

100
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,810
Where are you going?

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,530
I'm going to Shanghai for a research project.

102
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,770
You're taking so much stuff just for a research project?

103
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,320
There are too many memories here.

104
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,780
I don't want to remember anymore. I need to get away for a while.

105
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,020
You're running away, aren't you?

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,130
Why would I be running away?

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,860
Do you think the surgery was successful?

108
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,220
Then why did my mother suddenly end up like this?

109
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,120
Qin Gang, I'm also very sorry about what happened to your mother.

110
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,920
But the surgical plan

111
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,360
was personally developed by Dr. Wei in America.

112
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,200
After the surgical plan arrived in China,

113
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,640
your family reviewed and signed off on it.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
And I assure you, the surgery

115
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
was truly successful.

116
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,400
There were no complications after the surgery.

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,930
I also...

118
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,640
So what you're saying is

119
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,200
I didn't take good care of my mother,

120
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
that I made her so angry she died?

121
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,250
That's not what I meant.

122
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm truly sorry about what happened.

123
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,400
Fine.

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,380
I'm telling you, this matter isn't that simple.

125
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,040
I will get to the bottom of it.

126
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,640
I clearly saw Liu Wei coming out of President Qin's house.

127
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,720
President Qin must have collapsed from anger because of her.

128
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
But you wouldn't let me tell anyone.

129
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,040
You know, since President Qin passed away,

130
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,640
I haven't been able to sleep at night.

131
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,280
My conscience is killing me.

132
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,880
I understand.

133
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,760
But Xu Chunli, you absolutely cannot tell anyone right now.

134
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,890
If you say anything,

135
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm finished.

136
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,010
You'll be finished too.

137
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,000
What do you mean?

138
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,690
Isn't it just that Liu Wei helped you get your position back?

139
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,920
Kaiyang,

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,860
are you hiding something from me?

141
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,240
All I can tell you is

142
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
if anything happens to Liu Wei, I'm in trouble too.

143
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,160
What's going on? Tell me now.

144
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,250
It's not the right time to tell you yet.

145
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,200
If I go to prison, what will happen to you and our child?

146
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,280
Prison?

147
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
What's happening?

148
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,330
You must tell me everything today.

149
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,500
I did something I shouldn't have.

150
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,120
What exactly did you do?

151
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,680
Please don't push me.

152
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,280
If I tell you now...

153
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll be dragging you into this. Do you understand?

154
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,280
Kaiyang, you need to know...

155
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,160
No matter how much we argue or fight...

156
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,020
We're still husband and wife.

157
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
We're the closest people to each other.

158
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,880
If you're not well, I can't be well either.

159
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,760
Whatever happens, you need to tell me.

160
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
We'll face it together.

161
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,440
This situation.

162
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,520
If you feel what you did was wrong...

163
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,640
I'll go with you to turn yourself in.

164
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,440
At worst, when you get out...

165
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,000
We'll be together again.

166
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,490
That's foolish.

167
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
If I turn myself in...

168
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,220
Who will pay the mortgage?

169
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,240
Where will you live without this house?

170
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,810
Who will pay for Xiaoxiao's living expenses?

171
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,140
But I can't just watch you make this mistake.

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,120
I understand.

173
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,300
I promise I'll turn myself in.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
But not now.

175
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,120
Let's talk about it in a few days.

176
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,600
I need to go out first.

177
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,360
Kaiyang.

178
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,760
Let's go turn ourselves in now.

179
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,320
I'll go with you.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,260
You don't understand.

181
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,780
Some things you do, there's no turning back.

182
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,560
After I finish what I'm doing,

183
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,450
I'll turn myself in.

184
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,440
Kaiyang, listen to me.

185
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,140
You must turn yourself in.

186
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
You need to hurry up.

187
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,780
While Qin Gang and Hua Ming are busy with their lawsuit,

188
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
you need to move quickly.

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,080
Transfer all the money

190
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,740
to this account immediately.

191
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,450
Why should I do this?

192
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,840
I've helped you plenty of times.

193
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,680
Besides, you've always gotten your fair share before.

194
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,810
No, it's too little.

195
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,040
Without me, you wouldn't get a penny.

196
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,480
No, without me,

197
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,080
you wouldn't get a penny.

198
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,280
What do you mean?

199
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,770
Didn't we agree on this before?

200
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,810
How can you back out just like that?

201
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,810
It was because President Qin wasn't dead before.

202
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,010
What do you mean?

203
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,260
What does it matter to you whether she's dead or not?

204
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,800
It matters to you.

205
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,960
The day President Qin died,

206
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,440
my wife saw you leaving her house.

207
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,000
Just think if Qin Gang found out his mother

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,460
was driven to death by you.

209
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,920
Think about what would happen.

210
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,900
If anything happens to me,

211
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,120
then your scam to cheat him out of his money

212
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,580
won't stay hidden either.

213
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,120
So,

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,130
we're in the same boat. Neither of us will come out clean.

215
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,290
What do you want?

216
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,680
Half and half.

217
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,680
You're too greedy.

218
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,090
Not negotiable.

219
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,960
Fine.

220
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,280
Half and half.

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
But this matter,

222
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,640
you must take care of it for me right away.

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,900
The sooner the better.

224
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
How are you doing?

225
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,380
Your mother worried about you the most before she passed away.

226
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,050
Did my mom contact you before she died?

227
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,840
No.

228
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,260
I was planning to visit your mother that day,

229
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,100
but then...

230
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,380
Why are you suddenly asking this?

231
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,840
I think

232
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,340
Huaming's surgery is just a scam.

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,400
Why would you think that?

234
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,240
He just wants to use the surgery funds

235
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,500
to maintain his Huaming Online website.

236
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,460
Think about it.

237
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,850
He didn't treat your father back then,

238
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,480
and now he comes back from America

239
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,410
with a surgical plan to deceive me.

240
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,480
He's a complete fraud.

241
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,600
He's a quack.

242
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,280
Qin Gang, I completely understand how you feel right now.

243
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,500
I know you can't accept this reality.

244
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,160
But this is the reality.

245
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,680
You can't treat everyone as your enemy.

246
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,400
Enemy?

247
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,360
Why are you still so naive?

248
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,580
How can you still believe him?

249
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,260
It was just a coincidence.

250
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,010
Could there really be such a coincidence?

251
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,700
I don't want to discuss this with you.

252
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,600
Xinxin.

253
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
From the beginning, he approached you and cared for you

254
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,880
until you fell completely in love with him.

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,160
He did all this just to give himself

256
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,600
a little comfort.

257
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,480
I bet he knew about this from the start.

258
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,720
But he's been hiding it from you all along.

259
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
It's not what you think.

260
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,160
I don't want to hear any more.

261
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,120
He's packing his bags to run away right now.

262
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,880
He's just preparing for a business trip.

263
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Wan Xinxin.

264
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,120
I think in this whole world,

265
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,520
you're the only one who still believes him.

266
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,840
Just wait.

267
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,880
Wait until I investigate this whole matter.

268
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,080
I absolutely won't let him off the hook.

269
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
But I need to warn you.

270
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,000
If Huaming comes back,

271
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,700
no matter what he says or does,

272
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,300
you absolutely cannot let him near Xiaobao.

273
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,080
Because I don't know

274
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,800
what else he might do.

275
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,520
Of course,

276
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,840
if I find out

277
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,500
that he's taken Xiaobao away,

278
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,690
I won't let you off the hook either.

279
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,490
Find me some people.

280
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,600
I want you to hack

281
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,660
that website called Huaming Online.

282
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Oh, and make sure to label it on the website as

283
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,360
a scam site run by murderers.

284
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
Make it as harsh as possible.

285
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,650
Yes, just name your price, whatever it costs.

286
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,440
That's it.

287
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,120
Don't be so angry.

288
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,200
You haven't slept well for days.

289
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,280
What if you get too upset?

290
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,560
I have to do this.

291
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,560
Huaming is a bastard.

292
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,800
I can't let him continue

293
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,660
to harm others under the banner of healing the sick.

294
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,520
How's the investigation at the hospital going?

295
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,280
Chen Weimin won't let me see the surgery records.

296
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,800
He says I don't have the right.

297
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,880
But it doesn't matter.

298
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,010
I've already hired a lawyer to sue him.

299
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,440
If you find something, what do you plan to do?

300
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,960
Huaming is the murderer who killed my mother.

301
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,800
I'll tear him to pieces.

302
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,400
My mother was my only family.

303
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,800
How dare he do this to her.

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
I don't care if he's Huaming or whoever.

305
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,280
I won't let him get away with this.

306
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,080
What about the company matters?

307
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,880
You still need to take care of business.

308
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,520
By the way, weren't you

309
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,160
planning to acquire a company?

310
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,319
Acquire my ass.

311
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,920
Don't be stubborn.

312
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,280
I know.

313
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,160
Your aunt is the most important thing to you right now.

314
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,760
But you still need to handle company business.

315
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,920
Why don't you issue a power of attorney to Jiang Kaiyang?

316
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,780
I'll keep an eye on things for you.

317
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,040
Fine.

318
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,480
Take the company seal tomorrow and issue the authorization.

319
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,440
That's it.

320
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,520
Send.

321
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,320
Sis.

322
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,720
Sis, come take a look.

323
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:33,640
I don't feel well at all.

324
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:33,760
My head hurts.

325
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,000
How did this happen?

326
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,680
I think Qin Gang did it.

327
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
Qin Gang came to see me yesterday.

328
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,720
He said he suspected there was something wrong with Huaming's treatment plan.

329
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,380
That's why Qin's mother passed away so quickly.

330
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,610
What does this have to do with Huaming?

331
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,930
He claims Huaming did it for money.

332
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,800
No way.

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,080
Huaming wouldn't go so far

334
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,680
as to harm someone for money.

335
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,250
That's what I think too.

336
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,160
Given Huaming's character,

337
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't think he would do such a thing.

338
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,520
But Qin Gang insists.

339
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,480
If he keeps making trouble like this,

340
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,010
Huaming's career will eventually be ruined.

341
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,920
What should we do?

342
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,520
Do you think Liu Wei might have upset him?

343
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,400
Liu Wei?

344
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,160
I'm just guessing.

345
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,280
Wait, sis.

346
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,500
Why did you suddenly think of Liu Wei?

347
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,080
I...

348
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,940
Are you hiding something from me?

349
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,520
No.

350
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,160
I...

351
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,280
Listen, sis.

352
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,760
This is a matter of life and death. It's not a small thing.

353
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
If you know something, just tell me.

354
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,480
I'm not sure, so I didn't want to say anything.

355
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,240
Are you going to tell me or not?

356
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,720
That time when I went to Qin Gang's house,

357
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,560
I saw Liu Wei from a distance

358
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,020
coming out of their house.

359
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,640
It was from far away. I couldn't see clearly.

360
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,680
I didn't see very well, just

361
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,200
it looked like her.

362
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,440
Really, it's just like...

363
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,400
Hey, Qin Gang.

364
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,400
Bring Liu Wei to my place.

365
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,980
Okay, I'll be right there.

366
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,760
Hello?

367
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,200
Where are you?

368
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm having tea with a friend. What's up?

369
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,580
Come to Wan Xinxin's gallery right away.

370
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,480
Did something happen?

371
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,440
No.

372
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,200
Come with me later.

373
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,640
Did you go to my house the day my mother fainted?

374
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,440
Who told you that?

375
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,120
Just answer my question.

376
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,480
No.

377
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,360
Why would I lie to you?

378
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,580
Then why did someone say they saw you?

379
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,900
It was them, wasn't it?

380
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,880
Look at them.

381
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,170
Every one of them is on Huaming's side.

382
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,600
Are you afraid something might happen to Huaming

383
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,530
so you're making me take the blame?

384
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,840
Repeat what you just told me.

385
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,880
That day, I took my brother to Qin Gang's house.

386
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,040
I saw you coming out of the door first.

387
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,080
Impossible.

388
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,200
I was at home the whole day.

389
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,320
Well, I did go out once later.

390
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,610
Where did you go?

391
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,320
You'd rather believe what they say

392
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,400
than trust me?

393
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,900
Jiang Kaiyang.

394
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,720
Tell them

395
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,770
what I was doing the day Mr. Qin collapsed.

396
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,560
Which day?

397
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,680
Let me think about it.

398
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Yes, that day.

399
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,560
That day we were discussing business at a café.

400
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,080
We talked for a long time.

401
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,320
That's how it was.

402
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,840
But your wife says

403
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,920
she saw me leaving Mr. Qin's house.

404
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,120
That I made Mr. Qin collapse from anger.

405
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,680
Xu Chunli, what are you doing?

406
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,240
Is something wrong with your head?

407
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:53,920
Kaiyang.

408
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,480
Things are chaotic enough without you making it worse.

409
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,740
What are you thinking?

410
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,360
No, brother-in-law.

411
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
My sister just clearly said she saw it.

412
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,520
Don't you know this is a matter of life and death?

413
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,040
Kaiyang.

414
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,000
Just because of what you said,

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,560
if something happens to Mr. Liu,

416
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,080
can you take responsibility?

417
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,360
It's precisely because it's a matter of life and death.

418
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,320
Well...

419
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,600
Mr. Qin, Mr. Liu, I'm really sorry.

420
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,560
We've caused everyone trouble.

421
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,120
We'll go first.

422
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,760
You can't leave. Sis, what you just said...

423
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,220
Xinxin, this is difficult for me to explain.

424
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,840
It's fine.

425
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,460
I just called you over to ask about it.

426
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,040
Whatever Wan Xinxin says always carries more weight than what I say.

427
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,520
Qin Gang.

428
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,960
You don't need to make excuses for Huaming.

429
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,400
What's fake can never become true.

430
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,980
I'll figure it out myself.

431
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,680
Senior, I'm Hua Ming.

432
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,330
I've almost finished packing up here.

433
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
So, Senior, I'll leave a key for you.

434
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,050
Please drop by my place when you have time.

435
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,920
Hey, your website was hacked.

436
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,160
You didn't know?

437
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,760
Of course I knew.

438
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,240
So...

439
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,770
You're just leaving like this?

440
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,010
It's a good time to shut it down anyway.

441
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,120
Hua Ming.

442
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
That was your dream.

443
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,090
You're giving up so easily?

444
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,240
A lot has happened over the past year.

445
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,440
But Senior, I'm really grateful to you.

446
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,080
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

447
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,720
I truly mean it.

448
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,680
Don't worry, I...

449
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,140
I won't give up on my dream.

450
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,820
I just need to take it slow.

451
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,720
Alright then.

452
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,370
Since you've made up your mind,

453
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
I won't try to persuade you anymore.

454
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,560
I'll courier the key

455
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,490
directly to your secretary later.

456
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,490
You really don't need to see me off.

457
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,920
I'm sorry. I hope you understand.

458
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,090
Why are we being so formal with each other?

459
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,000
What's wrong? You look exhausted.

460
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,280
Mentally exhausted.

461
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,080
I should be

462
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,520
quietly mourning my mother right now.

463
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,200
But now

464
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,610
I have to investigate the surgery,

465
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,920
look into how the medical funds for America were used,

466
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,860
keep an eye on Huaming,

467
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,960
can't let him escape,

468
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,810
and I've just taken over the company completely.

469
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,600
I wanted to review the accounts,

470
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,010
but now I don't have any time at all.

471
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,880
Actually, you don't need to worry too much about the company.

472
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,160
Your mother hasn't been managing it much these years either.

473
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,490
She left everything to the executive CEO.

474
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,860
But I've just taken over completely.

475
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,560
If I don't go to the company or check the accounts,

476
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,890
everyone at the company

477
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,760
will just see me as some rich kid.

478
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,010
I still need to go to the company tomorrow.

479
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,880
It can wait a day or two, can't it?

480
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,700
Of course it's urgent.

481
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,400
I need to call the financial director now

482
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,260
and have him show me the accounts.

483
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,620
Don't call yet.

484
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,640
Let me get you some water first.

485
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
Listen to me, let me explain.

486
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,680
Xinxin.

487
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,080
Hey.

488
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,170
You can't just leave like this.

489
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Look at yourself. You're running around like a headless chicken every day.

490
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,920
You've completely thrown off your own rhythm.

491
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,760
What can I do?

492
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,620
Everything is happening at once.

493
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,520
That's why you need to think long-term.

494
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,100
What do you mean by long-term?

495
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,850
Look at the state you're in.

496
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,210
You have no patience for anything.

497
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,560
Like a wound-up machine about to snap.

498
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,800
If you go to the company like this,

499
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,680
what will the shareholders and executives

500
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,600
think of you?

501
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,280
I don't care what they think.

502
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,360
You're talking nonsense again.

503
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,280
These people are all your aunt's

504
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,120
carefully cultivated partners.

505
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,520
Without their help,

506
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,250
you'll work yourself to death.

507
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,780
Your future still depends on their support.

508
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,850
What do you mean?

509
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,920
I'm letting them support me,

510
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
so my entire future depends on them?

511
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,520
How can I prove

512
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,040
my own abilities this way?

513
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,960
I'm calling the CFO right now.

514
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,960
Calm down, don't be angry.

515
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,320
Listen to me.

516
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,680
Look at yourself,

517
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,210
so agitated and impatient.

518
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,620
This is not how a director of a major company should behave.

519
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,570
That's why I'm asking you to think long-term.

520
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,280
I don't want to see you like this.

521
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,320
Take my advice.

522
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,800
Focus on your current work first.

523
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,680
Calm your mind and prepare yourself.

524
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,520
When the time comes, I'll help you

525
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,320
thoroughly investigate the company's accounts.

526
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,880
Then you can go to each department

527
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,290
and address their issues clearly.

528
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,120
By then,

529
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,660
who would dare question your abilities?

530
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,640
This is your first battle since taking over the company.

531
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,200
You need to not only win but win brilliantly.

532
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,080
But the problem is that these days,

533
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,280
I've let Jiang Kaiyang handle all company matters for me.

534
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,010
I feel uncomfortable about it.

535
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,160
You still have me, don't you?

536
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,880
Don't worry.

537
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,440
Even if everyone else in the world leaves you,

538
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,640
I'll always stand by your side.

539
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
Thank goodness you're here.

540
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,120
If you were to leave me,

541
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,880
I really wouldn't know what to do.

542
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,680
Let me ask you, will you leave me?

543
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,120
How could I?

544
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,120
I'll always be with you.

545
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,200
Let me get you some water.

546
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,000
No need.

547
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,810
I'll just say a few words and leave.

548
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Did you know the website was hacked?

549
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,880
Yes.

550
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,170
It used to be called 'Huaming Online.'

551
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,000
Now it's 'Huaming Offline.'

552
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,780
I'm just shutting it down.

553
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,120
Was Mrs. Qin's death related to the surgery?

554
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,440
No. The surgery was successful.

555
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,640
Now Qin Gang believes

556
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,400
that Mrs. Qin's death was related to the surgery.

557
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Did you know that?

558
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,680
I did.

559
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,330
Do you know why I'm leaving?

560
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,840
Because staying here

561
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,090
has no meaning anymore.

562
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Don't you want to explain yourself?

563
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,410
I don't want to explain.

564
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,360
But now everyone believes

565
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,480
that Mrs. Qin died because of a failed surgery.

566
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,820
It doesn't matter.

567
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,160
Being a doctor is a matter of conscience.

568
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,280
I have a clear conscience, that's enough.

569
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,760
You know better than I do

570
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,720
how important reputation is for a doctor.

571
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,980
You finally picked up the scalpel again,

572
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,980
and now you're just giving up?

573
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,250
I don't care.

574
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,360
I do.

575
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,800
Thank you.

576
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,100
At a time like this,

577
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,480
you still care about my reputation. Thank you.

578
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,170
You misunderstood.

579
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,900
I was the one who begged you to do the surgery.

580
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,920
If something went wrong, I'm responsible.

581
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,640
I came here today to tell you

582
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,040
you can leave, go anywhere you want.

583
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,490
No one will stop you.

584
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,520
But before you go,

585
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,290
you must explain this situation clearly.

586
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,520
Otherwise, I won't let you off the hook.

587
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,840
Xinxin.

588
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
How is Bao doing?

589
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,370
I'm not as mature as you are,

590
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,700
I don't think things through as thoroughly.

591
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,410
But when I set my mind on something,

592
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,540
I will definitely see it through.

593
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,520
When I face difficulties,

594
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,640
I accept them,

595
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,340
and overcome them.

596
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,520
That's what someone I once loved taught me.

597
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,520
Of course, this is your business.

598
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,160
Make your own decision.

599
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,040
You should go upstairs and get some sleep now.

600
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,719
I'll keep track of the time for you.

601
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,120
I'll get you some late-night snacks later.

602
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,960
Your favorite seafood porridge. Okay?

603
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,000
You know what?

604
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,239
You're now the only person

605
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,560
in this world who cares about me.

606
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,639
Alright.

607
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,130
If you behave, I'll care for you even more.

608
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,360
Good boy.

609
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,960
Okay, go now.

610
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,770
Did you two plan this together?

611
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,080
Plan what?

612
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,200
Is there anything else?

613
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm starving. Give me

614
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,050
one serving too.

615
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,700
This is the only pack left.

616
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,080
What is this? It's not properly soaked.

617
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,920
You eat this alone at home?

618
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,660
Does it look like I have any stock at home?

619
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,960
Fine, I'll take this.

620
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,160
When are you leaving?

621
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,010
I'm not leaving.

622
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,370
You're not leaving?

623
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,090
But didn't you already make plans?

624
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
Xinxin came by.

625
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,200
I thought so.

626
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,940
She convinced you to stay?

627
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,660
She asked me to explain everything clearly before I leave.

628
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
That's good news.

629
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,760
I think she's testing you.

630
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,080
Look, her attitude toward you

631
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,560
has softened a lot lately.

632
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,260
I really hope that's true.

633
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,090
I'm afraid I might be reading too much into it.

634
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,520
Why don't I ask her for you?

635
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,480
No, no, no.

636
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,200
I can speak for myself.

637
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,600
Don't help. You'll just make things worse.

638
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,120
You've changed a lot.

639
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,760
You wouldn't say a word before.

640
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,120
Now you're so proactive.

641
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,450
Well, I have to improve.

642
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,580
Although I'm much older than you,

643
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,680
I think you young people

644
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,920
have really good approaches sometimes.

645
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,400
Especially you and Wan Xinxin.

646
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,760
Sometimes to accomplish something,

647
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,290
you're both so determined.

648
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,920
That's how love should be.

649
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,440
Of course, you're different.

650
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,300
You're all over the place. Completely unreliable.

651
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,280
Why do I feel like you're insulting me?

652
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,080
But I'm glad.

653
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,520
And then?

654
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,880
Then there's hope.

655
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,640
I have to try.

656
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,000
And then?

657
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,120
Then since there's hope and I need to try,

658
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,040
I have to work harder.

659
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,770
And then?

660
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,370
Then I think it's really strange that you came today.

661
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,880
And then?

662
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,680
Then I think you just came here for a free meal.

663
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,010
That's right. And then?

664
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,860
Then if you don't leave, I'm going to hit you.

665
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,680
Who wants to eat this terrible noodles? They're not even properly soaked.

666
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,210
And then?

667
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,730
Let's go.

668
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,520
Xu Ke.

669
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,540
Having you as a friend makes me happy.

670
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,610
And then?

671
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,600
Gosh, really.

672
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:40,970
Let's go.

673
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,730
Hua Ming.

674
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,520
Good luck!

675
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,200
Kaiyang, quick!

676
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,240
Tell me what's going on right now.

677
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,040
Worst case, we'll turn ourselves in.

678
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,560
Well...

679
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,160
I know.

680
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,080
But I'm hungry. Can we make dinner first?

681
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,940
After cooking, while I'm eating,

682
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,800
I'll tell you everything.

683
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,960
Fine. During dinner,

684
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,020
you'll tell me everything that's been weighing on you.

685
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,610
Kaiyang.

686
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,810
Kaiyang, open the door.

687
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,640
I'll be back first thing tomorrow morning.

688
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,800
Open the door.

689
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,160
Open up, Kaiyang.

690
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,920
Open the door.

691
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,880
Kaiyang, don't do anything foolish.

692
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,260
Please don't do anything stupid.

693
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,800
I can pick it up with chopsticks.

694
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,640
Try it.

695
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,730
How is it?

696
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,600
It's good.

697
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,780
It fits well. The shoulders are perfect too.

698
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,400
It's good.

699
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,850
You don't need to look anymore.

700
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,890
Starting tomorrow,

701
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,730
all the company assets will belong to you.

702
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,040
They're ours.

703
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,410
What are your plans when you get the money?

704
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,680
You don't need to ask about that.

705
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,680
I just want to know

706
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,640
when I can get my money.

707
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,460
You have to give me some time to sell the company,

708
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,660
and I need to find the right buyer.

709
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,460
Here's what you do.

710
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
First transfer the money to the company account,

711
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
because it's a significant amount.

712
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,180
I hope by tomorrow morning

713
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,400
you'll deposit at least half the money into this account.

714
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,560
You're being too impatient.

715
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,450
Didn't we agree on this?

716
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,170
Qin Gang's company is investing in a new project now,

717
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,300
even if all the money is spent.

718
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:44,840
Li.

719
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:46,800
Li.

720
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,180
Li Wengang.

721
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,760
Jiang Qiaohua.
