1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,289
My brother-in-law isn't that kind of person.

3
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,520
Do you think he might have embezzled public funds?

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,600
Could he have taken bribes?

5
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Could he be under disciplinary investigation?

6
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,200
Impossible.

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,860
Don't let your imagination run wild.

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,600
When my brother-in-law comes back,

9
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,000
you can ask him yourself.

10
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,680
If anything happens to your brother-in-law,

11
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,740
it would be the end of the world for me.

12
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
Xiaoxiao and I couldn't go on living.

13
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,280
You still have me, sis.

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
You still have me.

15
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Brother-in-law.

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,120
How did it go?

17
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,800
Look, he's perfectly fine.

18
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,560
Tell me quickly. What happened?

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,600
Speak up!

20
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,160
Sis, I should probably head back now.

21
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,280
Okay.

22
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,960
Fine, you can go.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
No, I'll contact you later.

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,000
Just put it in the kitchen.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,720
Sure.

26
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,120
Tell me now!

27
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,080
You're driving me crazy.

28
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,600
My political career from today

29
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,440
is over.

30
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,600
Yes.

31
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,890
I don't have time today.

32
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,160
Please reschedule that meeting for me.

33
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,760
Okay?

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,600
Hello?

35
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,040
Hey, Qin Gang,

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,640
when are you coming? I'm waiting to have dinner with you.

37
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,440
I'm going to visit Xiaobao soon.

38
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,360
You'll have to eat lunch by yourself.

39
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,000
Didn't you just visit?

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,329
Why are you going again?

41
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,120
Is it that you can't go a day without seeing Wan Xinxin

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,380
or you feel miserable?

43
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,240
Stop overthinking.

44
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,040
We've already

45
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,440
We've already discussed this clearly before.

46
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Once I sort out the situation with Wan Xinxin,

47
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,920
I'll have something to explain to my mother when she returns.

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,050
It's better for our relationship too.

49
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,920
Then my mother can

50
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,800
stop blaming me

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,840
for everything about the divorce, right?

52
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
But why can't you go another day?

53
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
Why does it have to be today?

54
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,370
Do you know what day it is today?

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,400
Hold on.

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,640
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,800
I'm leaving right away.

58
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,760
Hey, I'm running out of time.

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,840
I'll talk to you later when I get back.

60
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Hello?

61
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
This is illegal parking.

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,100
I'm sorry. Leaving right now.

63
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,320
Hello, this is Liu Wei.

64
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
Notify the legal department.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,240
Immediately collect all the breach

66
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,640
of contract materials from Laidi Company.

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,400
Draft a legal notice and inform Laidi Company.

68
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,060
There's no room for negotiation.

69
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,960
Tell them

70
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,440
if they don't respond

71
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,600
within 24 hours,

72
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,960
we'll take legal action.

73
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
Did you hear me? Do it now.

74
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,160
Mr. Shi.

75
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,080
What is it? Is Wan Xinxin back?

76
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,440
It's not about Wan Xinxin.

77
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,880
YouBei just called.

78
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
What did they say?

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,930
They're preparing a legal notice.

80
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,760
Hello, Mr. Shi.

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,880
Wan Xinxin, how are the negotiations going?

82
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm still

83
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,360
negotiating.

84
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,620
How did you negotiate?

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,360
YouBei Company has already sent us a legal notice.

86
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:00,840
What?

87
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,930
What do you mean 'what'?

88
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,840
Tell me who you were negotiating with.

89
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,770
What exactly happened on your end?

90
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,250
How many things are you hiding from me?

91
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,320
Just wait a moment.

92
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,760
Give me some time.

93
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,960
Why are you panicking?

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,020
If there's a problem, we'll solve it.

95
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,000
Come back right now.

96
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,320
I'm preparing to sue the celebrity agency for breach of contract.

97
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,920
You know the situation best.

98
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,820
Come back so we can discuss it.

99
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,080
But Mr. Shi, do you really want to go to court?

100
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,520
A lawsuit could bankrupt the company.

101
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,200
We'll save what we can.

102
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,440
If we can't, then so be it.

103
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,480
Mr. Shi, please give me some time.

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,760
I promise.

105
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,880
I'll definitely handle this matter properly.

106
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,120
Come back right now. Immediately.

107
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
What happened next?

108
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,760
Then?

109
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,680
You...

110
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,200
Well, um...

111
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,360
That Miss Shen... that company went bankrupt.

112
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,060
It didn't go bankrupt.

113
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,880
It was shut down.

114
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Do you know what her so-called financial company actually was?

115
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,570
Do you have any idea?

116
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,300
It was a loan shark operation.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,760
So our money is completely gone.

118
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,760
Money is not a big deal, Xu Chunli.

119
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,320
The key is

120
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,760
I processed official documents for her.

121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,680
This matter.

122
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,200
Then...

123
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,809
Will the Discipline Inspection Commission arrest you?

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,280
What are we going to do?

125
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,799
What should we do? Tell me.

126
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,039
Why are you wailing? I'm not dead yet.

127
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,919
Now the money is gone too.

128
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
You're going to prison.

129
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,690
What about Xiaoxiao and me?

130
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,090
How am I going to explain this to Xiaoxiao?

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,730
Where are you going?

132
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,080
I'm going to pack up.

133
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,880
You should run away.

134
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,160
Try to see Xiaoxiao

135
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,680
before you go to jail.

136
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,200
Sit down.

137
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
Sit down.

138
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,320
It's not as serious as you think.

139
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,180
Can you stop making things worse?

140
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,920
Not that serious?

141
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,520
They won't arrest you?

142
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,080
My head is a mess right now.

143
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,640
Just let me think, will you?

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,920
After all...

145
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,880
I didn't actually embezzle anything,

146
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,680
nor did I take any bribes, right?

147
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,120
And our family money was scammed too.

148
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,160
That's right.

149
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,960
We're innocent victims who didn't know the truth.

150
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,400
Amitabha.

151
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,760
Losing money avoids bigger disaster.

152
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,880
It's good if there's no serious trouble.

153
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,320
There's still some trouble though.

154
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,200
After all, I was involved in rule violations.

155
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,000
The investigation is unavoidable,

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,800
and I'll face disciplinary action.

157
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,060
That's easy to handle.

158
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,560
We'll write the self-criticism.

159
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
I'll go get paper and pen now.

160
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,400
We'll write it together,

161
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,600
make it really detailed.

162
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,480
No, I won't write anything.

163
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,560
Why should I?

164
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm a deputy division-level government official.

165
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,920
Why should I?

166
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,890
Just think about it.

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,160
Making me read a self-criticism

168
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
in front of hundreds of colleagues.

169
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,600
What about my dignity?

170
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,080
Even if I pass the investigation,

171
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,200
I'll be a person with a stain on my record.

172
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,960
Do you think I can still get promoted, Xu Chunli?

173
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,440
Have you thought about that?

174
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,360
Kaiyang,

175
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,920
you have to write the self-criticism.

176
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't you always say

177
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,240
that you can't improve without admitting mistakes?

178
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,720
Besides, if you don't write it,

179
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
the leadership won't approve.

180
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,720
I don't need their approval.

181
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,180
I've already submitted my resignation.

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,400
Huh? What?

183
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Let me tell you,

184
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,320
I've wanted to quit this civil servant job for a long time.

185
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,200
You know that?

186
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,520
Low pay but too many rules.

187
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,280
Well...

188
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,240
Think about it. I have so little authority,

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,280
but a whole bunch of people watching my every move. What's the point?

190
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,680
But if you stop working,

191
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,560
what will happen to our family?

192
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,960
We all depend on you.

193
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,800
What about our mortgage of over 2 million?

194
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
How will we pay it?

195
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,730
Should our family just live on air?

196
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,800
Xu Chunli,

197
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,760
after all these years of marriage, don't you know me at all?

198
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,440
Am I, Jiang Kaiyang, someone without capability?

199
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,640
Let me tell you,

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
don't forget I've been in government.

201
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,400
Have all these years of struggle been for nothing?

202
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,560
With my work experience, right?

203
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,480
With my analysis of market trends

204
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
and political acumen,

205
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,010
I'm telling you,

206
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,280
I, Jiang Kaiyang, am now

207
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,160
the talent that all major companies dream of having.

208
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,320
I told you before that I, Jiang Kaiyang,

209
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,650
was constrained by my official position.

210
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,000
Now I'm

211
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,320
free.

212
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,960
From now on, I'm going to accomplish great things.

213
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,800
Starting today,

214
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,000
from this very moment.

215
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm hungry.

216
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:38,900
Well...

217
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,680
Hungry.

218
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,690
Okay, I'll go make food.

219
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Good. If you're good, we're all good.

220
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,240
Go, hurry up.

221
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,040
Hurry!

222
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,200
Hurry up!

223
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,240
What are you doing?

224
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Let me tell you, why are you so late?

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's raining, sis, and there's traffic.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,640
What do you want from me?

227
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,120
I know.

228
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,760
No.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,720
Of course I'm here for something important.

230
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,840
Don't you like to do role-playing games?

231
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,700
Role-playing?

232
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,760
Just play a role for me this time.

233
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,080
Who am I playing?

234
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,410
A domineering male CEO.

235
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,090
A domineering male CEO?

236
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,760
From now on, you're not Xu Ke anymore.

237
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,760
If I'm not Xu Ke, then who am I?

238
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,200
From now on,

239
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,050
you are Manager Li from YouBei.

240
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,080
Who?

241
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,080
Manager Li from YouBei. The one we've met before.

242
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,400
I.

243
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,720
Hey, why are you dressed so colorfully today?

244
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,240
Listen.

245
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,680
Let me ask you first.

246
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,640
Why is YouBei Company suing you?

247
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,500
What happened?

248
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,200
I don't have time to explain to you now.

249
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,560
Just remember two things when you go in there.

250
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,200
Tell our female boss when you go up there

251
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
that you will withdraw the lawsuit

252
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
and beg her not to go to court.

253
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,650
Say it and leave. Got it?

254
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,960
Let's go.

255
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,200
Give up. I don't think I can do this.

256
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,730
Xu Ke, I swear I'll kill you.

257
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,740
Where's that devil woman?

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,730
So handsome.

259
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,280
Let's handle it this way. It's fine.

260
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,960
Mr. Shi,

261
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
Manager Li from YouBei is here.

262
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,580
Mr. Shi.

263
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,180
Manager Li.

264
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,360
Well...

265
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,640
What a coincidence. How could it be you?

266
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,570
Yes, how could it be you?

267
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,250
You two know each other?

268
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,960
Yes, we do.

269
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,320
So you're the manager of YouBei.

270
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,040
Yes, he is.

271
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,740
Manager Li, please tell Director Shi

272
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,880
about that situation.

273
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:09,720
What should I say?

274
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,980
Withdraw the lawsuit.

275
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,040
Yes.

276
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,650
Well, yes. I'm Manager Li from YouBei.

277
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
I just wanted to let you know.

278
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,920
Regarding the lawsuit, we're prepared to withdraw it.

279
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,240
So you don't need to prepare

280
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,170
for the court case anymore. Right.

281
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,080
Is that so?

282
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,820
Do you have the authority?

283
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,960
Yes, he does. At their company,

284
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,880
his word is final.

285
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:33,920
Yes, yes.

286
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,440
Alright then. Let's talk in my office.

287
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:38,920
OK.

288
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,560
What?

289
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm saying you can't mess this up.

290
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,720
What's going on with you two?

291
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,680
It's not like that.

292
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,920
This is my true love.

293
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,160
That's her.

294
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,920
You're killing me.

295
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,240
Not her.

296
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,840
Please come in.

297
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,440
Okay.

298
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,610
Let's go.

299
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,000
What should I do?

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,080
Come on.

301
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,650
We're already in this mess.

302
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,160
Why didn't you tell me?

303
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,090
How would I know?

304
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,740
How would I know it was her?

305
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,130
Are you two done with your monkey show?

306
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Can't keep up the act anymore?

307
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,330
You claim to be YouBei's manager, so who is he?

308
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:50,940
Mr. Shi.

309
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
I was wrong.

310
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,380
Do you know any other phrases?

311
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,840
I know what I did was wrong.

312
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,600
But this whole thing was my idea.

313
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,440
I forced Xu Ke to do this.

314
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,880
It has nothing to do with him.

315
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,280
I'll take responsibility for my mistake.

316
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,600
How will you take responsibility?

317
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,730
By finding someone else to deceive me?

318
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,400
I know what I did was definitely wrong.

319
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,160
But I really didn't want

320
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,240
to get you and the company involved in a lawsuit.

321
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,840
That would ruin the company.

322
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,800
Please give me some more time.

323
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,260
I'll definitely find a way

324
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
to recover the company's losses.

325
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,800
I promise.

326
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,290
How can you guarantee that?

327
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,080
Wan Xinxin, tell me yourself.

328
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,760
When have you not made solemn promises?

329
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,560
When have you ever done anything right?

330
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,640
When problems arise, you never face them directly.

331
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,920
You always resort to underhanded methods.

332
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,480
Making things worse and worse.

333
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,920
In the end, others have to clean up your mess.

334
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,980
How can I trust you?

335
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,400
I thought you might have changed with this event.

336
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,840
But in the end, you've messed things up again.

337
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,440
I've told you before.

338
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,140
You can talk to me about anything.

339
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,260
We're not afraid of problems.

340
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,640
As long as we're not at fault,

341
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,400
there's nothing we can't handle.

342
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,460
But what about you?

343
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,690
You brought this guy to deceive me.

344
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,359
You

345
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,730
might be able to fool me.

346
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
But what about everyone else out there?

347
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,420
Can you face your colleagues?

348
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,660
Do you know you're hurting her by doing this?

349
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,240
No one was born to clean up after you.

350
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,920
Wan Xinxin.

351
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,890
I hope next time before you act,

352
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,640
you'll consider the people around you.

353
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,500
Don't just think about yourself.

354
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,360
You can't be so selfish.

355
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,400
That's enough.

356
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,320
Aren't you being a bit harsh?

357
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,020
You have no right to speak.

358
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,400
Mr. Shi.

359
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,780
I was definitely wrong this time.

360
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
Don't worry.

361
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,840
I will definitely find a way

362
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,100
to resolve this issue.

363
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,880
I, Wan Xinxin, keep my word.

364
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,140
I will definitely give you and the company an explanation.

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,480
Wait, is that it?

366
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,840
Hey.

367
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,200
Aren't you being too harsh?

368
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,060
What does this have to do with you?

369
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,400
Nothing.

370
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,600
Everything Wan Xinxin has done for this event

371
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,400
has been witnessed by everyone.

372
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,440
This situation wasn't

373
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,170
what she wanted either, right?

374
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,360
Get out.

375
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,960
Or I'll call someone.

376
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,560
The way you speak so harshly

377
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,640
I don't like it at all.

378
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,400
Get out!

379
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,560
You're cuter when you're drunk.

380
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,520
Hey.

381
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
Liu Wei.

382
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,520
I promise you.

383
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,160
From now on,

384
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,040
my son and I

385
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,580
will never see Qin Gang again.

386
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,800
Please, I'm begging you to leave Laidi alone.

387
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,930
As long as you leave,

388
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,890
I'll withdraw the lawsuit.

389
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,170
But I'm warning you,

390
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,620
don't pull any tricks like last time.

391
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,240
Otherwise, I guarantee

392
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,040
you won't even know what hit you.

393
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,650
I, Wan Xinxin, always keep my word.

394
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,920
Don't worry.

395
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,020
Xinxin.

396
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
Xinxin, where are you going?

397
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
I want to go home.

398
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
I want to see my brother.

399
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,140
Let me take you.

400
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,560
No need, Xu Ke.

401
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,210
I want to walk alone.

402
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,600
No.

403
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,600
What happened? What's going on?

404
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,520
I recommended this job to you.

405
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,280
If there's a problem, I'll definitely

406
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,360
go talk to them.

407
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,040
Don't go.

408
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,280
It's nothing. Really, it's nothing.

409
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,360
I've already resolved it.

410
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,800
Really, it's all taken care of.

411
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,080
Don't be like this. You're scaring me.

412
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,240
I'm sorry for putting you in an awkward position earlier.

413
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,560
But I don't feel guilty.

414
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,620
Didn't I help you find your true love?

415
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
Don't change the subject.

416
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,320
What exactly happened?

417
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,480
Can you please tell me what went wrong?

418
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,880
Really, it's nothing.

419
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,120
I'm leaving. Bye.

420
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,760
Bye.

421
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,440
No, call me when you get home.

422
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,880
I'm Xu Ke.

423
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,040
Never mind who I am.

424
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,760
I'm looking for your boss Li.

425
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,040
No need to apologize.

426
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,640
Listen, I have his private photos.

427
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,920
He must see me, understand?

428
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,880
That's final.

429
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,240
Take it easy.

430
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,810
What are you looking at?

431
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,810
Nothing.

432
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,730
Support the head when you hold him.

433
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,520
Look at daddy.

434
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,650
Daddy needs to learn how to hold us. Got it?

435
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,680
Okay.

436
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,020
Say hi to uncle.

437
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Why hasn't Wan Xinxin come back yet?

438
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,920
Xinxin's company has some issues.

439
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,240
If you're in a hurry, you can go ahead.

440
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,700
She's troubled right now.

441
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,280
What could possibly be happening at that lousy company of hers?

442
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,920
My mom is coming back soon.

443
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,600
I need to arrange for my mom to see the child.

444
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,320
Talk to her about it quickly.

445
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,720
By the way, has she mentioned anything to you recently?

446
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,400
She hasn't changed her mind about letting my mom see the child, has she?

447
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,600
You make Xinxin sound so unreasonable.

448
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,380
She doesn't make a fuss over nothing.

449
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,200
Mommy doesn't make unreasonable demands, right?

450
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
She just has a strong sense of pride.

451
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,620
Strong sense of pride?

452
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,080
You've never lived with her.

453
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,120
That's not pride.

454
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,320
What she does is simply making unreasonable demands.

455
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,200
Come here.

456
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,360
Let's take a look.

457
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,880
Listen carefully.

458
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,640
When Wan Xinxin comes back,

459
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,760
be extremely careful what you say,

460
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,520
or just keep your mouth shut.

461
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,000
If you must speak, say only nice things.

462
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,600
You don't know her well enough yet.

463
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,560
If you stroke her fur the right way,

464
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,840
she's just a big kitten.

465
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
But if you rub her the wrong way,

466
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,760
she turns into a lioness

467
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,620
who'll tear you apart in seconds.

468
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,760
You're laughing?

469
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,000
You mean she's

470
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,800
just too young and immature?

471
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,280
Nothing like my wife, right?

472
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,800
Not mature at all, huh?

473
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,760
What's wrong with you?

474
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,800
Why didn't you say this

475
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,000
when you married her?

476
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,600
Now she's already had your child,

477
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,460
and you're calling her immature?

478
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,440
Really?

479
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,320
You're a grown man. You know how it is.

480
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,880
When we first got together,

481
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,000
I thought she was fun.

482
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,880
We ate, drank, and had a good time.

483
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,840
It was enjoyable, never boring.

484
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,120
Who knew she'd take it so seriously?

485
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,280
She seemed carefree at first,

486
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,880
but once she got serious, she was dead serious.

487
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,410
She insisted on marrying me

488
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,880
and then got pregnant with my child.

489
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,080
My mother was desperate for a grandchild,

490
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,920
and Liu Wei was abroad at that time.

491
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,880
So I thought,

492
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,810
life with anyone is still life,

493
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,360
and marrying anyone is still marriage.

494
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,480
So I just mindlessly married her.

495
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,560
Looking back now, it feels like a joke.

496
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,680
You just used four words

497
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,480
that perfectly describe your marriage: 'mindlessly.'

498
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,680
How can you be mindless about marriage?

499
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,440
You say Wan Xinxin is childish like a little girl,

500
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,400
but let me tell you,

501
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,330
you should become a real man first.

502
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,570
Don't you think?

503
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,160
Dr. Hua,

504
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,920
you don't seem like a veterinarian

505
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,780
but more like a doctor for people.

506
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm more than qualified to treat you.

507
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,080
You're talking

508
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,840
like you're some relationship expert.

509
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,600
I bet you studied psychology,

510
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,440
a therapist.

511
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,200
How come I've never seen your wife and kids?

512
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,760
Haven't found someone yet,

513
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,850
or are you in the same boat as me?

514
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,600
Hey, we're addressing your issues here,

515
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,260
reflect on yourself instead of questioning me.

516
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,640
Wan Xinxin isn't childish,

517
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,360
but you're acting like a gossip.

518
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,400
You love to gossip so much,

519
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
you're the embodiment of gossip itself.

520
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,610
Come on, hit him!

521
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,680
Don't cry. Be good.

522
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,640
Daddy is mean.

523
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,340
No more crying.

524
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,200
Xinxin.

525
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,600
Xinxin.

526
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,340
Wan Xinxin.

527
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,640
You two are having quite a nice chat.

528
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,320
Should I buy you both a couple of bottles?

529
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,120
So you can have a drink together.

530
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,500
There's nothing going on between us.

531
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,680
Not funny.

532
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,720
Well...

533
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,520
I brought the baby out to get some sunshine,

534
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,720
to help him get some vitamin D,

535
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,040
and just happened to run into Qin Gang coming to see the baby.

536
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,440
I mean, he's the child's father,

537
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,800
we can't keep him from seeing his child, right?

538
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,130
Qin Gang, don't you have something to say?

539
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,050
It must be tough.

540
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,040
Take care of yourself and get some rest.

541
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,090
Huaming, let's go home.

542
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,640
Xinxin, Qin Gang, didn't you

543
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,170
buy something for the baby?

544
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,660
I bought formula for the baby.

545
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,530
Look, he bought a bunch of formula.

546
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,280
I didn't know which brand was best,

547
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,480
so I just picked the most expensive one.

548
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,720
You're really generous when it comes to spending on the baby.

549
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,360
I also bought clothes for the baby.

550
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,040
That's taken care of.

551
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,280
I didn't know which clothes would be suitable,

552
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,600
but the sales assistant told me

553
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,400
these are this year's trendy new styles.

554
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,480
Trendy brands are definitely expensive.

555
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,200
The baby will look so cute wearing them.

556
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,930
I also bought toys for the baby.

557
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,880
Toys.

558
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,880
Suitable for ages one to six.

559
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
They said

560
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,200
these toys are especially good for developing a child's intelligence.

561
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,160
But never mind that, are these intelligence-developing toys expensive?

562
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,240
It's expensive and educational.

563
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,320
You're so generous with your kid.

564
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,250
Are you two doing a comedy routine?

565
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,720
Xinxin.

566
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,850
Take it away.

567
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,400
Wan Xinxin.

568
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,280
Take it all away.

569
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,000
Wan Xinxin.

570
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,200
Qin Gang came to see the child.

571
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,160
He doesn't mean any harm.

572
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,890
He bought all these things with good intentions.

573
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
You're upset, aren't you?

574
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
Did you resolve your work issue?

575
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,690
It's none of your business.

576
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,600
Qin Gang, did you see that?

577
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,120
I'm stressed out from work.

578
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,520
Just talk to me properly.

579
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,600
Xinxin.

580
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
You should stop working from now on.

581
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,040
Just stay home and take care of our child.

582
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,640
I'll take care of everything else.

583
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,770
My mother will feel at ease when she comes to see the baby.

584
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,360
Qin Gang.

585
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,260
From now on, this child

586
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,440
has nothing to do with you anymore.

587
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,570
Nothing to do with your family either.

588
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,160
Stop disturbing my life.

589
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,280
Didn't we agree on everything before?

590
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,340
Why are you changing your mind again?

591
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,170
I did agree with you before,

592
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,000
but now I've changed my mind.

593
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,000
That's just how fickle I am.

594
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,100
Wan Xinxin, I am this child's father.

595
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,640
My mother is this child's grandmother.

596
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,720
A father buying things for his son.

597
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,800
A grandmother wanting to see her grandson.

598
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,600
What's wrong with that?

599
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,760
Are you being reasonable at all?

600
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,680
I've never been reasonable anyway.

601
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,120
You were talking fine. Why are you arguing again?

602
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,640
What's going on?

603
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,280
Shut up.

604
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,320
Qin Gang, if you really care about our child

605
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,160
then don't come to see him anymore.

606
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,120
I'll pay you back that 100,000 yuan

607
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,200
okay?

608
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,960
What are you thinking about?

609
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,080
You're acting like a lunatic.

610
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,160
What exactly are you trying to do?

611
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,320
Yes, I am crazy.

612
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,960
Just treat me like a nightmare and forget about me.

613
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Or treat me like a fart and let me go.

614
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,920
Either way is fine.

615
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,840
From now on, we'll stay out of each other's way.

616
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,200
Never speak to each other again. Never see each other again.

617
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,520
I wish you happiness

618
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,720
and a long life together.

619
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,240
Enough.

620
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,880
Listen, don't be so shameless.

621
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,360
If you keep making unreasonable scenes like this

622
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,690
don't blame me for getting tough with you.

623
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,680
I give up.

624
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,000
Qin Gang, please, I'm begging you

625
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,140
don't come see our child anymore.

626
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,000
No way.

627
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,360
His grandmother needs to see her grandson.

628
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,000
Qin Gang!

629
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,760
What are you doing?

630
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,600
What are you doing, Qin Gang?

631
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,560
Don't hurt the child!

632
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,320
Qin Gang!

633
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,440
Even if I die

634
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,160
I won't let you take my child away.

635
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,280
Let me tell you straight - I am this child's father

636
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,840
and I have custody rights too.

637
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,370
I'm laying it out right now.

638
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
Whether we go to court or file a lawsuit

639
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,160
we'll see how this plays out.

640
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,490
Lock me up then, Qin Gang

641
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,800
so I never have to see you again.

642
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,720
Let go of me!

643
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,680
Fine.

644
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,840
Mr. Shi

645
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,680
come in.

646
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,640
The legal notice for

647
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,120
the entertainment company is ready.

648
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
Should we send it now?

649
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,920
Mr. Shi, Wan Xinxin has resigned.

650
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
She wasn't actually our formal employee.

651
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,440
There was an issue with the YouBei event.

652
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
In principle, we could distance ourselves from it.

653
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,500
Hold off on sending the legal notice.

654
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,800
Call YouBei company

655
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,080
and tell them I want to meet with them.

656
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,140
But their CEO Li is out of the country.

657
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,320
Then call his assistant.

658
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,660
I need to find out exactly what happened.

659
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,680
Um...

660
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,640
It's all good now, uncle.

661
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
You can go back first.

662
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,120
Is there something wrong with this event?

663
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,080
No problem,

664
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,890
it's going well.

665
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,980
Everything's been resolved.

666
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,240
I'm leaving now.

667
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,800
Okay.

668
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,340
You finally decided to come back.

669
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,400
This family of three seems to be having fun.

670
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,520
They're completely exhausted.

671
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,720
Is there anything to eat? I'm starving.

672
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,440
Why am I waiting on them hand and foot

673
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,460
and can't even get a meal out of it?

674
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm telling you, women,

675
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,060
how do you even think about problems?

676
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,800
Why are you so impulsive

677
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,400
Can't you solve problems more rationally?

678
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,920
Why are you angry at me?

679
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,320
Tell me.

680
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,240
Did Wan Xinxin upset you again?

681
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,100
Don't even mention it. It was your terrible idea

682
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,200
insisting I should be nicer to Wan Xinxin.

683
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,480
I've been good to her,

684
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
but now she's taking advantage of me.

685
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,640
Really?

686
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,940
Maybe she's just being coquettish with you.

687
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,360
Don't be so insensitive.

688
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,140
Let me tell you something.

689
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,760
Now Wan Xinxin won't let my mom see Little Bao again.

690
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,220
My mom is coming back soon.

691
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,920
If she can't see her grandson then,

692
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,320
we'll both be in trouble.

693
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,200
Really?

694
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,160
That's pretty good then.

695
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,530
Good? What's good about it?

696
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,080
Do you really want to see my mother

697
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,410
kick me out of the house?

698
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,600
You've been more than generous to her.

699
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,200
Why won't she let the old lady see her grandson?

700
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,080
Her character is just terrible.

701
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,160
I think the old lady

702
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,760
won't blame it all on you.

703
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,400
I just don't understand.

704
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
Why is Wan Xinxin making such a fuss?

705
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,330
What exactly does she want?

706
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,800
You can't even see what's going on?

707
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,880
No wonder your mother

708
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,040
won't let you manage the family business.

709
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,100
But it makes sense.

710
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,840
If you could see through her,

711
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,760
you wouldn't have married her and had a child.

712
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,760
Look at you now.

713
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,020
She's got you wrapped around her finger.

714
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,960
As long as my mother can see the child,

715
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,280
I'll give Wan Xinxin whatever she wants.

716
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,520
But the problem is she not only refuses to take anything,

717
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,000
she even wants to return

718
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,050
everything I've given her before.

719
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,880
She's playing hard to get.

720
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,500
And you're falling for it.

721
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,200
How much can you really give her?

722
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,260
You're seriously underestimating Wan Xinxin.

723
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
As long as she has the child,

724
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,240
she holds a priceless treasure.

725
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,280
According to your mother's wishes,

726
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
your family's assets will eventually be hers anyway.

727
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,200
Not hers. My son's.

728
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,760
I am this child's father.

729
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,220
I have custody rights too.

730
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,080
If this continues,

731
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,800
I'll fight for custody in court if I have to.

732
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,370
You're not really planning

733
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,620
to fight her for custody, are you?

734
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,620
He's my son. Why wouldn't I fight for him?

735
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,680
But I heard that when a child is nursing,

736
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
custody usually goes to the mother.

737
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,760
Nursing period.

738
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,880
As long as I'm alive,

739
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,850
I'll fight her till the end.

740
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
Alright, alright.

741
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,440
Why are you getting so angry?

742
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,170
What if you make yourself sick?

743
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,719
Who's provoking me here?

744
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,040
If you didn't provoke me,

745
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,560
how could I provoke you?

746
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,290
Some people are really something,

747
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,960
forgetting what day it is today.

748
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,889
It's your birthday, right?

749
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,449
You still remember.

750
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,130
Where's my gift?

751
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,159
Let's go buy it now.

752
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,040
Brother Wang.

753
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,239
I'm Xu Ke.

754
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,250
You can't play me like this. Are you trying to ruin me?

755
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,239
Look, if you can't help me, who can?

756
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,240
Where are you? I'll come find you right now.

757
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,160
Are you with Manager Shi?

758
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,160
No, where are you guys?

759
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,420
I'm coming to find you right now. Really.

760
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
Stop joking around. I'm begging you.

761
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,240
Be careful or I'll take those nightclub photos

762
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,840
and edit them into a scandal.

763
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,730
I'll wait for you. Send me the address.

764
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,600
Alright.

765
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,920
Damn it.

766
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,120
This is from my personal collection,

767
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,840
Château Latour 2011 vintage.

768
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,320
I'd like to share it with you.

769
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,770
Miss Shi, you've done your homework well.

770
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,440
You even know about my little hobby.

771
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,360
In our PR business,

772
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,000
if we don't know what our clients like,

773
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,760
we might as well quit.

774
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,240
Besides,

775
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,410
you're the CEO's first assistant.

776
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,920
You personally manage everything in this company.

777
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,450
Everyone knows who you are.

778
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,320
Miss Shi, you're truly talented and beautiful.

779
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,800
I believe Lady Company's influence

780
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,080
in the industry

781
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
must be largely due to your efforts.

782
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,320
You're too kind, Mr. Wang.

783
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,000
I'll need your support in the future.

784
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,060
Listen, Director Shi.

785
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
I know why you invited me here today.

786
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,760
About that matter...

787
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,760
It could be easy to handle.

788
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,970
But it could also be difficult,

789
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,170
very difficult indeed.

790
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,610
I think you misunderstood.

791
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,680
I came today not just to solve problems,

792
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,100
but also to make friends with you.

793
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,760
Well then, since we're friends,

794
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,320
we should have a proper drink today.

795
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,360
Waiter, open all of these bottles.

796
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,890
I didn't expect you to be so straightforward.

797
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,880
Good. Let me pour you a drink.

798
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,680
You've done me a great honor today

799
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,460
and I truly appreciate it.

800
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,480
Whether we resolve today's matter or not,

801
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,320
I consider you a friend from now on.

802
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,520
Here, I offer you the first glass.

803
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,660
Bottoms up!

804
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
This second glass

805
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,040
is my apology to you.

806
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,960
Our company has caused you a lot of trouble.

807
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,240
If we've offended you in any way,

808
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,880
I hope with this drink,

809
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,920
you can forgive us.

810
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
I'll drink it all.

811
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,120
Good.

812
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,440
Miss Shi, you truly are a remarkable woman.

813
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,520
Just for that,

814
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,050
I must offer you another drink.

815
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,330
Come.

816
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,200
Let's have another round.

817
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,360
If it's difficult for you, Miss Shi, then never mind.

818
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,000
Come on, Brother Hui, have some food.

819
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,720
You've had too much to drink. Eat more dishes.

820
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,360
Wait.

821
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,640
What did you just call me?

822
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,650
Brother Hui.

823
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,850
Brother Hui.

824
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,200
I like that name.

825
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,480
Just call me Brother Hui.

826
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,320
You can't ignore your sister's situation.

827
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,090
About your problem,

828
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,960
it's actually quite simple.

829
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,560
Just call Manager Li

830
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,360
and ask for a favor for your sister.

831
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,760
It depends on how sincere you are.

832
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,820
Then let me and Hui have a cross-cup toast

833
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,440
to show my sincerity.

834
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,640
Wait a minute.

835
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,530
You know each other?

836
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,720
Wang, let me tell you something.

837
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,680
This is my girlfriend.

838
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,400
You're talking nonsense.

839
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,660
Stop having ideas about her. You hear me?

840
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,960
Mr. Wang, please don't misunderstand.

841
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,360
I don't know this person.

842
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,440
We just had a fight today.

843
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,300
I'm sorry for the embarrassment.

844
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,840
Get out.

845
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,810
I need to talk with Mr. Wang.

846
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,840
Wait, what are you discussing with him?

847
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,170
He's just an assistant.

848
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,240
It's just drinking. Come on.

849
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,940
Come, I'll drink with you.

850
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,220
Hey, Wang... I mean, Assistant Wang.

851
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,650
I'll drink with you.

852
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,920
I'm sorry.

853
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,400
I apologize for interrupting your meal.

854
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,720
Please accept my apologies.

855
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,360
I'll drink it all.

856
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,880
I won't drink.

857
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,720
Wang Hui, let me tell you.

858
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,040
If you don't want your wife to know

859
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,120
about your little affairs at the nightclub,

860
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,400
finish this drink

861
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,330
and get the hell out of here.

862
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,280
Well, since you two have things to discuss,

863
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,480
I'll leave you alone.

864
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,640
I have another appointment this afternoon.

865
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,720
No need to see me out.

866
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,400
Mr. Wang.

867
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,600
Lulu.

868
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,660
What are you doing?

869
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,720
Why are you shouting?

870
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,020
Don't be angry.

871
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,440
Don't you enjoy drinking with people?

872
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,840
Here's the deal. I'll help you get this done

873
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,640
if you finish all these drinks with me today.

874
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,860
How about that?

875
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,020
Don't worry, baby.

876
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,200
Mommy won't let him take you away.

877
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,360
Liu Wei.

878
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,690
I've already promised you.

879
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,920
I'll leave as soon as possible.

880
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,800
Li.

881
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:46,800
Li.

882
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,240
Li Wenwang.

883
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,760
Jiang Qiaohua.
