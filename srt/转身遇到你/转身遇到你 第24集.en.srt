1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Presiding Judge and Judicial Panel

3
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,680
I have

4
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,600
important information to add.

5
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,280
Wan Xinxin has been

6
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,640
fired multiple times over the past few months.

7
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,840
She has been unemployed for a long time.

8
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,880
Even her basic living expenses

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,760
have to be supported by her friends and family.

10
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,440
So from a financial standpoint,

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,880
Wan Xinxin simply doesn't have

12
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
the ability to raise a child.

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,250
Does the defense attorney have any explanation?

14
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,120
My client is running an art gallery

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,980
and has already received orders.

16
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,920
Based on the current income projections in the art industry,

17
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,200
my client does not have

18
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,860
any financial difficulties.

19
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,840
Your Honor,

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,640
as far as I know,

21
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,280
Wan Xinxin only opened the gallery

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,680
after receiving my legal notice.

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,210
This is clearly just to deal with the lawsuit.

24
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,079
Besides, how much could her paintings possibly be worth?

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,520
So I'm very concerned about

26
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,850
the environment my child is growing up in.

27
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,520
My child's nutrition is also an issue.

28
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
That's nonsense!

29
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,000
Even if I go hungry myself,

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
I would never let my son starve.

31
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,520
And let me tell you,

32
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,760
Xiaobao is very healthy and happy now.

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,440
Is that so?

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,120
Then why did you come to my house

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,440
to stay for a while?

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Your Honor, he tricked me into going there.

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,800
Order!

38
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,480
Do the prosecution or defense have anything to add?

39
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,080
No.

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,280
No.

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,920
Court is adjourned. The verdict will be announced shortly.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,240
Don't worry, Xinxin.

43
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,930
The child is very young now,

44
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,240
courts usually tend to rule in favor of the mother.

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,440
Really?

46
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,320
Really.

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,560
But my eye keeps twitching. What should I do?

48
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,250
It's okay. I'm here for you.

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,160
All rise.

50
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,890
The court will now announce its decision.

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,120
In accordance with the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China,

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,200
Article 36, Paragraph 3,

53
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,880
the Supreme People's Court,

54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
regarding the handling of divorce cases by people's courts,

55
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,760
and the custody of children,

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,120
specific opinions,

57
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,160
Article 3, Item 3,

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,840
and Article 16, Item 4,

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,530
the court rules as follows:

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,159
From the effective date of this judgment,

61
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,600
the child of plaintiff Qin Gang and defendant Wan Xinxin,

62
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,320
Wan Xiaobao,

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,360
shall live with the plaintiff Qin Gang.

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,680
The case filing fee of 100 yuan

65
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,240
shall be borne by the defendant Wan Xinxin.

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,080
If you disagree with this judgment,

67
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,440
you may submit an appeal to this court within 15 days

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,450
from the date of service of this judgment.

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
Court is adjourned.

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,000
Xinxin.

71
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,580
Xinxin, I'm coming in.

72
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,040
Xinxin.

73
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,360
I brought your favorite food.

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,920
Super spicy beef noodles. Have a bite.

75
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
Don't be afraid.

76
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,010
Don't be like this, Xinxin.

77
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,920
This is just the first trial, not the final result.

78
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,360
Please leave. I want to be alone for a while.

79
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,440
Wan Xinxin.

80
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,600
But you know what?

81
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,120
This is just the first trial.

82
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,880
There will be a second trial after this.

83
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,440
And then a final trial.

84
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,080
This isn't the final result.

85
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,440
As long as we don't give up and keep fighting.

86
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,520
If you want to continue with the lawsuit,

87
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,580
I'll stay by your side the whole time.

88
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
I know why you're upset now.

89
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
It's because

90
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,160
you feel like you've let Bao down

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,100
and can't do anything for him.

92
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,180
But let me tell you something.

93
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,010
You've put in more than enough effort.

94
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,840
I can see that for Bao,

95
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,920
you're willing to sacrifice everything.

96
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,840
You'd even risk your life for him.

97
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,970
I remember when I first met you.

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,040
You've become a completely different person now.

99
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,360
You used to be stubborn and willful,

100
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
nothing like a mother.

101
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
But now, in my eyes,

102
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,740
you are definitely a good mother.

103
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,450
There will be many more challenges ahead.

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,600
But don't be afraid. Trust me.

105
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,920
Xu Ke, your sister, and I,

106
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,080
we'll all stay by your side.

107
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,810
Come out for dinner when you're ready.

108
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,240
Don't cry.

109
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,640
Stop crying.

110
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,200
Mom will never let anyone

111
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
take you away.

112
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,200
Congratulations on your first victory.

113
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,210
What are you talking about?

114
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,890
This is a complete victory.

115
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,600
Fine, then I wish you

116
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,120
continued success.

117
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,880
From what you're saying, you're afraid

118
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,080
Wan Xinxin will fight back, aren't you?

119
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
Does she even have that ability?

120
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,860
Doesn't she have Hua Ming by her side?

121
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,460
Hua Ming won't stand by and do nothing about her situation.

122
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Wan Xinxin has no ability to raise a child.

123
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,580
That's an indisputable fact.

124
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,160
Although Hua Ming gave her

125
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,760
that shabby little gallery,

126
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
with her limited abilities,

127
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,000
how could she possibly fulfill customer commissions?

128
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,840
Even if I didn't sabotage her behind her back,

129
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,520
she still couldn't complete them.

130
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,200
Fine, even if she struggles a bit

131
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,840
and paints a few pictures,

132
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,970
would I let things go smoothly for her?

133
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,370
Now that you're about to get the property,

134
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,760
have you

135
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,040
completely forgotten about marrying me?

136
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,400
I haven't forgotten.

137
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,440
Just wait to become Mrs. Qin.

138
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,320
Don't you ever paint yourself?

139
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,680
Don't you ever knock?

140
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,680
Hello.

141
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,380
You don't know me. My name is Hua Ming.

142
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,840
But you've met my friend, Wan Xinxin.

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,930
What do you want?

144
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,760
I'd like to tell you a story.

145
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,290
Of course, it'll only take 10 minutes of your time. Is that okay?

146
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,440
Do you really think

147
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,200
I have the power to save a child?

148
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,410
It would at least help a little.

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,200
Starting today,

150
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,560
I'll praise Wan Xinxin on Weibo,

151
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,720
so she can get orders from collectors,

152
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,810
proving she can support her child,

153
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,520
and the child will stay with her. Is that it?

154
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,040
Yes.

155
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
You're dreaming.

156
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,560
I'm an art critic.

157
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,680
I will never go against my conscience and call black white.

158
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,120
Bad is bad.

159
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,280
Miss Jiang Xiaoyu,

160
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,760
I'm not asking you to go against your conscience.

161
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,920
You don't have to be so harsh on her, at least.

162
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,450
Actually, I'm helping her.

163
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,880
Let me be honest with you.

164
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,720
I think she's very talented.

165
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,240
In her previous works,

166
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,700
I could see her potential.

167
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
But what she's painting now,

168
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
what are these things?

169
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,960
Maybe it's because Wan Xinxin is a mother now,

170
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,760
she probably has a lot on her mind.

171
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
By the way, could you

172
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,320
help her get back to her original state?

173
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,520
I'm sorry, I'm an art critic,

174
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
not an art teacher.

175
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Goodbye. Don't see me out.

176
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Xiaoyu.

177
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,000
Brother,

178
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
look, do you like the fruit I brought you?

179
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,200
I like it. You're always so good to me.

180
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,640
Look, your hair has changed.

181
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,480
Let's go.

182
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,280
Come on.

183
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,760
Hello, excuse me,

184
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,120
where can I find Dr. Chen Weimin?

185
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,050
He's over there.

186
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,400
Thank you.

187
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,400
Dr. Chen.

188
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,460
This isn't the consultation room. You should go to-

189
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,320
Huaming.

190
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,900
Senior.

191
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,640
Huaming, what brings you here?

192
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,130
Long time no see.

193
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,570
Which hospital are you working at now?

194
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,960
You're not practicing medicine anymore?

195
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,120
What a waste!

196
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,490
Back then, you were our hospital's

197
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,000
top neurosurgeon.

198
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,850
When you were a specialist,

199
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,500
I was just a junior doctor.

200
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,680
You're too kind, senior.

201
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Aren't you the deputy director now?

202
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
It's just an empty title.

203
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,580
This private hospital

204
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,530
belongs to my classmate's father.

205
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,400
They hired me just for peace of mind.

206
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,600
When it comes to talent and skill,

207
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,980
I can't compare to you.

208
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,770
You're too modest, senior.

209
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,440
I'm here about Jiang Xiaoyu.

210
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,600
Let me explain something first.

211
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,490
Jiang Xiaoyu isn't my girlfriend.

212
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,850
She's my cousin.

213
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,730
Since she started college, every weekend

214
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I check on her for her parents.

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,660
Bringing her food and drinks.

216
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,380
About what you told me,

217
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,040
I can try to persuade her for you.

218
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,400
Senior, if you really help me with this,

219
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,490
I'll definitely find a way to thank you properly.

220
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,460
If you really want to thank me,

221
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,610
there's an opportunity right now.

222
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,160
Neurosurgery is our hospital's weakness.

223
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,500
If you could come work with us,

224
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,740
our hospital would gain a prestigious name.

225
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,240
Then I could tell everyone

226
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,240
that our hospital is an authority in neurosurgery.

227
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,760
Well...

228
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,520
I've been away from practice for so many years.

229
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,360
Really, I can't go back.

230
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,920
This is like

231
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,080
burying gold underground.

232
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,360
A complete waste.

233
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,360
I'm sincerely inviting you to join us.

234
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,120
I'll have all the hospital staff

235
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,060
host a banquet to welcome you.

236
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
I believe in your sincerity,

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,860
but really, it's been too long. I'm out of practice.

238
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,160
It's only been three or four years. Is it that serious?

239
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,880
Surely not.

240
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,160
Let me tell you something.

241
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,880
If you don't come work with us,

242
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,740
I can't guarantee anything about Xiaoyu's situation.

243
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,880
Why didn't you save me?

244
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,860
Why didn't you save me?

245
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,440
Why didn't you save me?

246
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,920
Why didn't you save me?

247
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,460
Why didn't you save me?

248
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,000
Quite impressive.

249
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,250
What are you doing here?

250
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,620
I came to see your precious son

251
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,570
and have a little chat with you.

252
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,240
Huaming.

253
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
This is the office prepared for you.

254
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,320
Huaming told me everything about your situation.

255
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,450
I really admire you.

256
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,960
If it were me, I would have given up long ago.

257
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,820
Motherhood makes you strong.

258
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,580
That's what he told me.

259
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,160
You two make a good match.

260
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,720
You're quite the gossip,

261
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,290
Teacher Xiaoyu.

262
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,360
If you came here today to lecture me,

263
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,050
it's really not necessary.

264
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,650
I know I'm not good material for painting.

265
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
I'm already neck-deep in lawsuits.

266
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,220
I didn't come here with any hostility today.

267
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,690
Can we sit down and talk?

268
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,160
Senior.

269
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,080
Is this okay now?

270
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,440
It's just a sebaceous cyst removal on the scalp.

271
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,010
It's the most minor surgery possible.

272
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,160
Okay.

273
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,240
When I first saw your paintings,

274
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,330
I thought they were quite good.

275
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,200
But after seeing your sketches,

276
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I couldn't believe they were yours.

277
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,930
At least not done by who you are now.

278
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,200
If you're not a fraud,

279
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,450
you need to prove yourself.

280
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,560
Find your original skill level.

281
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,020
Find your true self again.

282
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,800
Right now,

283
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,240
I really don't know

284
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,840
if I can find myself again.

285
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,440
I'll try my best.

286
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,240
Are you still willing to give me this chance?

287
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,570
I'm willing to help you.

288
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,440
Did Huaming talk to you about something?

289
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,640
Didn't we agree on an exchange?

290
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,520
What exchange?

291
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,890
I help you find inspiration, and Huaming helps my brother at the hospital.

292
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,840
Murderer! Murderer!

293
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,800
No!

294
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,760
Dr. Chen, you take over.

295
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,960
Miss Wan.

296
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,640
The date for the appeal hearing has been set.

297
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,840
It's next Wednesday.

298
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm heading back now.

299
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,570
You're back.

300
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,840
Um, I didn't cook today.

301
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,080
There's a hamburger on the table. Help yourself.

302
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,810
I have no appetite. I can't eat.

303
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,480
You need to eat something. Your stomach can't handle it otherwise.

304
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,740
Don't act like a child.

305
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,560
I just don't want to eat a hamburger.

306
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,290
How is that throwing a tantrum?

307
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
I know you're upset.

308
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,760
But don't talk like you've got a short fuse.

309
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,440
I just don't want to eat a hamburger.

310
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,170
How is that having a short fuse?

311
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,880
It's not like you just met me.

312
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

313
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
I wasn't careful with my words.

314
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,720
I just wanted you to have something warm to eat.

315
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,840
You can heat it up in the microwave.

316
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,080
Alright, alright. I know.

317
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,640
I'm not a child anymore.

318
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,340
The date for the appeal hearing has been set.

319
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,300
How's the painting coming along?

320
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,140
Don't ask me. How would I know?

321
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,410
Well, who else am I supposed to ask?

322
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,160
Ask whoever you want. I really don't know.

323
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,600
I can't judge it myself.

324
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,360
Well, don't worry.

325
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,320
I'll contact Mr. Wan again tomorrow.

326
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,260
That Mr. Wan was brought in by you.

327
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,560
No, we knew each other before.

328
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,960
He likes collecting art.

329
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,180
Why do you have to arrange everything for me?

330
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,440
Xinxin, what have I arranged for you?

331
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,970
What haven't you arranged?

332
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,040
You taught me how to be a mother.

333
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,360
You arranged for me to be a boss, to open a gallery.

334
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,880
You even arranged people to buy my paintings.

335
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,940
Aren't all these your arrangements?

336
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,130
Do you think I'm completely incompetent?

337
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm talking to you.

338
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,260
Why are you looking at your computer?

339
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,280
I wanted to wait until you were in a better mood

340
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,540
before talking to you.

341
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,600
My mood is just fine now.

342
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,060
Why would I be in a bad mood?

343
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,240
Okay, if you're in a good mood, I'm listening.

344
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,770
Jiang Xiaoyu came to see me.

345
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,600
His brother was your former colleague, right?

346
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,320
He was an intern I supervised before.

347
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,600
Why is his brother coincidentally your colleague?

348
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,400
How come when I just started painting,

349
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,640
I happened to meet Jiang Xiaoyu?

350
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,600
Why did Jiang Xiaoyu happen to dislike me?

351
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,240
Why did you happen to open a gallery for me?

352
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,120
How is everything such a coincidence? How is it all so convenient?

353
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,200
It just happened that way.

354
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
Stop lying.

355
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,040
You only started working at the hospital after losing the first trial.

356
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,080
You're the one who sent Jiang Xiaoyu to help me.

357
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,760
Wan Xinxin.

358
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,420
Fine, don't say anything.

359
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,600
I know what you're going to say.

360
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,040
You're just going to say I need to grow up.

361
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,120
I should grow up and mature.

362
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,130
I should accept these challenges.

363
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
But can't you be more considerate about timing?

364
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,760
My baby brother is about to be taken away from me.

365
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,640
Why are you still testing me now?

366
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,840
You knew all along there were so many people helping me.

367
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,440
Why didn't you help earlier?

368
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,210
You had to wait until I was losing the case to help.

369
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,290
Let me tell you, Wan Xinxin.

370
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,880
I have to go to work at the hospital now.

371
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,840
Do you know how

372
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,760
important a surgeon's hands are

373
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,640
to him?

374
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,280
Do you have any idea?

375
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,760
Whenever I pick up a scalpel now,

376
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,040
my hands shake.

377
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,760
Do you know how painful this is for me?

378
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,440
Do you?

379
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,880
Do you know how painful it is

380
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,120
to lose a child?

381
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,800
You're not the only parent here. I'm a father too.

382
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,960
Even if you lose the case now,

383
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,720
isn't your baby brother still

384
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,400
living in the same city with you? What about Ruirui?

385
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
My Ruirui has been abroad for three years.

386
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,040
I haven't seen her for three years.

387
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,160
Every day when I stare at her photo,

388
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,520
my heart aches.

389
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,720
Wan Xinxin, back then...

390
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,940
When you first came

391
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,600
to live with us,

392
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,960
do you know why I let you stay?

393
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,200
We weren't related at all.

394
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,240
I just felt that you were alone,

395
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,080
raising a child by yourself wasn't easy.

396
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,160
I thought you were in a difficult situation,

397
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,520
so I let you stay here.

398
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,040
So you've been pitying me all along.

399
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,520
No, no.

400
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,900
I don't need your pity.

401
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,180
Wan Xinxin!

402
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,240
Wan Xinxin, where are you going?

403
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,040
I know he means well.

404
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,160
But I'm in a bad mood today.

405
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,800
Why can't he just give me a break?

406
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,560
If you were here,

407
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,420
you would definitely indulge me.

408
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,840
Whenever I was upset,

409
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,700
you always knew how to cheer me up.

410
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,400
But look at him,

411
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,960
at his age he still doesn't know how to be considerate.

412
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,490
I'm going through a difficult time right now.

413
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,280
He doesn't feel sorry for me.

414
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,200
Yes, he has his own troubles.

415
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,040
But...

416
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,360
But my baby boy means everything to me.

417
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,960
I'm truly at the lowest point of my life.

418
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,690
My husband cheated on me right after I gave birth.

419
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,420
And they've been plotting against me all along.

420
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,170
They even want to take my baby away from me.

421
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,210
I will never let them take him away.

422
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,720
My baby boy now

423
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,560
is the only family I have left in this world.

424
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,170
I absolutely won't let them take him away.

425
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,620
Can't you bless me with some protection?

426
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,090
Could you bring me some good luck, please?

427
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,560
I'm really at the end of my rope now.

428
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Why is heaven treating me like this?

429
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,250
I've run into every possible misfortune.

430
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,240
One wasn't enough, then came two.

431
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,370
Two weren't enough, then came a dozen.

432
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,040
Did the universe just package up

433
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
all the bad luck and deliver it to me?

434
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,800
Why do people have to grow up?

435
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,640
Always facing all these messes.

436
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,520
Childhood was so happy.

437
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,240
No worries at all.

438
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,000
Happy no matter what I did.

439
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,760
Do you know when I was happiest?

440
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,560
I remember when I was little,

441
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,200
when you took me to art class.

442
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,740
You would take me on your bicycle.

443
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,240
I was so carefree back then.

444
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Back then I could just

445
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,880
draw whatever I wanted.

446
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,600
But now

447
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,440
I just can't seem to draw anything anymore.

448
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,400
Everything I draw now is wrong.

449
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
I can't find that feeling I once had.

450
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,360
Where has my inspiration gone?

451
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,680
Should I just give up?

452
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,120
Look at this. What am I even drawing?

453
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,440
Don't pout at me like that.

454
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,220
I'm already upset enough.

455
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,840
Old buddy, I was wrong last night.

456
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,460
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.

457
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,120
Don't be mad anymore.

458
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,680
I'm going to draw now.

459
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,600
Draw well.

460
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,080
You're awake.

461
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,600
Go inside and get some sleep.

462
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,719
It's fine.

463
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm feeling

464
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,520
a bit dizzy.

465
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,840
You haven't slept all night?

466
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,719
I stayed up all night to finish the painting.

467
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
I'm going to see Jiang Xiaoyu later.

468
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,500
Not sure if it'll work out.

469
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,440
I'll wash my face and go with you.

470
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,280
No need.

471
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,500
You should catch up on some sleep.

472
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,890
I've already slept for a few hours. It's fine.

473
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,160
Really, it's not necessary.

474
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,020
Just stay home and look after Bao.

475
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,920
Come here.

476
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,080
Wait, hug me for ten more seconds.

477
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,840
Don't force yourself for my sake.

478
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,300
It hurts me to see that.

479
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,330
Teacher Xiaoyu.

480
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,960
How did it go? Did you work it out?

481
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,240
I don't know if I've worked it out.

482
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,760
Congratulations. You've moved me.

483
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,280
Thank you so much.

484
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:08,840
No, no.

485
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,120
You should thank that older guy.

486
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,800
Are you dizzy?

487
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,760
Feeling dizzy?

488
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,080
Come on. If Mom sees me spinning you like this,

489
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,460
she'll scold me again.

490
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,280
Amazing!

491
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,640
It's really amazing. Do you know that?

492
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,320
This is the talent I saw

493
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,780
in your paintings before.

494
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,410
Do you have an agent?

495
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,360
What agent?

496
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,200
Artists need agents.

497
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,920
No, Teacher Xiaoyu.

498
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,320
These aren't my priorities right now.

499
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,880
I just want a stable income now.

500
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,640
I need money.

501
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,040
Huaming, I hope you don't mind me asking.

502
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,970
What's been going on with you all these years?

503
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,920
That incident a few years ago...

504
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,330
I've never been able to get over it.

505
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,320
But that wasn't your fault.

506
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,200
Here.

507
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,040
Yes, as a doctor you can understand.

508
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,760
Let me put it this way.

509
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,090
I've never actually regretted what I did.

510
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,140
But the patient's family didn't see it that way.

511
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,640
They called me a murderer.

512
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,980
I still remember all their faces.

513
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,690
Their voices...

514
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,600
They follow me like nightmares.

515
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,000
After leaving our hospital,

516
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I tried working at other hospitals.

517
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,920
But I...

518
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,020
My hands start shaking whenever I pick up a scalpel.

519
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,930
I guess I still can't get past it mentally.

520
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,720
What would it take

521
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,340
for you to return to your former self?

522
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,400
Senior, I promised to come help you at the hospital.

523
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,570
But this is the condition I'm in right now.

524
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
I hope you can give me some time

525
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,680
to adjust. Is that okay?

526
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,100
How about this.

527
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,340
You don't have to be the lead surgeon.

528
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,720
Just help me develop treatment plans

529
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,980
and provide guidance in the neurosurgery department.

530
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,160
Alright. Thank you for understanding.

531
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,840
Hey, you've all seen the painting.

532
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,920
Book me for next week's auction.

533
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,720
Starting price: $20,000.

534
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,960
Yes, this is a piece by a new artist.

535
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
Trust me.

536
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,480
She'll be famous very soon.

537
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,560
Without a deposit, who would paint for you?

538
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,280
Hurry up.

539
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,600
Otherwise, someone else will get this painting.

540
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,480
Alright, fine.

541
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,440
Well...

542
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,440
Is it done just like that?

543
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,280
Yes, it's that simple.

544
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,480
No, I suddenly feel that my...

545
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,120
I'm not used to this role change.

546
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,200
Using talent to gain fame and fortune.

547
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,960
Is there anything more noble than that?

548
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,560
No.

549
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,200
Send me your card number quickly.

550
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,860
Okay, I'll send it right away.

551
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,960
My bank card is shining bright.

552
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,160
Like a sparkling diamond.

553
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,360
I'm rich now!

554
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,680
Sis, now that you're rich, can you please stop singing?

555
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,540
It's terrible.

556
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,800
No, listen.

557
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,280
I'm telling you, from today on,

558
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,080
I'm loaded.

559
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,560
Didn't you say I've been

560
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,000
freeloading at your place?

561
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,920
Tonight, I'm treating you.

562
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,920
Tell me what you want to eat.

563
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,240
Stop calling me 'sis'. You think money makes you special?

564
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,000
Of course.

565
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,920
Money makes me special.

566
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm a man with dignity.

567
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,600
I don't have to go just because you invite me to dinner.

568
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,400
You have dignity?

569
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Let me check the information first.

570
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,360
Oh my, you're so full of dignity!

571
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,060
I recently thanked my father,

572
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,340
thanked Jiang Xiaoyu,

573
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,020
but you're actually the person I should thank the most.

574
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Little rich lady.

575
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,770
The trial starts tomorrow.

576
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,650
You need to make a good impression.

577
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,680
Your Honor, my client Wan Xinxin.

578
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,900
One of her artworks

579
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,560
was acquired yesterday by a French contemporary art auction house

580
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,480
with a starting price of $20,000.

581
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,080
Many bidders have expressed

582
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,880
interest in commissioning her other works.

583
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,400
Based on this calculation,

584
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,360
the total value of paintings currently in the gallery

585
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,120
exceeds 1 million yuan.

586
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,280
Therefore, my client Wan Xinxin

587
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,200
has no financial issues whatsoever.

588
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,000
The child is not yet one year old.

589
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,280
From this perspective,

590
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,560
my client Wan Xinxin

591
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,040
is more suitable to raise the child.

592
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,640
Nonsense.

593
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,800
Nonsense!

594
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,440
I've lived with Wan Xinxin

595
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,100
for more than just a day or two.

596
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,000
Your Honor,

597
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,040
she's just an ordinary office worker.

598
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,920
How could she possibly paint?

599
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,200
Even if she could paint, how much would it be worth?

600
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,960
This must be fabricated evidence.

601
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,920
It must be fake.

602
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,660
You're talking nonsense!

603
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,960
Qin Gang, this is a courtroom.

604
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,000
Show your evidence. How did I fabricate anything?

605
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,060
I'm saying you fabricated evidence!

606
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,240
Please maintain order in the court.

607
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,940
People's Court

608
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,200
According to the Provisions on Evidence in Civil Proceedings

609
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,160
Article 2

610
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,890
The court rules as follows:

611
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,810
First, revoke the Yanglin District People's Court of Haizhou City

612
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,000
Civil Judgment No. 39.

613
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,200
Second, reject appellant Qin Gang's

614
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,680
appeal for custody modification.

615
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,800
Court fees of 100 yuan for each trial

616
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,740
shall be borne by the appellant Qin Gang.

617
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,320
The plaintiff Qin Gang and defendant Wan Xinxin's

618
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,010
biological son Wan Xiaobao

619
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,760
shall live with the defendant Wan Xinxin.

620
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,520
This judgment is final.

621
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,240
I'm here today to share some good news with you.

622
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,040
Look what I brought you.

623
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,540
Let's have a good drink together.

624
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,320
Here.

625
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,400
This can is for you.

626
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,720
Come on, let's have the first one.

627
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:44,840
Li,

628
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:46,800
Li,

629
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,180
Li Wengang,

630
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,760
Jiang Qiaohua.
