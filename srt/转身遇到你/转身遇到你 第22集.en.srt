1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,880
When it comes to romance,

3
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,680
we should let everyone congratulate us

4
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,360
and give us their blessings.

5
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,640
Yes, I understand.

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,320
Mr. Shi,

7
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,400
we're officially together now.

8
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
You two are together?

9
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,640
Don't you think we make a good match?

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,240
If you think so, that's fine.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Let's go, darling.

12
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,960
Let's go get something to eat.

13
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,760
Eat?

14
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,160
Alright, let's go eat.

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,720
Xu Ke.

16
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,180
Have you finished the report?

17
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,759
You're also a shareholder of this company.

18
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,720
Do as you see fit.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,960
Reports are important, but so is eating.

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,090
We can work on the report after dinner.

21
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,120
If you're not coming, we'll go ahead.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,880
Bye, Mr. Shi.

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,920
Let's go.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,329
How did I do just now?

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,520
Don't you think that was a bit too much?

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,200
What if she gets really angry?

27
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,440
What do you mean?

28
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,640
It's good if she gets angry. Let me tell you.

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,020
Her anger proves she cares about you.

30
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:48,600
Really?

31
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,360
Of course.

32
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,800
That makes sense.

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,520
When she gets angry,

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,160
I automatically back down.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,370
She might actually like me.

36
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,520
Go confess your feelings now.

37
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,650
You've got a chance.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,400
Hurry up.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
Roses represent love.

40
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,880
Someone like you wants to date two people at once?

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,040
Um, well...

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,920
I want to talk to you about work matters.

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,500
What is it? Tell me.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,760
Just say it.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,800
No, about that day...

46
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,520
Wan Xinxin was just helping me out.

47
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,650
You don't actually think we're together, do you?

48
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,200
That's impossible. She and I are just good friends.

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,530
No way. Absolutely not.

50
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,920
You can be with whoever you want.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,600
Look at you, you're jealous.

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,320
I know you actually care about me.

53
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,760
Why can't we be together?

54
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,080
I will never be with anyone.

55
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,940
Don't you want to get married and have children?

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,760
No.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,240
Why not?

58
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
Do you really want to know?

59
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,520
Yes.

60
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,200
Fine, I'll tell you.

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,040
None of you men are any good.

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,900
Including you.

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,520
I only trust myself.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
I have extreme insecurity.

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,840
Only work gives me peace of mind.

66
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,480
From what you're saying...

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,080
It sounds like you've been hurt before.

68
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,540
And it was quite profound.

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,610
But you can't keep punishing yourself like this, right?

70
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,520
I don't want to fall in the same place twice.

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
The key point is...

72
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,440
It's not the same place.

73
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,440
And not even the same person, right?

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,920
So you should give yourself another chance.

75
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,360
Right?

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,170
Knowing I'll get hurt again...

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,800
Why should I even try?

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,540
You think I'm like you?

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
A masochist?

80
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,360
I'm not a masochist.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,400
Can you stop being so cold?

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,000
Let me ask you then.

83
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,600
Don't you like me at all?

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,500
You're overthinking.

85
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,960
Then why are you jealous?

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
Do you think I'm jealous?

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,920
I just want you to focus

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,159
more on your work.

89
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
As a company shareholder,

90
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,860
can't you show some responsibility?

91
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,600
And stop letting that Wan Xinxin

92
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,680
come to the company and put on an act.

93
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,480
See? You are jealous.

94
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,700
Fine, don't worry.

95
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,400
From now on,

96
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,840
I won't let Wan Xinxin come to the company again.

97
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,360
So...

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,380
Why don't you give me a chance?

99
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,720
Look at us...

100
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,850
Is this the work matter you wanted to discuss?

101
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:11,840
No.

102
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,800
Look at you.

103
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,160
You're not being serious at all.

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,620
What did you come here for?

105
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,620
I came to discuss work.

106
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,720
Fine, you can leave then.

107
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,010
Business matters should be discussed at the office.

108
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,360
Come back!

109
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,050
Take your flowers with you.

110
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,480
Keep them. Give them to whoever you want.

111
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,560
Mom.

112
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,360
The lawyer has finished revising the will.

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
I just printed it out. Please take a look.

114
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,920
If there's anything inappropriate,

115
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,050
I'll tell him to make further changes.

116
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,320
Mom, what are you...

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,400
What are you doing?

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,840
But this is the will you asked to modify.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,930
That was before.

120
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,920
I've changed my mind now.

121
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,600
Why?

122
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,240
Why? No reason.

123
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,440
It's my money and I'll give it to whoever I want.

124
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,440
I'll dispose of it however I please.

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,040
That's my freedom.

126
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,680
Mom.

127
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
You might have misunderstood.

128
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,560
I never said I wanted to take over

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,920
the family business right now.

130
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,580
Then don't take it over at all.

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,680
But I'm your son after all.

132
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,880
Won't all this be mine eventually?

133
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,180
Who says it will eventually be yours?

134
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,320
Bill Gates already announced

135
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,800
he's donating all his wealth after his death.

136
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
If Bill Gates can do that,

137
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,280
why can't we learn from him?

138
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,560
Bill Gates did say that,

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,000
but he's not donating everything.

140
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,640
He's still leaving a portion for his children,

141
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,880
and it's more than enough for them.

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,120
In that case, I'm more noble than Bill Gates.

143
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,039
Because I've decided

144
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,799
to donate all of my assets.

145
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Mom, stop joking around.

146
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
It's my money and I'll give it to whoever I want.

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,080
No, Mom.

148
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,960
Mom, you...

149
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Mom, what are you doing?

150
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,480
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,400
My mother has gone crazy.

152
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,680
She actually said she wants to donate all our family assets.

153
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,540
She's just trying to scare you. That's impossible.

154
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,880
It's not impossible.

155
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,480
She asked me to modify her will before.

156
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,160
I had the lawyer revise it already.

157
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,400
And just now, right in front of me,

158
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,680
she tore up the will.

159
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
I'm really worried

160
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,640
that one day she'll make a rash decision

161
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,500
and donate all our family assets.

162
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,600
Alright, calm down.

163
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,200
I think you shouldn't be so anxious.

164
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,760
Let's ignore Wan Xinxin for now, okay?

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,330
And forget about the child custody issue.

166
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,960
We can get married first.

167
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,920
After we're married and have our own child,

168
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,160
the old lady won't be angry anymore by then.

169
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
We can't get married yet.

170
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,680
I need to take over all the family businesses first,

171
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,760
expand and strengthen them,

172
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,420
and get them listed on NASDAQ.

173
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,300
I want you to see me in a completely new light.

174
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,720
I can't let everyone think

175
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,840
that I'm just living

176
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
under my mother's wing like a little quail.

177
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,970
You know I don't care about any of that.

178
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,640
That's easy to say.

179
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,280
But look at you.

180
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,400
You're now

181
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,160
a star editor at an internationally renowned fashion magazine.

182
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,880
And me?

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
Just a minor shareholder in a car dealership.

184
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,900
I don't want to be like before.

185
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,160
I am a man.

186
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,410
I need my own career.

187
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,920
I need my self-respect.

188
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,280
Is your self-respect more important than us being together?

189
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,720
Alright, let's not discuss this now, okay?

190
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
If Wan Xinxin hadn't run away,

191
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
the will issue would have been resolved by now.

192
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,520
Now we have to start from scratch.

193
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,760
I need to find a way to get the child back.

194
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,800
Hello, Attorney Zhao.

195
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520
I want to sue Wan Xinxin.

196
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,050
I want to fight for custody of my child.

197
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,680
Please get ready for it.

198
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,200
That's really well painted. Quite professional.

199
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,280
It's not good at all.

200
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,280
Really? You call this professional?

201
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,010
This is actually quite good. Look.

202
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,280
The color arrangement is great. I think it's really good.

203
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,730
I've completely lost my touch now.

204
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,060
I haven't picked up a brush since I married Qin Gang.

205
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,080
I used to paint quite well when I was in school.

206
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,160
Won lots of awards.

207
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,760
Really?

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,530
Many people paid good money for my paintings.

209
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
Now I've lost all feeling for it.

210
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,680
Well,

211
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,440
I don't know much about painting.

212
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,680
What style is this painting?

213
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,740
What is it exactly?

214
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Is it naturalism?

215
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,040
Or fauvism?

216
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,600
Or some other school?

217
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,240
This is

218
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,170
no school, no style,

219
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,290
a style of my own.

220
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,520
Having your own style is good. That shows personality.

221
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,760
Let me tell you, in medicine

222
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,200
and natural sciences, we need commonality.

223
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,080
But in art, you definitely need individuality.

224
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,410
I think it's quite good.

225
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,680
I feel like life has worn me down

226
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,140
until I have no edges left.

227
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,280
What personality do I have left?

228
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
I feel like I'm just a

229
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,600
cotton candy.

230
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,840
Don't flatter yourself.

231
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,000
Brother Bao is the real cotton candy.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Big, fluffy and soft.

233
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,680
Let me smell you.

234
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,840
Are you sweet?

235
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,040
Stop it, stop it.

236
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,200
This is body painting.

237
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,480
Mom, what are you doing?

238
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,980
I'm going back to America to rest for a while.

239
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,920
Mom, you can't leave at a time like this.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
Then when should I leave?

241
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,920
If you anger me to death, I won't be able to leave at all.

242
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
Mom, I won't upset you anymore, okay?

243
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,520
I don't want to see you right now.

244
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,320
Let me have some peace and quiet.

245
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,000
Ma'am, please take your medicine before you leave.

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,680
Fine.

247
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,640
Mom, you can't leave.

248
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,000
Give me the medicine.

249
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,520
Mom.

250
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm here taking care of you.

251
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
Isn't that good enough?

252
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,260
I'm begging you, please don't leave.

253
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
Mom.

254
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,080
Mom, you can't leave.

255
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,920
Mom, I'm begging you, please don't go.

256
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,770
Get out of my way.

257
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,160
Mom.

258
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,680
The doorbell is ringing.

259
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,240
Go answer it.

260
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,720
You go.

261
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,640
You go answer it.

262
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,200
You go. I'll get it next time.

263
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,120
Just wait.

264
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,920
Mrs.

265
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,000
Xinxin, I've come to say goodbye.

266
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,340
Goodbye? Where are you going?

267
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,980
I'm going back to America.

268
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,200
May I see the baby one more time?

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,560
Of course. Please come in.

270
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,160
Thank you.

271
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,640
Please have a seat.

272
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,120
Okay.

273
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,920
Xinxin, don't be so formal.

274
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,050
I'll just say a few words and leave.

275
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,440
Would you like some water?

276
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,080
Auntie, you can talk with Xinxin.

277
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,610
I'll give you some privacy.

278
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,880
No, you sit down too.

279
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Xinxin, Huaming.

280
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,920
You don't really know me.

281
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,940
When Xiaogang was very young,

282
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,680
his father abandoned us.

283
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,320
When Xiaogang grew up and learned about this,

284
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,050
he deeply resented his father.

285
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,600
Before, I kept urging you to reconcile with Xiaogang.

286
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,720
I was mainly afraid that when the baby grows up,

287
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,480
he would hate Xiaogang too.

288
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,480
I want my grandchild

289
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,800
to live a carefree life.

290
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,100
But after how Xiaogang treated you both,

291
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,040
I really can't show my face anymore.

292
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,160
So I have no reason

293
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,400
to persuade you to go back to him anymore.

294
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,960
Auntie,

295
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,040
please don't say that.

296
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,240
This is just between us young people,

297
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,840
it has nothing to do with you.

298
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,880
Don't worry, I won't let the baby hate Qin Gang.

299
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,620
That's wonderful.

300
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,520
I've been bothering you all this time,

301
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,880
I apologize for that.

302
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,560
No, Auntie, what are you doing?

303
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,160
Please sit down.

304
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,760
It's not necessary, Auntie.

305
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,760
Auntie,

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,460
please don't be like this.

307
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,720
I know you've been good to me, treating me like your own daughter.

308
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,240
We may not be destined to be mother and daughter-in-law,

309
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,119
but you are still the baby's grandmother.

310
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,180
You can come see him anytime you want.

311
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,400
Xinxin, you're a good girl.

312
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,970
Losing a daughter-in-law like you

313
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,520
is just my bad fortune.

314
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,040
Don't praise me,

315
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,840
I might get conceited.

316
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,840
Huaming,

317
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,600
you're mature and steady,

318
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,400
and quite clever at times.

319
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,720
To be honest, with the baby and Xinxin here with you,

320
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
I feel at ease.

321
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,160
Auntie, I won't let you down.

322
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,610
I'll do my very best.

323
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,410
Good.

324
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,360
It's not easy for Xinxin to raise a child alone.

325
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
I know this from experience.

326
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,640
So on this trip to America,

327
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,400
I'll make some arrangements and decisions.

328
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,610
The main purpose is to ensure that Xinxin and the baby

329
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,500
won't have to worry about basic needs in the future.

330
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,560
During this time, I'll trouble you

331
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,520
to take good care of them.

332
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,090
Rest assured, I'll take good care of them.

333
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,880
Good, I've said what needed to be said.

334
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,680
I've seen the baby too.

335
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll be going now.

336
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,740
Let me walk you out.

337
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
Xinxin.

338
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,400
Don't you want to give me a goodbye hug?

339
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,900
Please take care of yourself.

340
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,800
Goodbye.

341
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,440
Take care of your health.

342
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,160
Mom!

343
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,560
What are you doing here?

344
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,840
Mom, I was waiting for you.

345
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,770
Please calm down. Don't leave yet.

346
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,060
Let me tell you something.

347
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,680
I could have stayed.

348
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,400
But I just saw the baby upstairs.

349
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,760
And that made me even more determined to leave right away.

350
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,360
No, Mom.

351
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,050
If you want to stay here,

352
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,520
then please stay.

353
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,850
This way you can see the baby every day.

354
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,240
It's too hard for Xinxin to raise a child alone.

355
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,060
And the child will grow up.

356
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,770
Education and living expenses will be issues in the future.

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,280
The first thing I'll do when I return to America

358
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,800
is to set up a trust fund.

359
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,880
I'll give all my money to the baby.

360
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Mom, don't do anything rash.

361
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,140
I'm not being rash.

362
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,400
When I make up my mind, I follow through.

363
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,320
Mom, if you set up this fund,

364
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,520
you're just letting Xinxin manage the money.

365
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,720
How can that work?

366
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,440
Giving it to Xinxin is the same as giving it to the baby.

367
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,600
I've been watching Xinxin.

368
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,440
She's a good girl.

369
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,600
She's not just a good girl,

370
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,040
she's also a good mother.

371
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,440
She absolutely will not be like you,

372
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,020
abandoning her own child.

373
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,560
Mom, what about me?

374
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,580
What about you?

375
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,200
I've already raised you.

376
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,760
I gave you money so you could run your business.

377
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,200
You don't need me anymore.

378
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
No, Mom.

379
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,320
How can you say I don't need you?

380
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,960
Mom, you can't be like this.

381
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,600
This is clearly Wan Xinxin's scheme.

382
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,160
She's just using the child to win your heart.

383
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,560
She's obviously using my child to trick you out of your money.

384
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,420
How dare you say such things to me!

385
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,880
How can you even say that?

386
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
Are you really my son?

387
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
I'm so disappointed.

388
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,560
No, Mom.

389
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,680
I know you're very emotional right now.

390
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,720
But you can't let emotions lead to impulsive decisions.

391
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,520
You really need to think carefully before acting.

392
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,200
Mom!

393
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,080
Mom!

394
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,320
Mom, I'm your son.

395
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,760
Hey, Lawyer Zhao.

396
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,760
Come to my office right away.

397
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,610
I want to move up the court date.

398
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,020
Mr. Qin, you called for me?

399
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,920
Sit here.

400
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,400
Ever since we had a child,

401
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,560
Wan Xinxin has been doing everything possible

402
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,920
to keep me from seeing my child.

403
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,160
What she's doing is illegal.

404
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,820
She must face appropriate legal consequences.

405
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,320
Sue her immediately. I want a court hearing right away.

406
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,200
I understand.

407
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,000
Here's the legal notice I've prepared.

408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,460
I'll deliver it to her now.

409
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,920
No need.

410
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,700
Let him deliver it.

411
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,530
Mr. Qin, I don't think it's appropriate for me to deliver it.

412
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,520
Didn't you say before

413
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,200
that you would help persuade Wan Xinxin?

414
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
So what's the result?

415
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,520
Well, I think if I try to persuade her,

416
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,240
it won't lead to a good outcome either.

417
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,970
So go deliver the legal notice.

418
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,320
I'm suing her.

419
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400
You be there to back me up.

420
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,560
Mr. Qin, look,

421
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,800
I don't think a confrontation in court is necessary.

422
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,320
After all, you were husband and wife.

423
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,520
Whose side are you on?

424
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,680
I work for the company, so of course I'm on the company's side.

425
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,920
Good. Then go do it.

426
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,940
Jiang Kaiyang,

427
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,760
do you know why Wan Xinxin and I

428
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,280
are fighting so bitterly

429
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,810
and yet I haven't fired you?

430
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,240
Because I'm responsible?

431
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,370
Responsible my ass.

432
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,130
I hate people like you who talk like bureaucrats.

433
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
But whenever Wan Xinxin...

434
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,000
When you make me feel really upset,

435
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,440
I can send you to make trouble for Wan Xinxin.

436
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,200
Then I'll feel much better

437
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,400
and in a great mood.

438
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,290
That's where you come in handy.

439
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,520
Mr. Qin, I...

440
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,640
I just think you're being so blunt

441
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,800
that I don't know how to respond.

442
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,880
Go now.

443
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,860
Deliver the legal notice.

444
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,320
Bastard!

445
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,120
Son of a bitch!

446
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,690
You're nothing but a rotten egg, I'm telling you!

447
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,340
You really think you're something special!

448
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,560
Let me tell you something.

449
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,160
I, Jiang Kaiyang, used to be somebody important.

450
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,720
I don't give a damn about you, Qin Gang.

451
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,890
You understand?

452
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,200
You're using me as your punching bag now,

453
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,600
but I'm not afraid of you.

454
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,720
That's right! We're not scared!

455
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,320
Worst case, we'll just quit.

456
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,690
Don't be stupid!

457
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,320
But he's bullying you!

458
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,520
I'll stand up to anyone who messes with you.

459
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,000
Alright, calm down.

460
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,200
I have a task for you.

461
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,240
Take this to Xinxin right now,

462
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,520
otherwise I won't be able to face my boss tomorrow.

463
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,560
This Qin Gang is really nasty,

464
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,480
making you deliver this legal notice.

465
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,960
He's clearly trying to drive a wedge between us!

466
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,160
If he wants to go to court, fine!

467
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,090
We'll fight him!

468
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,160
Use your brain, Xu Chunli!

469
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,440
Think about why Qin Gang asked me to deliver it.

470
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,130
Just think about it.

471
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,680
It proves he wants us to persuade Xinxin.

472
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,160
So you're saying

473
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,540
he doesn't really want to go to court?

474
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,080
It's just a bluff!

475
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,680
This guy is playing games.

476
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,440
Have you considered that

477
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,500
they were husband and wife after all?

478
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,320
Neither of them wants this to end up in court.

479
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,040
If it really goes that far,

480
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,960
it would be embarrassing for everyone involved, right?

481
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,680
That's true.

482
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,940
Let's persuade Xinxin

483
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,560
to let the Qin family take the child, okay?

484
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,640
They'll take good care of the kid. It's not a big deal.

485
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,800
She can definitely visit the child.

486
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,800
Plus, she'll get compensation money,

487
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,200
right?

488
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Also, if this really goes to court,

489
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,960
I'll lose my job.

490
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,920
Think about it.

491
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,080
My job pays pretty well, doesn't it?

492
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,320
Without it, we can't pay for Xiaoxiao's tuition.

493
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,920
She'd have to drop out and come back home.

494
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,120
Come back by ship.

495
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,920
By ship?

496
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,700
How many days would that take?

497
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,800
How long? About a month.

498
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,760
That many days? No way!

499
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,560
Hurry up!

500
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,800
I'll take it to her right away.

501
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,920
Go quickly!

502
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,920
Do you know a bottle of water costs 10 dollars on that ship?

503
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,480
You're Dr. Hua?

504
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,560
You're Manager Lin, right?

505
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:01,920
Yes.

506
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,380
Hello. Please have a seat.

507
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,520
Would you like something to drink?

508
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,320
No, thank you.

509
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,080
Dr. Hua, we've been in contact online before.

510
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,480
How did you find out about my Huaming Online service?

511
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,200
Your website is becoming more and more popular.

512
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,880
And it has helped many people who can't afford medical care.

513
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,040
I'd like to ask about your operational model.

514
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,280
I mainly divide it into two parts.

515
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,600
One part is for profit.

516
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,960
The other is non-profit.

517
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,200
For the profitable part,

518
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
I mainly work with some foreign medical websites,

519
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
medical institutions, including foreign hospitals.

520
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,840
I participate in some of their

521
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,440
surgical plan development.

522
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,760
So this part generates income.

523
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,040
And the other part is

524
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,490
for domestic patients.

525
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,720
I provide services mostly for free.

526
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,360
Due to my limited time and energy,

527
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,680
I've reached a bottleneck.

528
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,130
But I used to be a doctor,

529
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,440
and I hope to continue

530
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,080
this work to help more patients.

531
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,770
I'm here to discuss sponsorship with you.

532
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,560
This is a great idea

533
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,540
and a genuine charitable act.

534
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,600
Thank you so much, Manager Lin.

535
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,200
Thank you.

536
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,400
So we have a deal then.

537
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,960
Yes.

538
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,440
I'll draft an agreement when I get back.

539
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,480
From now on,

540
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,900
I'll fully support your Huaming Online.

541
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,400
Thank you so much, Mr. Lin.

542
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,920
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

543
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,320
I'll go now. Let's keep in touch.

544
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,560
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lin.

545
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,800
Goodbye.

546
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,860
As you instructed,

547
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,500
we'll provide him with 3 million in funding support annually.

548
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,200
I understand.

549
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,480
I'll arrange it right away

550
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,140
and transfer the money to you.

551
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,010
Yes, Mr. Qin. I understand.

552
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,680
Fine. Since they're so shameless,

553
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,760
they want to sue me?

554
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
No problem. Let them sue.

555
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,560
I'll fight them to the end. I'm not afraid.

556
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,760
You can't fight this.

557
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,560
The Qin family is so wealthy,

558
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,490
they'll hire the best lawyers.

559
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,400
Why not send the child to them,

560
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,640
to live with Qin Gang?

561
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,200
You've seen how well Mrs. Qin treats the child.

562
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
You've seen it yourself.

563
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,120
She won't mistreat the child.

564
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I bet she'll even

565
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,170
give you some compensation money.

566
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,560
Sis, are you okay?

567
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,240
You're asking me to sell my child!

568
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,200
How is that selling?

569
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,580
Qin Gang is the child's father after all.

570
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,360
Anyway, you can't fight this lawsuit.

571
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,360
You just can't.

572
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,160
I... I can't fight?

573
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,760
Whose sister are you anyway?

574
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,280
If you keep making trouble like this,

575
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,040
he will definitely fire your brother-in-law.

576
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,000
I knew it. It's about my brother-in-law again.

577
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,440
If your brother-in-law loses his job,

578
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,100
what will happen to Xiaoxiao?

579
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,400
She still has more than two years of study abroad.

580
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,660
You're forcing her to drop out of school.

581
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,650
All her bright future will be gone.

582
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,440
No. You want to send Xiaoxiao to live with someone else.

583
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
How could you?

584
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,260
I'm telling you, I'm definitely going through with this lawsuit.

585
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,400
Don't push me.

586
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,560
Please think it over again, will you?

587
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
Xinxin, think about it.

588
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,600
Think carefully.

589
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,200
Please reconsider.

590
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,820
Going to court isn't as hard as you think.

591
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,760
I know.

592
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,720
I just feel a bit upset.

593
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,840
And disappointed.

594
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,400
How many people are like me and Qin Gang?

595
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,820
Once husband and wife,

596
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,600
then bitter enemies with broken hearts,

597
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,490
and finally ending up in court.

598
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,000
What exactly is love anyway?

599
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,000
Why does it come like a flood,

600
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,130
impossible to stop,

601
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,840
but when it leaves, it's like smoke,

602
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,130
I can't hold onto it?

603
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,760
I can't really explain it either,

604
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,040
what love truly is.

605
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,840
Because everyone understands love

606
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
differently.

607
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,720
But as someone who's been

608
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,580
hanging around for over 40 years,

609
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,360
my advice to you is,

610
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,080
when you can't hold onto love, hold onto your child.

611
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,440
Are you ready to respond to the lawsuit? It's your call.

612
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,120
Of course. I must get my child back.

613
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,440
I'll arrange a lawyer for you tomorrow.

614
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,880
Old fox.

615
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,680
Thanks.

616
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,000
Everyone, Mr. Qin is here.

617
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,500
Hello, Mr. Qin.

618
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,360
Mr. Qin.

619
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,760
These are all elite professionals in our field.

620
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,320
Even on a national level,

621
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,640
they are among the top lawyers in the country.

622
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,360
I've put in a lot of effort,

623
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
pulled many strings,

624
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,280
to convince them

625
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,960
to join our legal team.

626
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,000
Our current legal team,

627
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,600
in terms of strength and lineup,

628
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,120
is truly unprecedented.

629
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,080
Good.

630
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,080
First, I'm honored

631
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,920
that you lawyers have taken my case.

632
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,720
I only have two requirements.

633
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,400
First,

634
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,650
naturally, is to win this case.

635
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,360
I believe in your capabilities,

636
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,080
so that shouldn't be a problem.

637
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,540
The second requirement is

638
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,760
I hope you can talk to your

639
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,120
lawyer friends

640
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,780
to absolutely refuse Wan Xinxin's requests for representation.

641
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,770
Mr. Zhang, may I ask you something?

642
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,800
How long have you been interning at this law firm?

643
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,860
Almost a month now.

644
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,500
I previously studied architectural engineering.

645
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Then I took law as an elective.

646
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,200
So you didn't originally study law?

647
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,620
I took it later as an elective.

648
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,680
Excuse me, we need to step outside for a moment.

649
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,840
Xinxin.

650
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,970
What kind of lawyer did you find for me?

651
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,320
From Engineering Department?

652
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,800
What Engineering Department?

653
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,080
He's a lawyer.

654
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,840
I swear, I contacted several famous lawyers

655
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,500
that I know.

656
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,720
But once they heard you're suing Qin Gang,

657
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,090
they all backed out.

658
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,420
Qin Gang is behind this again.

659
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
I swear, Wan Xinxin.

660
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,600
I called one firm after another

661
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,860
until I found this one.

662
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,660
Why would this firm dare to take the case?

663
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,760
Two reasons. First,

664
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,200
their law firm is too small

665
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,040
and Qin Gang can't reach them.

666
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,160
And second,

667
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,400
I asked around and...

668
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,409
their success rate might be

669
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,960
a bit low.

670
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,080
Wan Xinxin.

671
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,440
No.

672
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,920
Listen to me.

673
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,360
It doesn't matter if their success rate is low or high.

674
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,560
Regardless of whether they switched from Engineering,

675
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
they're lawyers now.

676
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Neither of us is a lawyer,

677
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
we have no choice.

678
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,159
So let's go in now

679
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,520
and hear what advice they have for us.

680
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,250
Let's just listen first, okay?

681
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,679
I guess that's all we can do.

682
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,210
Let's go.

683
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,560
Mr. Zhang,

684
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,739
you probably know the situation.

685
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,440
This case is extremely important to us.

686
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,040
We're very anxious about it.

687
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,480
I just want to ask you,

688
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,600
what are our chances of winning?

689
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,530
I've reviewed your documents.

690
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,210
I think there's still hope of winning.

691
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,080
The child is young and still nursing.

692
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,560
This works in your favor.

693
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,640
But to win this case,

694
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,840
you must solve one problem.

695
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,440
What problem?

696
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,520
You currently don't have a job.

697
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,850
This indicates that you

698
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,120
don't have the ability to raise a child.

699
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,520
To win this case,

700
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,480
you need to quickly find

701
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,120
a job with decent income.

702
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,920
Xinxin.

703
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,560
I've summarized some options for you.

704
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,160
Take a look at this one first.

705
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,020
The base salary is too low.

706
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,130
This one seems fine.

707
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
I need to find a high-paying job.

708
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,520
I absolutely cannot let Qin Gang and others

709
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,120
find any excuse to attack me.

710
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Alright. What about this one?

711
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,520
This one looks promising.

712
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,920
Let's go with this one then.

713
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,720
I'll contact them.

714
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,120
Good.

715
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,200
182.

716
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,420
Do you have any other additional requirements?

717
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,520
No.

718
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,240
Such a good attitude.

719
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,050
As they say nowadays, attitude determines everything.

720
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,600
Your resume is excellent.

721
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,360
And I've heard about

722
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,450
many of your previous designs.

723
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,400
So, you can start working here next week.

724
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,000
Really?

725
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,480
Really.

726
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,400
Thank you, Manager Yang.

727
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,160
Don't worry. I'll work hard.

728
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,560
I won't let you down.

729
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,440
Good.

730
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,160
Okay, I'll be going now.

731
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,800
Goodbye.

732
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,640
Okay, goodbye.

733
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,320
Goodbye.

734
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,440
See you next week.

735
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,300
Okay, goodbye.

736
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,400
Mr. Yang

737
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,520
Editor Liu

738
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,380
Long time no see. Please sit down.

739
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,640
Been quite busy lately.

740
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,400
Not bad. You're still so beautiful.

741
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,840
Sorry to keep you waiting.

742
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,200
I just interviewed a design manager.

743
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,760
That person just now.

744
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,620
It's her. You know each other?

745
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,760
Not really.

746
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,000
We've just worked together a few times.

747
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,720
This person has some issues.

748
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,840
Really? What issues?

749
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,040
You can ask around at Lady Company.

750
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,200
She caused a lot of trouble there.

751
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,640
Made Lady Company breach contracts several times.

752
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,300
They had to pay a lot of compensation to clients.

753
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,220
Mr. Yang, you should be careful about hiring someone like her.

754
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,560
About the lawyer.

755
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Have a seat first.

756
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,880
I did you a huge favor today.

757
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,240
What is it?

758
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,200
I went to my friend's place today

759
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,060
and happened to see Wan Xinxin interviewing there.

760
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,680
That must be what her lawyer told her.

761
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,880
If she doesn't have a job,

762
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,240
she won't get custody.

763
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,000
So,

764
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,120
I put in a word with my friend

765
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,840
and got Wan Xinxin rejected.

766
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,160
You've actually reminded me of something.

767
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,040
We need to come up with a plan quickly.

768
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,480
If Wan Xinxin finds a job,

769
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,920
I'll be in trouble.

770
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,800
Don't worry. Fortunately, her previous jobs

771
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,930
were all in my field.

772
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,240
That's right.

773
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,600
Editor Liu,

774
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,560
I'll leave this matter to you.

775
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Please talk to your

776
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,360
colleagues and friends

777
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,690
to put Wan Xinxin on the blacklist.

778
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,000
Sure. How will you thank me for helping you like this?

779
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,980
What's mine is yours. Isn't that enough?

780
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,440
Who cares about that?

781
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,330
Come, have some tea.

782
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,560
This isn't running, you're risking your life.

783
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,280
Don't follow me.

784
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,570
Do you feel really frustrated inside?

785
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,600
Yes.

786
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,500
Then I'll take you somewhere.

787
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,680
I got fired again.

788
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,760
I ran into Liu Wei when I went out today.

789
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,760
She's up to something again, isn't she?

790
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,960
What exactly do they want?

791
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,560
I just want my baby boy.

792
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,240
Is that wrong?

793
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,760
They stop me when I try to find a lawyer.

794
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,400
They even prevent me from finding a job.

795
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,120
They just want to take my baby away, don't they?

796
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
But my baby is still so little.

797
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,140
He needs his mother right now.

798
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,040
I absolutely cannot let them take my baby away.

799
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,520
I, Wan Xinxin,

800
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,480
no matter how much I suffer or how unfairly I'm treated,

801
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,640
I will never let them take my baby away.

802
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,160
I'm already backed into a corner by them

803
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,040
with no way out.

804
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,440
Wan Xinxin.

805
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,320
Do you know

806
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,880
why I brought you here?

807
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,200
Because I've faced many difficulties in my life too,

808
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,600
problems I couldn't solve on my own.

809
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,840
Sometimes I feel like I'm about to explode,

810
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,640
so I come here.

811
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,800
I need to vent too.

812
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,730
I need conflict.

813
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,880
I thought shouting would be enough to let it all out.

814
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,800
I thought when facing difficulties,

815
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,120
if you just push hard enough,

816
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,580
you could knock them down.

817
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,580
But I didn't knock it down.

818
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,440
It knocked me down instead.

819
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,920
It knocked me down too.

820
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,520
The force I used against my problems

821
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,600
pushed back and knocked me down here.

822
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,250
But you're different, Wan Xinxin.

823
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,120
You know what?

824
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,440
You're the first girl

825
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,200
I've brought here in all these years.

826
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,900
Because I think you're special, Wan Xinxin.

827
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,560
Who are you?

828
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,480
You're someone who can't be steamed or boiled,

829
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,320
an indestructible cockroach, the little witch Wan Xinxin.

830
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,840
I'm really not.

831
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,120
I have no way out now.

832
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,600
There is a way, Xinxin.

833
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,500
For the people we love.

834
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,840
Stand up.

835
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,400
Come on, Xinxin.

836
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,120
No.

837
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,880
Come.

838
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,000
Come here.

839
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,200
Ahead of us,

840
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,280
we'll face many more difficulties like this.

841
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,920
When we face difficulties,

842
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,120
