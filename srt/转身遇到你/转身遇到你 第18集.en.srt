1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,039
You've given up without even confessing to her.

3
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,120
You're worse than me in this regard.

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,640
I pursued Shi Lu and didn't succeed,

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,100
but at least I kept trying.

6
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,920
Ming, listen to me.

7
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
You must confess to her.

8
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,900
You need to hear the answer from Wan Xinxin herself.

9
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,600
Hear it from her own lips.

10
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,560
Absolutely.

11
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,280
There are two more lines in that cheesy song.

12
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,560
Yet I happened to meet you.

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,520
In the bustling crowd.

14
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,800
Cheesy.

15
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,370
Cheesy or not, I'll go find her.

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,570
You pay the bill.

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,040
How much?

18
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Hello, Mrs. Qin.

19
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,530
Have you gone to bed?

20
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,560
Not yet.

21
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,079
I have something to tell you.

22
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Mrs. Qin, I'm out right now.

23
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,200
If it's something that can wait,

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,280
could we talk another day?

25
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,520
No, I'm right outside your building.

26
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,920
Okay, please wait for me.

27
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,100
Mrs. Qin, you wanted to see me?

28
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,370
The flowers are beautiful.

29
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,360
Huaming, are you planning to confess your feelings to Xinxin?

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,940
Seems I came at the right time.

31
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,280
Huaming,

32
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,560
you can't do this now.

33
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
Why not, Mrs. Qin?

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,930
For Baogege's sake.

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,760
Baogege is still young.

36
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,360
He doesn't understand anything yet.

37
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,090
Sooner or later, he'll grow up.

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,400
Eventually, you'll have to tell him yourself

39
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,440
that you're not his biological father.

40
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
You'll also have to tell him

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,760
who his real father is.

42
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,280
How all of this happened.

43
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,600
Huaming, have you thought about it?

44
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,160
When that time comes,

45
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,800
no matter how you explain,

46
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,600
in a child's young heart,

47
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,640
it will be an indelible scar.

48
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,040
Just like your daughter now.

49
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,519
She has to endure your divorce from your ex-wife.

50
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,000
Mrs. Qin,

51
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,680
my daughter Ruirui is doing well now.

52
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,160
She could have had a better life.

53
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,800
No matter how you look at the current situation,

54
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,200
it's still unfortunate.

55
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,760
For this reason,

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,370
you especially shouldn't confess to Xinxin.

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,560
Especially now.

58
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,320
You've seen it yourself.

59
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,040
Xinxin and Xiaogang -

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,159
their relationship is healing.

61
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,320
They loved each other before.

62
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,080
If they didn't love each other, they wouldn't have had this child.

63
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,680
Right?

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,680
Of course, young people make mistakes,

65
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
that's normal.

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,600
But as long as they know how to make amends, it's good.

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,120
Through their efforts,

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,720
they'll surely return to their original life.

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,440
There might be some barriers,

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,960
but for the child,

71
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,640
his world is complete.

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
His family is intact,

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
at least his parents are the original couple.

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,060
Don't you think I'm right?

75
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,440
Mrs. Qin, I understand your reasoning.

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,840
But this has nothing to do with love.

77
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,000
Huaming,

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
you're an adult.

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,600
I believe you fully understand what I mean.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,930
Do as you see fit.

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,250
Goodbye.

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,620
Goodbye, Mrs. Qin.

83
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,560
You're back.

84
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,320
I had too much to drink with Xu Ke.

85
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,000
This Xu Ke is so unreliable.

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,160
Why did he make you drink so much?

87
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,020
Why didn't you drink with me instead?

88
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Give me that wine.

89
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,159
Still drinking?

90
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,680
Give it to me.

91
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,520
Stop drinking.

92
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,250
Give it to me.

93
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,200
Do you know why?

94
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
A glass of wine goes well with a movie.

95
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,280
No, forget about the movie.

96
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,360
Don't you have something to tell me?

97
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:00,880
I...

98
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,440


99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,640
Comfortably curled up on the sofa.

100
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,770
You have to stay on the sofa to talk?

101
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,880
Where did I throw my clothes?

102
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,010
Why are you worried about clothes now?

103
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,440
Just talk.

104
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,600
My head hurts.

105
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
The alcohol is kicking in.

106
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,080
No.

107
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
Cover me with the clothes later.

108
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I'll sleep here.

109
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,690
And turn off the lights while you're at it.

110
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
We'll talk about everything tomorrow.

111
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
Tomorrow.

112
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,480
What a waste of time.

113
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,520
As you can see,

114
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,640
Xinxin and Xiaogang

115
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,320
are in the process of repairing their relationship.

116
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,840
They were in love before,

117
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,200
if they weren't in love, they wouldn't have had this child.

118
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,400
With both of their efforts,

119
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,730
I believe they will return to their previous life together.

120
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,360
There might be some estrangement.

121
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,880
But for the child,

122
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,580
his world is complete.

123
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,600
His family is intact,

124
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,370
at least his parents are the original couple.

125
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
Hello, Manager Zhang.

126
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,400
Hi, this is Wan Xinxin.

127
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,760
Yes, I called you the day before yesterday.

128
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160
Are you in the office now?

129
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,880
Good. I'll come right over.

130
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,280
Hello?

131
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,940
I want to meet with you.

132
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,280
You can choose the place.

133
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,880
Okay. Be there or be square.

134
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,400
This is quite a rare sight.

135
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,280
Just say what you want to say.

136
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,840
I don't have time to waste here with you.

137
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,800
Actually, I came to say goodbye to you today.

138
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,360
We're not even friends.

139
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,940
Is that necessary?

140
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,120
Even if we're not friends,

141
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,920
we were once rivals, weren't we?

142
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
But I have to admit,

143
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,400
you won this time.

144
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,490
I'm planning to go back to America.

145
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,580
You don't need to report your schedule to me.

146
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,000
I've realized that no matter how hard I try,

147
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,840
I can never win Qin Gang's heart.

148
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,320
I only make him dislike me more and more.

149
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm thinking,

150
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
if I had never appeared in the first place,

151
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
perhaps you two

152
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,020
would still be happily living together now.

153
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,360
That's possible.

154
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,960
If you hadn't come back, we might not have broken up,

155
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,600
but I'm doing quite well now.

156
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,570
I'm about to leave. Let's shake hands and make peace.

157
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,690
Actually, I never lost.

158
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,530
How could the contract be invalid?

159
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,880
It says right here.

160
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,200
The specific terms of cooperation are to be interpreted by Party A.

161
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,040
Mr. Shi, you're an experienced businessman.

162
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,240
How could you make such a mistake?

163
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
This was her condition for signing.

164
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,920
We had no choice but to write it this way.

165
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,520
Otherwise she wouldn't sign.

166
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,920
I believe an international magazine like this

167
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,680
wouldn't make promises lightly,

168
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,740
and naturally wouldn't easily change those promises.

169
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,040
This Liu Wei is truly shameless.

170
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,200
That's right.

171
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
She is an extremely annoying woman,

172
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,840
really irritating.

173
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
She's absolutely terrible.

174
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,890
What are you doing here?

175
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,520
I...

176
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
I came to help you tidy up.

177
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,200
It's so messy.

178
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
What can you do? Get out.

179
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,440
No, let me help you with something.

180
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,380
I'm discussing something important now. Would you please leave?

181
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,760
Fine. I'll go find something else to do.

182
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,600
Good.

183
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,460
Don't be angry.

184
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Attorney Sun, do you have any other way

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,960
to make them admit responsibility?

186
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,490
According to the contract,

187
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,080
I really have no options.

188
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,520
No, let me drive you wherever you're going.

189
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,760
Where to?

190
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
No need. I have my own car.

191
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,520
No, you're too upset right now.

192
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
You shouldn't be driving.

193
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
For safety reasons, let me take you.

194
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,840
Why do you keep following me?

195
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
I'll call security if you continue.

196
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,960
No, when will you pay me back?

197
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,640
I knew you'd come asking for money.

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,860
I'm not someone who dodges debts.

199
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,800
Come on, follow me to the company.

200
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,520
I'll write you a formal IOU.

201
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,160
From now on,

202
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,440
all company income will go to you first,

203
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,040
until the debt is fully paid.

204
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,760
Should we also set an interest rate?

205
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,600
I'm just kidding.

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,640
If you give me all the company's earnings,

207
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,280
how will you operate the business, right?

208
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,560
Besides, the company

209
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,320
needs funds right now.

210
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,800
Just because Liu Wei and Qin Gang left,

211
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,860
doesn't mean I can't run the company.

212
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,250
I'm just in temporary difficulty.

213
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,200
If you're struggling, you shouldn't pay me back now.

214
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
How about this? I'll join you.

215
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,820
We'll get through this tough time together.

216
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,210
Would you like that?

217
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,040
Of course I would.

218
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
I'd love that.

219
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,160
Come in, Mr. Shi. Please.

220
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
Look, how about this one?

221
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,840
The pay for copywriting is decent.

222
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,280
Copywriting?

223
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,120
No, I used to

224
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,360
manage three copywriters.

225
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,220
You're making me take a demotion.

226
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,840
Okay, let's skip that one.

227
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,930
This one looks good.

228
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,780
Take a look.

229
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Deputy Director?

230
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,760
Are you serious?

231
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,320
They want me as Deputy Director? At my age,

232
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,780
would they even accept me for that position?

233
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,980
Okay, let's keep looking.

234
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,760
This one...

235
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,280
This won't work.

236
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,680
Too high won't work, too low won't work either.

237
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,140
I don't know what you want.

238
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,600
You're basically saying I'm not good enough for anything.

239
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,960
Just say it directly.

240
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,160
No, no, that's not what I meant.

241
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,290
Let's keep looking.

242
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,160
Why are you so short-tempered lately?

243
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,860
Have some patience. Job hunting takes time.

244
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,040
Haven't I always been like this?

245
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,850
Liu Wei came to see me today.

246
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,000
Hello?

247
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,360
Hey, Xinxin.

248
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,360
I heard you're looking for a job.

249
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,600
My brother-in-law told you, right?

250
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,730
He's got a big mouth.

251
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,580
Why are you even looking for a job?

252
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,040
Just stay home and take care of the kids.

253
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
Leave the money-making to me.

254
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,680
No, thanks.

255
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
I want to handle this myself.

256
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,609
Then you could come work at my company.

257
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,560
I said no thanks. I can solve this myself.

258
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,119
Alright.

259
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,000
If you need any help,

260
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,160
call me anytime.

261
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm willing to lend a hand.

262
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,800
Okay.

263
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,320
Let's continue searching.

264
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,720
Why are you staring at me?

265
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,520
What's wrong?

266
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,620
What's wrong with you?

267
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,800
Nothing's wrong with me.

268
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,530
I'm just helping you find a job.

269
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,880
I know what you're thinking -

270
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,160
why am I suddenly being so nice to him.

271
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,220
My attitude toward him has improved.

272
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,480
I owed him before.

273
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Besides, he's changed a lot recently.

274
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,680
What's wrong with me being nicer to him?

275
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,360
No, you-

276
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,560
I didn't say anything was wrong. I didn't say a word.

277
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,890
You're the one talking.

278
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,720
No, I really hadn't noticed

279
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,520
how petty you've become.

280
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,240
You are being petty.

281
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,120
You were just staring at me the whole time.

282
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,050
If that's not being petty, what is?

283
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,520
Wan Xinxin, you can't be like this.

284
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,560
You really haven't been yourself lately.

285
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,620
Could you please have some patience?

286
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,760
Can you stop being so explosive every day?

287
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,490
I haven't done anything to you.

288
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,640
I've always been like this.

289
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,500
Is this your first day knowing me?

290
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,520
Fine, I was wrong.

291
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,610
What are you doing here?

292
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,010
Why are you here?

293
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,280
This is my office.

294
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,520
I know, I know, I know.

295
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,490
No, you haven't assigned me an office either.

296
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,840
It's after work hours.

297
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,570
Go home first. I'll arrange one for you tomorrow.

298
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,040
Work is over.

299
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,920
Wait, if work is over, why aren't you leaving?

300
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
How about we go get dinner together?

301
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,920
Western food. Steak.

302
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,860
I'm not hungry.

303
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,440
You need to eat even if you're not hungry.

304
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,700
I'm really not hungry.

305
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,560
I feel sick. My head hurts.

306
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,600
You should definitely eat if you have a headache.

307
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,640
I've been running around all day.

308
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,700
Just let me have some peace and quiet.

309
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,720
Who's Jing Jing?

310
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,340
Is that joke supposed to be funny?

311
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,260
It's not funny.

312
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,800
Not funny. Get out.

313
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,360
Wearing these high heels and running around all day isn't good for you.

314
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,000
What are you doing?

315
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Give me that.

316
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,000
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

317
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,120
Get out!

318
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,480
No, I just learned foot massage online.

319
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,720
I'm a shareholder in this company.

320
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,680
Though I can't help much with business matters,

321
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,000
I can at least help you

322
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
with a foot massage in daily life.

323
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,360
Give me a chance.

324
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,840
I'll make you never forget me.

325
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,000
Take it easy.

326
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,800
Okay.

327
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,760
How's that? How's this?

328
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,080
How is it?

329
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,140
This pressure.

330
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,400
It's alright.

331
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,440
What are you thinking about?

332
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,720
You don't look happy.

333
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,650
How could I be happy?

334
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,840
Have you decided? Who will you choose?

335
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,690
I've made up my mind.

336
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,100
I choose neither. I'll live on my own.

337
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,400
Why are you talking nonsense?

338
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,810
What did Huaming say to you?

339
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,320
If only he could say something meaningful.

340
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,160
He can't get a word out no matter how hard he tries.

341
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,890
The closer I get to him, the further he pulls away.

342
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,600
What did you used to call him? A warm guy?

343
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,760
This warm guy, in my understanding, is like this.

344
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,680
Just like this radiator.

345
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,720
When the heat is on, it's warm.

346
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,160
It keeps you warm.

347
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,040
Makes you feel cozy all over.

348
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,920
Once spring comes and the heating stops.

349
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,040
Touch it again and it's ice cold.

350
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,100
So that's what I mean about this warm guy.

351
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,340
If he distances himself and stops caring about you.

352
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,720
He's just like this radiator.

353
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,450
Useless when it's not heating.

354
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,480
Where do you get all these

355
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
twisted theories from?

356
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,240
And about Qin Gang.

357
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,540
I think he's like an electric heater.

358
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,240
Plug it in anytime and it works.

359
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,560
Keep it plugged in and it stays warm.

360
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,720
Think about it. Even if he's not around.

361
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,000
He's got money.

362
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,200
The money is there.

363
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,650
You and your child won't go hungry or cold.

364
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,180
Did you wake up with a stiff neck, sis?

365
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,240
I don't have a stiff neck, I just-

366
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,580
No stiff neck but you're all about money.

367
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,770
What's wrong with caring about money?

368
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,240
Without money, you'll be living on air.

369
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,800
Give it a rest. Stop talking about me.

370
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,440
Did you marry my brother-in-law because he was rich?

371
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,880
That was different.

372
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,040
Don't use me as an example.

373
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,900
I'm saying this for your own good.

374
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,120
What you and my brother-in-law have is true love.

375
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,080
Don't deny it.

376
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,610
Let's not talk about it.

377
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,080
I'm going to the supermarket to buy something.

378
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,760
Xiaobao.

379
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,640
Yes?

380
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,960
Stay here.

381
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,000
Play by yourself at home.

382
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,440
Mommy will be back soon.

383
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,640
I'm going now.

384
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,200
Okay, don't worry.

385
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,240
Come.

386
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,480
Watch the car! You really...

387
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,290
What are you doing here?

388
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,180
I haven't seen you for days. I missed you.

389
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,040
I never stopped you from seeing Xiaobao.

390
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,240
Why would you miss me?

391
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,360
I just

392
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,220
didn't want to disturb your life.

393
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,040
So I found this spot to hide

394
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,700
and watch you from a distance.

395
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,240
I do the same outside your office building.

396
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,560
I'm always ready for you to take me back.

397
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,600
Stop acting like you're in a soap opera.

398
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,800
What's the point of saying all this now?

399
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,170
I'm going shopping. Do whatever you want.

400
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,560
Huaming.

401
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,240
I wonder if you've thought about

402
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
what I told you last time.

403
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm begging you.

404
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,160
If you've made up your mind,

405
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,120
please let them be happy together.

406
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,080
Here.

407
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,400
Why aren't you crying?

408
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,440
You two eat first. I'm leaving.

409
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,020
Wait, where are you going?

410
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,360
I need to go back and cook for your brother-in-law.

411
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,880
He's about to become a shareholder now.

412
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,000
His temper is quite short these days.

413
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,760
You should have told me earlier.

414
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,520
I could have asked Huaming to cook.

415
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,760
You didn't need to go through all this trouble.

416
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,160
We can't always have Dr. Hua waiting on you.

417
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,840
You know, you're like China's best neighbor.

418
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,700
No, now you should be called China's best landlord.

419
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,360
Your suffering is almost over.

420
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,280
Once Xinxin and Qin Gang remarry,

421
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,610
you'll finally be free.

422
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,880
I'm going now.

423
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,400
Sis.

424
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,760
Hey, Qin Gang and Wan Xinxin are remarrying.

425
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,640
It's worth celebrating. Why don't you stay?

426
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,760
I can't. I'm running out of time.

427
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,560
I have to go.

428
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,920
Goodbye, auntie.

429
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,720
Let's go to sleep now.

430
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,360
Xinxin, I'll put the child to bed first.

431
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
Time for bed.

432
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,120
Bedtime.

433
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:01,880
Okay.

434
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,200
Wait, what are you doing?

435
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,720
Didn't your sister say

436
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,120
we should celebrate your reconciliation?

437
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,880
No, my sister was just talking nonsense.

438
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,610
What's there to celebrate?

439
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,720
Well...

440
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,200
So you want to celebrate with me?

441
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,080
Sure.

442
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,000
Then I want to ask you something.

443
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,920
Should I go back?

444
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Why ask me? You should ask yourself.

445
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,640
Isn't it your decision?

446
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,320
I just want to know what you think.

447
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,720
Should I go back or not?

448
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,560
Yes, that's up to you.

449
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,080
So should I go back or not?

450
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,540
You should.

451
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,120
Here.

452
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,520
What am I to you?

453
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,160
Look, Xinxin, here's the thing.

454
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,280
Your sister can't keep taking time off

455
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
to help you with your son, right?

456
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,040
And I can't keep being a medical advisor at home.

457
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,680
I need to find a job.

458
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,000
What am I to you?

459
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,000
The Qin family is wealthy.

460
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,760
After your son returns to the Qin family,

461
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,920
he'll get a better education.

462
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,920
Really, it's a good thing.

463
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,880
You, Qin Gang,

464
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,400
and your son - the three of you reunited as a family.

465
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,120
It's good.

466
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,600
So what exactly is our relationship?

467
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,680
Landlord and tenant.

468
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,160
Friends.

469
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,120
Friends.

470
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,200
Just friends.

471
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,760
Come on, friend.

472
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,880
Let's drink to our friendship.

473
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,280
Your voice is changing.

474
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,640
Come on, cheers.

475
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,760
Let me tell you.

476
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,320
If we're friends, then I feel better.

477
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,680
I've been freeloading at your place,

478
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,400
I've put you through so much trouble.

479
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,840
I feel really bad about it.

480
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,520
But if we're just friends,

481
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,520
then it's no problem, right?

482
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,400
Why talk about this? Look,

483
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,680
when people come together,

484
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,240
two people meeting is fate.

485
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,080
Isn't it?

486
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,840
Yes.

487
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,520
So I think when fate brings people together,

488
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,360
we should cherish it.

489
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,440
Wan Xinxin, those words are so true.

490
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,200
Really.

491
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,720
Cherish.

492
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,440
Look,

493
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,120
you, your son, and Qin Gang -

494
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,180
the three of you together as a family.

495
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,920
You really should cherish that.

496
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,250
It's truly a good thing.

497
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,440
Should we drink to fate then?

498
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,440
Let's.

499
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,960
No, let me see.

500
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,640
It's fine, don't worry.

501
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,000
Look, you're about to reconcile.

502
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,800
This is a sign.

503
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,800
As friends, we can drink from the same glass.

504
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,680
Here.

505
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,960
No, what I actually wanted to say is...

506
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm afraid that after we leave,

507
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,130
you might feel lost.

508
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,000
Will you miss us?

509
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
I guess so. I'll miss you.

510
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,640
It's okay. When I miss you,

511
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,200
I'll just...

512
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,920
Am I really that ugly?

513
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,060
You're beautiful.

514
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,500
Let me tell you.

515
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,050
You're so beautiful that fish would sink and birds would fall from the sky.

516
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,240
When people say that about you, it's not an exaggeration. You're gorgeous.

517
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,760
Stop flattering me.

518
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,880
I'm so beautiful, yet you

519
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,120
Why don't you like me?

520
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,000
Why don't you have feelings for me?

521
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,720
What reason do you have not to like me?

522
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,560
I've had so many people chasing after me since I was young.

523
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,400
I'm telling you, they could form lines for several blocks.

524
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
I've lived here for so long.

525
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,040
We've been through so much together.

526
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,080
No, how come

527
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,480
Why are you completely immune to me?

528
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,560
It's not right.

529
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
Look, for example, you and Xu Ke.

530
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,760
You and Xu Ke together.

531
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,360
Xu Ke is taller than me, right?

532
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,440
And he's very muscular.

533
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
You two have known each other for so long.

534
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,860
Why can't you two be together?

535
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,680
See? It's the same logic.

536
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,940
It just doesn't match.

537
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,320
A lonely shadow responds to fragile nerves.

538
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,780
You don't like men, do you?

539
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,800
Now you're just talking nonsense.

540
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,200
Look at that!

541
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,800
Am I right?

542
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,360
Right about what?

543
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,240
You're blushing.

544
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,760
My face is red from drinking.

545
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,680
Why are you nervous?

546
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,200
I'm not nervous at all.

547
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,040
You do like men.

548
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,120
Of course my face is red from drinking.

549
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,240
I feel relieved now, let me tell you.

550
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,400
I've finally regained some face.

551
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,660
I've finally got some self-esteem back.

552
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,640
Come on, let's keep drinking.

553
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,400
We're out of alcohol.

554
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,280
There's none left.

555
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,800
No more alcohol. It's fine.

556
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,560
What should we do then?

557
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,640
I'll go get

558
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,040
I'll go

559
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,970
open another bottle. Can you still drink?

560
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,040
I

561
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Can I still drink?

562
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,680
Whoever can't drink is a puppy.

563
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,760
Wait here.

564
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,400
Only then will there be memories.

565
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,360
Here.

566
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,360
Thankfully I have you.

567
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,960
Where are you?

568
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,160
A lonely shadow.

569
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,120
This old fox Hua is too cunning.

570
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,960
He's completely confused me.

571
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,920
If he really has no feelings for me at all

572
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Then what was that all about on the camping day?

573
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,680
He's so nice to me

574
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,960
what does that mean?

575
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,360
But

576
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,930
I've asked him so directly.

577
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,650
He still won't admit it.

578
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,440
Could it be that

579
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,210
I'm really just imagining things?

580
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,120
Such beautiful scenery shouldn't lose its meaning.

581
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,400
Otherwise

582
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,090
I should test him one more time.

583
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,960
Old bacon.

584
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,680
If you would just ask me to stay

585
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,160
I would rush to your room right now

586
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
hold you tight

587
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,360
and never leave again.

588
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,240
Only because of you are there memories.

589
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,720
If indulgence is a kind of relief

590
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,240
only to repeat over and over again.

591
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,840
Xinxin.

592
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,410
Forgive me for saying one thing but meaning another.

593
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,760
I can't selfishly keep you here.

594
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:57,240
Such beautiful scenery shouldn't lose its meaning.

595
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,840
I can't be without you.

596
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,080
Who's breathing so loudly?

597
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,320
Memories exist because of you.

598
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:23,280
You give everything meaning.

599
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,130
You're up early.

600
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,300
I went to bed early.

601
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,040
By the way,

602
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,239
your brother's clothes are all dry now.

603
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,760
I drank too much last night.

604
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,340
It's fine. You always drink too much anyway.

605
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,680
Huaming,

606
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,000
even now you won't say a word to make me stay.

607
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,300
I guess I was just fooling myself.

608
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,360
Xinxin, thank you for agreeing to come back with us.

609
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
I know you want to go back.

610
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,380
I've been so happy I couldn't sleep for several nights.

611
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,560
You getting back together with Xiao Gang

612
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,520
shows that you two still have feelings for each other.

613
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,200
I give you my word

614
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,880
Xiao Gang will definitely treat you even better than before.

615
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,400
Xinxin.

616
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,730
The baby's just been fed. Pat him a little.

617
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,000
Baby.

618
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,720
Huaming.

619
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,400
Ma'am.

620
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,690
Thank you for these days

621
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,520
taking care of our Xinxin and my grandson.

622
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,720
Our family is reunited again.

623
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
Isn't that something to be happy about?

624
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,080
Yes.

625
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Let's go then.

626
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,600
Xinxin.

627
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,160
You've seen how sincere I am.

628
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,880
Let's go home.

629
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,240
You all go wait by the elevator for a moment.

630
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,200
Okay.

631
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,960
Come on, let's push the stroller out first.

632
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,900
You're always welcome to visit our home.

633
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,640
Hurry up.

634
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,840
Help the baby burp.

635
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,880
Let me check if we left anything here.

636
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,640
Huaming.

637
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,800
What is it?

638
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
Thank you.

639
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,610
You're welcome.

640
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,900
Lift it carefully.

641
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,660
That's enough. Just leave it here. Hurry up.

642
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,210
Take it easy.

643
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,600
Take this.

644
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,760
Qin Gang.

645
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,200
These are all the baby's things.

646
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,680
If the baby cries,

647
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,880
I've downloaded his favorite music

648
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,560
onto Wan Xinxin's phone.

649
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,920
Also...

650
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,080
No need for anything else. I'm here.

651
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,720
Get in the car.

652
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,320
Let's go.

653
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,520
Goodbye, little one.

654
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,600
Don't make me cry.

655
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,400
Are you happy now?

656
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,280
No.

657
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,160
Let's go.

658
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:51,600
I thought I would never love again.

659
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,800
Spring flowers wouldn't bloom for me.

660
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,720
Yet I happened to meet you.

661
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,080
In this bustling crowd.

662
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:20,040
I thought after all life's changes,

663
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,440
My heart would never race again.

664
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:34,000
Yet I happened to meet you.

665
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,440
Seems like you do care about me.

666
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,960
When I no longer believed in love,

667
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:48,080
It's not that I didn't want to love, despite being hurt before,

668
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,720
Who can predict fate's plan?

669
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,360
It's not that I didn't want to love.

670
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,560
Remember to wear your coat.

671
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,800
It's not that I didn't want to love,

672
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,160
Love became vast as the ocean when I turned away,

673
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,720
Perhaps I'm destined to wait a lifetime.

674
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,360
Hey.

675
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,840
Hmm?

676
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,960
Do you like me?

677
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,640
No.

678
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,440
Then why are you so nice to me?

679
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,920
I just feel sorry for you.

680
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,400
I thought after all life's changes,

681
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,880
My heart would never race again.

682
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,360
Yet I happened to meet you.

683
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
What am I to you?

684
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,200
The Qin family is wealthy and powerful.

685
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,680
After the baby returns to the Qin family,

686
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,000
He'll have better education.

687
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,920
Really, this is a good thing.

688
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:02,240
It's not that I didn't want to love, despite being hurt before,

689
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,160
Who can predict fate's plan?

690
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,600
Why don't you like me?

691
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,080
Why don't you like me?

692
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,240
That's not right.

693
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,320
Love became vast as the ocean when I turned away,

694
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,600
Perhaps I'm destined to wait a lifetime.

695
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,640
Let's go.
