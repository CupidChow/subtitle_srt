1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,600
United Airlines flight UA087 to New York

4
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,640
has now departed.

5
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,960
I told you

6
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,860
we'd never make it.

7
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I thought after all the changes in life,

8
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:40,000
my heart would never race again.

9
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,880
Yet I happened to meet you.

10
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,560
I'm sorry.

11
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,360
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

12
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,760
Please try again later.

13
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,480
Coming!

14
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,040
Thank you.

15
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,040
What would you like to drink?

16
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,440
Anything is fine.

17
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,399
You're still the same as before.

18
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,450
Never can decide what to drink.

19
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,920
By the way, Ruirui is asleep.

20
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,080
She's been gloomy ever since she came back.

21
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,409
Says she misses her dad.

22
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,400
The school organized a summer camp.

23
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,880
So I signed her up for it.

24
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,880
I thought being with other kids

25
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,210
might cheer her up a bit.

26
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,800
Xiaqing.

27
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,890
I'm really sorry to you and Ruirui.

28
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,280
First time back in over three years,

29
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,760
and I made you both unhappy. I'm sorry.

30
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
Why so formal? We're family.

31
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,240
Thank you.

32
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,240
Have you

33
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,720
told Wan Xinxin yet?

34
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,840
No.

35
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,300
How long are you planning to avoid it?

36
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,320
I don't know.

37
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,280
I just don't have the courage to tell her right now.

38
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
What's your next step?

39
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,880
I don't know. I'll take it one step at a time.

40
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,300
Are you going back?

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,680
Maybe.

42
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,159
Maybe not.

43
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,320
Perhaps.

44
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,480
Well, since Ruirui isn't here...

45
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,560
I'll be going then.

46
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,330
Where are you going so late?

47
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,680
I booked a hotel before coming.

48
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,720
What hotel?

49
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,050
Will you sleep in Ruirui's room or the guest room?

50
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,200
It's late.

51
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,960
It's too late.

52
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,180
Why did she only think about surgery now?

53
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,450
Huaming.

54
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,840
As a top neurosurgeon in the country,

55
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,920
what do you think about this surgery

56
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
and what are the chances of success?

57
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,680
I'd say no more than 5 percent.

58
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,280
Professor, you're right.

59
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,159
Many experts in China

60
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,560
are basically at a loss.

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,880
Since Mrs. Qin

62
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,159
gave up her chance for treatment in America,

63
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,880
could you possibly

64
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,080
develop a special treatment plan here?

65
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,220
The surgery would still need to be performed back home.

66
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,880
Difficult.

67
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,680
Really difficult.

68
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,720
Professor, do you remember?

69
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,640
When I was still a student,

70
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,490
I truly regarded you

71
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
as a god-like figure.

72
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,000
You told me doctors aren't omnipotent.

73
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,920
Not every life

74
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,640
can be saved with certainty.

75
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,080
But as long as there's even a 1 percent chance,

76
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,410
we should never give up.

77
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,820
That's what you taught me, and I remember it to this day.

78
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,840
Huaming.

79
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,179
Setting aside my role as your professor,

80
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,039
we've been good friends for many years.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I've always believed in you.

82
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
I've treated you like my own child.

83
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,080
I'll definitely help you with this.

84
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,220
Thank you, Professor.

85
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,200
Thank you.

86
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,800
Sis.

87
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,250
Xinxin, have you really decided to leave?

88
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,720
Please look after the gallery for me these days.

89
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
Don't be so impulsive, okay?

90
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,040
I must go to America this time.

91
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,240
I must find Huaming.

92
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,320
You're crazy.

93
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,280
Your English is terrible.

94
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,520
You'll be in a completely foreign place.

95
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Someone could sell you off.

96
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,040
And you'd be counting the money for them.

97
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,720
I really can't worry about all that.

98
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
I won't give up until I hit a dead end.

99
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,480
I must find him.

100
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
What about Bao?

101
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,080
Are you just abandoning him?

102
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,520
Bao is staying at Qin Gang's house these days.

103
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,580
I'll be back as soon as possible, sis.

104
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There's something I've been meaning to tell you.

105
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
But I haven't said it yet.

106
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,720
Now I have no choice but to tell you.

107
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,640
Sis, you don't need to say anything.

108
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,040
I must go to America.

109
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Did you know

110
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,600
Huaming met with Mrs. Qin?

111
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,440
Yes, I know that.

112
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,000
She gave him some money.

113
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,160
I know that too.

114
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,920
You already know all this?

115
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Huaming started a medical website.

116
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
The old lady gave him some

117
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,280
financial support.

118
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,010
Then think about it carefully.

119
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,200
Do you think she gave that money for nothing?

120
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Mrs. Qin is very calculating.

121
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,250
She must have planned everything.

122
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,240
Why wouldn't he develop his business in China?

123
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,500
Why run off to America?

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,520
I think even if you go to America,

125
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,980
you definitely won't be able to see Huaming.

126
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,600
Why don't you understand?

127
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,850
She just wants to separate you two.

128
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,120
All right.

129
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,050
Let's go inside.

130
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,800
Weimin.

131
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,640
Huaming.

132
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Well,

133
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,080
Professor Wei has already

134
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,280
developed a surgical plan for Mrs. Qin.

135
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,000
That's great!

136
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,200
But will Mrs. Qin go to America for the surgery?

137
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,480
Actually,

138
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,160
I've convinced Professor Wei

139
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
to come back to China to perform the surgery for Mrs. Qin.

140
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
And also to provide

141
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,860
some guidance for our hospital's future development.

142
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,440
Professor Wei's return is wonderful news!

143
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,090
When is he coming back? Let me know in advance.

144
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I need to make proper preparations.

145
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,120
Weimin, there's no need.

146
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
Just make sure all the necessary documents

147
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
at the hospital are ready.

148
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,400
Professor Wei is like family to us,

149
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,160
so don't go to any trouble.

150
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Okay, I understand.

151
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,560
But what about Mrs. Qin?

152
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,480
Don't worry about that. I'll communicate with her in advance.

153
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,210
I'll let you know ahead of time.

154
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,840
Huaming.

155
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,040
How are things going for you in America?

156
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,890
I'll tell you when I get back, okay?

157
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,220
That's all for now, Weimin. Goodbye.

158
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,280
Little monkey.

159
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,520
Hold it. Hold it.

160
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,040
This is a monkey.

161
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,320
Going grocery shopping.

162
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,040
Auntie.

163
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,920
Xinxin is here.

164
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,560
I'd like to speak with you privately about something.

165
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,240
Sure.

166
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,640
Xiaogang, go upstairs first.

167
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,120
Mom, why should I leave?

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,160
Xinxin wants to talk to me privately. Go upstairs.

169
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,120
Go on up.

170
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,180
We're going upstairs to play.

171
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,960
Let's go.

172
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,770
Have a seat, Xinxin.

173
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,840
Auntie.

174
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,800
Why do you insist on breaking up me and Huaming?

175
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,520
What did you do to make him go to America?

176
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,520
Why are you bringing this up now?

177
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,090
Isn't that true?

178
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
When I asked you that day,

179
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,520
you said you only gave him

180
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,920
some financial support.

181
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,840
Was it just financial support?

182
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,800
His Huaming Online could be run from anywhere.

183
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,720
Why did he have to go to America?

184
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,840
Why did you have to separate us?

185
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,520
I separated you?

186
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,440
Xinxin,

187
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,080
do you really think I would do

188
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,800
something so terrible?

189
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,940
Don't be silly, child.

190
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
Huaming went to America

191
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
for his own reasons.

192
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,240
In America,

193
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,380
he has his ex-wife and daughter that he can't let go.

194
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,360
And he's always dreamed

195
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,680
of his career as a doctor.

196
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes, I did give him some

197
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,160
financial help.

198
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,800
I wanted him to make Huaming Online better

199
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
so more people

200
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,040
could go to America for treatment.

201
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,240
How did this become

202
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,600
a reason for me to break you up?

203
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,360
What a coincidence then.

204
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,000
Why did you choose this exact time to return to China?

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,200
Why did Huaming choose

206
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,960
this exact time to go to America?

207
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,920
I know in your eyes,

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,930
anything can be solved with money.

209
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,080
So you bribed him with money.

210
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,720
Xinxin.

211
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,620
You and Huaming aren't right for each other.

212
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,480
Both of you once had

213
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,640
very happy families.

214
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,400
And you both have children.

215
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,720
All of this can't be

216
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,800
cut off so easily.

217
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,840
Before going to America, you kept telling me

218
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,600
that you wouldn't come back to disturb us.

219
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,040
You gave your blessing to me and Huaming.

220
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,770
Why did you go back on your word?

221
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,160
I know.

222
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,360
You just want me to remarry Qin Gang, don't you?

223
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,460
But let me tell you,

224
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,240
I will absolutely never

225
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,170
remarry Qin Gang in this lifetime.

226
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,220
Even if I don't stay with Huaming,

227
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,090
I still won't remarry Qin Gang.

228
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,160
But you can't

229
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,800
abandon your son.

230
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,160
You need to think about your baby.

231
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,490
I am thinking about my baby.

232
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,660
I don't want him to learn bad habits from his father.

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Alright, Xinxin.

234
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,040
I can't discuss

235
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,920
this issue with you anymore.

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,880
Fine, let's not talk about it.

237
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,460
If you don't want to remarry, then don't.

238
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,800
But I think between you and Xiao Gang,

239
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,880
couldn't you stop being

240
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,920
so resentful toward each other?

241
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
You were husband and wife after all.

242
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Even a day of marriage creates a bond that lasts.

243
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,760
For the sake of your child,

244
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,720
couldn't you understand and help each other?

245
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,840
You can at least be family, can't you?

246
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,680
I've always acknowledged that Xiaobao is Qin Gang's son.

247
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,280
I also allow him to visit him.

248
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,800
But I don't want to have

249
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,960
any emotional entanglements with Qin Gang anymore.

250
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,690
Fine, if there's nothing, then there's nothing.

251
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,240
But there's one thing

252
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,960
I must make clear to you.

253
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,560
Xiaobao must stay with our Qin family.

254
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,490
On what grounds?

255
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,020
I am Xiaobao's mother.

256
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,920
The court has already awarded Xiaobao to me.

257
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
He is mine.

258
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,360
I admit he is your child,

259
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,280
but no matter what,

260
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,210
he is also flesh and blood of our Qin family, isn't he?

261
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,720
If he stays with our family, we can give him

262
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,120
a better life,

263
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,480
both in daily life and education.

264
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,760
You are his mother.

265
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,440
You can come see him whenever you want.

266
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,520
But I think you should

267
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,200
Auntie!

268
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
No, Auntie!

269
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,560
Auntie!

270
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,560
Qin Gang

271
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,440
Let me tell you something.

272
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,960
If anything happens to my mother,

273
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,079
I won't let this go.

274
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,720
How could you be so cruel?

275
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,160
Even if you don't like her,

276
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,599
you shouldn't do this.

277
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,160
No, I just...

278
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,880
I didn't expect

279
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,400
she would get so emotional.

280
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,319
I really didn't mean to.

281
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,359
No, I...

282
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,079
I really didn't expect this. I'm sorry, Qin Gang.

283
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,560
What good is an apology?

284
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,720
Could you all please keep your voices down?

285
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,680
This is a hospital.

286
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,280
Doctor.

287
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,010
Doctor, how is my mother doing?

288
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,250
You're a family member of the patient, right?

289
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,040
What were you all thinking?

290
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,400
Upsetting her like that.

291
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,640
Her condition is very serious now. She's already in a coma.

292
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,500
Director Chen.

293
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,320
When will she regain consciousness?

294
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,580
We need to monitor her for a while longer.

295
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,940
Keep your voices down.

296
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,680
I must have had the worst luck in eight lifetimes

297
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,360
to have met someone who brings such bad luck like you.

298
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,160
Why did you have to talk to my mother?

299
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,640
Aren't you just causing trouble for no reason?

300
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,480
Are you trying to anger her to death?

301
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,240
She only has a few months left.

302
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,520
Can't you just let her be happy?

303
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,440
I...

304
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,560
Wan Xinxin, you did this on purpose, didn't you?

305
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,760
I think she wants to anger your mother to death sooner.

306
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,960
So you can get the inheritance earlier.

307
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,800
No, what are you talking about?

308
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,160
What inheritance?

309
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,120
I never wanted any inheritance.

310
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,920
I...

311
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,840
No, Qin Gang.

312
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,160
I really didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

313
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,920
Will saying sorry wake my mother up?

314
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,360
Is an apology of any use?

315
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,720
Make my mother wake up.

316
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,760
Give my mother back to me.

317
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
Just give her back to me!

318
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,160
Dr. Jia.

319
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,360
Yes.

320
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,680
Gather the best doctors immediately

321
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,810
for my mother's consultation.

322
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,040
Extreme fatigue.

323
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,920
The patient appears to be suffering from excessive mental stress,

324
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,600
anxiety and tension causing irregular heartbeat

325
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,880
and insufficient blood supply to the brain,

326
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,360
which led to her fainting at the scene.

327
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
If she doesn't rest and recover properly,

328
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,800
given her current physical condition,

329
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,840
she could easily develop other

330
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
cardiovascular and heart diseases.

331
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,700
That's her situation in general.

332
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,200
She's really a woman who makes people worry.

333
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,250
Let's go. I'll check on her.

334
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:58,920
Director Chen.

335
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,840
You still need to rest.

336
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,600
Wan Xinxin, why are you out of bed?

337
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,080
I...

338
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,060
Dr. Chen, I couldn't stop her.

339
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
It's okay. You can go back to work.

340
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,760
Alright.

341
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,400
You can go too.

342
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,800
Okay.

343
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,860
Director Chen,

344
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,840
can you tell me

345
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,170
what exactly is Mrs. Qin's condition now?

346
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,840
When will she wake up?

347
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,360
Her condition has stabilized.

348
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,890
Let's talk about you first.

349
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
You're suffering from exhaustion

350
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,320
and your health is compromised.

351
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm fine.

352
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,200
I was just too emotional earlier.

353
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,240
It's all my fault for making her so upset.

354
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,040
I'm begging you,

355
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,040
can you please find a way to save her?

356
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,200
We do our best

357
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,660
to treat all our patients.

358
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,760
You probably don't know,

359
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,080
Huaming went to America

360
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,360
to work with our mentor, Professor Wei,

361
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,320
on developing a treatment plan for Qin Fenglan.

362
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,930
But this will take time.

363
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,040
So you mean

364
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,400
Mrs. Qin can be saved?

365
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,480
What are you looking at so intently?

366
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,680
Weimin and I have a very difficult surgery right now.

367
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,160
Qin Fenglan.

368
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,340
Qin Gang's mother.

369
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,770
What are you planning to do?

370
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,660
I haven't decided yet.

371
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,530
My trip to America this time

372
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,620
besides helping patients through Huaming Online,

373
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
was also to find Dr. Wei

374
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,040
to develop a surgical plan for Aunt Qin.

375
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,360
But Dr. Wei told me

376
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,880
that the most suitable surgeon in China

377
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,040
is me.

378
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,610
But you know,

379
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,200
right now

380
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,600
I can't even pick up a scalpel.

381
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,840
I'm not ready yet.

382
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,840
That's not it.

383
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,130
You're not going back because you're afraid to face Wan Xinxin.

384
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,440
Right?

385
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,450
You've always loved her in your heart.

386
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,320
Huaming.

387
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,920
Go back.

388
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,220
It hurts me to see you torturing yourself like this.

389
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,240
You weren't wrong about Wan Xinxin's father's death.

390
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,320
You only made

391
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,240
the choice a doctor should make.

392
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,680
If it were me, I would have done the same.

393
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,180
Really.

394
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,480
During the time back in China,

395
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,480
I could see how much you love her.

396
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,490
Huaming.

397
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,960
Be brave.

398
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,800
You can't keep running away like this.

399
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,370
You'll have to face it sooner or later.

400
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,960
Listen to me. Go back.

401
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,080
Return to Wan Xinxin's side.

402
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,180
Return to the battlefield where you fight death for lives.

403
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,040
Don't forget,

404
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,440
only when your hands pick up the scalpel

405
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,770
are you truly yourself.

406
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,480
Thank you.

407
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,480
I think...

408
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,720
Can I be alone for a while?

409
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,360
It's good to have you.

410
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,280
Where are you?

411
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:25,040
Lonely shadows respond to fragile nerves.

412
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,520
It's good to have you.

413
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,360
Where are you going?

414
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:41,000
Don't let the transparent mirror shatter all over the ground.

415
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,400
I can't be without you.

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,640
Can I hold you tight?

417
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:59,000
Don't let such beautiful scenery lose its meaning.

418
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,520
I can't be without you.

419
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,520
Who's breathing so loudly?

420
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,840
Because of you, I have memories.

421
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
It's good to have you.

422
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,120
Where are you?

423
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,880
Lonely shadows respond to fragile nerves.

424
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
It's good to have you.

425
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,200
Where are you going?

426
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,560
Don't let the transparent mirror shatter all over the ground.

427
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,320
Huaming.

428
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,000
I can't be without you.

429
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
How are you doing in America?

430
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,920
Can I hold you tight?

431
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,800
Don't let such beautiful scenery lose its meaning.

432
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,040
I miss you.

433
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,080
Don't let such beautiful scenery lose its meaning.

434
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,680
I can't be without you.

435
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,540
I've made a big mistake this time.

436
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,800
Who's breathing so loudly?

437
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,930
Aunt Qin was so upset by me that she's in the hospital now.

438
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,520
Director Chen says only you can save her.

439
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,640
I know you went to America

440
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,600
to develop a treatment plan for Aunt Qin.

441
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,320
Please.

442
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,040
Come back quickly.

443
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
I really can't handle this anymore.

444
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,400
I don't want Aunt Qin to die.

445
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,280
She's Xiaobao's grandmother.

446
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,400
Please help me.

447
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,600
Come back quickly.

448
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,440
Will you?

449
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,880
Because of you, I have faith.

450
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,610
You're on the plane now, right?

451
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,730
Why didn't you tell me before you left?

452
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,160
Let me tell you.

453
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,600
This is the last time I'm chasing after you.

454
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,600
You can do whatever you want from now on.

455
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

456
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,680
Hello Dabai, I am Dabai.

457
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,560
Uncle, look.

458
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,040
It's clean, isn't it?

459
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
And over here too.

460
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,920
Let me tell you, I've learned how to do housework now.

461
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,760
Huaming.

462
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,220
Are you listening?

463
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,240
I know you're listening. Please say something.

464
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,480
I can't be without you.

465
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,480
Can I hold you tight?

466
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,960
Don't let such beautiful scenery lose its meaning.

467
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,520
I can't be without you.

468
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,840
Who's breathing so loudly?

469
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,280
Because of you, I have memories.

470
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:54,720
Because of you, life has meaning.

471
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,600
I've negotiated all the contracts.

472
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,560
And the car payment and mortgage loans

473
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
are all prepared too.

474
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,260
We can proceed as soon as you sign and authorize.

475
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,420
That was certainly quick.

476
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,240
Of course I'm efficient.

477
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Why do we need to mortgage the house?

478
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,520
What? Don't you trust me?

479
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,880
No.

480
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,360
I just worry about the worst-case scenario.

481
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,840
There won't be any problems.

482
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,700
I've done all the research for you. It's foolproof.

483
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,760
This is all my assets.

484
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,600
So there can't be any mistakes.

485
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,560
Recently.

486
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm completely busy taking care of my mother

487
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,440
and don't have time to handle these things.

488
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,770
So you must help me get this done properly.

489
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,200
Don't worry. This is our shared future.

490
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,500
I'll definitely do my best to help you with this.

491
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,960
Alright, come sign here.

492
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,440
I'll explain to Ruirui when she comes back.

493
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,480
Huaming.

494
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,960
Wherever Ruirui and I are

495
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,720
is your home.

496
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,690
Have a safe journey.

497
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,080
Thank you.

498
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,880
Thanks.

499
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,900
Hey, what's wrong?

500
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,239
The property deed isn't in the drawer you mentioned.

501
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,080
I remember it was in that drawer.

502
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,010
Why don't you check elsewhere?

503
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,280
It's not there. I've looked everywhere.

504
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,400
Maybe check the study.

505
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400
It might be there.

506
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,719
It's not there.

507
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,440
The desk is covered with your documents.

508
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,239
I remember it was in that drawer.

509
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,280
Why don't you look somewhere else?

510
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,199
Let me see.

511
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,560
In the drawer.

512
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,199
It's not here.

513
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,239
Here it is.

514
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:56,920
Found it.

515
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,680
You can focus on taking care of auntie.

516
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
Leave everything else to me.

517
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,480
Hand tumors, cerebrovascular diseases, spinal and clinical research.

518
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,760
Work experience: Completed doctoral program at the US Health Institute, 2005.

519
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,890
Basic theory. 2012.

520
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,280
Senior.

521
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,600
Huaming,

522
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
you're finally back.

523
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,960
I thought you wouldn't want to get involved in this mess.

524
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,640
How's the patient's condition?

525
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,600
Deep coma. The tumor has worsened,

526
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,160
severely compressing blood vessels and nerves.

527
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,960
Life-threatening at any moment.

528
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,640
Let's go.

529
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,840
Where to?

530
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,680
Your office.

531
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,760
Don't you need to recover from jet lag?

532
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,890
It's fine. Let's go.

533
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,480
Go.

534
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,100
Hello, distinguished experts and professors.

535
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,600
On behalf of Mr. Qin Gang,

536
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,060
I thank you all for coming despite your busy schedules.

537
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
As you can all see,

538
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,120
the patient's condition is very serious.

539
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,650
I'll skip the pleasantries

540
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,380
and get straight to the point.

541
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,160
First, let's welcome the neurology expert from Limin Hospital,

542
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,760
Professor Wang, to explain his surgical plan.

543
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,480
I would like to propose

544
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,480
three treatment options from the perspectives of surgery,

545
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,040
radiation therapy, and chemotherapy

546
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,840
for your consideration,

547
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,520
colleagues.

548
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:01,960
Come in.

549
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,280
Can we talk?

550
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,880
Ms. Liu Wei.

551
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,400
I don't think we have

552
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,730
anything to talk about.

553
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,640
Now can we talk?

554
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,640
How did you get these?

555
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,800
It doesn't matter where I got them.

556
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,530
What matters is what's inside.

557
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,570
What do you want me to do?

558
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,970
It's simple.

559
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,240
You leave this place.

560
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,820
You want me to stop Mrs. Qin's treatment?

561
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,920
I didn't say that.

562
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,160
How you handle it is your business.

563
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,130
Let me tell you, Ms. Liu Wei.

564
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,180
Before Mrs. Qin recovers,

565
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,130
I won't leave the hospital.

566
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,520
Like I said,

567
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,180
we have nothing to talk about.

568
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,440
Fine. Remember this.

569
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,560
We'll see about that.

570
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,540
Close the door for me, please.

571
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,000
Director.

572
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,240
We'll gather all your proposals

573
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,560
and decide on one after thorough review.

574
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,960
Here's another proposal

575
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,290
for everyone to review.

576
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,810
Hello, Manager Liu.

577
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,760
Manager Qin has authorized the signature.

578
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,820
Are you at the bank?

579
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,320
I'm already here.

580
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,640
I'm waiting for you.

581
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,100
Did you bring all the documents and the seal?

582
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,540
I have everything.

583
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,620
Good. I'll be there soon. See you in a bit.

584
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,960
I'll be waiting.

585
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,900
What's happening?

586
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,720
The patient's vital signs are dropping.

587
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,650
Breathing is becoming difficult.

588
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,400
Prepare for surgery immediately.

589
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,800
OK.

590
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,200
Director Chen

591
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,640
Dr. Chen

592
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,560
Director Chen

593
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
What happened to my mother?

594
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,440
Your mother's condition has worsened.

595
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,040
She needs immediate surgery.

596
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,440
Has Professor Wei from America arrived?

597
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,970
It's too late. We probably can't wait for him.

598
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,460
Director Chen, can you perform the surgery?

599
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,700
I'm afraid I can't.

600
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,960
Dr. Chen

601
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,200
I beg you.

602
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Please, I beg you to save my mother.

603
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,690
I'm begging you.

604
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,680
Please don't give up. I'm begging you.

605
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,040
We'll do our best.

606
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,920
Xinxin

607
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,640
Let me tell you something.

608
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,600
I'm afraid I can't perform this surgery.

609
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,860
But there's someone who might be able to.

610
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,560
Who?

611
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,650
Come with me.

612
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,640
Hua Ming.

613
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,020
When did you come back?

614
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,040
Xinxin.

615
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,570
Now is not the time to discuss this.

616
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,960
Qin Fenglan is in critical condition. She needs surgery immediately.

617
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,040
Huaming,

618
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,400
Zhongxin Health,

619
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,320
in the hospital now,

620
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,680
Zhongxin Health,

621
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,600
you're the only one we can count on.

622
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,160
Senior.

623
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,360
You know I'm not in the right condition to perform surgery.

624
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,760
Zhongxin Health,

625
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,800
there's no time left.

626
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,800
Zhongxin Health,

627
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,320
Wan Xinxin, please help me convince him.

628
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,290
I'll call Professor Wei

629
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,840
to confirm some details.

630
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,160
This surgery

631
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,280
must be performed by him.

632
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,800
Otherwise Mrs. Qin's condition

633
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,460
will truly be beyond help.

634
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Thank you for coming back this time.

635
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,960
Is the surgical plan ready?

636
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,160
Xinxin.

637
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,280
Dr. Wei has shown me the case.

638
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,800
He says Mrs. Qin's case is quite unusual.

639
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,880
The surgery carries extreme risks.

640
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,410
The patient could die on the operating table.

641
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,800
But Mrs. Qin is in critical condition now.

642
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,600
There are no other options left.

643
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,240
Director Chen says you're the expert in this field.

644
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,600
You're the only one who can save her now.

645
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
Xinxin, don't you understand

646
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,840
surgery isn't a game?

647
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,490
Mrs. Qin has helped many patients.

648
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
I wish I could help her, but...

649
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,000
But I'm not in the right condition to perform surgery now.

650
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,640
Huaming.

651
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,490
Could you please

652
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,920
do this surgery for me?

653
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li

654
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,160
Li Wenwang
