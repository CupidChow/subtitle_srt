1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,420
planning to leave.

4
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,800
I don't know when I'll be back.

5
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,360
Or if I'll ever come back.

6
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,020
So it works out that

7
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,860
my house will be empty.

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,530
It might as well be used.

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,360
You, Bao, and Xinxin

10
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
can stay there comfortably.

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,300
I'd like to,

12
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,240
but I'm afraid Xinxin won't agree.

13
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,080
Tell Xinxin

14
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,800
that you bought it.

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,840
If she thinks you bought it for them, she'll agree.

16
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,170
I'm broke now. Where would I get the money?

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,210
Qin Gang,

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,560
we all teach our children

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,850
that lying is wrong,

20
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,280
but I'm a few years older than you.

21
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,410
I've always thought

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,920
that to make our families' lives better,

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,360
telling a few lies sometimes is no big deal.

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,329
Don't you agree?

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,240
Take it. They'll be more comfortable this way.

26
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,680
Sis.

27
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,360
Sis.

28
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,480
No, sis.

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
What are you doing?

30
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,000
Qin Gang, I've let you down.

31
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,160
Do you still consider me your sister?

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,760
Of course.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Kaiyang has indeed wronged you.

34
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,680
Look at how much money you've lost because of him.

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,810
He's now received his due punishment.

36
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,520
I have no other requests.

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,840
I only ask that you forgive him.

38
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,340
For Xinxin's sake, please don't hold a grudge against him.

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,880
I've got a job now.

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,440
I can run a small business

41
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,460
and make 20,000 to 30,000 a month.

42
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,740
I'll bring you the money on time every month.

43
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,320
As long as I'm still breathing,

44
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,160
I will pay back

45
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,680
all of this money.

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
Sis, I can't take this money.

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,640
We're family.

48
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,900
There's no such thing as debt between us.

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,360
Well...

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,890
Besides,

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,320
my brother-in-law was deceived by Liu Wei.

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,000
Once Liu Wei is caught and the money recovered,

53
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,250
we can sort everything out.

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,800
Whoever made the mistake should bear the responsibility.

55
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,160
So Kaiyang was at fault?

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,320
I should be responsible for Kaiyang's mistakes?

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,720
You must take this money.

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,280
Otherwise, I won't be able to live with myself.

59
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,010
Sis, I can't accept this money.

60
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,200
Sis.

61
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,010
Don't give us money. I still have some.

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,839
You've just started your business.

63
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,370
It's not easy to make money.

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,660
That's a separate matter.

65
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,540
If he doesn't take this money,

66
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,880
I'll feel guilty for the rest of my life.

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,660
Take it.

68
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
Alright, sis.

69
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,540
I'll take the money

70
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,560
and let Xinxin manage it.

71
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
When the police catch Liu Wei

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,740
and recover the company's money, we'll talk again.

73
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,159
Money isn't important to me right now.

74
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,080
What's important is Xinxin, Xiaobao,

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,840
and all of you.

76
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,400
You are what matters most to me now.

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Ultraman.

78
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,240
So cool, really.

79
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,760
So cool, bro.

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,400
So cool, really.

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,130
It doesn't matter if the car looks cool or not.

82
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,240
As long as it drives well. Let me tell you.

83
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,300
I bought it secondhand from someone.

84
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
It's a used car.

85
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
But it's never given me any trouble.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,820
Just take good care of it when it's yours.

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,360
Don't worry, I'll definitely treat it

88
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,820
like my first girlfriend.

89
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,880
Wait, are you really giving me this car?

90
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,900
I might not be coming back.

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,520
Look, this car of mine

92
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,960
is just a piece of scrap metal sitting in the garage anyway.

93
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,020
Just use it for now.

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,000
When I leave,

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,330
I'll clean it up a bit and give you the keys.

96
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,570
Wait.

97
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
No, I think...

98
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,760
You're giving me such a cool car.

99
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,440
I feel like you have something else going on.

100
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,970
Yes, not just the car but also that apartment.

101
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,940
The... the apartment too?

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,280
Oh my god, bro!

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,940
You're giving me your apartment!

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,920
You're like my second parents!

105
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,960
I...

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,620
Thank you so much, I really...

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,200
Buddy.

108
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,500
I'm sorry, I shouldn't laugh.

109
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,940
Buddy, let me finish what I'm saying.

110
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm not giving you the car right now.

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,880
As for the apartment, I want you to

112
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,560
convince Wan Xinxin, Qin Gang, and Bao to

113
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
move into my apartment.

114
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,560
The studio is too damp now.

115
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,290
It's not good for their health.

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,970
I feel dirty.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,880
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,920
Wait, you're giving the apartment to them?

119
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,000
What if Wan Xinxin doesn't agree?

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,120
That's why I'm asking you, since you're Wan Xinxin's best friend,

121
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,640
right?

122
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,280
Please help me convince her.

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,810
Besides,

124
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,940
to be quite honest,

125
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,690
whether I'm with Wan Xinxin or not,

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I really want her to have a good life.

127
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm counting on you with the apartment. Thank you so much.

128
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,640
And when the time comes, I'll clean up the car

129
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,920
and give you the keys before I leave.

130
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,320
I have something to do. Get yourself a taxi.

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,860
Come on, give me a ride.

132
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:15,600
Bro.

133
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,040
Let me experience it.

134
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,570
It's so cool.

135
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,240
I didn't bring any money.

136
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:37,940
Qin Gang

137
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,450
What are you doing here?

138
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,680
It's too stuffy in the gallery.

139
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,480
I brought Xiaobao out for a walk.

140
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
When I got back to the gallery and saw you weren't there,

141
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,960
my heart started racing.

142
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,920
Please don't scare me like that.

143
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,650
Don't worry.

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,580
I'm really enjoying life now.

145
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,690
I won't do anything stupid.

146
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,090
That's a relief.

147
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,480
By the way,

148
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,850
I was just about to tell you.

149
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,240
We really can't live in this gallery anymore.

150
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
Look,

151
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,880
those are the clothes you washed a couple days ago, right?

152
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,410
I checked and they're already getting moldy.

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
It's too damp.

154
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,120
I haven't been in the mood to paint lately,

155
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,720
and I haven't made any money.

156
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,640
I'll start painting right away.

157
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,880
Once I earn some money,

158
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,200
we'll rent an apartment.

159
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,260
Then you can live there with the baby.

160
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,970
Look at you, you're barely holding up.

161
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,120
I just have a slight cold.

162
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,400
It's nothing.

163
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,580
Let me suggest something.

164
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,640
How about

165
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,250
we move to Huaming's place for now?

166
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,240
He's gone anyway,

167
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
and the house is just sitting empty.

168
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,400
I won't go back to live there.

169
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,170
You have a fever.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,730
I might just have a slight cold.

171
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,080
I'll take some medicine when I get back. It's really nothing.

172
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,400
Let's go.

173
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,200
No.

174
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,760
Let's go to the hospital right away.

175
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,620
Come on, let's go to the hospital.

176
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,520
Slow down.

177
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,200
Watch your hands.

178
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,840
Yes, this way.

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,160
Behind the fridge.

180
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Get out of the way.

181
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,240
Why are you so strong?

182
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,960
I've been helping you all this time and I'm exhausted.

183
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
Aren't you young?

184
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,600
I can do this kind of work by myself.

185
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,800
Go do something else.

186
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,520
Come on, how can you say that?

187
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,840
I didn't bring any money during the day.

188
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,570
You made me come back by myself.

189
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,130
You're killing me with exhaustion, you know?

190
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,160
What are you trying to achieve here?

191
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,620
Going to all this trouble.

192
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,120
I've been talking to you all this time for nothing.

193
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,720
Fine. You ask me, I'll ask you too.

194
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,040
You're also Wan Xinxin's friend.

195
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,600
So what are you after if you're not taking any money?

196
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,080
I...

197
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,060
Do you have to be after something?

198
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
I understand now.

199
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,640
Your highest level of love is

200
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,220
letting go.

201
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,300
Another highest level is defeating your opponent.

202
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,160
Phone.

203
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:02,960
Here.

204
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,440
Where's the phone?

205
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,160
TV.

206
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,770
Television.

207
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,960
It's so heavy.

208
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,820
Weimin.

209
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,160
Huaming, Wan Xinxin just came in for a checkup.

210
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,000
Nothing serious, just a cold.

211
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,980
Okay, wait for me. I'll go right away.

212
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,320
Can you help me with this?

213
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
I'll handle it.

214
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,840
This...

215
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
You're not taking care of it anymore?

216
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,880
Your highest level of love is just hugging?

217
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,440
No, where did I put it?

218
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,130
Qin Gang.

219
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,770
How is Xinxin doing?

220
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,840
She's much better, but still has a slight fever.

221
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,440
What about the moving plans?

222
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,250
Yes, I was just about to tell you that I'm thinking

223
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,540
of moving in tomorrow.

224
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,920
That's fine. Do you need my help?

225
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,080
No, don't show up.

226
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,810
If you appear, Xinxin will be even more upset.

227
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,400
Look, why do you care whether Xinxin likes it or not?

228
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,930
Qin Gang,

229
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,960
just pack everything up,

230
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,840
move in first,

231
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,720
and she'll have to accept it

232
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,250
whether she likes it or not.

233
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,490
Alright,

234
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I'll carry her over here if I have to.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,320
Yes, this is very important.

236
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,480
When you go back, since Xinxin

237
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,280
might have a viral cold,

238
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,760
you need to keep her and Bao

239
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,290
separated from each other.

240
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
Yes, got it.

241
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,520
My phone is on 24 hours a day.

242
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,280
Call me directly if anything happens.

243
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,720
Okay,

244
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,600
let's head back now.

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,260
Sure thing.

246
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,120
Is there anything else?

247
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,780
That's all.

248
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,240
Don't just sit there. Let's clean up first.

249
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,170
Let me rest for a moment.

250
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,720
We need to hurry up a bit.

251
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,250
I don't want Xinxin to see me when she arrives.

252
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,170
What's the rush?

253
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,090
It's fine. Sit down and let me explain some things to you.

254
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,360
This is the utility card.

255
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,080
Water, electricity, and gas are all paid with this card.

256
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,920
I've already paid for this month.

257
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,240
I've linked it to my bank card.

258
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,280
You don't need to worry about it.

259
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,340
This is a spare key.

260
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
And also...

261
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,400
There's a notebook in here.

262
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
I've written down Xinxin's...

263
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,260
All of her habits are in there.

264
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,700
Also...

265
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh right, the kitchen...

266
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,800
There are two cabinets in the kitchen

267
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,460
with three thermal cookers on the bottom shelf.

268
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,600
The first pot

269
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,280
is for your regular cooking.

270
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
And these two are for making soup.

271
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,480
Actually, Xinxin isn't too picky about food.

272
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,520
She likes drinking soup.

273
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,720
She prefers stronger flavors, but don't listen to her.

274
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Don't indulge her.

275
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,250
Make the soup a bit lighter.

276
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,640
Also.

277
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,720
Right, the baby is still very young.

278
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,900
So try not to use the air conditioner.

279
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,080
The ventilation here is very good.

280
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,920
When you open the windows and doors, there's a nice cross breeze.

281
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,450
Alright.

282
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,850
I know all this already.

283
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,450
After all, I've lived with her before.

284
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,360
Yes.

285
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,730
And also.

286
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,960
These are some

287
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,240
basic medications I've prepared.

288
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,040
I've marked all the expiration dates here for you.

289
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,680
And

290
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
remember to check those dates carefully.

291
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
Make sure to throw away any expired medicine.

292
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,560
I've prepared a phone number

293
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,290
so I can reach you wherever I am.

294
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,540
Just call me if anything happens.

295
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,220
I don't really need this key anymore.

296
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Keep it as a spare.

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,480
Also...

298
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,280
What else?

299
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,490
I'm leaving.

300
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,960
Huaming.

301
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,600
I miss you.

302
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,840
Can you come back soon?

303
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,160
I really can't take it anymore.

304
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Please come back quickly.

305
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,840
I'm begging you.

306
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,800
Come.

307
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,040
Come in.

308
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,260
Qin Gang, I should go back to stay at the gallery.

309
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
No, Xinxin.

310
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,760
You're still sick.

311
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Stay here and rest properly.

312
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,280
Let me make you something to eat.

313
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,610
Here.

314
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't just stand there.

315
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,240
Sit down.

316
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,920
Take a rest here.

317
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,960
Stop fussing around.

318
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,810
I'll put the child to sleep.

319
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,100
You should rest well here.

320
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
I'll go put Xiaobao to sleep.

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,730
I'll make you something to eat.

322
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,560
Stop hiding.

323
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,680
I'm not hiding from you.

324
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,340
You're not?

325
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,880
No.

326
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,560
This is a snow scene painting.

327
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,079
It's all white. The contrast in this area...

328
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,850
I can't cook either.

329
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,610
I boiled some eggs for you to eat first.

330
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,720
Let me try.

331
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,480
What's going on?

332
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,760
Didn't your fever break this afternoon?

333
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,040
Why is it back now?

334
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,890
It's okay, Qin Gang.

335
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,450
I'll drink some water and take a nap. I'll be fine.

336
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,410
Wait here. I'll get you some medicine.

337
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,220
Huaming, Huaming.

338
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,840
Come over quickly. I have an emergency.

339
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,500
Qin Gang

340
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,440
You're finally here.

341
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,500
Xinxin has a high fever of 40 degrees.

342
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,960
Should we take her to the hospital for an IV?

343
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,160
No need for an IV if there are no complications.

344
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,960
What did you give her for dinner?

345
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,480
Eggs.

346
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,760
Eggs can worsen fever symptoms.

347
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,890
How would I know? That's what I always ate.

348
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,180
What should we do then?

349
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
I made some porridge.

350
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
And some stir-fried vegetables on the side.

351
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,680
Remember, the food should be light,

352
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,940
but still nutritious.

353
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,300
What should we do next?

354
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,260
Give her medicine.

355
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,800
If that doesn't bring down the fever, try physical cooling methods.

356
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,570
How do you do physical cooling?

357
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,600
Come on, take your medicine now.

358
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,900
Drink more.

359
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,900
I can't drink anymore.

360
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,010
It helps reduce fever by sweating.

361
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,650
I'll drink it later.

362
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,050
It's physical cooling.

363
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,920
Huaming, Xinxin's fever has gone down.

364
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,320
Xinxin went to the supermarket.

365
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,160
There are some things I don't know how to do.

366
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,760
Could you come up and show me?

367
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,240
Is this right?

368
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,200
You can't mix it evenly that way.

369
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,530
Get the air bubbles out.

370
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,570
Give me the eggs.

371
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,160
Spread it along the edge of the pan.

372
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,240
So it cooks evenly.

373
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,920
When wiping the baby, first get him ready.

374
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Then wipe with the tissue like this.

375
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,580
Support him like this. You can hold him this way.

376
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,680
Just add one more spoon of sugar.

377
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,010
Put some baby powder on him.

378
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,920
Like this.

379
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
These clothes...

380
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,570
Don't wash them with adults' clothes in the machine.

381
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,660
Keep them sealed in plastic bags.

382
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,160
Thank you.

383
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,140
Sorry for the trouble.

384
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,860
She's back.

385
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,330
Come on, wash your hands and let's eat.

386
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,800
Did you make all this?

387
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,540
Have a seat.

388
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,770
Try this soup first.

389
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,560
Taste it.

390
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,120
Did you cook all these dishes?

391
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,160
I'm learning how to cook.

392
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,880
I learn from TV shows and cookbooks.

393
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,380
Taking it step by step.

394
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,480
Try it.

395
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,050
The taste is off.

396
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,620
It's too salty.

397
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,500
Did you make this soup?

398
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
I'm learning to cook.

399
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,080
I don't really know much about cooking.

400
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,360
Just learning little by little.

401
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,640
I just want to make sure you eat and drink well.

402
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,500
And stay happy.

403
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,170
So the baby will be healthy too.

404
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
This is broccoli.

405
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,170
This dish may look simple, stir-fried broccoli.

406
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,160
It seems easy,

407
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,280
but it's actually quite tricky to make.

408
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,440
If you cook it for too short a time,

409
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,170
it stays raw.

410
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,080
And if you cook it too long,

411
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,040
it gets mushy.

412
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,040
So the timing has to be

413
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,840
just right.

414
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,540
Let me try it first.

415
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,250
I forgot to add salt.

416
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,290
I'll go add some.

417
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,500
Here, try it again.

418
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,120
Now it's good.

419
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:51,960
Eat up.

420
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,880
Why are you still wearing an apron while eating?

421
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,480
It's fine. I'll be washing dishes after we eat.

422
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,800
No need. I'll do it later.

423
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,500
It's awkward eating with an apron on.

424
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,260
I just wanted you to rest a bit.

425
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,240
Let's eat.

426
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,160
Okay.

427
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,640
Why are you staring at me?

428
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,420
I'm not.

429
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,000
I just appreciate your recent changes.

430
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,090
I just want to take good care of you all now.

431
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,480
I think if I work this hard,

432
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,440
I should do better than Huaming.

433
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,970
Why compare yourself with him?

434
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,800
You are you, and he is he.

435
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,140
I'm just making a comparison.

436
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,720
You must have seen all the things I've done.

437
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,800
I hope that someday,

438
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,530
you can give me another chance.

439
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,720
I don't know when it started,

440
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,580
but my life seems completely disrupted.

441
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,960
I can't sort it out at all now.

442
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,960
Qin Gang.

443
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,640
Give me a little more time, okay?

444
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,200
I can wait patiently.

445
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,600
Just like you said,

446
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,700
we still have Xiaobao.

447
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,880
We're a family.

448
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,480
Go ahead and eat.

449
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,920
I'll go clean up the kitchen.

450
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,800
Have a heart-shaped apple.

451
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,610
What's this?

452
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,920
The property management now requires

453
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,840
all tenants living in the apartment

454
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,960
to register.

455
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
What should I say?

456
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,080
What can you say?

457
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,680
Just say thank you and I'll say you're welcome.

458
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,240
Fine. Let's say I'm renting this place.

459
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,240
Then give me your bank account number.

460
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
When I have money,

461
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,640
I'll pay back all the rent to you.

462
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,660
No need.

463
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,170
You did what you thought you should do.

464
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
Now I need to do what I think I should do.

465
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,600
Okay.

466
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,890
Qin Gang.

467
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,160
For me,

468
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,240
I've lived in that house for almost three years.

469
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,040
Sometimes when there are just two people in this home,

470
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,160
I feel like

471
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,760
it's just a temporary place.

472
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,960
But when it's just the three of us,

473
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,720
you feel like it's a real home.

474
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,440
Thank you.

475
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,250
You're welcome.

476
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,720
Is it a mermaid?

477
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,360
The face should be toward me

478
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,890
and the tail toward the sea.

479
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,360
Don't touch my child.

480
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,700
I won't. I won't touch.

481
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,840
How did you know I was here?

482
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,040
The question I asked you last night,

483
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,500
have you thought about it?

484
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,960
Qin Gang, you know what?

485
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,660
Just now when I was standing here,

486
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,650
I remembered so many things from our past.

487
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,680
When I was at my lowest point,

488
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,400
I met him.

489
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,760
He built a small home for me,

490
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,120
taught me how to love.

491
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,720
But heaven played

492
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,240
a cruel joke on me.

493
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
I feel like I've aged so much lately.

494
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,640
Recently,

495
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,480
I suddenly feel like time is passing so slowly.

496
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,400
That day when you tried to kill yourself on the bridge,

497
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,090
I was really scared.

498
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,690
I suddenly became so afraid of losing you.

499
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,720
You know what?

500
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,880
We'll be family for life.

501
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,920
We'll raise our baby together.

502
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,530
But I don't have the capacity to love again right now.

503
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,540
Being together isn't about love.

504
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,920
It's about responsibility.

505
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,050
Huaming left his house to our baby.

506
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,780
Before he left, he was worried about how you'd be doing.

507
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,120
I now do laundry, cook,

508
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,239
clean the house, take care of our child -

509
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,900
all things Huaming taught me.

510
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Sometimes when you weren't around,

511
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,280
those meals were actually cooked by Huaming.

512
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,130
When you had a fever,

513
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,560
he was downstairs

514
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,460
teaching me how to bring your temperature down.

515
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,440
He only left after your fever broke.

516
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,120
If I were to ask you now

517
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
to remarry me,

518
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,199
I would be truly selfish.

519
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,219
Huaming wasn't thinking about having you for himself.

520
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,639
He wanted you to be happy.

521
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,720
It's impossible between us now.

522
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,490
Nothing is impossible.

523
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,700
Xinxin,

524
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,480
I'm urging you to keep Huaming in your life.

525
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,160
Really,

526
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,170
it's over. That chapter is closed.

527
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,130
Come with me. Let's go find him.

528
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,040
You should at least say goodbye.

529
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,240
That's right.

530
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,160
Maybe it's difficult,

531
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,860
but for this possibility,

532
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,700
maybe there's another ending

533
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,610
that's worth fighting for.

534
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,460
You old fox.

535
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,450
I know you're doing all this

536
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,840
just to make me stay.

537
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,960
Where is the guest

538
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,360
who checked out already?

539
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,640
When did he leave?

540
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,080
I'm not sure about that.

541
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,010
Where would Hua Ming go?

542
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,610
Forget it, Qin Gang. Stop looking.

543
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,800
Xinxin.

544
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,080
If this time

545
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,340
you don't see Hua Ming,

546
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,060
you might regret it for the rest of your life.

547
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Think carefully. Where might he go?

548
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,530
He should be under the big banyan tree.

549
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,800
Xinxin.

550
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,360
When it comes to love,

551
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,880
I'm not a coward.

552
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,370
No one can stop us from being together.

553
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,800
I can risk everything for you

554
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
but I can't ignore our son's future.

555
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,620
Being separated from my daughter for so many years,

556
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,520
I know very well

557
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,400
that a broken family

558
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,640
causes irreparable damage to a child.

559
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,120
For our son to have a complete family in the future,

560
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,880
I have no choice but to leave.

561
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,560
Xinxin.

562
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,080
In this bustling

563
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,880
please forgive me

564
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,720
sea of people.

565
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,200
I thought after all these changes in life.

566
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,440
I would never feel passionate again.

567
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,970
What kind of person are you?

568
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Yet I happened to meet you.

569
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,840
But I no longer believe in love.

570
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,840
It's not that I don't want to love, even though I've been hurt.

571
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,200
Who can see through fate's arrangements?

572
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,600
It's not that I don't want to love,

573
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,040
but love has become vast as the ocean.

574
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,000
Forget about me.

575
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
Give me some time.

576
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,000
Hua Ming, forget about me.

577
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,040
It takes a lifetime to wait.

578
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,040
Hua Ming, forget about me.

579
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:54,000
I thought after all the changes in life.

580
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,200
Stop talking. Please stop.

581
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,880
I still happened to meet you.

582
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,720
But I no longer believe in love.

583
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:22,320
It's not that I don't want to love, even after being hurt.

584
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,920
Who can see through the arrangements of fate?

585
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,440
It's not that I don't want to love.

586
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,280
Love has become as vast as the ocean.

587
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,680
Perhaps it's destiny.

588
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,120
Are you with me because you pity me?

589
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,640
Do you pity me?

590
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,480
Every moment I think of you.

591
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,540
I can't forget you because I love you.

592
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,640
It's not that I don't want to love.

593
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,520
Even after being hurt.

594
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,680
Perhaps it's destiny.

595
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,760
I once made a promise to you.

596
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,800
I said,

597
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,320
if everything could start over,

598
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,410
I wouldn't let her go again.

599
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,640
Hello, Officer Ye. What can I do for you?

600
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,200
The suspect Liu Wei

601
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,420
has been arrested.

602
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,720
She has now been transferred to the prosecutor's office.

603
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,880
Like a gentle breeze

604
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,320
blowing through my heart.

605
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,960
The little monkey and the little elephant.

606
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,080
How about drawing a baby and a mom?

607
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,960
Draw this big circle.

608
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,800
Scattered my gaze, taking away my longing.

609
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,860
Alright, go ahead.

610
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,760
I'll take care of this.

611
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,960
If fate is meeting a stranger

612
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,560
that familiar feeling comes in an instant.

613
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,200
The heart flutters and stays in this moment

614
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,400
as we fall in love.

615
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,520
I want to stay like this

616
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,200
cuddling close to you

617
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,120
forgetting about time.

618
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,010
If everything could start over

619
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,180
I would never let you go again.

620
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,160
Yours, mine

621
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,560
the line of happiness

622
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,760
is right beside me.

623
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,240
I want to stay like this

624
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,920
accompanying you in your world forever

625
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,360
forgetting about place.

626
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,240
If love has no boundaries

627
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,920
no matter each day

628
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,040
you're here, I'm here

629
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,320
in our hearts

630
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,840
love never changes.

631
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:46,720
Wang Yaping
