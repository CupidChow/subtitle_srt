1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,140
How's it going?

3
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
Then please prepare to do an episode for us too.

4
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,130
Sure, whenever you're available.

5
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,770
I'll have my secretary schedule with you.

6
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,880
Hello.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,759
Editor Liu.

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,680
Where are the materials?

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,440
It's fine.

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,160
Please take a look. These are the prepared materials.

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,780
Editor Liu, if there's nothing else, I'll head back to the office.

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,410
Excuse me, I need to make a call.

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
Hey, Wang. It's Liu Wei.

14
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,680
You're doing well these days.

15
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,410
Even became Tong Tong's agent.

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
Don't be so polite.

17
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,840
I wouldn't dare call myself your teacher.

18
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,320
I still need your help.

19
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Nothing special.

20
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
I'd like to invite Tong Tong

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,360
to be our cover model this issue. What do you think?

22
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,650
How about tomorrow?

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
She's busy tomorrow?

24
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,120
Then please rearrange her schedule.

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,450
You know how influential our magazine is.

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,840
Great. Let's discuss details in person.

27
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,360
Okay, bye.

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,640
Xiaohui.

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,480
Tomorrow, contact that

30
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,640
cellist Ma Youyou

31
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,760
and schedule an interview with him.

32
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,360
Yes.

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,210
Remember, it must be tomorrow.

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,280
Bye.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,920
Uncle.

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,960
Get up, Uncle.

37
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,840
You're my assistant today.

38
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,480
You need to make me look good.

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,840
I really am your assistant.

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
I was your assistant last night too.

41
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,079
Last night when feeding the baby,

42
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,240
you were sound asleep

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
and I took care of the baby all night.

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,240
Work and personal life are separate.

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,720
Don't make excuses.

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,320
Why did you come so early?

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,080
The early bird catches the worm.

48
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,480
Uncle.

49
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,760
Uncle, you need to help boost morale later.

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,290
Let's go.

51
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,160
Go help me boost morale.

52
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,240
Let's go.

53
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,079
Wake up, everyone!

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,200
What's going on?

55
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,360
Get up! Quick! Wake up!

56
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,480
Maybe you feel tired.

57
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,720
Maybe you think today is

58
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
an impossible mission.

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,840
You can leave or go home and sleep.

60
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,480
But someday in the future,

61
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,400
when your children and grandchildren ask you

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,440
about this grand event today,

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,560
why weren't you there?

64
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
Won't you feel ashamed?

65
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,720
Won't you feel embarrassed?

66
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
Perhaps one day,

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,640
we will lose our ideals and live in a daze.

68
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,240
But I believe it won't be today.

69
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,800
Perhaps one day,

70
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,320
our names will be erased from human history,

71
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,520
but I believe it won't be today.

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,400
Perhaps one day,

73
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,320
the world will fall into darkness,

74
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,080
humanity will no longer be able to fight,

75
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,480
but I believe it definitely won't be today.

76
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,520
Today, we will use our

77
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,800
perseverance, trust, and ideals,

78
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,360
use our flesh and blood

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,880
to win the world's praise and respect.

80
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,700
Speak like a normal person. I don't understand.

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,520
That's too much.

82
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,600
Be real.

83
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,770
Do you still want your bonuses?

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,490
Get back to work now.

85
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,810
I'll report slackers to the boss lady.

86
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Let's get to work.

87
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,760
Mom, when is it starting?

88
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,800
Let's go.

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,890
What's going on? It's been so long.

90
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,640
That's good.

91
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,680
Why are you here?

92
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,240
I should at least

93
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,840
support your career, right?

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,800
Cut it out.

95
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,040
These are new pants. Don't kick.

96
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,400
I asked you to come with me this morning but you refused.

97
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,560
You'll have to buy a ticket now.

98
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,600
Don't ask me to cover it.

99
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,000
No, when are you starting?

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
I can see the audience is

101
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,000
getting impatient.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,120
It'll start soon.

103
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,159
Xinxin.

104
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,960
Honey.

105
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,880
Aren't you...

106
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,960
Wait, how did you manage this?

107
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,200
This is even Bohemian style.

108
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,240
Hey, aren't you her best friend?

109
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,560
Since you're her bestie, let's switch places.

110
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,440
You work here, I'll watch the kid.

111
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:55,880
No.

112
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
Wait, what are you doing?

113
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,440
I'll take this off and you can do it.

114
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:58,880
No, no.

115
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,120
Me? I'm the nanny now.

116
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,800
I need to watch the child.

117
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Both of you, stop messing around.

118
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,120
You just be your fairy tale gentleman.

119
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,920
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,480
Take good care of the baby.

121
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,880
Be careful.

122
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,440
I know.

123
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
So unreliable.

124
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,240
Wan Xinxin.

125
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,180
Where is everyone?

126
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,000
Those two said they had emergencies and can't make it.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Who can't make it?

128
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,080
Tong Tong and Ma Youyou.

129
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
Why aren't they coming?

130
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
How would I know?

131
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,500
How's it going?

132
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,890
Has everyone left the amusement park?

133
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,200
Sir.

134
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,960
It's almost time. Please restore the venue quickly,

135
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,320
okay?

136
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,919
Just a moment, just a moment.

137
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,159
Wait.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,680
Manager Yang says the time is almost up.

139
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,400
He wants the venue restored.

140
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,760
Miss Wan.

141
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,120
Since the show is over, we'll be leaving now.

142
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,120
We have things to do early tomorrow.

143
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,200
Please wait a little longer.

144
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,280
I'm trying to figure something out.

145
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,040
What's there to figure out?

146
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,080
This celebrity promotion event...

147
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,640
Without celebrities, what are we promoting?

148
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,240
That's right. Our time is valuable too.

149
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,680
We don't have time to waste here with you.

150
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,320
Please wait a bit longer.

151
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,050
I'll make another call and try to find a solution.

152
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,970
Wow, it's raining! Let's hurry and leave.

153
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,890
Don't leave! I'm trying to figure something out!

154
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,920
Don't go! None of you leave!

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Kids! Kids!

156
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,680
Don't go!

157
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,410
Please stay!

158
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,240
Little bunny!

159
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,300
Don't leave! Please, all of you stay!

160
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
Kids! Kids!

161
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,480
Xinxin, don't be discouraged.

162
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,400
Didn't you say

163
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,880
that someday you'd just get by?

164
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,340
But definitely not today.

165
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,240
I think it is today.

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,920
Why doesn't heaven help me

167
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,650
with all the efforts I've made?

168
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,560
I really can't get anything done.

169
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,240
Thankfully I have you.

170
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Where are you?

171
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:48,080
Lonely shadows respond to fragile nerves.

172
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,600
Thankfully I have you.

173
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,160
Where are you going?

174
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,400
Transparent mirror, don't shatter all over the floor.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,880
Can't live without you, can I hold you tight?

176
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,760
Such beautiful scenery, don't let it lose its meaning.

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,520
What are you standing there for? Go change your clothes.

178
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,640
You're a big star now, you know that?

179
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,020
This show can be saved.

180
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,400
Go, hurry!

181
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,120
Because of you,

182
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,240
memories exist.

183
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,760
Thankfully I have you.

184
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,280
Where are you?

185
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:06,480
Lonely shadows respond to fragile nerves.

186
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,160
Thankfully I have you.

187
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,720
Where are you going?

188
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,960
Transparent mirror, don't shatter all over the floor.

189
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,920
Can't live without you, can I hold you tight?

190
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Such beautiful scenery, don't let it lose its meaning.

191
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:45,360
Can't live without you, who's breathing so loudly?

192
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,680
Because of you, memories exist.

193
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:00,400
If indulgence is a kind of release,

194
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,920
Only later, again and again,

195
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,600
stung by old and new wounds.

196
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,920
Can't live without you,

197
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,520
can I hold you tight?

198
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,000
What?

199
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,720
Didn't I tell you

200
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,650
to keep Tong Tong and Ma Youyou busy for the whole day?

201
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,720
They didn't go. How could it succeed?

202
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,920
Enough. No need to explain.

203
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,520
Don't come to work tomorrow.

204
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,480
Dr. Hua.

205
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,520
Thank you.

206
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,280
What a coincidence.

207
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,280
So, are you still working at that hospital?

208
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,920
No, I'm a veterinarian now.

209
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,170
A veterinarian?

210
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,000
Hello.

211
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,320
Thank you so much for today.

212
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,400
I'm really grateful.

213
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,280
I don't know what I would've done without you.

214
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,210
You came to the rescue just in time.

215
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,560
You're thanking me?

216
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,960
I should be thanking him.

217
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,560
He saved my life.

218
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,760
Once on the highway,

219
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,880
I had a car accident

220
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
and hit my head.

221
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,040
Dr. Hua treated me.

222
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,280
I wouldn't be here today without Dr. Hua.

223
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,400
Let's not talk about the past.

224
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
The song was beautiful. Send it to me later.

225
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,640
And let's have tea sometime.

226
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,120
Okay.

227
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,480
Thank you.

228
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,440
That's settled then.

229
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay, goodbye.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,840
Goodbye.

231
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,960
Thank you.

232
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,760
Goodbye.

233
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,920
Thank you.

234
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,000
Don't you treat dogs?

235
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,520
You treat people too?

236
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,640
I used to treat people too.

237
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,540
You know what, Xinxin?

238
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,250
When you walked over

239
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,920
from that group of children,

240
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,080
truly, besides being stunningly beautiful,

241
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,540
you were full of strength.

242
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,200
Really?

243
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,920
Really.

244
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,920
Success!

245
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,320
Yay!

246
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,960
Well done.

247
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,560
Thank you.

248
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
Don't mention it.

249
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,280
This dress is quite tight.

250
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,440
It's really uncomfortable.

251
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,120
Being a princess isn't easy.

252
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,000
Wan Xinxin.

253
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
Hello?

254
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,420
Is this CEO Li from YouBei?

255
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,650
I'm Liu Wei, editor-in-chief of Frontier Magazine.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,600
I'm also pleased to meet you.

257
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,960
I heard that recently

258
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
you're promoting the YouBei brand.

259
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,200
Would you be interested

260
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,730
in collaborating with our magazine and sharing some insights?

261
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,740
Great, I'll have my secretary schedule a time with you.

262
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,240
Okay, bye-bye.

263
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,600
Oh my!

264
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,920
All the major video sites are going crazy with it.

265
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,720
Look at this!

266
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,660
It's all over my social media.

267
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,600
Man, you're amazing.

268
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,010
Xu Ke, get me some paper.

269
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,240
How did you come up with that idea?

270
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,650
I didn't know you could play piano.

271
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,330
It's not that I can really play.

272
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,520
The singer didn't recognize me at first.

273
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,650
It was pouring rain.

274
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,560
Later I felt that his song really spoke to me,

275
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,960
and what he said

276
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,800
about dedicating it to children far away

277
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,120
and about his wife - I was really moved.

278
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
And I happened to have practiced piano with my daughter for a few years,

279
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,080
so I could fill in.

280
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm telling you, excessive modesty

281
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,380
is just another form of pride.

282
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,720
Pretending to be calm,

283
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,120
you're like the big bad wolf

284
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,640
who can't hide his tail.

285
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
The big bad wolf's tail should be held high.

286
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,440
Let me tell you something.

287
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,040
Do you know what I'm looking at?

288
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,400
The YouBei brand

289
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,800
has seen its online sales

290
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
increase threefold already.

291
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,240
This trend usually continues for three to four days,

292
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,800
based on my experience.

293
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
If there's nothing wrong with the product itself,

294
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
this upward trend will continue.

295
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,780
Your Highness.

296
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Um, well...

297
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,680
This fairy tale world project was a success, right?

298
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,400
Do you think that female tyrant

299
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,330
won't give you a hard time anymore?

300
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,320
Success becomes history.

301
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,800
Don't always focus

302
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,000
on past achievements.

303
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,840
Prepare for the next challenge.

304
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,319
You're all talk and no action.

305
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,560
By the way, old timer.

306
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,119
I have a very serious question to ask you.

307
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,160
Ask.

308
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,760
Who are you really?

309
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,359
I am who I am.

310
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,800
A firework about to burn out at forty.

311
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,760
Cut it out.

312
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,760
No, you say you're a vet.

313
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,680
Spending your days rescuing cats and dogs.

314
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,920
How do you have so many connections?

315
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,240
Right.

316
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,080
I'm telling you, last time he used German

317
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
to help me close a deal.

318
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,560
You even diagnosed my brother's mysterious condition.

319
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,360
Yes, and today...

320
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,220
Today that team leader said you once saved his life.

321
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,880
Who are you really?

322
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,560
Bro.

323
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,280
You're not some high-level

324
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,080
international spy hiding in our country, are you?

325
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,120
Or maybe you're an alien?

326
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,880
I'm just from

327
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,600
the monkey babysitter academy.

328
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,600
Come on, that's so lame.

329
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,600
Just tell us quietly.

330
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,520
We'll definitely keep it secret, right?

331
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,160
Exactly.

332
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,280
Come on, tell us.

333
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm really tired.

334
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,320
Well...

335
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,280
I really can't keep up anymore. I'm getting old.

336
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,880
I'm going to rest for a while.

337
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,920
No, why do you need to rest?

338
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,880
Let's go celebrate later.

339
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,800
Yeah, we're going for drinks!

340
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,840
How about we have a couple of drinks?

341
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,920
I'm old. I really can't party anymore.

342
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,400
Come on.

343
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,280
Hey, don't go.

344
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,740
Seriously, you're no fun.

345
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,200
Why are you such a buzzkill?

346
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,960
Getting older

347
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,240
and aging.

348
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,120
Xu Huahua.

349
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,200
Don't you think this guy is special?

350
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,440
He seems to have many stories.

351
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,850
Don't you see it?

352
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,880
Every man has

353
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,040
a hidden pain.

354
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,160
If you want to open his heart,

355
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,360
there's only one way.

356
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,360
What way?

357
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,520
Love.

358
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,240
Hit you.

359
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,840
Wan Xinxin and Xu Ke's excited questioning

360
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,480
left me speechless.

361
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,720
That so-called medical accident

362
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,380
leaving the medical profession I loved.

363
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,440
My wife's departure without a word.

364
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
My daughter's misunderstanding of me.

365
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,050
All these painful memories

366
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,360
are still hurting me deeply.

367
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,960
She-devil.

368
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,200
Hurry up!

369
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,200
Hello, Mr. Shi.

370
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,800
This is all part of my job.

371
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,650
Please don't thank me, really.

372
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,280
As long as you're satisfied.

373
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,680
What? They're suing us?

374
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,240
According to the contract,

375
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,600
we are indeed in breach.

376
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,720
Is YouBei determined to resolve this through legal action?

377
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,040
They said negotiation is possible,

378
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,280
but they're demanding substantial compensation.

379
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,080
It could break our cash flow.

380
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,650
Something's not right.

381
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,640
Something must have gone wrong somewhere.

382
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,680
Where else could it be?

383
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,720
It must be that Wan Xinxin.

384
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,120
She mishandled the situation and angered the client.

385
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,450
This isn't the first time she's done this.

386
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,600
Now look what's happened.

387
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,400
She's ruined everything for us.

388
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,290
Stop panicking.

389
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,970
Let's solve the problem first.

390
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,160
Go call YouBei again.

391
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,050
Find out what the real issue is.

392
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,520
Notify the finance department.

393
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,880
Have them estimate our payment capacity.

394
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
Tell the project department to follow up on

395
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,520
the final payments for the other events.

396
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
Okay, I'll do it right away.

397
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,960
This Wan Xinxin...

398
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,020
Why isn't she here yet?

399
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,120
Hello?

400
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,440
Okay.

401
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,800
Hi.

402
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,200
Team leader.

403
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,730
Alright.

404
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:38,840
Xinxin.

405
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,440
The event was done very well.

406
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,880
That's amazing!

407
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,840
You're in big trouble this time.

408
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,520
Let's see how you explain this to Director Shi.

409
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,720
So our chances of winning aren't great.

410
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,780
Come in.

411
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,760
Let's do this, Attorney Ma.

412
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,720
I'll send you a copy of the contract.

413
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,050
Please review it for me.

414
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,840
See what would happen if we go to court.

415
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,100
What's the best possible outcome for us?

416
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,420
Good. Thank you for your help.

417
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,680
Thanks.

418
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,610
Director Shi, what's going on?

419
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
Is YouBei still suing us?

420
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,000
This morning,

421
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,880
someone from YouBei called.

422
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,080
They accused us of breach of contract and fraud.

423
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,080
We didn't bring the celebrities as required by the contract.

424
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,440
They said we made false promotions.

425
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,360
And seriously damaged their company's credibility.

426
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,290
Wait, this promotion already achieved its purpose.

427
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,960
Their click rates shot through the roof.

428
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,680
And now they turn around and want to sue us?

429
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,520
That's completely unreasonable.

430
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,380
It doesn't matter what we say now.

431
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,280
We did fail to fulfill the contract.

432
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,140
We didn't bring the celebrities.

433
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,200
Look, if they're suing us,

434
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,080
then we should sue those celebrities who breached their contracts.

435
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,160
This kind of circular lawsuit wastes time and energy.

436
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,020
Worst of all, it damages our company's reputation.

437
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,000
Nobody can afford that.

438
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,760
However, I think YouBei's challenge

439
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,600
isn't just about the contract.

440
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,130
There must be other issues.

441
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,880
I've dealt with Director Li from YouBei.

442
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,720
I don't think he's the type

443
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,050
to burn bridges after crossing the river.

444
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,920
Wan Xinxin, during this whole process,

445
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,120
did you break any rules

446
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,080
or have any conflicts of interest with YouBei?

447
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,400
No.

448
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,480
Wait, Director Shi.

449
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,840
You don't suspect I'm deceiving you

450
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,160
and taking bribes behind your back, do you?

451
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,620
It's better if you didn't.

452
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,600
Fortunately, they said there's still room for negotiation.

453
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,480
You know the most about this situation.

454
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,240
Go there.

455
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,960
You must find out what the real issue is.

456
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,200
Don't worry.

457
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,800
I'll handle this right away.

458
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,920
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

459
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,400
Find out what's really going on.

460
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,260
I'll give you a full explanation.

461
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,250
How's it going? Is it resolved?

462
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,380
He's not answering his phone.

463
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,000
Hey, are you okay?

464
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,260
If you really broke it,

465
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,080
how would you answer incoming calls?

466
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,040
No, I mean, the event was so well organized,

467
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,880
why would he turn around and blame us?

468
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,330
If this Li guy really dares to shift the blame,

469
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,240
I'll crush him.

470
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,530
No, no, no, stop.

471
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,680
I don't care who you crush,

472
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,880
but if you break this, your brother will still want to play with it.

473
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Do you have ADHD?

474
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,080
Can you please settle down for a moment?

475
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,200
No.

476
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
Of course you're not worried since she's not your friend.

477
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,400
Right. I'm not her friend, I'm her uncle.

478
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,840
But I am Bao's friend.

479
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,720
Let me tell you how to solve this.

480
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,160
Wait until Wan Xinxin figures out what happened.

481
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,760
Then we'll discuss what to do next when she returns. Understand?

482
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,130
I'll give Wan Xinxin a call.

483
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,050
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

484
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,460
Everything I said was wasted.

485
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,040
What I mean is that now

486
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,600
if Wan Xinxin is handling something,

487
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,860
wouldn't your call be interrupting her?

488
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,640
Let her figure out what's going on completely.

489
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,640
We'll discuss our strategy after she comes back.

490
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,700
Do you understand?

491
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,200
Oh my, this...

492
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,360
I really can't...

493
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,000
Fine, fine. Go on.

494
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,520
Whatever I say to you is pointless.

495
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,720
Keep your voice down.

496
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,360
Bao is sleeping inside, right?

497
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,600
Go away. He's inside.

498
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,680
Mr. Li,

499
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,920
this international baby products expo

500
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,450
is an important domestic exchange platform.

501
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,480
Our Frontier Magazine

502
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,440
will definitely provide extensive coverage regularly.

503
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,280
I believe this will be

504
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,520
a great opportunity for YouBei brand

505
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,120
to enter the international market.

506
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
Thank you for all your hard work, Mr. Li.

507
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,280
Not at all.

508
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,760
I should really thank you.

509
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,720
It's only through your efforts

510
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,320
that we got an entry ticket.

511
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,080
Mr. Li, you're too kind.

512
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,000
Since you've entrusted us

513
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
with your brand promotion,

514
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
you are our top priority.

515
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,040
Serving you is our duty.

516
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,720
Then YouBei's future promotion

517
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,200
will be entirely in your hands.

518
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,000
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Li.

519
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,880
I believe

520
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,410
we'll have a pleasant cooperation this time.

521
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,040
Mr. Li.

522
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,800
Mr. Li.

523
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,040
Miss Wan from Lady Company called.

524
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,170
She wants to see you.

525
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,160
It's about the promotion contract breach.

526
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,600
Mr. Li, since you've entrusted me

527
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,120
with all the promotion rights,

528
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,580
please catch your flight without worrying.

529
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,240
Director Liu, I actually think Lady Company's

530
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,320
promotional activities were quite good.

531
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,850
Don't be so strict about it.

532
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,180
Business is business.

533
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,320
Sometimes even bad news

534
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,440
can increase brand awareness.

535
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,920
Besides, these minor legal matters,

536
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,320
don't you trust that I can handle them well?

537
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,480
Alright then. Thank you for your help.

538
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,760
I need to catch my flight.

539
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,440
Take care.

540
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,120
Go tell Wan Xinxin to come see me.

541
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,520
Where?

542
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,200
To that coffee shop she knows.

543
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,480
Hello.

544
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,240
Oh, Mr. Li is abroad.

545
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,480
What coffee shop?

546
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,100
What a coincidence running into you.

547
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,880
I was just thirsty.

548
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,400
What's wrong, Director Liu?

549
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,000
Feeling guilty? What have you done wrong?

550
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,650
Wan Xinxin, stop playing dumb.

551
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,760
I believe you already know.

552
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,560
YouBei's promotional campaign

553
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,240
is now handled by us,

554
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,840
Frontier Culture Group, with full authority.

555
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,920
I have the power to decide whether to sue your company.

556
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,160
So I suggest you be nice to me.

557
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,720
Don't flatter yourself.

558
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,960
I didn't come here today

559
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,490
to discuss YouBei with you.

560
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,040
Mr. Li will talk to you when he returns.

561
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,360
Don't worry about it.

562
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
I suggest you don't waste your time.

563
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,320
Do you think I'll give you that time?

564
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,000
Besides, one article from Frontier

565
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,760
is worth more than ten of your events.

566
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,640
Who do you think he'll listen to?

567
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,400
I've been respectfully calling you Director Liu.

568
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,930
Seems you don't deserve it.

569
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,100
What game are you playing?

570
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,600
Take your child and leave this city,

571
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,820
and I won't pursue the YouBei matter.

572
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,120
Otherwise,

573
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,130
you know the consequences.

574
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,700
You're really shameless.

575
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
What grudge do you have against me?

576
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
Why do you keep harassing me

577
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,920
like a ghost that won't go away?

578
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,720
You're the one who won't go away.

579
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
You're the one constantly

580
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,220
using your child to cling to Qin Gang.

581
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,640
I've said it before.

582
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,480
As long as

583
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,000
you remain in Qin Gang's sight,

584
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
I won't leave you alone for a day.

585
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,560
Liu Wei, I really want to ask you.

586
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,480
In your career, you're

587
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,560
a somewhat successful woman.

588
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,360
But why in relationships

589
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,480
do you become so possessive

590
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,400
and insecure?

591
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,520
I've already told you,

592
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,160
I have no interest in your precious Qin Gang.

593
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,810
People say whatever they want.

594
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,840
The least trustworthy thing

595
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
in this world is a person's promise.

596
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,400
Even if I'm gone,

597
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,860
there will be other women.

598
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Aren't you tired of being like this?

599
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,240
Stop pretending to be so noble here.

600
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,840
All this talk about love.

601
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,320
Don't act like you're some saint.

602
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,080
You just turn around and use your child

603
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,360
to get money from Qin Gang.

604
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,200
Why don't you just be clear

605
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,940
about how much money you want?

606
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,570
So you don't have to put on this act all day.

607
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Aren't you tired?

608
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,920
That's bullshit! Who asked Qin Gang for money?

609
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,920
You didn't, but your sister did.

610
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,580
Is there a difference?

611
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,480
My sister did ask,

612
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,080
but she already returned

613
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,740
that 100,000 yuan to Qin Gang.

614
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,340
Whether it's been returned or not, only you know the truth.

615
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,280
She didn't return it?

616
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,120
Wan Xinxin, stop acting innocent here.

617
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,840
These little tricks of yours,

618
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,720
I've seen through them all.

619
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,760
What? Exposed and want to run?

620
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,890
I'll look into the money issue.

621
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,040
But Mr. Liu,

622
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,160
don't use UBay to threaten me anymore.

623
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,420
If you have any issues,

624
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,730
come directly at me.

625
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,160
At you?

626
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
What do you have?

627
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,290
Let me tell you clearly.

628
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm going to destroy your pathetic company.

629
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,800
I'll make everyone know

630
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,960
that you, Wan Xinxin, are completely selfish.

631
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,240
Anyone associated with you

632
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,360
will end up bankrupt because of you.

633
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,640
Liu Wei, you're truly despicable.

634
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,720
Do these angry words help?

635
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
If you don't want this to happen,

636
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,320
then disappear.

637
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,760
When you've made up your mind, give me a call.

638
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,400
The number you have dialed is currently powered off.

639
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,930
Why is the phone turned off?

640
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,880
Hello, Miss Shen.

641
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,000
Yes, I'm at home.

642
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,560
What? Shen?

643
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,320
Miss Shen, didn't you say it was a sure profit?

644
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,320
I don't care about anything else.

645
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,080
I want you to return my money.

646
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,320
What?

647
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Miss Shen?

648
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,290
What did she say?

649
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,159
Miss Shen says she has invested her money too

650
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,520
and can't get it back anytime soon.

651
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,679
She says there's nothing she can do.

652
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,679
When she took the money initially,

653
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,600
she said there wouldn't be any problems.

654
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,240
How can she say there's nothing she can do after taking the money?

655
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,880
No way. I have to get the money back.

656
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,520
Kaiyang, have you been scammed?

657
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,400
This is our family's

658
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,120
entire savings that you're holding.

659
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,400
I told you before,

660
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,080
there's no such thing as free money.

661
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,960
But you wouldn't listen.

662
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,000
You were just dreaming of getting rich.

663
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,240
Now look what's happened.

664
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,640
Can you please shut up?

665
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,640
Miss Shen?

666
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Director Zheng?

667
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,440
What?

668
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,320
Okay, I'll be right there.

669
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,580
I'm coming right away.

670
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,440
What's happened now?

671
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,640
Director Zheng says there's a problem with Miss Shen's company.

672
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,100
I need to get there right away.

673
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,080
Will you be okay, Kaiyang?

674
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,740
What are we going to do?

675
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,810
It never rains but it pours.

676
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,840
I'll beat you to death!

677
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,760
I'll kill you!

678
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,160
Can you keep it down?

679
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,220
Don't you know the child is sleeping?

680
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,810
It's Wan Xinxin.

681
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,280
Someone's looking for you.

682
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,940
Who's that?

683
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,120
Qin Gang.

684
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,720
Hello, Mr. Qin.

685
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,930
You want to see the baby, right?

686
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,420
The baby just fell asleep.

687
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,040
Alright, come over.

688
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,280
By the time you get here, the baby will be awake.

689
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,520
I just wanted to ask about something.

690
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,800
When I visit the baby, I want to bring formula.

691
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,160
Which kind should I buy?

692
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:56,520
What?

693
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,320
Just get the 0-3 months formula.

694
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,000
Let me check.

695
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,890
They really have it.

696
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,080
This isn't very expensive.

697
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,160
It's not the most expensive one, okay?

698
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,490
The baby has been drinking this all along.

699
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,160
Okay, fine.

700
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,090
If you say it's good, I believe you.

701
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,120
Great. Wait for me.

702
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,260
I'll be there soon.

703
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,890
Who's there?

704
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,080
It's me.

705
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,000
Who is it?

706
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,480
Me.

707
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,520
Xinxin.

708
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,120
Put the knife down first.

709
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,440
Okay, I'll put it down.

710
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,600
Come inside quickly. I need to tell you something.

711
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,400
Just a moment.

712
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,360
Oh my goodness!

713
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,760
Come in and I'll tell you.

714
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,640
Who bullied you?

715
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,400
Who else? Your brother-in-law, of course.

716
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Brother-in-law?

717
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,770
Okay, that's it.

718
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,170
You're welcome.

719
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,610
Hey, mister.

720
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,130
Call me brother.

721
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,960
Wait, you seem pretty close with Qin Gang.

722
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,280
Not really. He's just the child's father.

723
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,640
Come, let's have a chat.

724
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,240
What's up?

725
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,440
Qin Gang wants to visit the child.

726
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,240
Yes, the biological father wants to see his child.

727
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
Now he suddenly remembers to see his child?

728
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,000
It's too late.

729
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,080
No way. I'm telling you.

730
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,320
He absolutely cannot see the child. Let him suffer.

731
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
He's a beast.

732
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Heartless.

733
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,920
So the child doesn't need to know who his father is.

734
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,080
Knowing me is enough.

735
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,840
And you shouldn't get involved, okay?

736
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,920
Just calm down first.

737
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,000
Really, birds of a feather flock together.

738
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,840
You and Wan Xinxin truly deserve to be best friends.

739
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,770
You two think exactly the same way.

740
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,600
Do you understand what blood is thicker than water means?

741
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,200
Aren't you depriving

742
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,000
a father of his right to see his child?

743
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,040
Calm down.

744
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,760
You're also depriving the child of the right to see their father.

745
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,560
What right do you have to do this?

746
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,640
Besides, even if we take a step back,

747
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,120
who are you to make these decisions?

748
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,320
You think you can just forbid them from meeting?

749
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,280
At most, you're just the child's mother's best friend,

750
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,040
just a godmother.

751
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,880
And the biological father can't even see his child?

752
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,520
You're talking about me?

753
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,560
You've only been in this family for how many days?

754
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,640
How long have you known Wan Xinxin?

755
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,680
I've known her for years.

756
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,520
I'm talking about Qin Gang and me.

757
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,780
Enough. I don't agree.

758
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,640
I simply don't agree.

759
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,920
I don't agree to him seeing the child.

760
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
It's that simple.

761
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,000
Wan Xinxin herself has already agreed.

762
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,040
What does your disagreement matter?

763
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,280
Wan Xinxin agreed?

764
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,640
Impossible.

765
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Turn it off.

766
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,930
It's off.

767
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,440
Okay.

768
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,760
Even if Wan Xinxin doesn't agree,

769
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,200
aren't you Wan Xinxin's best friend?

770
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,800
Aren't you?

771
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,240
Yes.

772
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,800
Right?

773
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,520
What are friends like? Friends are like mirrors,

774
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,650
right? They should remind each other.

775
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,440
You should help your friend

776
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,170
make the right decision when they're in trouble.

777
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,640
Now if Wan Xinxin

778
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,040
agrees to let Qin Gang see the child,

779
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,240
isn't that the best thing

780
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,900
for the child's development?

781
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,880
Brother,

782
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,560
I can't continue this conversation with you.

783
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,120
Why?

784
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,120
We have a generation gap.

785
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,920
Then you should still call me mister.

786
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,720
I might as well call you grandpa.

787
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,280
Hey, why are you acting like an old lady

788
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,920
nagging all the time,

789
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,600
even worse than me?

790
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,170
Can't you be more manly?

791
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,040
And this is your idea of being manly?

792
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,370
Listen, Xu Ke, stop being so stubborn now.

793
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
You don't understand.

794
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,600
When you have your own child,

795
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,730
you'll understand why I'm doing this.

796
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,560
Let me tell you,

797
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,520
if you get hungry,

798
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,680
go to the kitchen and make something to eat.

799
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,880
I'm not eating anything.

800
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,240
I'll throw up again when I see that jerk later.

801
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,280
What a waste of food.

802
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,800
Oh, by the way,

803
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,280
if Wan Xinxin calls,

804
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,880
let me know immediately.

805
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,160
Take a shower.

806
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,120
Keep your voice down.

807
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,400
At first, I was really thinking of you.

808
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,480
I originally wanted to take that 100,000 yuan

809
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,680
to make more money for your retirement.

810
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,720
But now

811
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,160
I've even lost my own funeral money.

812
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,920
I'm so sorry.

813
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,960
Please don't blame me.

814
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,000
Alright, stop crying.

815
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,340
Problems that money can solve aren't big problems.

816
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,720
Let's do this. I'll find a way

817
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,320
to pay back Qin Gang's money.

818
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,300
Well...

819
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,400
Now I'm worried about your brother-in-law.

820
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,080
Do you think something might happen to him?

821
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,320
You see the anti-corruption campaign now,

822
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,780
the situation is so tense.

823
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,810
My brother-in-law isn't that kind of person.

824
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,040
Do you think he might have embezzled public funds?

825
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,440
Could he have taken bribes?

826
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
Could he already be under investigation?

827
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,040
Impossible.

828
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,300
Don't overthink things here.

829
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:44,920
Yang Ming
