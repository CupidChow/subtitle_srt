1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,160
Like a gentle breeze.

3
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,520
Wan Xinxin

4
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,120
Melting away past attachments.

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,880
Wan Xinxin

6
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,480
A maple leaf falls.

7
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,960
Scattering my gaze

8
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,000
Taking away my longing.

9
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,360
If fate is meeting a stranger.

10
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,040
That familiar feeling is just

11
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,680
A moment in time.

12
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,160
My heart stops at this moment.

13
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,720
Xinxin

14
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,680
Falling in love with each other.

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,720
I want to just

16
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,520
Snuggle up beside you.

17
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,440
Xinxin

18
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Forgetting where we are.

19
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,680
If love can have no expiration date.

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,880
You old rascal.

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
So you finally got what you deserve.

22
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,530
That's what you get for not helping me.

23
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,600
I want to just

24
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,240
Snuggle up beside you.

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,760
Forgetting about time.

26
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,480
If love can have no expiration date.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Only after turning around do I realize

28
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
Your

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,600
My

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,660
Path to happiness.

31
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,960
Don't play around like that.

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,000
Pull me up.

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
You scared me to death.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
You're really nervous

35
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,360
Come here.

36
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,500
Forgetting the place.

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,920
If love no longer has

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,160
Any boundaries.

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,440
No matter each day

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,840
You're here, I'm here.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,360
Do you dare or not?

42
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,080
I don't dare, I don't dare.

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,120
Come on, try again. It's okay.

44
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,850
I don't dare.

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
In my heart.

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
I don't dare.

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,480
I don't dare, I was wrong.

48
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,400
I was wrong.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,460
I won't dare again.

50
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,079
You old rascal, I'm starving.

51
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,740
I'm so hungry my stomach is touching my back.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,040
If I don't eat something soon, I'll die.

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,570
About to die and still playing pranks.

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,020
You deserve to starve.

55
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,770
Wait. How could I let you go hungry?

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,520
What's this?

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,079
You old rascal.

58
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,200
Do you have any conscience?

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,000
Hiding all this food and tricking me into fishing.

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
I have no conscience?

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,440
I have no conscience bringing you all these snacks?

62
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
How could I bear to let you go hungry?

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,260
Looks like you care about me quite a bit, huh?

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,720
I'll

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,170
Gather some firewood and make a fire so you don't catch cold.

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
The firewood seems to be over there.

67
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,880
Are you catching a cold?

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
Just because I sneezed doesn't mean I have a cold.

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,880
Let me tell you, I'm perfectly healthy.

70
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,680
I haven't had a cold in ten years.

71
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,920
I sneezed because someone is thinking about me.

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,250
Two sneezes means someone is cursing you.

73
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,420
You really feel a bit warm.

74
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,080
Using your hand isn't accurate.

75
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
Then what would be accurate?

76
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,200
A thermometer.

77
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,340
I didn't bring a thermometer.

78
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
So there you have it.

79
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,400
I told you I'm fine.

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,730
You're something else.

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,000
You really are a bit warm.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,320
Really. Maybe we should go.

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,040
Really?

84
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,720
Yeah.

85
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,760
Using your face isn't accurate either.

86
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,680
You have to use your lips for accuracy.

87
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,080
Nonsense. Who says that?

88
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,840
When we were kids, we always used our lips to check.

89
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,040
You're serious?

90
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,120
Stubborn.

91
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,160
Can't you be a bit more professional and check properly?

92
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,320
Follow-up examination.

93
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,080
It's really a bit...

94
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,840
Thankfully I have you.

95
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,640
Where are you?

96
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,360
A lonely shadow

97
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,880
responds to fragile nerves.

98
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,200
Thankfully I have you.

99
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,040
Where are you going?

100
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,840
The transparent mirror

101
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,200
don't shatter all over the ground again.

102
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,600
I can't be without you.

103
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,880
Can I hold you tight?

104
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,120
Don't let such beautiful scenery lose its meaning.

105
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
I can't be without you.

106
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,280
Who's breathing loudly?

107
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,560
Because of you,

108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,000
I have memories.

109
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,760
Thankfully I have you.

110
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,000
Where are you?

111
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,560
A lonely shadow

112
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,240
responds to fragile nerves.

113
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,880
Thankfully I have you.

114
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,960
Where are you going?

115
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,720
The transparent mirror

116
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,240
don't shatter all over the ground again.

117
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,640
I can't be without you.

118
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,600
Can I hold you tight?

119
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,799
Are you cold?

120
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,760
No, I'm not.

121
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Put this on even if you're not cold.

122
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,490
It's fine. I'm not cold.

123
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,010
What do you mean not cold? You have a fever.

124
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,450
It'll be ready soon.

125
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,300
What are you doing?

126
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,160
What?

127
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,200
Don't you know you can't drink alcohol after taking medicine?

128
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,240
It's fine.

129
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,970
When I say no drinking, I mean no drinking.

130
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,960
Uncle, when you care about me,

131
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,570
you're so domineering,

132
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
so charming,

133
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,680
such a good man.

134
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,490
Did you say 'good man' or 'boring man'?

135
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,880
Good man.

136
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
Man.

137
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,170
That's a sheep you're drawing.

138
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,560
You're so full of yourself.

139
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,610
Speak properly.

140
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Do you know you're just like Baymax?

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Who?

142
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,280
Baymax.

143
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,520
Your ex-boyfriend?

144
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,440
He's every girl's boyfriend.

145
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,120
All girls want a Baymax

146
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
to be their boyfriend,

147
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,340
to protect and take care of them forever.

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,660
I'm like Baymax? Is Baymax handsome?

149
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,360
Not really handsome.

150
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
He's cute, white, and chubby,

151
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,840
with a soft belly.

152
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Cute, white, chubby,

153
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,240
soft belly.

154
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,420
You're describing

155
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,440
a pig.

156
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
No, that's not it.

157
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Let me show you.

158
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,880
Well, Baymax is an inflatable robot

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,240
who won many girls' hearts

160
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
with his adorable appearance and kind heart.

161
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,640
He's basically the god of cuteness now.

162
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,450
Look, he has a special ability.

163
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,800
He can scan you

164
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,440
and know your emotional state,

165
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
whether you're sick or not.

166
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,620
If you're sick, he can even treat you.

167
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,880
See? Isn't that like you?

168
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,440
You treat me when I'm sick.

169
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,440
You're always by my side when I need you.

170
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
So aren't you Baymax?

171
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,800
I am Baymax.

172
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,720
I'm scanning Wan Xinxin.

173
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,040
Wan Xinxin has a fever and needs rest.

174
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,960
Let's go home.

175
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,880
No. Why?

176
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,480
Be good.

177
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,560
I still have something to do.

178
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,560
What is it?

179
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
Something important. I need to make a wish.

180
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,080
What wish? Do it next time.

181
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,760
No way.

182
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,480
I promised my little brother. Really.

183
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,880
Please, I'm begging you.

184
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,440
Do you know what wish I'm making?

185
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,810
Must be a wish for your little brother.

186
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,720
I hope my little brother grows up quickly,

187
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,520
becomes a real man soon,

188
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,520
stops crying so often,

189
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,760
and can protect me when he grows up.

190
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,080
Wan Xinxin, with your fighting skills so high,

191
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,740
do you still need protection?

192
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,720
Of course.

193
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm a girl,

194
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,770
and girls naturally want to be protected.

195
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,080
A girl.

196
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,280
Uncle,

197
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,720
what kind of person am I in your eyes?

198
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,080
A patient.

199
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,360
Besides being a patient?

200
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,690
A patient who's about to have a high fever.

201
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,920
Make a wish quickly and let's go.

202
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Okay? Let's go.

203
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,820
You should make a wish too.

204
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,800
Come on, make one too.

205
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,760
I don't want to.

206
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,040
Don't be like that. We're already here.

207
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,520
Fine, but don't peek.

208
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,920
Dear old banyan tree,

209
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,600
please help my wish come true.

210
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,200
After my wish comes true,

211
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,460
I promise I'll come back here.

212
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,880
I'll water you and give you fertilizer,

213
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,600
and give you a big hug.

214
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,920
Dear old banyan tree,

215
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,000
you must help my wish come true.

216
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,400
Please bless me.

217
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,120
What did you wish for?

218
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,880
The wishing tree only needs to know.

219
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
If I tell you, it won't come true.

220
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,240
But I told you mine.

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
Share yours with me.

222
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,400
No.

223
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,160
Come on.

224
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,570
Fine, I'll tell you, but don't get mad.

225
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,840
My wish is

226
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,440
for Wan Xinxin

227
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,420
to disappear from here immediately.

228
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,800
Are you serious?

229
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,480
Yes,

230
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,200
see? The wish is coming true.

231
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,800
You jerk!

232
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,120
Well, now you've learned how to lie.

233
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,040
How could you lie to me? Lying to a sick person.

234
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,160
Is that appropriate?

235
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,080
Being sick is such a hassle.

236
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,000
And you're bullying a sick person.

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,880
Hurry up and get on the horse. Let's go.

238
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,680
Get on.

239
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,940
I'll do you a favor.

240
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,280
It's not that heavy, is it?

241
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
It's crushing me. This could sell for good money.

242
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,360
Stop it.

243
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,580
Let's go. Giddyup!

244
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,000
Tomorrow I'm going to marry you!

245
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,960
Tomorrow I'll be your bride!

246
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
I couldn't hit the high note.

247
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Why are you wearing so little again?

248
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
Didn't you say you had a fever?

249
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm a bride now.

250
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,720
Be serious.

251
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,280
If you keep acting like this, you'll end up on an IV.

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,360
This moment will never come again.

253
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,620
I don't want to miss it.

254
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,400
Let's go back.

255
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,520
Old man, even though this honeymoon is fake,

256
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,160
it's the first one in my life.

257
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,800
Maybe also the last one.

258
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,850
Could you help me record it?

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,040
Please?

260
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
Your singing is terrible.

261
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,360
Let's go.

262
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,560
Slow down.

263
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,540
I want to take photos here.

264
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,160
Xinxin.

265
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,530
Why are you here?

266
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,840
Xinxin.

267
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,100
Are you really going to marry him?

268
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,200
Why can't you give me another chance?

269
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,120
There's no need for us

270
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,280
to continue this conversation anymore.

271
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,360
Please leave right now.

272
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,760
Why can't we continue?

273
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,680
No, what I mean is

274
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,560
I know I made many mistakes before.

275
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,560
I hurt you deeply.

276
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,800
But I sincerely hope

277
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,520
you can give me another chance.

278
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,650
Let me make up for the pain I caused you.

279
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,370
I hope it's not too late.

280
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,960
It's too late.

281
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,440
We're about to have our wedding.

282
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,800
Xinxin.

283
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,840
Give me one more chance.

284
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,880
Will you marry me?

285
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
It's really over between us.

286
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,040
Xinxin.

287
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,720
Xinxin.

288
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,599
You really can't be with him.

289
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,680
She has a fever and needs to leave now.

290
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,560
Xinxin.

291
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,560
Please give me one more chance.

292
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,320
I'm warning you, don't get in my way.

293
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,880
Shut up! She's my wife.

294
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,720
Xinxin, we're the real couple.

295
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,240
Don't forget, we have a little one.

296
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,280
He's our child.

297
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,520
Please come back.

298
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,680
I promise you.

299
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I'll give you a complete family again.

300
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,840
Qin Gang.

301
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,160
I've already told you. You're too late.

302
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,080
Xinxin.

303
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,200
If you don't agree,

304
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I'll jump off that stone bridge.

305
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,490
Are you crazy, Qin Gang?

306
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Joking about something like this.

307
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,280
You said I haven't grown up.

308
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,800
Who's the immature one here?

309
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,280
If I keep hanging around with a kid like you,

310
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,720
I'll lose my mind.

311
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,250
Let's go.

312
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,200
You don't believe me?

313
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,450
If you don't believe me, I'll really jump.

314
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,440
Go ahead and jump then. Be my guest.

315
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Qin Gang!

316
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,800
Doctor, how's my friend doing?

317
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,880
Nothing serious.

318
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,200
He just hit his head and lost consciousness briefly.

319
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,600
He has a mild concussion.

320
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,240
We'll need to keep him under observation for a few days.

321
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,560
Can I go in and see him?

322
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,080
Go ahead.

323
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,680
Sure.

324
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,810
I'll go check on him.

325
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,280
It's okay. Don't try to get up.

326
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,320
The doctor said you have a mild concussion

327
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,450
and need to be monitored for a few days.

328
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,880
You should get some rest.

329
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,320
As long as I can see you,

330
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,490
I'm completely satisfied.

331
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Serves you right.

332
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,080
Look at you, a grown man

333
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,760
still doing such foolish things.

334
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,320
If you had hit a sharp rock,

335
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,680
you would be dead now.

336
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,000
Xinxin.

337
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,240
I was too immature before.

338
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
Too thoughtless.

339
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,960
It wasn't until you left with our child

340
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,080
that I realized

341
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,400
you two are the most important people in my life.

342
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,840
Lulu.

343
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,040
Lulu.

344
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,400
Shi Lu.

345
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,640
Lulu.

346
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,050
What are you doing here?

347
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,440
You're home.

348
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,880
Well...

349
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
No, I haven't told anyone anything.

350
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,480
You need to leave now.

351
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,410
If you don't go, I'll call someone.

352
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,800
Okay, I'm leaving right now.

353
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,480
Um, the flowers I bought you...

354
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,400
I'll leave them at the door. Remember to pick them up.

355
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,840
Alright, just go now.

356
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,820
Well...

357
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
Go quickly.

358
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,570
Remember to take them. I'm leaving them here.

359
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,280
Hello?

360
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,080
Hello, it's me.

361
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,840
Listen, tell Wan Xinxin

362
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,080
that I agree to her terms.

363
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,920
I won't deal with her directly.

364
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,480
As long as she accepts our company

365
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
for the design and promotion of this project,

366
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,400
I'll agree to any of her conditions.

367
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,120
I'll definitely make it happen.

368
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,450
Then here's to a successful partnership.

369
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
Okay, goodbye.

370
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,660
You're really going all in this time.

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,200
You have to spend money to make money.

372
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,600
It's her fault for not agreeing.

373
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,440
I didn't want to jump either.

374
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,240
I just slipped and fell down.

375
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,640
Don't you know how dangerous that was?

376
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,300
Don't you know I'd be worried?

377
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,200
You know, this trick actually worked quite well.

378
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,660
Wan Xinxin's attitude softened right away.

379
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,560
I really don't understand.

380
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,160
Her attitude has clearly improved.

381
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,560
Why do you still want her to take over your work?

382
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,080
I can't let your teachings go to waste, right?

383
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,280
This move alone won't secure victory.

384
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,120
I have even better tricks up my sleeve.

385
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,680
I plan to use this auto show

386
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,920
not only to completely crush her spirit,

387
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,720
but also to make sure that once she falls,

388
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,200
she can never get back up again.

389
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,480
Well done!

390
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,610
You're a quick learner.

391
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,640
Look at you.

392
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,920
Mr. Shi.

393
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,360
I've already resigned.

394
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,520
Technically, I'm no longer with Ledi.

395
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,400
I haven't approved your resignation letter yet.

396
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,240
Is it you who hasn't approved it or Qin Gang?

397
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,560
I understand. You're just doing your job.

398
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,760
But do you know

399
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,620
why he wants me to do this project?

400
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,040
He just wants me to make some money

401
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,770
to ease his guilty conscience.

402
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,810
I absolutely refuse to do this.

403
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,720
But you're wrong.

404
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,280
He trusts your abilities.

405
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,560
From the first day you met him,

406
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,960
he's been running this 4S dealership.

407
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,440
No one in our company knows it better than you.

408
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,520
So his insistence on this point

409
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,760
isn't without reason.

410
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,300
You're the most suitable candidate.

411
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,890
Really? He actually told you that?

412
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,200
Not only that,

413
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,560
he specifically told me

414
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,650
that he won't approach you during the entire process

415
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,240
until you say you forgive him.

416
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,890
I don't care about your relationship,

417
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,280
but judging from his behavior,

418
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,360
it's because he trusts your professional skills.

419
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,320
That does sound nice to hear.

420
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
But...

421
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,940
But my trust in Qin Gang

422
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
is absolutely zero now.

423
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,520
You still owe me a favor.

424
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,240
Fine, okay.

425
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,690
I'll take this project.

426
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,200
But I need to make something clear first.

427
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,320
I'm taking this project

428
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,450
for you and for the company's benefit,

429
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,920
absolutely not because of him.

430
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,280
Your reasons are your business.

431
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,720
I only care about results.

432
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,000
Time is tight. Submit the project proposal within three days.

433
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,960
That won't be a problem.

434
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,040
For these final items we confirmed,

435
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,800
you must call them today to verify,

436
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,880
okay?

437
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,160
Don't confirm with the supervisor.

438
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,490
You must speak directly to President Qin.

439
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,160
Okay, we see it.

440
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,280
Good. Move on.

441
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,600
Great. Perfect.

442
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,120
The color I want

443
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,280
is not that bright red stripe.

444
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,280
I'd prefer the color to be a bit darker,

445
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,640
so it looks more elegant and sophisticated.

446
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,560
Also,

447
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,160
Coming! Just a moment.

448
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,880
Where was I?

449
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,320
The color.

450
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,440
About the color, remember

451
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,880
not bright red. It must be dark red.

452
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,680
Mr. Liu, this gift is too expensive.

453
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,080
What exactly do you want me to do?

454
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,360
You need to be straight with me.

455
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,280
I can't accept something for nothing.

456
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,210
Otherwise I'll feel uncomfortable taking this bag.

457
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,880
I heard you recently

458
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,360
took on a car show project.

459
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,940
For Mr. Qin's dealership.

460
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,880
Wan Xinxin is the project manager,

461
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,740
and you're her assistant, right?

462
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,860
Nothing escapes your notice.

463
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,000
Just tell me what you need me to do.

464
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,520
I want the car show to fail.

465
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,920
Make Wan Xinxin mess things up.

466
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,320
Make Qin Gang hate her.

467
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,000
This...

468
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,240
I can't do this.

469
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,400
I'm afraid of karma.

470
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,240
This bag, you should...

471
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,640
What karma?

472
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
If Shi Lu finds out, she'll fire you.

473
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,570
Then you can come work for our company.

474
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,160
Our company is much better than Ledi.

475
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,200
I know that.

476
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,080
But hurting Wan Xinxin like this

477
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,400
doesn't seem fair.

478
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,260
That's because you lack motivation.

479
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,720
Keep this bag for now.

480
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,040
I also have a card here.

481
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,800
It has 300,000 in it.

482
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,720
After the job is done,

483
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,890
I'll transfer another 300,000 to you.

484
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,600
With these terms,

485
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,420
you'll definitely help me get this done, right?

486
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,080
Remember what I want:

487
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,080
Make the car show fail. Make Wan Xinxin mess up.

488
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,080
Make Qin Gang hate Wan Xinxin.

489
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,800
Come in.

490
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,480
Hello, Mr. Qin.

491
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,160
What? Do you also want to

492
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,840
improve your artistic cultivation like me?

493
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,480
Artistic cultivation and personal cultivation are two different things.

494
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,210
Classical music is nice, but it doesn't suit you.

495
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
I'd like to discuss something with you.

496
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,770
Please sit down.

497
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,760
Thank you.

498
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,840
What? Got money and want to buy a car now?

499
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,120
Just tell me which model you like,

500
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,920
and I'll give you a big discount.

501
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,320
I don't have much money, but it's always enough.

502
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,420
I have no plans for a car recently.

503
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,360
I came here to

504
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,580
discuss the matter of meals with you.

505
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,440
Look at that. Even eating has become a problem.

506
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
And you still stubbornly claim you have money.

507
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,600
It's not about my meals.

508
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,530
It's about your employees' meals.

509
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,560
Our company

510
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,760
has never delayed paying employees' wages.

511
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,560
They have no problem with meals.

512
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,320
I've checked the surroundings of your company.

513
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,580
It's not in a busy area,

514
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,000
and there isn't even a decent restaurant nearby.

515
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
How do you all eat?

516
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,800
We order boxed meals.

517
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,840
Boxed meals?

518
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,560
Not only are boxed meals not nutritious,

519
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,960
you don't even know if they use healthy oil.

520
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,840
If you keep eating like this long-term,

521
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,120
there's no nutrition at all.

522
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,800
When employees aren't healthy, their efficiency drops.

523
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,400
You should order nutritious lunches for them.

524
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,800
Order from whom?

525
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,040
Me.

526
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,560
Not necessary.

527
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Mr. Qin, speaking as a businessman to a businessman,

528
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,880
hear me out before you decide.

529
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,960
Look, when I was planning to go abroad,

530
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,920
I was afraid I wouldn't find a job.

531
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,120
So I got

532
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,600
a level-two chef's license.

533
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,680
I can also get a health certificate.

534
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,400
Most importantly,

535
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,280
I can buy healthy ingredients.

536
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,040
I've counted,

537
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,240
I can manage cooking for over 30 people.

538
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,970
By the way, how much is each boxed meal?

539
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,920
10 yuan.

540
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
How much?

541
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,080
10 yuan.

542
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,640
What era are we in? You're still getting 10-yuan boxed meals?

543
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,240
Fine, I'll do it.

544
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,000
I'll do it for 10 yuan too.

545
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,360
Look, when employees eat well,

546
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,200
their motivation improves and efficiency increases.

547
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,360
In the long run, they'll be grateful to you, not me.

548
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,620
Isn't that a good deal?

549
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,320
I'm saying, with all this effort,

550
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,040
you actually just want to cook for Wan Xinxin, right?

551
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,880
Yes.

552
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,520
If I deliver food to her alone,

553
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,180
she won't eat if others don't.

554
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,480
This way, she can take a break when everyone eats together.

555
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,610
You really are going to great lengths.

556
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,880
Why do you like

557
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,880
going after my leftovers?

558
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,520
The boxed meals I make

559
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,160
have four dishes and one soup: two vegetable dishes, one egg dish, and one meat dish.

560
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,560
For the meat dish, I like

561
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,580
twice-cooked pork. A specialty.

562
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm saying, a smart person like you,

563
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,840
surely you have more than just this purpose?

564
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,800
What purpose do you think I have?

565
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
You want to keep an eye on us two.

566
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,540
You're afraid I'll take her away.

567
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,160
Afraid.

568
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,570
But also not afraid.

569
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,720
Can we drop this subject?

570
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,650
If that's okay, I'll start delivering four dishes and a soup tomorrow.

571
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,800
You're welcome anytime.

572
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
See you tomorrow.

573
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,120
Oh, Mr. Qin.

574
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,170
Classical music really doesn't suit you.

575
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,850
Too much of it will make you anxious. Trust me.

576
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
Is someone coordinating all these details?

577
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,440
Yes, yes.

578
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,200
About the flowers, I want them

579
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,000
to be delivered to the store

580
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,040
within 5 hours.

581
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,360
And remind them to spray some water

582
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,130
to keep them looking fresh.

583
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,040
Also, about the models,

584
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,280
make sure they arrive

585
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,680
3 hours before the event.

586
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
You need to stay on top of this.

587
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,080
Okay.

588
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,800
Don't let them

589
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,280
be nowhere to be found at the last minute.

590
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,140
I've seen this happen many times.

591
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,480
The front ones go here

592
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,140
and the back ones are blocked.

593
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,360
Just put it here.

594
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,880
Come on, everyone,

595
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
dinner's ready!

596
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Xinxin, come eat.

597
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,280
Dinner time!

598
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,530
Xinxin! Wan Xinxin!

599
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
Uncle, I'm still busy.

600
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,800
You can be busy after eating.

601
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,040
People need to eat.

602
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,160
Remember you're still recovering.

603
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,760
I'll make sure you take your medicine in 30 minutes.

604
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,400
Here.

605
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,240
Come on.

606
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,520
Wow, so fancy. Special treatment?

607
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,360
No special treatment.

608
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,420
Same food for everyone, just in different containers.

609
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,120
How unromantic.

610
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,320
Xinxin, I reported to President Qin.

611
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,360
He wasn't satisfied and said I didn't explain clearly.

612
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,440
He even scolded me.

613
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,320
No, isn't it clearly written in this PPT?

614
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,080
Then go tell him yourself.

615
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,040
No, no, no.

616
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,720
Finish your meal first.

617
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,000
No need. Don't worry about me.

618
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,730
I'll go now and come right back.

619
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,889
Miss, doesn't your President Qin eat?

620
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,000
Xinxin, come in.

621
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,639
No, Mr. Qin.

622
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,400
Do you think there's any problem with this PPT?

623
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,219
Come, sit down. We can talk while eating.

624
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,040
But didn't we already discuss this before?

625
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,659
Sit down. Let's talk while we eat.

626
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,920
Mr. Qin, you...

627
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,000
Rice.

628
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,480
Chopsticks.

629
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,239
Look, we previously...

630
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,440
Didn't we already confirm the plan?

631
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,239
And you had already approved it.

632
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,960
That's when I started working on it, right?

633
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,400
Now you're saying there's a problem again.

634
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,159
Here, try this.

635
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,719
It's their signature dish. Really delicious.

636
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,719
Seriously.

637
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,320
Just take a bite.

638
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
Take one bite and then I'll show you.

639
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,900
Please just look at it now.

640
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,760
Xinxin is back.

641
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
She's back.

642
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,880
Here, try some of the fruit I cut.

643
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,480
I can't eat anything.

644
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,220
Did Qin Gang bully you?

645
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,200
How dare he bully me?

646
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,120
That designer...

647
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,280
Really, he doesn't listen to anything I say

648
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,680
and even talks back to me.

649
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,420
I was making proposals before he even showed up.

650
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,890
You're talking like you're so old.

651
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,560
I may not be old, but I have deep experience.

652
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,720
Really, about this 4S dealership project,

653
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,600
nobody is professional, nobody understands,

654
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,060
they don't understand anything I tell them.

655
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,120
I told you,

656
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,240
Qin Gang definitely had ulterior motives asking you to join.

657
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,000
What does this have to do with Qin Gang?

658
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,400
Then who does it involve?

659
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,520
I'm angry at my brother-in-law.

660
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,600
He's really an idiot.

661
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,320
In your eyes, is everyone an idiot?

662
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,780
No. Look at today at lunch,

663
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,640
when discussing the proposal with Qin Gang,

664
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,000
everyone understood.

665
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,680
Everyone present, everyone,

666
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,480
except my brother-in-law,

667
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,680
who didn't understand.

668
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,480
How can he work with me?

669
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,800
What can I say? He's my brother-in-law.

670
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,080
Yes, I saw.

671
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,000
You and Qin Gang were chatting at lunch,

672
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,640
looking quite happy and getting along well.

673
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,760
Yes, it was nice.

674
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,360
Strange person,

675
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,000
closing the blinds while talking at noon.

676
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,080
Why do I hear a hint of jealousy?

677
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,920
Really?

678
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,560
Yes, strong jealousy.

679
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,880
Is that so?

680
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,360
Fine, yes.

681
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,810
What did you talk about?

682
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,080
Well, we closed the blinds to discuss

683
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,760
something rather confidential.

684
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,760
What was it?

685
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,840
We were just saying...

686
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,840
Say it.

687
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,050
Actually, it was just talk.

688
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,280
Tell me quickly.

689
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,120
I just said the sun was too bright

690
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,650
and pulled down the blinds.

691
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,480
Just that?

692
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,160
See, I knew you'd say something like this.

693
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,400
Come on,

694
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,080
you knew beforehand?

695
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,480
You really knew?

696
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,600
Wan Xinxin.

697
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,360
Since we came back from camping last time,

698
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,840
I've been wanting to tell you...

699
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,080
Let me answer this first.

700
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,840
Hello?

701
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,720
Do you know how pigs die?

702
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,120
Brother, I'm really speechless.

703
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,800
Look, the auto show starts in two days

704
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,010
and you haven't even made the posters.

705
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,560
Don't explain to me.

706
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Stop explaining. Is that an excuse?

707
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Fine, say no more.

708
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,480
I'll make a design for you to see,

709
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,160
okay?

710
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,850
I'm really speechless.

711
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Wait, what were you going to tell me?

712
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,440
I just wanted to tell you that now

713
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,840
I'm just delivering lunch boxes to your company.

714
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,360
You don't look down on my job?

715
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,560
I'm going to cook now.

716
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,450
It'll be ready soon.

717
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,800
Mr. Qin, these are the colors I've selected.

718
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,560
These darker colors are elegant and formal.

719
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,080
And these lighter colors are sporty and casual.

720
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,000
Since our auto show is in summer,

721
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,960
I think the lighter colors would be more suitable.

722
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,120
What do you think?

723
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,760
They're all good.

724
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,560
Just do as you suggested.

725
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,800
No, no.

726
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,180
This is just my personal opinion.

727
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,360
You can have different opinions too.

728
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,220
I still have time to make changes.

729
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,480
I think they all look great.

730
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,820
I was wondering why you weren't answering my calls.

731
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,720
I'm busy.

732
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,080
Right, busy catching up with Wan Xinxin.

733
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,520
We're working.

734
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,280
Besides, what's it to you?

735
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,440
Why are you being so cruel to me?

736
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
I came back for you

737
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,460
because I wanted us to start over.

738
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,000
I thought you two were already divorced.

739
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,200
This time you would be completely mine.

740
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,640
But why are you treating me like this?

741
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,880
Why did you leave me?

742
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,280
Are you punishing me

743
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,040
for leaving you for America seven years ago?

744
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,560
We've both changed.

745
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,480
I've been reflecting a lot lately.

746
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,940
Divorce was the biggest mistake I ever made.

747
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,380
Mr. Qin, if there's nothing else, I'll be going now.

748
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,800
There's nothing to hide.

749
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,480
Liu Wei, we broke up seven years ago.

750
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,160
You shouldn't have come back looking for me.

751
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,080
Let the past remain in the past.

752
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,840
Now I realize my mistake.

753
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,450
We need to look forward.

754
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,260
The more we look back, the more mistakes we make.

755
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,360
Besides, Xinxin and I already have our baby.

756
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
That's a fact that cannot be changed.

757
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,960
No one can tear us apart.

758
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,160
I will do whatever it takes

759
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,760
to rebuild our complete family.

760
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,880
Give me another chance.

761
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,410
I'll prove I'm better than her.

762
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,840
I'm a thousand times, ten thousand times better than her.

763
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,880
You should go.

764
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,530
I should leave instead.

765
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,980
Please, I'm begging you. Just give me some time.

766
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,580
I don't want anything to do with you anymore.

767
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
If it weren't for last time

768
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,600
when you threatened to kill yourself,

769
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,360
I would never have left Xinxin.

770
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,460
But you met with me many times after that.

771
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,400
You even divorced her for me.

772
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,090
All this proves you love me.

773
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,800
That was your trap.

774
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,520
You set everything up.

775
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,600
I see clearly now.

776
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,880
I know what I want.

777
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,200
Fine.

778
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,300
You're really going to be this cruel.

779
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,440
Yes.

780
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,280
Go back to America.

781
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,740
There's nothing worth staying for here.

782
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,680
Qin Gang.

783
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,920
I misjudged you.

784
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,480
He's gesturing.

785
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,280
Qin Gang, we're divorced.

786
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,200
It's over. Completely over.

787
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,560
I'm not your toy.

788
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,000
You can't just discard me when you want.

789
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,560
And come back for a hug whenever you feel like it.
