1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,079
Xinxin.

3
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,640
I went to the place where I asked you to meet me,

4
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,880
but you never showed up.

5
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,770
Then it seems we went to different places.

6
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,960
Do you know

7
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,040
why I asked you to meet me?

8
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,720
I don't know

9
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,650
and I don't want to know.

10
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,040
Marry me.

11
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,880
No, wait.

12
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,720
You're just playing with me, aren't you?

13
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,560
You agreed to remarry her,

14
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,810
and now you're proposing to me?

15
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,240
Do you think you're the emperor?

16
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,260
I didn't agree to remarry her.

17
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,720
I know Xiaqing and Ruirui's return

18
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,640


19
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,720
I'll handle it properly.

20
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,890
It's not that I don't trust you.

21
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,100
And I'm not trying to be emotional right now.

22
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,620
I've been married before,

23
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,329
so I understand what a proposal means.

24
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I just feel that

25
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,760
proposing at this moment

26
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,360
really isn't the right time.

27
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,180
At least wait until there are no obstacles to our marriage.

28
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,370
I want to wait for Xiaqing and Ruirui's blessing.

29
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,520
I understand.

30
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,400
I don't want you proposing now

31
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
with anxiety in your heart.

32
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,580
I understand everything.

33
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,920
Trust me, I'll handle it well.

34
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,120
Why is it that whenever

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,040
we're about to be happy,

36
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,600
all kinds of obstacles appear?

37
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,480
Why does fate test us

38
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
with so many challenges?

39
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,409
I'm afraid that like Xiaqing said,

40
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
we're just not meant to be together.

41
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
My little Xinxin.

42
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,640
Think about it.

43
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,700
You said there are so many streets

44
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,360
with so many cars on them.

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,440
How did you and your boyfriend

46
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,320
end up in my trunk?

47
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,820
Is that what they call fate without destiny?

48
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,320
So many beaches, so many rocks.

49
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,640
And I happened to find you

50
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,520
drinking beer, dressed as a mermaid

51
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,320
with your boyfriend.

52
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,080
Is that what they call fate without destiny?

53
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,800
I don't care who you were hiding from when you moved into Xu Ke's place,

54
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
but Xu Ke lives right next door to me.

55
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,580
Is that fate without destiny?

56
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,480
Trust me, there's no such thing as fate.

57
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,880
Fate is the result of two people's efforts.

58
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,240
But I'm afraid that one day we'll get tired,

59
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,280
exhausted,

60
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
and no longer want to try.

61
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
Then we'll really break up.

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,480
I know why you're proposing to me now.

63
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,200
It's because you want to tie me down

64
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
and prevent me from going to France.

65
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
But as long as you deal with those

66
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,320
old and young demons in your family,

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,780
I won't leave even if you try to drive me away.

68
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
I would never drive you away.

69
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,840
I'll keep this for you for now.

70
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,080
I can't wear it now.

71
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
The diamond is quite big.

72
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,480
Do you know what fate is?

73
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,640
Fate is the lipstick transfer technique.

74
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,810
On your lips.

75
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,300
Here, take it back.

76
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,180
I don't want it.

77
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,600
Take it back.

78
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
You're so ugly.

79
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,920
No. I can't let them get married.

80
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,530
Why don't you just tell Huaming directly?

81
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,840
I can't tell Huaming.

82
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,240
He's finally managed to forget about it.

83
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,100
I don't want him to get hurt again.

84
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,600
Don't worry. I won't say anything either.

85
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,840
But I still think

86
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
the truth will come out eventually.

87
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,240
That's why I need to find a way to remarry him as soon as possible.

88
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,500
Only then can we keep this matter hidden.

89
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,440
I know.

90
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,800
Everything you're doing is for Huaming's sake.

91
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Being alone in America

92
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,010
and working hard hasn't been easy for you.

93
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,320
Look, you and Huaming have Ruirui.

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
If you and Huaming remarry,

95
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,160
the three of you as a family would be the best option.

96
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,120
Come on, Dad!

97
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,840
Ruirui, stop fooling around.

98
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,520
Hurry up.

99
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,559
Mom!

100
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,440
Dad, you promised me

101
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,440
that you would recreate the scene

102
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,039
when you proposed to Mom.

103
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,400
Back then, I just

104
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,240
gave your mom flowers and said 'marry me'

105
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,370
and she agreed when I gave her the ring.

106
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,160
That's not how your father did it.

107
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,420
He got down on one knee.

108
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,280
I knew it, Dad!

109
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,360
So, do you love me?

110
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,000
I do.

111
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,720
If you love me, then recreate

112
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
the scene when you knelt down.

113
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,960
Please, I'm begging you.

114
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,320
So, are you going to record this?

115
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
Yes, I am.

116
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,320
Wait.

117
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,680
Ready.

118
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,200
One, two, three, go!

119
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,120
I love you. Marry me.

120
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,680
I came to see you today

121
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,200
mainly to ask you to be sensible

122
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,340
and let Huaming go.

123
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,920
That's exactly what I wanted to say to you too, Xia.

124
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,360
Wan Xinxin, I know you like Huaming,

125
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,640
but can you do laundry, cook, and take care of him?

126
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,760
When his stomach is upset,

127
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,480
do you know what to feed him?

128
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,920
Also, do you know

129
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
what brands of clothes he likes to wear?

130
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,560
You can't do any of these things.

131
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,160
Most importantly,

132
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,720
he won't be happy with you.

133
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,320
I haven't done those things you mentioned,

134
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,720
but he doesn't need me to.

135
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,920
If one day he needs it,

136
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,840
let me tell you,

137
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,000
I can change for him and do it for him.

138
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,600
My greatest strength as Wan Xinxin

139
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,000
is my strong learning ability,

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,480
intelligence and quick comprehension.

141
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,980
Are these things even challenges for me?

142
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
The key is whether he needs it or not.

143
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,120
Also, do you think that just because

144
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,360
you two had a failed relationship before,

145
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,160
he and I can't be happy together?

146
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,410
That's ridiculous.

147
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,120
Yes, what happened between Huaming and me is in the past.

148
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,960
We're both different people now.

149
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,600
Besides, we have Ruirui.

150
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,120
Ruirui can't be without her father,

151
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
and Huaming can't be without his precious daughter.

152
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,280
So the three of us together

153
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,680
is the most suitable arrangement.

154
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,200
Are you putting on a variety show?

155
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,680
Changing your story just like that.

156
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,560
One second you're telling me

157
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,880
that Huaming and I are a good match,

158
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,720
and the next second you're saying

159
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,600
we can't be happy together.

160
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,000
What exactly do you mean?

161
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,680
But there's no point discussing this anymore.

162
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Huaming has already proposed to me.

163
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,020
I've already said yes.

164
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,040
So the two of us

165
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,970
will be happily together for life.

166
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,920
Was Huaming wearing a suit,

167
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,080
holding a bouquet of flowers tenderly,

168
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
kneeling on one knee and saying to you,

169
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,160
'Marry me'? Is that how it happened?

170
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,060
You guessed it all correctly.

171
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,210
What do you mean?

172
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,960
Wait, you drugged him?

173
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
What's going on here?

174
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,760
It doesn't matter what drug he took.

175
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,720
What matters is

176
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,920
he proposed to me too.

177
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,840
No, to be precise, we're getting remarried.

178
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,680
Don't think you can fool me with this video.

179
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,570
Huaming already told me

180
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,900
he wants to spend his life with me.

181
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,880
Men are just like children.

182
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,480
When they feel lonely,

183
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,960
they might chat with just anyone.

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,040
Don't take what he said too seriously.

185
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,440
By the way, let me tell you something.

186
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
We're going back to America in a few days.

187
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,240
So I suggest you be a sensible woman

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,860
and know when to let go.

189
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Stop right there.

190
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
I don't know why you've come back

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,360
or what you're really after.

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,690
I won't let you succeed with your schemes.

193
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,000
You are my little apple.

194
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,320
I can never love you too much.

195
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,560
Your rosy little face warms my heart.

196
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,560
You light up the fire of my life.

197
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,880
Turn it off.

198
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,160
Xu Ke.

199
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,680
Why are all the men I meet so unreliable?

200
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,880
Not reliable at all.

201
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,720
Qin Gang cheated on me.

202
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,000
Hua Ming.

203
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,640
Hua Ming has an ex-wife and a daughter.

204
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,000
After they came back,

205
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,200
I became nothing to him.

206
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,760
Really nothing at all.

207
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,440
Look at this.

208
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,600
Look.

209
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,280
See?

210
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,320
What is this?

211
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,160
Happy breakup, wishing you happiness.

212
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,960
You can find someone better.

213
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,200
Happy breakup, wishing you joy.

214
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,080
You'll find someone better.

215
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,600
Huaming, how are you?

216
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,120
I have some good news to tell you.

217
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,320
A few days ago,

218
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,120
an old classmate of mine who works in capital operations contacted me.

219
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,920
He wants to invest in a hospital.

220
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,120
After giving it some thought,

221
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,040
I believe you're the best candidate.

222
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,200
This is like manna from heaven!

223
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,060
And it's falling right on my head.

224
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,880
This is no coincidence.

225
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,360
I believe you can turn this opportunity into success.

226
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,200
I've already sent

227
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,720
the detailed information to your email.

228
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,250
Please review it and get back to me soon, okay?

229
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,400
Hello?

230
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,560
Hi.

231
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,640
Who are you?

232
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,490
I'm the one who's here to bring you to justice.

233
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,560
You've got the wrong number.

234
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,280
Wait.

235
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm Wan Xinxin's friend. My name is Xu Ke.

236
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,480
Are you Hua Ming's ex-wife?

237
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,570
What do you want from me?

238
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,160
Let's find a place to talk.

239
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,100
Okay. I'll send you the address shortly.

240
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,960
See you soon.

241
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,280
Director Chen.

242
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,280
Do you want to make our hospital

243
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,600
one of the top private hospitals in China?

244
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,360
Of course.

245
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,480
Then if we could get a large capital investment now,

246
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,610
wouldn't that help achieve this goal?

247
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,220
Certainly.

248
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,660
Congratulations. Your opportunity has arrived. Take a look.

249
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,560
American Angel Fund.

250
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,560
That's great!

251
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,840
If you think this plan is feasible,

252
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,480
then we'll create a proposal.

253
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,120
We can achieve this goal in the short term

254
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,640
and arrange a site visit.

255
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,160
I know something about this fund.

256
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,780
Good. As soon as possible.

257
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,490
Alright.

258
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,240
Huaming.

259
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,840
You're not going to America with Xiaqing anymore?

260
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,810
I never said I was going to America.

261
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,720
Why don't you remarry Xiaqing?

262
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,120
You're both doctors and have so much in common.

263
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,080
Besides, Ruirui at this stage of growth

264
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,600
also needs your care.

265
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,520
You know me pretty well.

266
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,600
Xiaqing and I went to college together and worked together.

267
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,619
But we've really moved on now.

268
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,720
We're just close now.

269
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
We've made things clear between us.

270
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,599
It's just that Ruirui now,

271
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,599
she's studying in America.

272
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,319
I really should go be with her.

273
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,040
She needs a father by her side.

274
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,280
No, as a friend, do you really think

275
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,540
I should go to America?

276
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,079
Of course that would be good.

277
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,450
Going to America first would also benefit this project.

278
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,560
But now there's also Wan Xinxin.

279
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,360
Because Xinxin says between us,

280
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,160
we lack basic trust and understanding.

281
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,320
I think she's right.

282
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,020
Things will work out when the time comes.

283
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,360
Zhongxin.

284
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
I actually think

285
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,800
Zhongxin.

286
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,480
you might as well

287
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,740
take this opportunity to visit America.

288
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,280
Zhongxin.

289
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,840
Spend some time living with Xiaqing and Ruirui.

290
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,600
During this time, perhaps you

291
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,600
will gain a new perspective

292
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,970
on your relationship with Wan Xinxin.

293
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Don't you think?

294
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,840
Okay, thank you.

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Please take another look at this proposal.

296
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Hello.

297
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,800
Sir,

298
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,520
your attire doesn't meet our club's dress code.

299
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,980
What's wrong with my clothes?

300
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,320
This is the trendiest outfit this year.

301
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,720
Excuse me, he's with me.

302
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Please let him in.

303
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,880
Alright, please come in.

304
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,280
Miss Xia, your drink.

305
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,240
Thank you.

306
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,160
It's getting late.

307
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,680
If you're hungry, let's order some food.

308
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,400
Okay, don't mind if I do.

309
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,170
Hello, what would you like?

310
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,530
Hello sir, what would you like?

311
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,840
I'll have the same as her.

312
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Thank you.

313
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680
What did you want to talk to me about?

314
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,760
Ms. Xia.

315
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,960
You look so elegant and classy,

316
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,880
yet you keep doing such tasteless things.

317
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,720
I don't understand what you're talking about.

318
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,980
Do I have to expose you?

319
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,600
Fine.

320
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,160
You told Wan Xinxin

321
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,180
that Huaming proposed to you.

322
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,640
Do you have any questions?

323
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,880
I have major doubts.

324
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,660
That video alone raises many questions.

325
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,370
What questions?

326
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,940
What did Huaming say when he proposed to you?

327
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,690
Hello sir. Your special drink.

328
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,440
Thank you.

329
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,760
How could you not know what's said in a proposal?

330
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,120
Fine. Let's not talk about that.

331
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,920
Then let me ask you, where's your engagement ring?

332
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,520
If Huaming

333
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,120
really proposed to you,

334
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,440
then the ring he gave you

335
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,840
would be identical to Wan Xinxin's.

336
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,300
Why aren't you wearing it?

337
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,250
I left it at home.

338
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,840
I don't want to wear the same thing as Wan Xinxin.

339
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,970
Is that not allowed?

340
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,360
This single woman

341
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,360
fantasizing like this in broad daylight,

342
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,420
quite impressive.

343
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,640
Mr. Xu,

344
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,840
what exactly are you trying to say?

345
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,570
Huaming never proposed to you.

346
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,360
That video was just an act between you two.

347
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,560
You think I don't know

348
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,360
these kinds of tricks?

349
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,620
You may fool Wan Xinxin, but you can't fool me, understand?

350
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,040
Mom, you're here.

351
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,170
School's over, Ruirui. Come here.

352
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,920
Who is he? A garbage collector?

353
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,120
He is

354
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,200
Wan Xinxin's best friend. His name is Xu Ke.

355
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,240
I heard there's no such thing as platonic friendship between men and women.

356
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,370
You like Sister Xinxin too, don't you?

357
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,440
Oh my!

358
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,760
Kids these days are so straightforward.

359
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,240
Look, I need to talk to your mom.

360
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,040
Don't interrupt us.

361
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,900
Just stand aside and watch, okay?

362
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,400
Who says this doesn't concern me?

363
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,130
Mom's business is my business.

364
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,160
I just came from Huaming.

365
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,560
He told me

366
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,120
he never proposed to you.

367
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,000
So what?

368
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,800
He's already agreed

369
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,960
to go back to America with us and remarry me.

370
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,320
That's right. Dad belongs to us.

371
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,360
Don't even think about taking him away.

372
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,000
Fine. You two can say whatever you want.

373
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,920
Anyway, now

374
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,520
you're admitting this video is fake,

375
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,040
right?

376
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,720
Then I'll clarify this with Wan Xinxin.

377
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,080
When the time comes, who gets Huaming

378
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,760
is still uncertain.

379
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,620
Why don't you two compete fairly?

380
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,820
Then we'll see how it goes.

381
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,140
Ruirui, let's go home.

382
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,760
Mr. Xu, it tastes better with this added.

383
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,880
Thank you, kid.

384
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,080
Ruirui, let's go.

385
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,680
Goodbye.

386
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,880
Wait a minute.

387
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,000
Hold on, you two haven't paid yet.

388
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,080
Call them back.

389
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,840
Sir, the food plus service charge and private room fee

390
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,680
comes to a total of 998 yuan.

391
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,040
How much?

392
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,000
998.

393
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,720
998?

394
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,970
For these two lousy dishes?

395
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,480
Oh my god!

396
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,740
Our proposal video has been exposed.

397
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,040
Looks like we need to find a way

398
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,960
to get your father to leave here as soon as possible

399
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,760
and come back to America with us.

400
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,200
Mom, what should we do?

401
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,730
Please think of something.

402
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,440
I do have an idea.

403
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,880
What is it?

404
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
Let's dance.

405
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,440
Dad.

406
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,340
I've been happy these days since I came back. How about you?

407
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,040
I'm very happy too.

408
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,040
Dad,

409
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,600
why are you listening to such a sad song?

410
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,880
Do you understand what this song means?

411
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,760
Dad, I know.

412
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
Mom and I coming back

413
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,650
caused you and Sister Xinxin to fight.

414
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,720
But Mom and I both hope

415
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,560
that you can live happily.

416
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,400
I know.

417
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,160
I also want Ruirui to be happy.

418
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,600
Dad, you know what?

419
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,320
My classmates always ask

420
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,800
why my dad doesn't live with my mom.

421
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,440
I tell them my dad

422
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,960
is the bravest and coolest dad,

423
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,480
like Batman.

424
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,480
Really, China needs him,

425
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,040
he can't just leave.

426
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,760
All the other kids have lots of photos with their dads.

427
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,600
But I want to take many photos with you too.

428
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,360
I know you love me the most.

429
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,280
Dad, I know

430
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,800
you've always liked Sister Xinxin.

431
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,720
If I ask you to come with us to America,

432
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,100
you won't be happy either.

433
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,600
But I know,

434
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,920
Dad, you will always love me.

435
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,720
It's okay. When I grow up and make money,

436
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,640
I hope we

437
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,840
can come back to see you every week

438
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
and take lots of photos with you.

439
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,610
I'll send them to my classmates

440
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,400
so they can see

441
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
how much my dad likes me

442
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,200
and loves me.

443
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,440
Dad, do you know

444
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,840
my classmates ask me

445
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,520
why my dad isn't with my mom?

446
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,880
All the other kids have lots of photos with their dads.

447
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,680
But I want to take many photos with you too.

448
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,120
I know you love me the most.

449
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,120
What's this? Are you really leaving?

450
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,120
Yes.

451
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,210
Yes? What do you mean 'yes'?

452
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,060
The battle hasn't even begun and you're already giving up.

453
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,180
Have some backbone, will you?

454
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,400
Where's that fierce attitude

455
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
you had when you lectured me before?

456
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,360
Think about it.

457
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,580
One is older than you, one is younger.

458
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,660
What are you afraid of?

459
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,200
What are you running from? What are you scared of?

460
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,080
I'm not afraid.

461
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,240
I've really decided to go to France.

462
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,370
Don't try to stop me.

463
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,760
They're not scary.

464
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,000
But whenever they

465
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,560
appear in my life

466
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,560
everything becomes a mess

467
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,960
that I can't sort out.

468
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,480
I give up.

469
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,040
No way. I don't agree. Stop packing.

470
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,360
I even met with that Xia Qing for your sake.

471
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,720
Don't you want to know what happened?

472
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
The results don't matter anymore.

473
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,800
Alright, stop packing.

474
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,040
Stop packing, will you?

475
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,680
What are you doing, Xu Ke?

476
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,130
What do you mean? Look at yourself.

477
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,320
You're a mess.

478
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,240
Are you still the Wan Xinxin I know?

479
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,920
Just because of those two people

480
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,480
you're willingly giving up your own happiness.

481
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,810
Aren't you afraid you'll regret it later?

482
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,840
Happiness?

483
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,360
I feel like I'm the most

484
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,760
unfortunate person in the world right now.

485
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,960
Fine. Let me ask you one last question.

486
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,940
Do you still love Hua Ming?

487
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
The answer doesn't matter anymore.

488
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,120
He's getting back together with his ex-wife.

489
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,720
Then let me tell you.

490
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,640
What if I told you

491
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,960
that video was fake?

492
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,200
What if I've already proven

493
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,080
that Hua Ming was practicing proposing with his ex-wife

494
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,560
so he could propose to you?

495
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,080
I don't understand what nonsense you're talking about.

496
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,920
And I don't want to hear it.

497
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,180
Hua Ming and I can't go back to how we were.

498
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,280
Fine.

499
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,480
I'll say no more.

500
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,480
Anyway, I've already found the mother and daughter.

501
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,680
They'll surely have a plan in the future.

502
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,280
Whether Hua Ming stays or not

503
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,490
depends on what you do next.

504
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,530
I'm leaving.

505
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,560
Why are you causing trouble for me?

506
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
Think about it carefully yourself.

507
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,760
Ruirui, dinner's almost ready.

508
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,440
Dad, come quickly!

509
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,360
Mom's heart condition is acting up and she has a fever too.

510
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,480
Hurry up!

511
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,290
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

512
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,660
It's nothing serious.

513
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,120
Just a headache.

514
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,520
Um, look, Ruirui.

515
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,200
Mom says she's fine. She'll feel better soon.

516
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Why don't you take her temperature?

517
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,600
Mom doesn't have a fever.

518
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,520
Check it properly!

519
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,820
Mom's temperature is normal.

520
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,000
Dad, you're a doctor.

521
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
You should know

522
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,840
what the most accurate way to take temperature is.

523
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,920
Isn't it using your lips to check?

524
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,520
When I had a fever as a child,

525
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,520
that's how you always checked mine.

526
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,280
Hmm, Mom does have a slight fever.

527
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,200


528
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,160
Dad.

529
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,520
Do you know where the most comfortable place is?

530
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
What place?

531
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,680
Dad's shoulder.

532
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Mom, lean on Dad's shoulder now.

533
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,200
Hurry up. It'll be over soon.

534
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,520
Dad, you know what?

535
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,400
Mom and I often get sick in America.

536
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,530
Let's all three of us go back to America together.

537
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,400
The two of us can take care of Mom. Wouldn't that be nice?

538
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,040
Ruirui...

539
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,800
Dad, you don't need to say anything.

540
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,800
I'll give you time to think about it.

541
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,240
Ruirui.

542
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,920
Dad promises you

543
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,480
to go back to America with you for school.

544
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
Really, Dad?

545
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,320
Great! I'll book the tickets right now.

546
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,200
My daughter has really grown up.

547
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,730
Thank you for playing along with us today.

548
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,440
Ruirui really hopes you can go with her.

549
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,640
I understand.

550
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,160
When did you decide to come with us to America?

551
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,960
Dr. Chen talked to me.

552
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,800
He said I should go to America with you.

553
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,200
Also,

554
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,600
Ruirui asked me for a dance that day,

555
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,500
and she told me something.

556
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,330
I've made up my mind.

557
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,000
I should go to America with my daughter.

558
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,640
What did she tell you?

559
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,200
You can't imagine.

560
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,260
I couldn't imagine it either.

561
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,520
Ruirui said she knows

562
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,360
I listen to such sad songs

563
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,560
because I like Wan Xinxin.

564
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,880
She said she wants to see me living happily.

565
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,000
She also said she really wants me to go to America,

566
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,520
because other children

567
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,920
all have their families of three together.

568
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,000
She said, 'It's okay, Dad.'

569
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,280
When I grow up and make money,

570
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,040
I'll fly back to see you every week.'

571
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,920
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,080
Anyway, I still want to thank you.

573
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,280
Thank you for making this decision. Really.

574
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,000
I've finished packing mine too.

575
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,929
All his things are in there.

576
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,199
Are you really not going to talk to Huaming to clear things up?

577
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,080
I'm boarding in just a few hours.

578
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,600
What's the point of talking to him now?

579
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,199
Does it even matter anymore?

580
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,239
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

581
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,840
Xuke told me

582
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,159
that Huaming's

583
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,800
proposal video to Xiaqing was fake.

584
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,800
He kept asking me to talk to you,

585
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,530
begging you not to make a decision you'll regret.

586
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,440
If he had decided not to remarry and not go to America,

587
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,500
he would have come to find me already.

588
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,480
I know you really like Wan Xinxin.

589
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,220
She likes you a lot too.

590
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,880
But Huaming, you need to understand.

591
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,560
Marriage

592
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,960
isn't maintained by love alone.

593
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,160
It needs time and experience to polish it.

594
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,480
I really wish we could go back to the past.

595
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,120
Living that carefree life.

596
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,890
Xiaqing.

597
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,820
All the memories from the past

598
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,720
will stay right here.

599
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,760
Right here.

600
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,040
But the past is the past.

601
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,600
We can't go back.

602
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
You know what?

603
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,530
Ruirui has grown up and I feel I've gotten old.

604
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,650
I've become a middle-aged man.

605
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,000
During these three years since you left,

606
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I've been living in this apartment.

607
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,880
Sometimes I just sit in this spot,

608
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,210
right here where I am now, looking out the window, thinking.

609
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,420
My life had already lost its passion,

610
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,120
becoming mundane with nothing

611
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,320
and no one able to enter my heart.

612
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,900
Except for Ruirui.

613
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,460
But then Wan Xinxin and Bao appeared.

614
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,840
She really entered my heart.

615
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,360
That passion and youthful feeling I hadn't felt for so long

616
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,160
came back. Really.

617
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,160
I really like Wan Xinxin.

618
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,210
Huaming, I understand.

619
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,080
I know. Three years ago when I took Ruirui back to America,

620
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,160
I caused you significant pain.

621
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,760
It was because I was selfish.

622
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,920
But you know,

623
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,720
I just wanted to give Ruirui a

624
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,400
better living environment.

625
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,040
I just hoped

626
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,760
my career would develop better.

627
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,960
Can you understand what I mean?

628
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,480
I can understand what you mean.

629
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,760
But Xiaqing, I want you to know that

630
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,920
you, me, and Ruirui will always be a family.

631
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,180
Really.

632
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,920
Ruirui is our joint creation.

633
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,080
We're proud of her.

634
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,210
But we can never go back to the past.

635
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,080
He hasn't

636
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,690
contacted me at all lately.

637
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,240
It surely means he's made up his mind.

638
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,280
Well,

639
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,480
are you sure there's no feeling left between you two?

640
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,800
Look at the ring you're wearing.

641
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,280
It's still the one he gave you

642
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,360
when he proposed.

643
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,480
It's such a big diamond, I might as well wear it.

644
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,000
If things don't work out for me in France someday,

645
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,160
I can always pawn it for money.

646
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,440
No, sis.

647
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,380
I have some clothes I can't wear anymore.

648
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,680
See if they fit you.

649
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,000
How could I possibly fit into your clothes?

650
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,880
Come here, baby boy.

651
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,240
By the time you come back next time,

652
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,100
baby boy will already be walking.

653
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,200
Right?

654
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,680
Mommy will be back in a year.

655
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,820
Don't pull auntie's hair.

656
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,120
Come on, say goodbye to mommy.

657
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,760
Mommy will be back in a year.

658
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,960
Sad.

659
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
After a year, I'll come back for you.

660
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,440
You'll miss mommy.

661
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,640
Come.

662
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,640
Well, since you've made up your mind,

663
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,970
I won't try to change it.

664
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,690
Let me take you there later.

665
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:36,880
No need.

666
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,440
Yesterday Xu Ke said he wanted to see me off, but I refused.

667
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,960
I'm about to live on my own,

668
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,520
so I need to learn to be independent now.

669
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,640
Where's baby boy's favorite toy?

670
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,400
That toy?

671
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,600
Is it in the bag?

672
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,730
Or did you leave it at Huaming's place?

673
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,720
It really is at his place.

674
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,400
Then go get it quickly.

675
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,240
No, sis. Could you go get it for me later?

676
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,160
I won't go. You go yourself.

677
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,760
Didn't someone just say

678
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,960
they needed to learn to be independent?

679
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,960
Face your own issues yourself, right?

680
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,640
Playing the grand piano in America.

681
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,360
It's been so long since I felt this way.

682
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,820
Our family of three can finally be together.

683
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:00,920
Look.

684
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,890
How happy Ruirui is.

685
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,960
You came back for something?

686
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,680
Um,

687
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,720
that bell that baby boy always likes.

688
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,170
I wanted to get it because I'm afraid he'll

689
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,290
keep crying without it.

690
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,440
Sister Xinxin,

691
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,840
come visit us in America when you have time.

692
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,780
I already prepared it.

693
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,720
I didn't know how to give it to you.

694
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,580
I thought I'd mail it to you later.

695
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,360
When are you leaving?

696
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,640
Um...

697
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,930
The day after tomorrow.

698
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li
