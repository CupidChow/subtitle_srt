1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,570
How to make the final decision?

3
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,520
It's all up to you now.

4
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,240
Please take a rest first.

5
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
I've finished speaking.

6
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,520
Xinxin.

7
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,880
The money in here

8
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,560
is for your rent and opening the gallery.

9
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,500
There might be some extra.

10
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
Consider it as thanks

11
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,120
for taking care of me and Bao.

12
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Xinxin, I want to tell you the truth.

13
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
Don't talk to me about any truth.

14
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,980
The truth means nothing to me now.

15
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,480
I can't face you right now.

16
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,880
Please leave.

17
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,720
Xinxin.

18
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,480
This is the most precious thing between us.

19
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
No matter what happens today,

20
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
you must listen to what I have to say.

21
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,200
I need to tell you the truth about what happened three years ago.

22
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,960
The story of that night three years ago goes like this.

23
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Dr. Hua, which patient should we operate on first?

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
The young man's condition is more serious,

25
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,560
but he's a criminal.

26
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,840
This is a hospital. Do we discriminate based on identity?

27
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,900
I'll do the second surgery after I finish the first one.

28
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,450
After suturing, send the patient to intensive care.

29
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,160
Li,

30
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,360
tell Dr. Chen

31
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
I'll go in right away to perform his surgery.

32
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
Dr. Chen asked me to tell you

33
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,680
that patient Wan Quanyou

34
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,560
shows no vital signs anymore.

35
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
Later,

36
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,040
the young man I saved

37
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,090
was sent back to prison.

38
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,320
Then he escaped again

39
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,920
and killed a guard and another inmate.

40
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,380
He was sentenced to death.

41
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,640
The victims' families

42
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,800
saw me as his accomplice.

43
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,200
Because I saved his life with my scalpel.

44
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,159
Since then, my scalpel

45
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,760
became a murder weapon.

46
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,160
It's like a nightmare

47
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
that follows me everywhere.

48
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,520
But Wan Xinxin, I want to tell you that until now,

49
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I've never regretted it.

50
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,560
I still believe I did nothing wrong.

51
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't regret what happened that day.

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,800
I made the right choice.

53
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,360
Say that again.

54
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,490
I did nothing wrong.

55
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,280
Your choice was to save a bad person

56
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,440
and abandon a good one.

57
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,880
Allowing that criminal to continue hurting others.

58
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,840
Is that right?

59
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,880
Yes,

60
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,120
I wanted to save him,

61
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,880
but I was alone.

62
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,320
I wanted to save both of them.

63
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,440
I told them to make arrangements.

64
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,080
I said I'd come out and immediately save the other person.

65
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,159
But I was alone.

66
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,440
When I came out, being the only doctor there,

67
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,680
your father was already gone.

68
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,800
I didn't know it was your father.

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,680
Stop talking. Just stop.

70
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,960
Wan Xinxin, how can I make it up to you?

71
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,159
What can I do to make amends?

72
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,360
How can I heal your wounded heart?

73
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,520
I'll do anything to make it up to you.

74
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,080
Just tell me.

75
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,280
You already have.

76
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,080
While you were hiding this from me,

77
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,360
you saved me and Bao.

78
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,200
You fed us and gave us shelter,

79
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,920
and helped me grow.

80
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
You've already made amends.

81
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,640
From now on, the two of us

82
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,480
owe each other nothing.

83
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,880
Wan Xinxin.

84
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,080
Believe me, when I found out about this,

85
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
I was on my way

86
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,480
I was on my way

87
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,760
to the civil affairs bureau.

88
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,800
I had just learned about it.

89
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,000
I couldn't face you. I thought

90
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,560
no matter what, I would only hurt you.

91
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,240
I couldn't face you,

92
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,800
so I chose to go to America.

93
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,720
I thought going to America would help me forget you.

94
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,640
But I want to tell you,

95
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,840
every day and night in America,

96
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,880
every moment I was thinking of you.

97
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,480
I can't forget you because I love you.

98
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
I love you, Wan Xinxin.

99
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,560
It's impossible for us now.

100
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,680
Wan Xinxin.

101
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,840
Even if heaven played a joke on me,

102
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,960
I think it was a beautiful joke.

103
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,720
From the moment you and Bao

104
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,880
appeared in my car trunk,

105
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,880
the beauty began.

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Can you give us some time?

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,169
Please give me another chance to love you.

108
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
It's impossible.

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,320
Huaming.

110
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,040
Forget about me.

111
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,880
Forget about me.

112
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,760
It's not that I don't want to love,

113
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,560
even though I've been hurt before.

114
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,800
I can't forget.

115
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,440
Who can predict the arrangements of fate?

116
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,120
It's not that I don't want to love,

117
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,800
love has become vast as the ocean.

118
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:23,000
Perhaps I'm destined to wait a lifetime.

119
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,360
I thought after all the changes in life,

120
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,000
my heart would never race again.

121
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,120
Yet I happened to meet you.

122
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,960
But I no longer believe in love.

123
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,400
It's not that I don't want to love,

124
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,280
even though I've been hurt before.

125
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,080
Who can predict the arrangements of fate?

126
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,520
It's not that I don't want to love,

127
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,360
love has sunk deep into the ocean.

128
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,720
Perhaps I'm destined to wait a lifetime.

129
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,480
Home is still the best place.

130
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,680
If it weren't for Dr. Hua Ming this time,

131
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
I really don't know

132
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,600
if I could have made it back here.

133
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,460
Mom, come sit down for a while.

134
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
If you ask me,

135
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
heaven is looking out for you.

136
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,080
You haven't even reached 100 years old yet,

137
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,540
so heaven doesn't have the heart to take you.

138
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,040
You sure know how to talk.

139
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,800
The doctor has already advised

140
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,080
that you should avoid any emotional stress.

141
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,960
You're right.

142
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
I can't handle any stress right now.

143
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,060
Especially smelling scents I shouldn't smell.

144
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,440
Or seeing people I shouldn't see,

145
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,120
that's what upsets me.

146
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
Mom, what do you mean by that?

147
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
What do I mean?

148
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,250
As soon as I walked in, I smelled it.

149
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,200
Tell me, this perfume scent,

150
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,400
do you wear it or do I?

151
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,080
Son.

152
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,960
While I'm in the hospital,

153
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,480
you bring someone into our home.

154
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,090
Don't say I didn't warn you.

155
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,000
If you keep seeing Liu Wei,

156
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
I will

157
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,760
disown you as my son.

158
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,240
Come in.

159
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,400
Senior,

160
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Huaming.

161
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,760
You came at the right time. Let's have dinner together tonight.

162
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,880
Some friends from out of town are coming.

163
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,410
I'll introduce them to you.

164
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,800
Senior, I'll pass on dinner.

165
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,860
I need to talk to you about something.

166
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
Why so serious?

167
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,880
Go ahead.

168
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
There's a research institute in Shanghai.

169
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,330
They want me to work on a project there.

170
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,400
That's great!

171
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,160
Why are you asking me about this?

172
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,760
Working on a project in Shanghai is a good opportunity.

173
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,490
It won't take that long either.

174
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,840
You're not

175
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,480
planning to leave for good, are you?

176
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,250
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

177
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Once I leave, I won't be coming back.

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,530
Huaming.

179
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,480
You're the face of our hospital.

180
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,920
You can't leave.

181
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,090
Face of the hospital or not,

182
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,540
I haven't contributed much here.

183
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Of course, I must thank you, brother,

184
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,200
for helping me return to practicing medicine.

185
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,160
And also,

186
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,360
Dr. Wei's investment

187
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,000
in our hospital is still valid.

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,330
I'll make all the arrangements before I leave. Don't worry.

189
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,240
So you're leaving after getting things done,

190
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
retiring after achieving success?

191
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,720
It's nothing like that.

192
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,680
It's just that this city

193
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,970
has too many complications. I just...

194
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,530
don't want to stay anymore.

195
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,280
You want to leave this place of heartbreak, right?

196
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,800
If you leave...

197
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,040
Fine.

198
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,920
You'll have more opportunities in Shanghai.

199
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,090
Since you've made up your mind,

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,530
I won't try to keep you here.

201
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,940
Just let me know before you go,

202
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
and I'll see you off.

203
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,850
Alright.

204
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,200
I'll hand over my current work

205
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,890
and leave once that's done.

206
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,160
Does Wan Xinxin know?

207
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,680
No.

208
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,280
You should at least say goodbye to her.

209
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,520
Okay.

210
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,380
Well, brother, I'll head out now.

211
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,400
You're finally here.

212
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,010
Come in quickly.

213
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,740
Have a seat. I'll get you some coffee.

214
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,720
I came to tell you.

215
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,530
My mother just had surgery. She can't handle any stress.

216
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,840
I can't upset her.

217
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,240
If she finds out

218
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,920
that we're still in contact,

219
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,890
I'm afraid she won't be able to take it.

220
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,800
So...

221
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,480
So

222
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
do you want to be with Wan Xinxin?

223
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:37,920
No.

224
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,580
That's just my mother's own idea.

225
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,850
There's no chance between me and Wan Xinxin anymore.

226
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,480
What about us? Do we still have a chance?

227
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,920
You're not trying to break up with me, are you?

228
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,400
That's not what I meant.

229
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,410
Please stop pressuring me.

230
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,480
I can't take it anymore. I'm about to break down.

231
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Qin Gang, I'm not pressuring you.

232
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,840
I just want more time

233
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,240
to be with you.

234
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,320
Alright, let's not talk about this anymore.

235
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,520
I need to get back quickly.

236
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,560
I told my mother

237
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,960
that I was meeting a client at the company.

238
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,020
I have to leave now.

239
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
If I get back late,

240
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,120
I'm afraid she'll get suspicious.

241
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,240
Qin Gang, don't go.

242
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,170
Please stay with me for a while.

243
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,760
Just keep me company.

244
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,280
I really can't right now.

245
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
Then I'll come see you at your office.

246
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,280
There are too many people at the office.

247
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
My mother will definitely find out.

248
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,480
From now on,

249
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,780
we can't contact each other anymore.

250
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,440
Xinxin.

251
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,960
I have to go. Let's meet up.

252
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,280
What are you doing here?

253
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,410
You're not welcome.

254
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,490
I came to see you.

255
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
I don't need that.

256
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,130
I'll just say a few words and leave.

257
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,410
I have nothing to say to you.

258
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,300
Let's talk about Qin Gang.

259
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,960
Wan Renxian.

260
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
Xu Huahua, where are you?

261
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,000
What's wrong? You don't look happy.

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,160
There's something.

263
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,360
I need your advice.

264
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,800
Go ahead.

265
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,210
Huaming says he's leaving.

266
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,160
Leaving?

267
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,800
Where is he going?

268
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,530
I don't know.

269
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,720
He just said he wants to meet with me.

270
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,850
Do you think I should go?

271
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
Well, do you want to see him?

272
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,360
I don't know.

273
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,840
I get it, I understand.

274
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,800
Look, just consider one question:

275
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,680
If you don't meet him,

276
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,880
will you regret it years from now?

277
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,920
If you think you'll regret it,

278
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,560
then go see him.

279
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,400
If you won't regret it, then...

280
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Xu Ke.

281
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,600
Um, Shi Lu is taking a shower inside.

282
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,440
I need to get her bathrobe when she's done.

283
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,280
I can't talk anymore.

284
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
Just think it through carefully.

285
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,040
I totally believe in you.

286
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,720
Kisses! That's it.

287
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
You value romance over friendship.

288
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Go ahead and say what you want to say.

289
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,520
Auntie.

290
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,520
Why won't you let Qin Gang see me?

291
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
Have I done anything wrong to him?

292
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,840
Yes.

293
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,700
You abandoned him many years ago.

294
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,460
That's what you did wrong.

295
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,600
I went to America at that time to study.

296
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,240
Wrong.

297
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
You wanted to get a green card.

298
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,520
I went there to study.

299
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,080
Yes, I did get married.

300
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,840
But at that time,

301
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,200
we were truly in love.

302
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,400
I really wanted to be with him.

303
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,080
Liu Wei.

304
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,960
You were in your twenties, he was in his seventies.

305
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
He could have been your grandfather.

306
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,960
Someone in their twenties.

307
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,560
With someone in their seventies.

308
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,360
Do you believe that's true love?

309
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,200
It was very easy for me to check up on you.

310
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,240
Your ex-husband

311
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,880
appeared to be a wealthy man.

312
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,960
He had some reputation in New York,

313
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,320
but his fortune was already gone.

314
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,290
You didn't know any of this at the time.

315
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
If you had known, you would never have married him.

316
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
You just wanted his fortune,

317
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,640
to get a green card.

318
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,840
That's why you abandoned our Xiao Gang.

319
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,720
But our Xiao Gang loved you.

320
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,680
Do you know that?

321
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,120
You abandoned him, went to America and married someone else.

322
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,450
Do you know what kind of life Xiao Gang had?

323
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,160
He locked himself in his room every day.

324
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,200
Refused to come out, refused to see anyone.

325
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,130
Had no social interactions at all.

326
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,880
I persuaded him for a very long time.

327
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,410
Before he finally came out.

328
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,720
But when he did, he was self-destructive.

329
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,080
Dating all kinds of women recklessly.

330
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,400
All of this was because of you,

331
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
Liu Wei. Do you know that?

332
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,840
I was too young back then.

333
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,200
I didn't understand.

334
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,520
But who hasn't made mistakes

335
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,120
when they were young?

336
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,400
Our Xiao Gang

337
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,640
finally met Wan Xinxin,

338
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,360
a good girl.

339
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,960
He was willing to be with Wan Xinxin,

340
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,760
to get married and live a normal life.

341
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,800
Why did you show up?

342
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,960
Why do you want to destroy his family?

343
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,640
I regret it.

344
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,560
After I went to America, I realized

345
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,200
I couldn't live without Qin Gang.

346
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,660
You're talking nonsense.

347
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,080
It's because your ex-husband died.

348
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,600
You didn't get

349
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,560
a single penny from him.

350
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,520
Liu Wei, you're too calculating.

351
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,000
Whatever you want to do,

352
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,360
whatever goal you want to achieve,

353
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,160
you'll use any means necessary.

354
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,520
Just like now,

355
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,320
you'll put on an act

356
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,580
of being so pitiful in front of everyone.

357
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,400
My son is kind-hearted and can't see through you,

358
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,520
but I'm not.

359
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,080
I can see right through you.

360
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,360
Auntie.

361
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,520
I know you've always misunderstood me.

362
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
But I do love Qin Gang now.

363
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,480
I just want to be with him.

364
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,210
Impossible.

365
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,200
Don't even think about it in this lifetime.

366
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
You will never see that day.

367
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,280
Why do you hate me so much?

368
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,240
Because my son Xiaogang

369
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,920
and Wan Xinxin and their son

370
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,920
should have been able to live

371
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,040
happily together.

372
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,680
But he doesn't love Wan Xinxin at all.

373
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,520
You have no right to talk about Wan Xinxin like that.

374
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,680
He told me himself.

375
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,560
Liu Wei, it's because

376
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
you've bewitched my son

377
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,560
and put him under your spell.

378
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,880
Let me tell you, Liu Wei. From today on,

379
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,840
I'm asking you to stay away from my son.

380
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,080
Stop pursuing him,

381
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,320
or I won't be so polite anymore.

382
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,200
Let me be honest with you.

383
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,050
I don't have much time left.

384
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,480
Sooner or later, it's all the same.

385
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't push me to desperate measures.

386
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,480
Auntie.

387
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,860
Please give me one more chance, will you?

388
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,560
Impossible.

389
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,120
But you'll die soon.

390
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,240
How long can you control things?

391
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,360
Qin Gang has already deceived Wan Xinxin once.

392
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,280
They will never remarry.

393
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I can wait.

394
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,480
I'll wait three months, six months.

395
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,040
I'll give you two years. Is that enough?

396
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,560
Liu Wei, you're despicable!

397
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,480
Auntie, lower your voice.

398
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,060
You can't get upset right now.

399
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,240
Actually, right now

400
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,120
I don't need to do anything.

401
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,320
I just need to quietly

402
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,080
wait here.

403
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,660
I'm waiting for you to die.

404
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,680
Then I'll marry Qin Gang.

405
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,160
I'll live in this big house

406
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,220
spending the money you leave behind.

407
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,440
When that time comes,

408
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,880
I won't let him see your grandson.

409
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I'll turn them against each other.

410
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,820
But what about you?

411
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,360
Where will you be then?

412
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,250
You won't be able to control anything.

413
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,730
When that day comes, I'll tell Qin Gang

414
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,820
that if it weren't for you,

415
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,980
we would have been together long ago.

416
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,040
You're running out of time. How can you possibly fight me?

417
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,720
Liu Wei,

418
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,480
I'll fight you to the end!

419
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,000
Liu Wei... Liu...

420
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,960
Help me!

421
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,960
Is anyone here?

422
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,880
Mr. Qin!

423
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,040
Mr. Qin!

424
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,620
What's wrong with you?

425
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,280
Is anyone here?

426
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Help! Someone!

427
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
Is this emergency services?

428
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,280
Come quickly! Someone has fainted here!

429
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,120
Hello?

430
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,600
Kaiyang, tell Qin Gang to come to the hospital

431
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,440
right away!

432
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,720
Let me get you some water.

433
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,480
No need.

434
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,120
Are you

435
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,540
planning to leave?

436
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,680
Are you going to America?

437
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,700
I haven't decided yet.

438
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,560
I want to change jobs.

439
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,320
Once I leave,

440
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,240
I might not come back.

441
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,920
I... you...

442
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,160
You go first.

443
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,680
Since...

444
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,880
I really feel that now

445
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,720
being 40 and living like this is pretty pointless.

446
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
The reason I

447
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,000
asked you to come here before I leave...

448
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,960
Now you're here and I don't know what to say.

449
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,800
Since you walked in and sat down, I've been

450
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,530
I've been...

451
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,640
I want to

452
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,810
formally apologize to you.

453
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,160
Sis!

454
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,400
Sis!

455
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
Qin Gang, you're finally here.

456
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,780
Where's my mom?

457
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,370
She's inside. They're trying to save her.

458
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,640
Why were you the one who brought her here?

459
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,440
Xinxin couldn't pick up Bao today,

460
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,400
so she asked me to take him to your place.

461
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,840
When I arrived at your house,

462
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,480
I saw the door was open.

463
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,400
As soon as I went in,

464
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,440
I found Ms. Qin collapsed on the floor.

465
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,400
I immediately called emergency services.

466
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,560
You know, Ms. Qin just had surgery.

467
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,240
Why wasn't anyone home with her?

468
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
It's all my fault.

469
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,120
I shouldn't have

470
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,600
left her alone at home.

471
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,000
All alone.

472
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,820
Actually, these days I've

473
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,140
been constantly thinking

474
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,720
about where I was the night my father had the accident.

475
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,040
Why wasn't I by his side?

476
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,340
If I had been with him, maybe it wouldn't have happened.

477
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,960
But I really can't remember.

478
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,640
The only image I can recall now is

479
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,650
after I rushed to the hospital,

480
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,200
I saw him

481
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,680
lying on the bed in the morgue.

482
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,200
There's one image that keeps appearing in my mind:

483
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,640
he was so cold,

484
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,600
eyes closed, no expression on his face.

485
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,680
I felt that wasn't my father.

486
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,240
I felt all of this was fake, not real.

487
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,480
I thought it was just a dream.

488
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,480
Then I started banging my head against the wall desperately,

489
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,610
over and over again.

490
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,920
I wanted to wake up from this dream,

491
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,520
so my father would come back to life and be fine.

492
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,760
Eventually I knocked myself unconscious.

493
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,360
The next day my sister told me

494
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,420
I almost killed myself there.

495
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,120
I'm sorry.

496
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,000
I'm fine.

497
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,640
Huaming, I actually know

498
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
you're a doctor.

499
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,220
Your choice wasn't wrong.

500
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,920
If it were me, I would also save

501
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,180
the patient in more critical condition.

502
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,440
When I'm calm, I tell myself

503
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,880
Huaming is just a doctor.

504
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,560
But whenever I see you,

505
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,600
I remember my father

506
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
lying on that bed in the morgue.

507
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,160
I feel that if you had saved him,

508
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,800
he wouldn't have died.

509
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,160
But why? Why did it have to be you?

510
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,880
I can't forget it.

511
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,440
I really can't.

512
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,560
What's going on? What happened to Liu Wei?

513
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,720
This is serious.

514
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,240
I don't know what to do.

515
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,840
I need to talk to you about it.

516
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,290
I went to Mr. Qin's house today.

517
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,160
I found her lying unconscious on the floor.

518
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,200
Before I went in,

519
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,520
I saw Liu Wei running out.

520
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,800
She drove away in a panic.

521
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,530
She didn't even close the door.

522
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,560
Wait. Liu Wei

523
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,040
has known Qin Gang for so many years.

524
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,770
Why would she go to their house?

525
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,280
Qin Gang told me

526
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,810
his mother has been stable since the surgery.

527
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,090
There was no one else at home today.

528
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,120
If Liu Wei wanted to see Mr. Qin,

529
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,720
why didn't she tell Qin Gang?

530
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,640
Maybe she didn't mention it.

531
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,880
That's normal for their relationship.

532
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,000
Then why did she run away?

533
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,000
Look at you,

534
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,160
being paranoid again.

535
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,880
Maybe she had some emergency.

536
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,320
So she left in a hurry. What's wrong with that?

537
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,600
No, something's definitely wrong.

538
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,560
Enough. Stop making wild guesses.

539
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,880
This matter,

540
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,170
I have things to do if you don't.

541
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,360
You called me all the way here,

542
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
and I have other things to attend to.

543
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,560
Such a big deal,

544
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,250
and you think it's nothing?

545
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,600
If I wasn't worried about affecting your work,

546
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,800
I would have called the police already.

547
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,360
What does this have to do with my job?

548
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,400
Didn't you get your job back

549
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,660
because Liu Wei put in a good word for you?

550
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,680
If this matter really involves Liu Wei,

551
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,340
wouldn't that affect you too?

552
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,680
Should I tell Qin Gang about this or not?

553
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
You're right.

554
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,720
This matter...

555
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,080
This matter cannot be told to anyone.

556
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,720
But I'm really worried.

557
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,440
What if something happens

558
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,080
to Director Qin?

559
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,480
If they start investigating

560
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,640
and find out I've been hiding the truth?

561
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,400
I'd never be able to clear my name.

562
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,480
No, this definitely has nothing to do with you.

563
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,040
But Chunli,

564
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,480
you cannot tell Qin Gang about this.

565
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,280
Especially not Xinxin. Do you understand?

566
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,840
I'm not good at keeping secrets.

567
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,970
You have to keep it in even if it's hard.

568
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,040
You can't say a word about this. Understand?

569
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,840
If you talk, we'll be in trouble.

570
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,120
When you put it that way, I can't stand it.

571
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,320
Are you hiding something from me?

572
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,719
Xu Chunli, there are some things...

573
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,440
I should tell you, but

574
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,600
not today. I'll tell you later.

575
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,480
I have something to do. I need to go now.

576
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,810
I'm leaving.

577
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,560
Come back early. I feel uneasy.

578
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,480
You know what, Wan Xinxin?

579
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,679
You're sitting in this spot now.

580
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,840
When I sit here sometimes,

581
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,170
Bao would be lying right beside me.

582
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,480
When I close my eyes,

583
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,080
all I see are the beautiful moments between us.

584
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,290
Sometimes I think this whole thing

585
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,040
is just a cruel joke played on me by fate.

586
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,400
You let me meet her.

587
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,480
You let me meet Bao.

588
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,340
Why did it have to be me as that doctor?

589
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,240
Why did that doctor have to be me?

590
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,440
Why did it have to be me of all people?

591
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,400
Why?

592
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,040
I hope you understand,

593
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,800
I cannot forgive you for this.

594
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,600
Thank you for taking care of Bao and me.

595
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,560
From now on.

596
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,520
We owe each other nothing.

597
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,800
Take care.

598
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,840
Xinxin!

599
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,680
Xinxin!

600
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,840
If you walk out that door,

601
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,160
We might never

602
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,610
See each other again in this lifetime.

603
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,700
But you have to believe me.

604
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,760
I never lied to you.

605
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,970
I never lied about my feelings for you.

606
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,120
I love you.

607
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,920
I love you.

608
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,280
Hey, sis.

609
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,560
What?

610
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,530
I'll be right there.

611
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:44,760
Hello?

612
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,500
I'll be there soon.

613
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,360
Doctor, how is my mother doing?

614
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,120
If the patient regains consciousness on her own,

615
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
her condition will improve significantly.

616
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,760
Although she's in a coma,

617
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,200
patients can still sense their family members' voices.

618
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,320
Mom,

619
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,520
can you hear me?

620
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,960
Mom, please wake up.

621
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,200
Auntie, it's Xinxin.

622
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,120
I'm here with Xiaogang.

623
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,840
Little Bao and Xiaogang are here too,

624
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,040
and we're all waiting for you to wake up.

625
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,360
Mom, please wake up.

626
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,040
I'll do whatever you say, Mom.

627
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,880
Mrs. Qin.

628
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,400
Mrs. Qin.

629
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:34,880
Huaming.

630
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,000
When was the patient brought in?

631
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,920
An hour ago.

632
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,720
Why wasn't I informed earlier?

633
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,000
The patient was sent to the ER.

634
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,130
They reported it to us only when they couldn't handle it.

635
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,240
What's the patient's condition now?

636
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,440
The patient remains unconscious.

637
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,170
Intracranial pressure is dropping too rapidly.

638
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,200
Huaming, please save my mother.

639
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,680
Please wait outside.

640
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,480
Xinxin, don't interfere with our rescue efforts.

641
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,040
Trust me.

642
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,640
Prepare 0.25 mg of epinephrine.

643
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,650
Adrenaline injection.

644
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,520
Xiao He! Xiao He!

645
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,500
150 joules for the first time.

646
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,200
Auto. Good. Set to 160.

647
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,280
Okay, set to 160.

648
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,730
What happened to my mom?

649
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,200
Don't be too sad.

650
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,760
Why don't you stay at my place for a few days?

651
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,960
Don't be like this. Come home with me.

652
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,850
I'm not going anywhere.

653
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,280
Okay, then I'll stay with you.

654
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,120
I'll get you some water.

655
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li.

656
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,740
Li Wenwang.

657
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,080
(Yeyun)
