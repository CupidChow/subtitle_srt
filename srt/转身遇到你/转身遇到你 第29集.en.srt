1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,300
Wait, are you really going to France?

3
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,479
Yes.

4
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,000
The Contemporary Art Academy of France

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,330
has already sent me an invitation letter.

6
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,720
That's impressive!

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,680
You're about to transform from Cinderella into a golden phoenix.

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,000
Who are you calling Cinderella?

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,680
Rich girl, we need to stay friends.

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,600
So, um...

11
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Is Ming going with you?

12
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:06,960
What's wrong?

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,280
It was my own decision.

14
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,000
It has nothing to do with him.

15
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,130
What's going on?

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,460
What happened?

17
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,440
Actually, to be precise,

18
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
it wasn't entirely my own decision.

19
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,680
His attitude provoked me

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
and forced me to make this decision.

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,160
Why do I sense some tension here?

22
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,079
You two aren't breaking up, are you?

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,960
Break up?

24
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,800
To be honest, I don't even know

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,920
if we were ever really together.

26
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
He's really just

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,400
like a cloud,

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,079
always floating around.

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,300
I can see him but I can't hold onto him.

30
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,160
I really don't know what's going on in his mind.

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
His heart is like a black hole.

32
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,600
Sometimes I think

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,240
I wish I could be like Cooper in Interstellar

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
and travel through it.

35
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,880
I want to see what's inside

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,160
that black hole of his.

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
But he never gives me the chance.

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,440
Well, you need to test him then.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,920
How do you know I haven't tried?

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,360
Every time I ask him,

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,040
he just uses some boring dad jokes

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,900
to brush me off.

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,040
Or he says he'll tell me later.

44
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,090
There's never any resolution.

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,040
And lately,

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,560
with all these external pressures and obstacles,

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,000
his ex-wife came back with their child.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,079
We haven't had a single peaceful day.

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,720
We're constantly fighting, non-stop arguing.

50
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
All that trust

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,320
we had worked so hard to build

52
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,730
is completely gone now.

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
Two people with no trust between them -

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,640
how can they live together?

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,880
So I thought

56
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,440
I'd use this opportunity to go to France

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,320
to test our relationship,

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,860
to see if it can withstand the challenge.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
After hearing all this,

60
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,200
I really feel you've been through a lot.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,600
But this decision you're making is meaningful.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,440
I support you.

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,880
Sometimes in life,

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,080
you should imagine losing something

65
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,410
while you still have it.

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,720
That way you learn to cherish it.

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,100
And even if you do lose it eventually,

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,400
you won't be caught off guard.

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,240
Been reading Douban lately?

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,360
Life forced me to.

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,080
Life is like a giant millstone.

72
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,880
It puts all our daily necessities

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,320
underneath that stone wheel.

74
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,040
Then fate pushes that wheel

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,440
rolling and rolling in circles.

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
No one can escape

77
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:44,880
that crushing weight and burden.

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,740
That's beautifully said.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,800
No, I think since you've

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,640
started dating and got a job,

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,920
you've become a completely different person.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,480
Really.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,400
I guess I need to break through my limits too

84
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,280
and make a qualitative leap.

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,440
We're not the same.

86
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,080
I'm flying within China,

87
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,200
but you're flying all the way to capitalist France.

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,330
Who can handle that?

89
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,080
I know you're saying this to encourage me.

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,840
Don't worry.

91
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,440
I'm definitely going through with this decision.

92
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,240
Mom.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,160
I'm afraid that if Dad knows the truth,

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,560
he won't love me anymore.

95
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,060
How could that happen?

96
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,760
As long as you have the courage to admit your mistake,

97
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,120
Dad won't blame you. Understand?

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,760
Go on.

99
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,440
Huaming.

100
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,700
Ruirui has something to tell you.

101
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,640
Ruirui, what do you want to tell Dad?

102
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,760
Dad, actually that day,

103
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,120
I took Xinxin's painting.

104
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Come here.

105
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,040
Look at me.

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,840
Look at me.

107
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,000
Didn't Dad ask you that day

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,480
if you took the painting?

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,080
Dad has always trusted you, right?

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,880
Isn't that so?

111
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,400
Whatever Ruirui says,

112
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Dad always believes you, right?

113
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,159
Then why did you lie?

114
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,840
Do you know the painting is gone now,

115
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
and Xinxin can't participate in the art exhibition?

116
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,440
Ruirui, nobody likes a child who lies.

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,700
Remember that.

118
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,320
Remember, nobody likes a child who lies.

119
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,140
Alright, alright.

120
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,520
She already knows she was wrong.

121
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,650
Stop lecturing her.

122
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,760
But I'm disciplining Ruirui now,

123
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,490
and I hope you won't interrupt.

124
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,890
You're only disciplining Ruirui now?

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,780
You only just remembered to discipline her?

126
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,160
Isn't it just because Wan Xinxin

127
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,680
can't participate in the exhibition?

128
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,740
Why are you taking it out on the child?

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,640
Let me ask you something.

130
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,640
Why didn't Ruirui act like this when she was in America?

131
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,160
Why only after coming to China?

132
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't you find that strange?

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,160
This isn't about America or China.

134
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm talking about a child lying,

135
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,240
and lying is wrong.

136
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,720
Yes,

137
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,520
didn't I ask her that day?

138
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,960
That day, didn't I

139
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,640
look straight into Ruirui's eyes and ask her?

140
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,720
I said, 'Ruirui, did you take this painting?'

141
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,080
And Ruirui looked me in the eyes and told me.

142
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,320
Didn't I trust her completely?

143
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
She said she didn't take the painting.

144
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,400
Now you suddenly remember to discipline her?

145
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,320
You're ridiculous.

146
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,800
Who let her leave in the first place?

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
You were the one who let her go.

148
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,240
So it's my fault again, is it?

149
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,360
I just hope she won't lie again in the future.

150
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,040
Stop arguing.

151
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,240
Dad, do you know why I took

152
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Xinxin's painting?

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,360
It's because she's trying to take you away.

154
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,320
Now in your eyes, there's only you,

155
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,840
only Xinxin and her baby.

156
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,480
You don't love Mom and me anymore.

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
I hate you!

158
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,760
Ruirui!

159
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,580
Are you satisfied now?

160
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,600
Alright, Ruirui.

161
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,360
Let's stop crying, okay?

162
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,320
Listen to mommy.

163
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,200
Daddy was just upset for a moment.

164
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,460
He's not really angry.

165
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,840
Okay? Stop crying.

166
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,800
Daddy has never spoken to me like that before.

167
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,080
He doesn't like me anymore.

168
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
How could that be?

169
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,860
Daddy and mommy still love you just the same.

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,200
It's all because of me that you're like this.

171
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,400
Silly, this has nothing to do with you.

172
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
Mom.

173
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,760
There, there. Come here.

174
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,800
No more crying, okay?

175
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,600
Mom.

176
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,460
Don't cry. This isn't your fault.

177
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,480
It's all because of me.

178
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,290
That's why daddy and sister Xinxin are fighting.

179
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,880
It's all my fault.

180
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,840
This has even less to do with you.

181
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
You're overthinking, sweetheart.

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,880
They have their own issues.

183
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,120
It has nothing to do with you.

184
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,580
Please stop crying, okay?

185
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
Grab me. Grab this. Come on.

186
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,760
Hold on.

187
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,200
Sis.

188
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,460
Huaming, you're here.

189
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,560
Xinxin went out.

190
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
Um, where did Xinxin go?

191
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,880
Did she go to the airport?

192
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,880
I don't know.

193
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,040
Alright, I'll go find her.

194
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:30,920
Goodbye.

195
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,480
Okay, hurry up then.

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
Ruirui, dinner's ready.

197
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,520
Ruirui.

198
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,680
Ruirui.

199
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Ruirui, dinner's ready.

200
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,400
Ruirui.

201
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,400
Ruirui.

202
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,880
Hello?

203
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,810
This is Huaming.

204
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,980
Ruirui is missing.

205
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,620
Ruirui!

206
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,900
How did Ruirui disappear?

207
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,280
Banana.

208
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,200
Sis,

209
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,440
Xinxin, you're finally back.

210
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,040
Sweetie.

211
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,280
Huaming was looking for you earlier.

212
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,080
What's going on between you two?

213
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,240
Nothing.

214
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,720
It's fine.

215
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,080
Come here to mommy.

216
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,260
Did you have fun today with your aunt?

217
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,280
Okay, just wait a moment.

218
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,460
I'll go out and look for it right away.

219
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,160
Hello.

220
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Have you seen a little girl

221
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,090
about this tall?

222
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Thank you.

223
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,520
Remember, nobody likes a child who lies.

224
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,170
No matter where you go, nobody likes a child who lies.

225
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,370
Can't you just forgive her?

226
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,960
Haven't I forgiven her?

227
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,680
I've always trusted Ruirui.

228
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,960
Are you satisfied now?

229
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,760
Mommy bought you clothes today.

230
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,880
Do you like them?

231
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,960
I love them so much.

232
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,610
A few days ago...

233
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,760
My mom and I passed by a clothing store

234
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,820
called Smile Baby.

235
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,720
But the clothes there,

236
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,680
mom said they were too mature for me.

237
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,810
I've been sneaking over there to look at them these days.

238
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,240
Driver, do you know where Smile Baby is?

239
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,770
Yes, I do.

240
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,400
Driver, please stop ahead.

241
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,880
Ruirui!

242
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,440
Sister Xinxin!

243
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
Sister Xinxin!

244
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,140
You scared us to death, you know that?

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,600
Why did you run off like that?

246
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,960
It's okay.

247
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,600
Look at your mouth.

248
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,480
Where did you get this?

249
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,320
Don't cry anymore.

250
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm just glad we found you.

251
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
Let me take you home, okay?

252
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Come home with me.

253
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,080
What's wrong?

254
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
Sister Xinxin,

255
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,280
I told my dad

256
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,880
about taking your drawing.

257
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,120
My dad and mom had a fight because of me.

258
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,720
My dad doesn't love me anymore.

259
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,120
He's very disappointed in me.

260
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,760
I don't want to go back.

261
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,520
No matter what happens,

262
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,080
you have to believe that your parents

263
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,340
are the people who love you most in this world, understand?

264
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,680
Especially your dad.

265
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,000
But today he

266
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,360
really said that to me.

267
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,240
I feel like I'm just

268
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,960
a burden to them.

269
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,440
It's because of me,

270
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,400
because I came along.

271
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,600
You and dad started fighting

272
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,760
and made mom and dad fight too.

273
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,160
So in the end, I got into an argument with dad.

274
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,330
My dad doesn't want me anymore.

275
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,920
How is that possible?

276
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,680
How could your dad not want you?

277
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
How about this? Let's go home.

278
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,920
If he says anything like that,

279
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,240
I'll hit him for you, okay?

280
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,720
I don't want you to hit him.

281
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,480
Okay.

282
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,700
I won't hit him.

283
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,480
Then, can I scold him?

284
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,120
You don't want to go home?

285
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,840
Alright, I'll call your dad

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
and tell him I've found you.

287
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,960
Then I'll go with you wherever you want to go.

288
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,690
Is that okay?

289
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,200
Hello?

290
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,640
I've found Ruirui. Don't worry.

291
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
Xinxin, please bring

292
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,320
Ruirui home soon.

293
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,770
I'm begging you.

294
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,760
Please make sure Ruirui gets back safely.

295
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,290
As long as you're not worried I'll kidnap her.

296
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,560
Thank you, Xinxin.

297
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,320
Hello, would you like to look at some clothes?

298
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,720
Hello.

299
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,440
If you like anything, you can try it on.

300
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,600
This is the store you like, right?

301
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,050
Get whatever you want. Take your pick.

302
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,880
I like

303
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,640
this.

304
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,040
What else?

305
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,500
Human-centered design will be integrated throughout our

306
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,520
promotion and marketing.

307
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,320
This will not only help clients

308
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,700
clarify their product positioning.

309
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
It will also allow customers

310
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,970
when purchasing products,

311
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,930
to have a complete experience.

312
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,080
Feel our care and thoughtfulness

313
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Let them know that

314
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,800
a mother's love is the most selfless love in the world.

315
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,880
Did Wan Xinxin help you make this slideshow?

316
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,440
No.

317
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,100
She's already swamped with work.

318
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,120
Don't underestimate me.

319
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,160
I was thinking about this promotion plan

320
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,160
while learning how to make slides.

321
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,400
By the time I've fully developed my ideas,

322
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,130
I'll be a slideshow expert too.

323
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,740
Admirable effort.

324
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,440
But your proposal lacks impact.

325
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,160
This wishy-washy approach

326
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,640
is worthless to me.

327
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,440
But you must respect my opinion,

328
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,560
because I'm also a shareholder of this company.

329
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,240
I have the right to participate in company management.

330
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,440
This is the responsibility you gave me.

331
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,400
So whether you like it or not,

332
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,599
I must stand by what I believe is right.

333
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,599
How dare you talk to me like this?

334
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,240
I must stand by what I believe is right.

335
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,800
I must stand by what I believe is right.

336
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
Isn't that going too far?

337
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,640
OK, thanks.

338
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,000
What's wrong?

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,930
Hold this for me.

340
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,180
What are you doing?

341
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,920
Wow!

342
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
Wow!

343
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
It's beautiful!

344
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,880
Let me tell you, if you wear this outfit now,

345
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,480
everyone will turn to look at you on the street.

346
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,120
Let's go.

347
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,400
Sister Xinxin, do you think I'm like you?

348
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,560
But do you think you're unique?

349
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,480
Of course.

350
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,360
Everyone is unique.

351
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,080
You are unique,

352
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,760
and so are your mom and dad.

353
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,160
That's why I'm afraid of losing my dad.

354
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,960
I won't take him away from you.

355
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,650
Your dad belongs to you.

356
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,050
Sister Xinxin, are you still going to France?

357
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,960
Yes.

358
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,840
Sister Xinxin,

359
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,320
could you please consider not leaving?

360
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,600
Don't you want

361
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,080
your dad to belong only to you?

362
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Sister Xinxin,

363
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
I used to want that.

364
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,720
But when I saw him frowning that day,

365
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,400
I felt really sad.

366
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
So, Sister Xinxin,

367
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,200
I want him to live happily.

368
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,280
So could you please consider not leaving?

369
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,680
Yes, I'll definitely think about it.

370
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,760
Don't worry.

371
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,160
Just remember

372
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,400
your parents will always be by your side.

373
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,160
That's all that matters.

374
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,400
Let's go.

375
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,200
Can we go home now?

376
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,320
Let's go.

377
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,180
This time the Iron Lady has been completely defeated by Mr. Xu.

378
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,040
Yeah, Mr. Xu is so impressive.

379
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,200
I must stick to what I believe is right.

380
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
In that moment, I found him so charismatic.

381
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,280
The Iron Lady doesn't appreciate what she has.

382
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,720
She's always looked down on him.

383
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
What abilities does she even have?

384
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,840
The company was doing fine before.

385
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,480
Now it's getting worse by the day.

386
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,640
I think she might as well

387
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,280
hand over her position to Mr. Xu sooner

388
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,600
and just retire.

389
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,300
Do you need a recommendation letter?

390
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,040
Mr. Shi.

391
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,600
It seems you don't need

392
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,210
employees who talk behind their boss's back.

393
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,160
No one will hire you anywhere.

394
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,280
Mr. Shi, please don't be angry.

395
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,000
We just thought you and Ms. Xu make a good match.

396
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,260
We meant nothing else.

397
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,760
I've been listening inside the whole time. Still trying to make excuses?

398
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,480
Both of you,

399
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,570
pack your things and leave.

400
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,010
What's going on?

401
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,640
Ms. Xu.

402
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Throwing your weight around again?

403
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,170
I heard you're firing both of them.

404
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,120
Do you have any objections?

405
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,920
I disagree.

406
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,020
The company is short-staffed right now.

407
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
If you fire them both,

408
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,040
where am I supposed to find

409
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,800
two experienced people to take over on such short notice?

410
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,520
Besides,

411
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,800
it's not about their work performance.

412
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,320
Every company has a few

413
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,160
female employees who love to gossip.

414
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,290
As a boss, you should be more tolerant.

415
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,720
Are you used to lecturing me?

416
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,440
No,

417
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,000
that's not it. I'm just standing my ground.

418
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,640
Enough.

419
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,740
Whose company is this?

420
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,400
Yours.

421
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,490
I'm just exercising my rights as the boss.

422
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,480
You two, get out.

423
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,840
And you.

424
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
Give me your account number.

425
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,570
I'll return your shares to you.

426
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,720
Come on, you're just being spoiled because you have money.

427
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,400
I'll pay you back.

428
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,320
No.

429
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,000
Stop it.

430
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
Let me apologize to you.

431
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,480
The company is short on cash right now.

432
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,340
Can't you just accept my apology?

433
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,200
Stop it. Don't be angry.

434
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,520
I'll work hard, sell my blood, my kidney, whatever it takes.

435
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,960
I will definitely pay you back.

436
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,040
Now pack your things and leave.

437
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
Never show up in front of me again.

438
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
Xinxin, thank you so much for today.

439
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,760
I'm so happy today.

440
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm glad you're happy.

441
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
You know what?

442
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,280
The outfit you picked looks really good on you.

443
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,840
Right?

444
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,400
Alright, go on up.

445
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,560
Xinxin, aren't you coming up with me?

446
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,080
I won't go up.

447
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,960
Your parents are anxiously waiting for you.

448
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,920
Hurry up.

449
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Xinxin, please come up with me.

450
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,280
I bet my dad really wants to see you.

451
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,560
Your dad definitely wants to see you more right now.

452
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,280
Come on.

453
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,840
Xinxin, what did I do wrong?

454
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,400
Haven't we gotten through it all?

455
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,660
What are you afraid of?

456
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,800
Come on, let's go up together.

457
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,520
What if your mom is home?

458
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,800
I'm scared.

459
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,880
My mom won't eat you alive.

460
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,960
I've noticed these past few days

461
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,120
her attitude toward you has changed.

462
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,560
She just seems cold on the outside,

463
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,280
but inside she's actually easily moved.

464
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,760
Besides,

465
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,680
today you're bringing back the lost me.

466
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,240
She'll definitely be moved to tears.

467
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,890
Come on, let's go together.

468
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,920
I really don't want to go up.

469
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,320
I have something to do later.

470
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,180
Hurry, take your things and go up.

471
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,240
You told me

472
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,040
to face difficulties bravely.

473
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,220
How come you're not as brave as me?

474
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Let's go.

475
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,920
Fine, I'll take you up.

476
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,120
Xinxin,

477
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,040
thank you so much for today.

478
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,040
Actually, I don't dislike you that much.

479
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,120
Beautiful girls can still be friends with each other.

480
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,640
Right.

481
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,840
Let's go.

482
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,120
Xinxin, thank you for today.

483
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,960
If it weren't for you,

484
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,010
we really wouldn't know where to find Ruirui.

485
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,320
Don't mention it. It's what I should do.

486
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
I was worried about Ruirui too.

487
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Thank you.

488
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,840
You two talk.

489
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,840
I'll go wash some fruit.

490
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,080
Xinxin, thank you.

491
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Stop thanking me.

492
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,020
It's good that Ruirui is back.

493
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,520
Don't lose your temper with her anymore.

494
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,580
She could develop emotional trauma.

495
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,680
So I should have been

496
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,640
apologizing all day.

497
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
I've been in a terrible mood lately.

498
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,600
It's getting late.

499
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,260
I should go now.

500
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,080
Xinxin.

501
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm really sorry.

502
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,840
I wrongly accused you about the painting.

503
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,220
You were right.

504
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,260
I didn't trust you enough.

505
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,180
Could you give me another chance?

506
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
Let's get to know each other better.

507
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,920
I've been really tired lately.

508
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,530
I know you're tired too.

509
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,640
Let's give each other some time, okay?

510
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,500
So are you going to France?

511
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,520
I don't know.

512
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm leaving.

513
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,960
Why

514
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,970
haven't you won over your goddess yet?

515
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,120
Now she's my little goddess.

516
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,850
I really won't dare do it again.

517
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,650
This incident with Ruirui scared me to death.

518
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,160
I was just a bit anxious today.

520
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,240
The little one probably got tired from running and fell asleep.

521
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,970
Don't worry.

522
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
I've already apologized to Ruirui.

523
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,860
Let me tell you something important.

524
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,440
Actually, through Ruirui running away today,

525
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,010
I've gained a whole new understanding of Wan Xinxin.

526
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,200
That little girl is quite reliable.

527
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,800
At least in critical moments,

528
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,060
she's quite rational.

529
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,500
I'm quite satisfied with her.

530
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,400
After all, she is a mother too.

531
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,360
And about this matter,

532
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,220
it doesn't matter if you're satisfied. Only my satisfaction counts.

533
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,120
Yes, your satisfaction is what matters most.

534
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,650
Actually, I wanted to tell you that

535
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,410
I'm planning to take Ruirui back to America in a few days.

536
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,880
Okay.

537
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,580
You two get along well.

538
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,960
Wan Xinxin just told me

539
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,040
she's decided to go to France.

540
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,620
And she's very determined this time.

541
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
If you truly love her, keep her here.

542
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,730
I have no way to keep her.

543
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,480
Take her to the altar.

544
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,760
You mean... propose?

545
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,980
If not now, when are you planning to propose?

546
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,850
Besides, you have more experience with this.

547
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,800
Yes, I do have more experience than others in this matter.

548
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,120
I have a suggestion.

549
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,400
Why don't you invite her somewhere

550
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,700
and we'll do a flash mob proposal?

551
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,600
I'm over forty now.

552
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,480
Don't want to throw my back out.

553
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,280
I'll help you.

554
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:55,640
You?

555
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,840
Thank you.

556
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,680
I'm serious.

557
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's quite funny,

558
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,800
an ex-wife helping her ex-husband pursue his current girlfriend.

559
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,100
You should remember this.

560
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,560
When you two have children someday,

561
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,840
you can tell them

562
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,960
the whole story

563
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,240
of how it all happened.

564
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,120
Thank you.

565
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,240
By the way, do you have Weimin's domestic phone number?

566
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,570
Chen Weimin?

567
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,000
Yes.

568
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,690
He's doing well.

569
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,440
Why do you need him?

570
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,320
For such a big proposal setup,

571
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,200
I might need some extra help.

572
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,040
I'll ask him for assistance.

573
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,520
Okay.

574
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,200
Weimin.

575
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,890
Sister-in-law.

576
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,130
What brings you here today?

577
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,680
Come, have a seat.

578
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,160
I came to see you today

579
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,200
because I need your help with something.

580
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,730
Go ahead.

581
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,200
Hello.

582
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,020
I need to talk to you about something.

583
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:07,920
Go ahead.

584
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,120
Well, this matter...

585
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,520
Why don't we meet somewhere?

586
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,400
I'm busy.

587
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,640
I need to tell you this in person.

588
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,520
Then forget it.

589
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,040
Hey!

590
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,240
Are you going to tell me or not?

591
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,970
Meet me at Seaside Park at 4 p.m.

592
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,280
Our employees have never danced street dance before.

593
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,060
We don't know how to do flash mobs either.

594
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,700
Besides, we don't have time to rehearse.

595
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,240
Don't you have that morning exercise for employees?

596
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,700
That would work just fine.

597
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,900
That's just radio calisthenics.

598
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,240
That would ruin the mood, wouldn't it?

599
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,600
It's okay. We just need enough people.

600
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,490
You have to help me, Weimin.

601
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,760
Someone who can be this nice to an ex-husband

602
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,400
is probably the only one in the world.

603
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,370
You know what happened between us.

604
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,640
When you truly love someone,

605
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,840
you want them to be happier than you are.

606
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,880
I understand.

607
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,080
Alright, I'll make it happen.

608
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,960
Thank you.

609
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,720
But who are we dancing for?

610
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,450
We've never even met that girl.

611
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,400
I have a photo here.

612
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:46,840
Here.

613
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,000
What's this girl's name?

614
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,930
Her surname is Wan. Her name is Wan Xinxin.

615
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,180
That's her.

616
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,960
Wan Xinxin.

617
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,520
Why are you here?

618
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
Wasn't Huaming supposed to meet me?

619
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,520
Come with me first. Let's leave here and talk.

620
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,920
Wait, where are we going?

621
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,600
Our relationship

622
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
isn't close enough for a date, is it?

623
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,530
It doesn't matter where. Let's go.

624
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720
Where exactly are we going?

625
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Are you coming or not?

626
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,520
I'm not going.

627
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,610
Something happened to Huaming. Hurry up.

628
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
What happened?

629
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,690
Let's go now.

630
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,719
Where to?

631
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,360
No, where exactly are you taking me?

632
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,960
Didn't you say something happened to Huaming?

633
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,000
He had something urgent come up and can't make it.

634
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
He can't make it. Something came up.

635
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,440
I'll go find him.

636
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,960
No, you can't go.

637
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,800
Why can't I go?

638
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,040
Xiaqing, you...

639
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,760
What's wrong with you? Have you changed your mind?

640
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,120
Do you want to be with him again?

641
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Yes, because I'm getting back together with Huaming.

642
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,570
You're a Gemini with AB blood type.

643
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,320
So split personality.

644
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,160
One minute it's this, the next it's that.

645
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,560
What exactly do you want?

646
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,080
There's no choice. It's fate.

647
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,700
You two can't be together.

648
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,410
Sister, are you acting in some cheesy soap opera?

649
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,960
'It's fate'?

650
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,600
You and your daughter are trying to drive me crazy.

651
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
I'll call him right now.

652
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,480
No, you can't call him.

653
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,000
Why can't I call him?

654
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,560
You just can't call him.

655
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,320
Mom.

656
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,800
Are you sure that Wan Xinxin's father

657
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,640
was the college professor Dad failed to save?

658
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,040
Your father changed his career to become a vet

659
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,660
because of this incident.

660
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,840
He was devastated.

661
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,520
Ruirui, you don't want Dad

662
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,040
to get hurt again, do you?

663
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,100
No, I don't.

664
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,680
So you must promise me

665
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,600
to keep this a secret. Understand?

666
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,640
I understand.

667
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,920
So that means Xinxin

668
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,810
has become a ticking time bomb.

669
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,520
Once she finds out this secret,

670
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,240
she'll not only leave Dad,

671
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,960
but also break his heart.

672
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,720
That's right.

673
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,800
I'll help you.

674
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,680
I'll bring Dad back to us

675
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,980
so we can return to America together.

676
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,380
Come, dinner's ready.

677
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,040
Huaming, let's eat.

678
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,890
I can't get through to Xinxin's phone.

679
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,040
Let's eat first.

680
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,240
I need to find Wan Xinxin.

681
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,200
Dad, don't go.

682
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,480
Don't you want to try

683
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,400
the food Mom and I made?

684
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,880
You can go after you eat.

685
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,760
Ruirui, be good.

686
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,720
Otherwise the food will get cold.

687
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,480
I know, I know.

688
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,640
Dad, but I'm not hungry now.

689
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,280
I need to see Aunt Wan Xinxin. You eat first.

690
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,080
If you don't eat, I won't either.

691
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,560
Ruirui,

692
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,490
please don't go.

693
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,400
Don't go.

694
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,140
Okay, good girl. Dad will eat with you first.

695
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,480
Come.

696
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,180
Ruirui, take big bites. Dad will eat too.

697
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,200
Dad, do you know

698
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,080
that other kids during their vacation

699
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,280
They all have their dad's company.

700
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,960
Why don't you come to America with us and Mom?

701
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,220
Ruirui, eat your food first. Come on.

702
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,360
Dad, don't you want to eat

703
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,520
Mom's cooking every day?

704
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Please come back to America with us.

705
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,680
Eat up, Ruirui.

706
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,800
Xinxin.

707
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,960
Xinxin, where have you been?

708
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,280
Where have I been?

709
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,320
I couldn't reach you on your phone.

710
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,040
Of course you couldn't reach me.

711
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Ask her why my phone wasn't working.

712
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,600
Don't point at my mom.

713
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,480
My dad has already promised us

714
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,640
that we're going to America.

715
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,320
Ruirui.

716
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,920
Going to America, huh?

717
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,000
Looks like you're really getting back together.

718
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,320
Am I out of touch,

719
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,840
or are you changing too fast?

720
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,040
No, Xinxin. Let me explain.

721
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,200
The child is just talking.

722
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,280
Is this the surprise you wanted to give me today?

723
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,760
No, Xinxin. Listen to me.

724
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,200
What a surprise!

725
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,360
Xinxin.

726
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,160
Xinxin.

727
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,760
Dad.

728
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,080
Huaming.

729
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,540
Xinxin.

730
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,200
I told you I wouldn't keep you waiting for long.

731
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,660
Who says rich kids can't start from scratch?

732
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,640
With my efforts,

733
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
I'm about to become self-made rich.

734
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,040
What's this?

735
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,780
I'm entering the IT industry.

736
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,360
Do you know about the cloud era?

737
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,760
Yes.

738
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,120
A classmate of mine from America has returned.

739
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,000
He has more than 10

740
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,840
patents related to cloud technology.

741
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,480
This is our product proposal.

742
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,840
If everything goes well,

743
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
in two years, our sales

744
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,560
should reach 200 million.

745
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,410
We can go public in three years.

746
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,960
The startup you mentioned before

747
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,360
was about this?

748
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,260
If I wasn't confident,

749
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,640
why would I tell you?

750
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,680
Isn't making such plans now

751
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,200
a bit too ambitious?

752
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,850
You doubt me, don't you?

753
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,960
No,

754
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,520
how could I think of you that way?

755
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,120
So you think I can't achieve anything significant?

756
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
No,

757
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm just

758
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,200
overwhelmed by this sudden happiness. I'm happy for you.

759
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,250
Then just wait for my good news.

760
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,640
My colleagues are waiting for me downstairs.

761
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,440
We need to pick up some documents.

762
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,600
Wait for me at home.

763
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,680
See you tonight.

764
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,040
Okay.

765
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,920
Wait for me.

766
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,360
Hey, how is it?

767
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,160
Does the suit fit well?

768
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,400
It fits perfectly, Mr. Liu.

769
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,640
You have such good taste.

770
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,440
The suit you bought is so much better

771
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,120
than what my wife used to buy.

772
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,480
Come to the office. Let's talk.

773
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,840
Sure, Mr. Liu.

774
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,440
I'll be right there.

775
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,690
Who was that?

776
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,050
Who were you talking to?

777
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,200
I need to go to the office.

778
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,530
Is this the person who bought you the suit?

779
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,360
Yes.

780
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,040
You two are so blatant about it.

781
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,600
I'm still at home and you're insulting me like this.

782
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,800
Is she really that great?

783
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,000
I want to meet her too.

784
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,120
Xu Chunli.

785
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,340
I think it's better if you don't meet.

786
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,840
I'm afraid after meeting her

787
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,040
you'll lose the courage to live.

788
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,320
About Qin Gang's new project,

789
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,920
I've reviewed the proposal.

790
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,720
It seems less and less feasible.

791
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,840
If he invests money into it now,

792
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,440
he'll definitely lose everything.

793
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,080
But it's useless for me to tell him.

794
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,240
He certainly won't listen.

795
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,200
Later, have your IT friends

796
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,600
talk some sense into him.

797
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,200
Don't say I asked you to do this.

798
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,640
Just say that you

799
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,250
accidentally saw it at the company, okay?

800
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,440
Okay.

801
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,700
Alright, I'm leaving.

802
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,050
Yang Ming

803
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li
