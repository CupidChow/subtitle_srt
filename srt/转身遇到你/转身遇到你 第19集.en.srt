1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
This room is exactly the same as before.

3
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,420
I haven't changed a thing.

4
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,080
Just added this crib.

5
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,020
The room has been cleaned.

6
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,320
I've installed an intercom.

7
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,200
If you need anything at all,

8
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,080
just press it.

9
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,800
I'll be here

10
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,080
in a flash.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,730
You're my little princess now.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Xinxin, it's so good to have you back.

13
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,640
I feel...

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,240
I feel like I'm dreaming.

15
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,440
We can go back to how things were before.

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,170
Plus we have him now too.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,600
How are we going to sleep tonight?

18
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,640
I knew you would ask that.

19
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,800
I've already had someone clean the guest room downstairs.

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,160
I won't come up without your permission.

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,680
Then I'll rest upstairs for a while.

22
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,640
Okay, you rest for a while.

23
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,240
I'll come up to get you when it's time to eat.

24
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Alright.

25
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,960
Great-grandmother, here's your medicine.

26
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,890
Good, thank you.

27
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,400
Xinxin.

28
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,770
Please sit down.

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,680
Xinxin, is the baby asleep?

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,320
Yes, just fell asleep.

31
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,840
Auntie, what medicine are you taking?

32
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,560
Nifuda was recommended by the local doctor.

33
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
It's also for blood pressure.

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,120
My colleague's father has been taking this medicine.

35
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,240
It works really well for blood pressure.

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,880
Yes.

37
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,800
Thank goodness for this medicine.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Otherwise,

39
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,930
he would have driven me to my grave.

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,360
Mom, dinner's ready.

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,810
You're criticizing me in front of Xinxin.

42
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,020
If you want me to speak well of you,

43
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,680
you must treat Xinxin well.

44
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,280
You have to be good to her.

45
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,040
Don't make Xinxin upset.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,160
Xinxin, Xiaogang told me

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,520
that you like both Chinese and Western food,

48
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,360
so I've prepared both for you today.

49
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,200
You can eat whatever you like.

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,279
Auntie, actually, I can eat anything.

51
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,720
Xinxin, why are you still calling her auntie?

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,400
It's okay.

53
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,400
She may call me auntie now,

54
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,040
but am I really just an auntie?

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,580
She'll change how she addresses me eventually.

56
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Xinxin, when that day comes,

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
I'll give you a big red envelope.

58
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,810
You should take your medicine now.

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,690
Good girl. Thank you for reminding me.

60
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,120
I'll take it when the water cools down a bit.

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Mom, let's eat.

62
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,240
Sure.

63
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,760
Xinxin.

64
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,180
Serve the food.

65
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,600
What is it?

66
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,090
Have some hot milk. It helps you sleep.

67
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:57,960
I don't have this habit.

68
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,240
I don't have this habit.

69
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,440
Then start developing this good habit from today.

70
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,900
It's good for your health.

71
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,180
You drink it for me.

72
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,000
How many times does the baby wake up at night?

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,720
It varies.

74
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
If you need anything,

75
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,000
don't forget to press that button. Call me anytime.

76
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,800
No need. You don't know how.

77
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,280
I'll sign up for a training class tomorrow.

78
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,200
I'll learn properly.

79
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,520
Really, there's no need.

80
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,780
I can manage by myself.

81
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,280
Good night.

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,560
Well.

83
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,760
How is it?

84
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,520
Let her adjust for a while.

85
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,640
She just came back.

86
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,010
She won't even let me into her room.

87
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,400
I'm already very satisfied with how things are now.

88
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,600
This is how it should be.

89
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,880
This is what makes a complete family.

90
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Okay, Mom.

91
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,080
I'll do whatever you say.

92
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,280
Xiaogang, I've been through it all.

93
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,160
Throughout my life until now,

94
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
I've never lacked anything.

95
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,340
The only thing I've missed is a complete family.

96
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,240
That's why I don't want

97
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,159
the same thing to happen to my son.

98
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,440
It won't, Mom. It won't.

99
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,640
It won't.

100
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,600
I truly hope you understand

101
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,730
this from the bottom of your heart.

102
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,120
I can't watch over you every day.

103
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
I only have a few years left with you.

104
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,160
Look at you, Mom.

105
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,500
You're being pessimistic again.

106
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,320
Sooner or later,

107
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,520
I'll pass all the family assets to you.

108
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,120
I hope that no matter when,

109
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,680
you never forget this lesson.

110
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,850
I'll remember, Mom.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's been a long day. Get some rest.

112
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,970
You should rest early too. Don't stay up late.

113
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
CEO Chen just got back from America.

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
She's invited friends for a welcome party.

115
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
I need to make an appearance.

116
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,800
You're still going at this hour?

117
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,600
You know how these social obligations work.

118
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,880
Fine. Come back early.

119
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,930
You should go to bed early too. Don't stay up late.

120
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm leaving now, Mom.

121
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,160
Okay.

122
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
So you finally decided to come back.

123
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Of course I'd come back.

124
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,840
Wan Xinxin is acting crazy.

125
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
She insists on sleeping separately

126
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,380
and won't let me into her room.

127
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,500
Sounds like you still want to go in there, don't you?

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,880
No.

129
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,720
Even if she threw herself at me now,

130
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,920
I wouldn't touch her.

131
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,640
I just can't stand her arrogant attitude.

132
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,040
Don't forget, that's my house.

133
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,320
Easy to say,

134
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,560
but every cat will steal fish when it can.

135
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,360
You might resist for a day or two,

136
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,320
but can you really keep your hands off her for long?

137
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,080
I can.

138
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,760
Without your permission,

139
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,200
I absolutely won't touch her.

140
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,400
Fine, I give you permission. Go ahead.

141
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,240
I was just joking.

142
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,040
Why are you taking it seriously?

143
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,160
Let's go out for a nice meal,

144
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,960
to celebrate.

145
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,200
Isn't it too early to celebrate?

146
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,960
Not at all. My mom just indicated

147
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
that I'll soon be able

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,860
to take over the family business.

149
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,120
Then, at that time,

150
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,930
will you still be willing to let Wan Xinxin go?

151
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,880
Of course.

152
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,960
Because this place in my heart

153
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,420
will always belong to you.

154
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,960
Come on, get changed.

155
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,090
Hurry up.

156
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,040
Hello? Who is it?

157
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,360
Hello, I'm Hua Ming.

158
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,880
I'm Wan Xinxin's friend.

159
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,200
I've brought something for your young master.

160
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,800
Okay.

161
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,560
Thank you.

162
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,490
Great, we've been waiting for you.

163
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,810
We have guests. I'll talk to you later.

164
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,360
Dr. Hua is here. Please have a seat.

165
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,160
Hello, ma'am.

166
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,080
Xinxin

167
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,960
Mrs.

168
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,160
Bao left these things at our house.

169
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,720
He likes to cry.

170
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,980
When you shake this, he stops crying.

171
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
Good. Thank you. Give it to me.

172
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,480
When he cries,

173
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,640
just shake it in front of him like this.

174
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,480
Put it inside.

175
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,730
Please sit down.

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,560
Okay.

177
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,080
Dr. Hua.

178
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,660
I've actually bought many toys for Xiaobao.

179
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,500
And yet such a small thing,

180
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,560
you went to the trouble of bringing it yourself.

181
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,160
I'm really sorry about that.

182
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,400
May I go upstairs to see Bao?

183
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,080
It's not convenient.

184
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,010
The child just fell asleep. Another day perhaps.

185
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,160
Is Bao doing well?

186
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,800
Hmm.

187
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,000
Are you doing well?

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,880
I'm fine.

189
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,840
We're all doing well so far.

190
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,280
If there are any shortcomings,

191
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,100
I will correct them promptly.

192
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,560
Dr. Hua is truly a caring man,

193
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,200
attentive and thorough.

194
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
There's much I need to learn from you.

195
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,240
It's nothing. I'll be going now.

196
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,680
Don't rush. Have a seat.

197
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,440
Let's have some tea and chat.

198
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,620
Maybe another day.

199
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,850
I'll see you out.

200
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,840
I'll do it. I'll do it.

201
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,440
Please stay.

202
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,480
No, let me walk you out.

203
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,610
Do you think it's appropriate for you to come to our home now?

204
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,050
You've been to my place too.

205
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,240
I was there to see Wan Xinxin.

206
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,620
I'm just bringing toys for the child.

207
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,600
Then I'd ask you

208
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,280
not to use such excuses to come to our home anymore.

209
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,680
You're not welcome here.

210
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,480
Goodbye.

211
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,840
Wan Xinxin.

212
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,680
Wan Xinxin.

213
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,760
Hello?

214
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,880
Hey, what are you trying to say?

215
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,000
I want to know

216
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,960
where you put that book 'The Long Goodbye'.

217
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,850
Do I look like someone who reads books?

218
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,560
Never mind then. I'll look for it myself.

219
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,970
Is there something you want to tell me?

220
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,520
No.

221
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,120
Just... how are you doing?

222
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,680
I'm doing fine.

223
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,000
Didn't you tell me

224
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,240
that I need to grow up gradually

225
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,490
and learn to accept new things?

226
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
I'm trying to start over.

227
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll learn to grow up gradually.

228
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,520
This is a new beginning for me.

229
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,940
That's good. You're finally growing up.

230
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,370
I hope it's not too late.

231
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,080
If there's nothing else,

232
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,700
I'll go look for that book.

233
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,840
The Long Goodbye...

234
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,970
Even the title sounds depressing.

235
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,010
Saying goodbye is painful enough,

236
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,060
and making it long?

237
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,450
How torturous must that be.

238
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,680
Hey, when I'm not around,

239
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,320
could you please stop torturing yourself?

240
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,440
Stop joking around. I'm going to look for the book.

241
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,840
That's it. Goodbye.

242
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,960
What's up?

243
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
A lonely old man working hard,

244
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,840
still strong in his old age, wanting to court a lady!

245
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,800
I'm annoyed. Get out of my way.

246
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,860
Don't be angry.

247
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,360
Are you feeling lonely now that Wan Xinxin is gone?

248
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,240
I'm glad she's gone. It's none of your business.

249
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,760
Look ahead.

250
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,690
What do you mean?

251
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,480
Are you crazy?

252
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,240
Look.

253
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,800
Mister.

254
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,240
You didn't even tell me before you left.

255
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,170
You don't take me seriously at all.

256
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,440
I'm talking to you. Can you at least look at me?

257
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:28,960
What?

258
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,560
Everything was fine before.

259
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,640
How come Wan Xinxin suddenly

260
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,900
got back with Qin Gang?

261
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,940
She came to her senses.

262
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,500
Came to her senses?

263
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,160
And you didn't try to stop her?

264
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,280
I encouraged her to go.

265
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,840
You encouraged her?

266
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,360
Are you crazy?

267
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,920
Yes, I'm crazy. And I don't care.

268
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,480
What don't you care about?

269
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,160
Mister, you said you liked her

270
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,640
but the timing wasn't right.

271
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,370
Your timing is wrong right now.

272
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,800
Don't be angry.

273
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,100
If you really didn't care,

274
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,040
you wouldn't talk to me like this.

275
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,320
How am I talking to you?

276
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,680
You're taking all your emotions about Wan Xinxin

277
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,800
and dumping them on me, right?

278
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,440
I...

279
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,760
Admit it.

280
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
Come on, admit it.

281
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,690
I hit the nail on the head, didn't I?

282
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,290
What are you planning to do?

283
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,930
She finally got back with Qin Gang.

284
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,200
She should have gone back to him anyway.

285
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
It's for the best.

286
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,640
Fine then.

287
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,130
Since you've figured it out, I won't try to comfort you anymore.

288
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,160
If you're still confused,

289
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
you can call me.

290
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,320
You remember my number, right?

291
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,200
Get lost.

292
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,840
I don't really want to leave. I want to stay.

293
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,280
Mom, I won't be coming home for lunch.

294
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,800
I have a meeting with a client.

295
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,600
I'll come home early for dinner.

296
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,520
Let Xinxin know, okay?

297
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,940
That's all for now.

298
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,410
Are you stealing tires?

299
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,680
The tire is flat.

300
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,200
Then quickly get someone from the repair shop

301
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,120
to come and inflate it.

302
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Yes.

303
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,680
Mr. Qin,

304
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,200
who were you just talking to on the phone?

305
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,680
Xinxin has moved back in.

306
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,530
Are you getting back together?

307
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,120
Not yet.

308
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
Do you plan to?

309
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Yes, we do.

310
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
That's great!

311
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,760
No, I mean, with such good news,

312
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
why didn't you tell me? Right?

313
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,680
How about this? I'll gather some people

314
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,880
and we can celebrate together, okay?

315
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Maybe another day.

316
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,080
Don't put it off.

317
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,720
There's no time like the present, right?

318
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,880
Tonight. Tonight.

319
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,540
This very evening.

320
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,720
As for this news,

321
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,280
just be happy you heard it.

322
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,560
I need to go home early for dinner to be with them.

323
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,880
Get back to work. Hurry up with that tire.

324
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,840
Okay.

325
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,920
Don't block the view.

326
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,480
Why are you back?

327
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,840
Why did you turn it off?

328
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,200
Stop watching this kind of TV drama.

329
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,160
You should watch the national news broadcast.

330
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,360
What time is it now? Is there even news broadcast now?

331
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,090
There's no news broadcast now.

332
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,160
It's getting late. I'll go make dinner.

333
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,770
Or should I go write a self-criticism?

334
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,100
No need to write any self-criticism.

335
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,480
No need to watch the news broadcast either.

336
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,960
I have some big news for you.

337
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,120
Very chewy and refreshing.

338
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,360
Very refreshing.

339
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,360
Very refreshing.

340
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,410
Your sister.

341
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,400
Why are you cursing at me?

342
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,360
Xu Chunli, no.

343
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,480
I don't mean that as an insult.

344
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,640
Your Wan Xinxin.

345
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,660
What about her?

346
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,920
What about Xinxin? Let me tell you.

347
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,520
Xinxin has moved back to the Qin family house.

348
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,600
So that means they're getting back together?

349
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
Following this logic,

350
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,720
they'll definitely remarry soon.

351
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,080
Think about it. Use your imagination.

352
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,600
If they remarry, then I, Jiang Kaiyang,

353
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,680
will quickly rise up

354
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,080
in position at the store.

355
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,560
From then on,

356
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
my status will improve.

357
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,840
I won't have to put up with Qin Gang ordering me around.

358
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,560
Old Jiang do this, Old Jiang do that.

359
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,600
What's the point?

360
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,460
I'll be your brother-in-law now.

361
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,520
Me becoming the store manager will be the natural course of events.

362
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,200
Right.

363
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Isn't that right?

364
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,080
So you're happy now.

365
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,680
You were talking about divorcing me before.

366
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,280
Before...

367
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,920
That was just to create

368
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,050
some family atmosphere or something.

369
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,280
Don't joke about this anymore in the future.

370
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,360
I won't, I won't.

371
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
Look, on my way home,

372
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,600
I knew Xinxin likes this drink,

373
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,160
so I bought it for her.

374
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,200
Let's hurry and take it to her now. Come on.

375
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,930
You've never bought any for me.

376
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
If you want some, that's no big deal.

377
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,200
Listen to me. Don't go.

378
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,640
She's moved to Qin Gang's place

379
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,000
without even telling me.

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,530
It means she's still upset.

381
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,960
It's not appropriate to go now.

382
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,920
Don't worry about others' feelings.

383
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,400
We need to go now. We...

384
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,360
We need to strike while the iron is hot.

385
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,520
If we wait, it won't be as effective.

386
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,380
This time you need to listen to me.

387
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,320
She didn't tell me.

388
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,560
She's still upset and hasn't gotten over it.

389
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,040
Let's wait until she's settled down

390
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,280
and then we can visit.

391
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Going now would just cause trouble.

392
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,040
Xu Chunli, you're being very rational right now.

393
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,640
Then I'll go make dinner.

394
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,600
Don't bother.

395
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,360
You were just watching TV

396
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
so intensely.

397
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,160
That must be exhausting, right?

398
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Let's eat out.

399
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,320
How's the pressure?

400
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,560
This Wan Xinxin really has her ways.

401
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,920
Huh? What did she do?

402
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,920
She finally drove Liu Wei away.

403
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,920
Now she's back as the lady of the Qin family.

404
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,320
That was inevitable.

405
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,000
How could a mistress possibly succeed?

406
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
That's how it always plays out in TV dramas, right?

407
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,860
They never end well. Don't worry.

408
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,400
Liu Wei shot herself in the foot.

409
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,700
Not only did she hurt Wan Xinxin, she tricked me too.

410
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,570
And now look what happened.

411
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,680
She's the one who got eliminated first.

412
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,140
She got what she deserved. Serves her right.

413
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,120
I curse her.

414
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,500
I'll draw circles for you.

415
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,120
I'm angry. Be serious.

416
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,160
Don't be angry.

417
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,800
Anger harms both mind and body.

418
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,920
Besides, it's not worth getting angry over someone like her.

419
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,000
She's gone back to America anyway.

420
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
Out of sight, out of mind, right?

421
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,930
When did she go back to America?

422
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,760
Wan Xinxin said she left many days ago.

423
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,880
But she responded to the lawyer's letter the day before yesterday.

424
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,480
Said she refuses mediation.

425
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,000
What?

426
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,840
She... she hasn't left?

427
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,000
Of course not.

428
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,440
Oh no.

429
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,560
Why is it so dark in the magazine office?

430
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,170
What do you want?

431
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,040
I'm...

432
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,560
I'm looking for Editor Liu.

433
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,300
Editor Liu isn't here.

434
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,780
Let me just take a look.

435
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,160
I told you she's not here.

436
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,370
You can tell me what it's about.

437
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,580
I'm her secretary.

438
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,320
I can't discuss it with you.

439
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,400
Fine, if you can't talk to me.

440
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,640
Then please leave.

441
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,760
Wait, miss.

442
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,440
Well, it's like this.

443
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,760
You see...

444
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
I want to propose to her.

445
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,880
Propose?

446
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,460
Don't speak so loudly.

447
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,800
Keep your voice down.

448
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,520
The thing is, she's my goddess.

449
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,600
Goddess?

450
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,080
Yes.

451
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,560
When I found out she was going to America...

452
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,000
My heart was completely shattered.

453
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,000
I just...

454
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,880
I only want to find her today.

455
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,600
I want to confess my feelings and propose to her.

456
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,800
Please help me.

457
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,640
I really feel sorry for you.

458
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,920
But...

459
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,280
I'll tell you a secret.

460
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,610
She didn't actually go to America.

461
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,420
She's on vacation at home.

462
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
She told us not to tell anyone.

463
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,200
Shh, don't tell anyone.

464
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,250
She really is your goddess.

465
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
She's my goddess.

466
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Crazy.

467
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,800
Goddess.

468
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,720
Is that for real?

469
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
She didn't leave.

470
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,720
Let me tell you.

471
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,120
To verify this,

472
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,440
I went to her company and asked around.

473
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,640
It's true.

474
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,760
Tell me, Ming.

475
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,840
Why would Liu Wei lie?

476
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
Why would she lie?

477
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,090
It can't be to help Xinxin and Qin Gang, can it?

478
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,280
She said she's returning to America

479
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,320
so Wan Xinxin would have fewer obstacles.

480
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,050
Impossible.

481
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,160
She said she was going back to America but didn't leave.

482
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,140
There must be something big going on.

483
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,120
Wan Xinxin isn't here. What's your problem now?

484
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,260
I want to hear some truth from you.

485
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,840
Truth or dare, huh?

486
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,700
No need for dares. Just the truth.

487
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,540
Do you love her?

488
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,960
Yes.

489
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,360
Did you bring her back this time to remarry her?

490
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,480
Yes.

491
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,360
Don't do such despicable things.

492
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,680
Is this fair to her?

493
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,600
I treat her well.

494
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,290
Then what about Liu Wei?

495
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,080
Liu Wei went back to America.

496
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,640
Be honest. Can you act like a man?

497
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,200
You came here to make trouble, didn't you?

498
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,860
Why are you hurting her again?

499
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,560
Why are you seeing Liu Wei behind her back?

500
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,200
Why?

501
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,580
What makes you think I'm with Liu Wei?

502
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,290
Where are your witnesses? Your evidence?

503
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,900
Sometimes in life,

504
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,440
you don't need evidence.

505
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,560
Just speak with your conscience.

506
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
You know better than anyone.

507
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,720
Listen, Hua Ming, don't push your luck.

508
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,840
Who do you think you are?

509
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,600
Always interfering in my life.

510
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,520
If it weren't for the fact

511
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,720
that you've been helping Wan Xinxin,

512
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,250
you'd be nothing in my eyes.

513
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,690
I'll tell you the truth.

514
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,440
I am with Liu Wei.

515
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,920
I want to be with her,

516
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,160
and Wan Xinxin is still willing to follow me devotedly.

517
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,000
I have that charm and ability.

518
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,240
Can you do that?

519
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,320
This is Qin Gang's house.

520
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,090
This is Liu Wei's house.

521
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,040
This area has places they frequently visit,

522
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,520
like shops and cafes.

523
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Just find a spot in between,

524
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,120
suitable for taking action.

525
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,860
Take photos when you see them.

526
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,330
Understand?

527
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,219
How's it going?

528
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,520
This one.

529
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,520
This one.

530
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,920
How about this one? Look.

531
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,199
No, you hit me.

532
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,400
What kind of photos did you take?

533
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,760
I asked you to take frontal shots,

534
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,199
but you took side and back views. How can we use these?

535
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,530
Brother, you think this is a photo studio?

536
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,200
Where I can stage photos?

537
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,260
I might as well take photos right in their faces, right?

538
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,680
I was almost caught.

539
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,320
What do you think I'm doing here?

540
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,400
I'm a private detective.

541
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,660
You haven't even paid me yet. Seriously.

542
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,040
Stop talking nonsense. Here's what you do:

543
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,000
pick a few clearer photos,

544
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,460
develop them, and I'll go confront Qin Gang.

545
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,010
Choose some.

546
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,120
I know.

547
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,180
Don't you think I know what I shot?

548
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
This one works.

549
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,530
This one's good too.

550
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
Explain yourself.

551
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,860
What do you have to say?

552
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,800
You've got it all on camera. What's left to explain?

553
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
Tell Xinxin the truth. Make it clear to her.

554
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,520
Does it have to be this way?

555
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,250
Absolutely.

556
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,320
Fine. Then come with me,

557
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,450
and we'll take her away too.

558
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,480
Okay.

559
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,440
Mom, Xinxin.

560
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,380
Dr. Hua is here.

561
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,080
Auntie.

562
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,570
Why are you here?

563
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,930
It's quite unusual to see these two together.

564
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,850
Do we really have to do this?

565
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,120
Speak.

566
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,320
Now.

567
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,280
Now.

568
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,640
I invited Dr. Hua here.

569
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,960
I just want to confirm with both of you

570
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,400
how shameless Dr. Hua is.

571
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,760
Why don't you open it and see your own shameless deeds?

572
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,960
Go ahead and look.

573
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,420
I have nothing to hide.

574
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,800
What is it?

575
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,320
Isn't this Liu Wei?

576
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,400
Yes. Liu Wei never left.

577
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,600
Dr. Hua,

578
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,560
you're fabricating evidence

579
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,560
to ruin my relationship with Xinxin.

580
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,480
But I admit,

581
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,040
Ms. Qian does look very similar to Liu Wei.

582
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,170
What are you saying?

583
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,560
Hua Ming, you...

584
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,320
How could you do this?

585
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,200
Using such methods.

586
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,920
Do you think

587
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,040
my son and our Xinxin

588
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,400
are too happy together?

589
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,880
Auntie, please, don't get upset.

590
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,160
Hua Ming.

591
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,680
No.

592
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,240
I've known all along that you and Xu Ke were up to something.

593
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
You're despicable.

594
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,320
I'm despicable? You take photos of me and I'm the despicable one?

595
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,520
Huaming, I won't allow you

596
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,720
to use this method to destroy

597
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,120
our family's happiness.

598
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
Everything I said is true.

599
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,080
Liu Wei and Qin Gang never left.

600
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,800
Huaming, can you please tell the truth?

601
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,600
Huaming, I'm asking you not to

602
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,120
talk nonsense in my home.

603
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,280
I'm not talking nonsense.

604
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,440
Liu Wei never left at all.

605
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,120
This is my house. I don't care who left or not.

606
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,440
I'm asking you to leave now. Please go.

607
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,360
Auntie, calm down.

608
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,200
Take it easy.

609
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,320
You should go now. We'll talk about this another day.

610
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,960
Xinxin.

611
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,900
I know I did something stupid.

612
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,320
But I can't let Qin Gang deceive you.

613
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,520
Come with me.

614
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,600
Huaming, what are you doing?

615
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,060
Xinxin.

616
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Huaming, what are you doing?

617
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:29,920
Xinxin.

618
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,480
What's going on here?

619
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,600
Mom!

620
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,040
Auntie!

621
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,280
Mom, what's wrong?

622
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:34,720
Mom!

623
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,400
Auntie!

624
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,160
Mom!

625
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,080
Take it easy.

626
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,600
Does she have a history of heart disease?

627
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,000
My mother has high blood pressure with complications.

628
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,680
She must have medication. Go get it.

629
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,160
Okay.

630
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,640
It's in the drawer of the bedside table upstairs.

631
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,960
Don't worry, Auntie. It's going to be fine.

632
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,600
Auntie.

633
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,440
It's okay. Just regulate your breathing.

634
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,970
Xinxin, call an ambulance.

635
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,400
Doctor.

636
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,930
How is my mother?

637
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,760
She's fine. She's past the danger zone now.

638
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,920
What were you thinking?

639
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,600
The patient has a history of hypertension.

640
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,460
How could you let her get so upset?

641
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,360
Someone could have died.

642
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,520
Thank you.

643
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,680
Let me tell you.

644
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,280
Qin Gang.

645
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,480
Huaming, if anything happens

646
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,000
to my mother,

647
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,480
I won't let you off the hook.

648
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,160
Qin Gang.

649
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,220
What are you doing?

650
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,940
I want to go in and apologize to your aunt.

651
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,520
If she sees you now,

652
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,450
she'll definitely get more upset.

653
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,080
Xinxin, I know when I was at Qin Gang's house,

654
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,210
I got too emotional.

655
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,400
But you have to believe me,

656
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,200
I wasn't lying. I told the truth.

657
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,920
Really.

658
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,080
Qin Gang is setting a trap for you.

659
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,800
Stop talking, Hua Ming.

660
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,520
None of this matters anymore.

661
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,400
What's the point of saying all this now?

662
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
Auntie isn't well right now.

663
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,080
If anything happens to her,

664
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,340
I'll blame myself for the rest of my life.

665
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
No matter what happens between me and Qin Gang,

666
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,450
auntie is innocent in all this.

667
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,600
I can't let her

668
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,660
suffer any more emotional distress.

669
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,960
Also,

670
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,890
since I've returned to the Qin family,

671
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,010
I'll face whatever consequences come my way.

672
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,020
Didn't you say you wanted what's best for me?

673
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,240
Then don't come looking for me anymore.

674
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,400
That's enough.

675
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,640
Bro, stop drinking.

676
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,200
You're scaring me like this.

677
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,330
I'll stop drinking.

678
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,000
Didn't you say that we

679
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
took those photos

680
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,560
for her own good?

681
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,280
Yes.

682
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,000
If it was for her own good, why is she acting like this?

683
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,160
It's fine if she's not grateful,

684
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,890
but why does she say she won't see us anymore? Why?

685
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,930
I don't know.

686
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,960
What do you mean you don't know?

687
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,120
Was it for her own good?

688
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,760
What we did, was it for her own good?

689
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,480
Yes.

690
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,440
Then why is she acting like this?

691
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,560
She's in the dark.

692
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,360
Even if she's in the dark, she should know

693
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,640
that we did this for her own good.

694
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,720
I really underestimated Qin Gang.

695
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,120
I'm done with her.

696
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,360
I'm telling you, I'm done with Wan Xinxin.

697
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,760
I'm done with her.

698
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,820
I'm absolutely done with her.

699
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,800
I can't not care about her.

700
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,200
I must take care of her, understand?

701
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,040
I understand.

702
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,640
Mom, that was a close call today.

703
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,440
Yes, we were terrified.

704
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,840
Thankfully nothing serious happened.

705
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,320
You should all go rest now.

706
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,400
I'm fine.

707
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,800
Get some rest.

708
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,540
Would you like some water?

709
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,780
Just leave it there. I'll drink it myself later.

710
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,000
I'll put it here then.

711
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,360
Okay.

712
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,440
Go on, go get some rest.

713
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,560
Is that Hua Ming?
