National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,680
Wishing Tree

3
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,020
People say you can make wishes come true.

4
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,080
I made a wish here last time.

5
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,169
If I could start over again,

6
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,860
I wouldn't avoid her anymore.

7
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
But Xinxin is gone.

8
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,840
Can you tell me where Wan Xinxin is?

9
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,180
I'll come back to fulfill my promise.

10
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,370
This tree is full of blessings.

11
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,880
Please give me one blessing.

12
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Thankfully I have you.

13
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,000
Where are you?

14
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
Wan Xinxin, where are you?

15
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,680
Wan Xinxin.

16
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,160
Thankfully I have you.

17
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
Wan Xinxin,

18
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,600
where did you go?

19
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,160
The transparent mirror

20
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,160
shouldn't shatter all over the ground.

21
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,480
Wan Xinxin, where are you?

22
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,920
I can't live without you.

23
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,160
Can I hold on tight

24
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,079
so this beautiful scenery doesn't lose its meaning?

25
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,680
I can't be without you.

26
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,760
Who's breathing so loudly?

27
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,680
Because of you,

28
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,440
memories exist.

29
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,320
Wan Xinxin, where are you?

30
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,200
Thankfully I have you.

31
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
Where are you?

32
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,720
The lonely shadow

33
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,880
responds to fragile nerves.

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,480
Thankfully I have you.

35
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Where did you go?

36
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
The transparent mirror

37
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,120
shouldn't shatter all over the ground.

38
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,840
I can't be without you.

39
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,240
Can I hold on tight?

40
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:45,240
Don't let this beautiful scenery lose its meaning.

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,720
I can't be without you.

42
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,600
Who's breathing so loudly?

43
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,760
Because of you,

44
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,160
memories exist.

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,720
If indulgence is a kind of relief,

46
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,200
only later, again and again,

47
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,400
am I stung by old and new wounds.

48
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,920
I can't be without you.

49
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,840
Can I hold on tight?

50
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,440
Such beautiful scenery

51
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,960
Why didn't you say it earlier?

52
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,240
shouldn't lose its meaning.

53
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,640
I can't be without you.

54
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,159
Who's breathing so loudly?

55
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,960
If everything could start over,

56
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,460
I wouldn't avoid her anymore.

57
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,880
Can you give me a blessing?

58
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,320
Because of you,

59
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,560
life has meaning.

60
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Boss, if you choose this car model,

61
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,280
that would be absolutely the right decision.

62
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,440
Look at this car model.

63
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,880
Whether as a family vehicle

64
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,010
or for business use,

65
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,920
it works perfectly for both.

66
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,120
It's definitely high-end and luxurious.

67
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,840
You see, your girlfriend is quite tall,

68
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,880
but our space is more than adequate.

69
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,080
V6 engine

70
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,040
with 3.0 supercharger.

71
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,620
Why don't you give it a try?

72
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,780
Try it out. Come on.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,720
Lao Jiang.

74
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,840
Lao Jiang.

75
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,280
Is Qin Gang here?

76
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,400
He's inside.

77
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,840
Have you found Xinxin?

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,600
Dr. Hua.

79
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,160
We found her.

80
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Are you even a man?

81
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,050
I am a man. What about it?

82
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,580
Let me tell you.

83
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,040
I hit you but I want to slap myself.

84
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
I was such a fool. I persuaded Wan Xinxin to come back.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,400
Trusting a liar like you.

86
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,320
Listen carefully, Qin Gang.

87
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,400
In 24 hours,

88
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,440
if Wan Xinxin isn't found, call the police.

89
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,160
One group of police will search for her,

90
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,240
and another group will be called here.

91
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,370
Because I'll be back to beat you again.

92
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,800
Fair enough.

93
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,520
Well...

94
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,520
Mr. Qin.

95
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,320
Mr. Qin.

96
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,440
Mr. Qin.

97
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,720
Mr. Qin, are you okay?

98
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
Should we call an ambulance?

99
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,440
Get out!

100
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,640
Yes, I mean you.

101
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,480
You've always told me since I was little

102
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,680
that girls don't need to learn anything

103
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,160
except how to be kind.

104
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,160
You said you would stay by my side

105
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
until I grew up.

106
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,760
But you lied to me.

107
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,180
Qin Gang lied to me too.

108
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,600
And now even Hua Ming is lying to me.

109
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
How could I be so stupid?

110
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,600
I'm homeless now.

111
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,240
No one wants me anymore.

112
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
When you left,

113
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
you should have taken me with you.

114
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,810
That would have ended everything.

115
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,690
What do you mean by ending everything?

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
What about your brother if you were gone?

117
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,140
Why are you looking for me? I don't need you to care about me.

118
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,760
Big seagull,

119
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,440
come see what's really happening here.

120
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,730
I hate seagulls.

121
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,160
Then I'll be a crow.

122
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,170
Wan Xinxin, what are you doing?

123
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,090
What are you looking at?

124
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,240
Don't think you can laugh at me. I'm doing fine.

125
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm enjoying the view here. Can't you see?

126
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,980
Enjoying the view?

127
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,240
What view are you looking at? Describe it to me.

128
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
Why should I tell you?

129
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,290
You can't describe it, can you?

130
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,210
I hit the nail on the head, didn't I?

131
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,520
Wan Xinxin.

132
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,080
Have you ever thought about something?

133
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,720
Why when we were children,

134
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,960
adults made us memorize Tang and Song poetry?

135
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,640
And then in college,

136
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,720
we still have to study classical Chinese literature?

137
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,880
It's so that when we encounter

138
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,760
such beautiful scenery,

139
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,640
we don't just blurt out things like,

140
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,800
'Wow, that looks awesome'

141
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
such simple exclamations.

142
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,400
These expressions should have depth.

143
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,720
For example,

144
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
Oh, the sea!

145
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,520
You're just like a bowl of spinach soup,

146
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,200
so salty and emerald green.

147
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,800
Your smile is so beautiful.

148
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,320
You're so annoying.

149
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,640
Let's go home.

150
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,620
I don't have a home now.

151
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,240
My place is your home.

152
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,680
Didn't you kick me out?

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,280
Well, now I'm

154
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,320
begging you to come back.

155
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,200
Come on.

156
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,000
Xinxin,

157
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,040
where have you been? We've been worried sick.

158
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,560
I'm fine, ma'am.

159
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm here to pick up my son.

160
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,400
Xinxin.

161
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Listen to me.

162
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,640
Let go of me.

163
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,960
No, Xinxin.

164
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,720
You can't take Xiaobao away.

165
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,480
Xinxin.

166
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,890
You've achieved your goal.

167
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,200
Sorry I couldn't help you achieve your goal.

168
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,280
Why must you be my enemy?

169
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
Why must you lie to Xinxin?

170
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,160
This is between husband and wife.

171
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,890
What does it have to do with you?

172
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,120
Xinxin.

173
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,520
He is my son.

174
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,660
You don't have that right.

175
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,960
Why don't I?

176
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,120
I don't want my son

177
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,440
to become a big liar.

178
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Wan Xinxin.

179
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,440
You can leave.

180
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,460
But leave my grandson with me.

181
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,800
Auntie.

182
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,720
I'm sorry, but I have to take my child with me.

183
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,320
I know you've been good to me.

184
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,970
Please take good care of yourself.

185
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,640
You can come see him anytime you miss him.

186
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,760
Mom.

187
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
Do you believe that I always had a feeling?

188
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,840
You and Qin Gang could never get back together.

189
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,700
Am I asking for a slap saying this?

190
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,840
You've always been asking for it.

191
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,170
As long as you're happy.

192
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,580
As long as little one is happy.

193
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,900
Then I'm happy too.

194
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,000
You know what, old man?

195
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,080
Actually, when I first got together with Qin Gang,

196
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,380
I was just trying to spite you.

197
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,720
But later,

198
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,840
you kept pushing me away.

199
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,240
I watched my son grow day by day,

200
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
looking more and more like Qin Gang.

201
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,260
I didn't want him to grow up without a father.

202
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,880
So I thought,

203
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,680
I'll just sacrifice myself.

204
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,740
After all, marriage is just a formality.

205
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Actually,

206
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,250
this is for the best.

207
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,170
Think about it - if you had remarried and then discovered the truth,

208
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,440
you would have been hurt all over again.

209
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,260
That would break my heart.

210
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm actually not that sad.

211
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,760
Really.

212
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,600
I feel...

213
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,660
I suddenly feel relieved.

214
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,440
I think all of this

215
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,640
was deliberately arranged by fate.

216
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,360
I feel like all of this

217
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,290
was something we had to go through.

218
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,080
As if I needed to go through these hardships

219
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,040
before I could return to you,

220
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,320
so we could learn to cherish each other.

221
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,960
But thankfully, it's all over now.

222
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,650
From tomorrow, everything will be new again.

223
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,280
I'm starting a fresh life.

224
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,860
But there's one thing I still don't understand.

225
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,040
If Qin Gang was still with Liu Wei,

226
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,240
why did he want to remarry me?

227
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,720
Why did he want me

228
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,120
to move back with our son?

229
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,760
Probably to fight for custody of the child.

230
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,000
Then why couldn't he and Liu Wei

231
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,720
just have another child?

232
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,440
Even if Qin Gang agreed,

233
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,000
his mother wouldn't allow it.

234
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,400
The Qin family is wealthy,

235
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,880
and our son is now the heir to their fortune.

236
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,600
Right?

237
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,260
Never mind.

238
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,340
I don't want to think about the past anymore.

239
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
What makes me happiest

240
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,760
is that I can live with you again.

241
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,560
Stubborn as always.

242
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
You little fool.

243
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,530
What's wrong? I think being a fool is fine.

244
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,359
Do you want to be foolish with me?

245
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,970
No, that won't work.

246
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,760
One fool in a couple is enough.

247
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,440
If we're both fools, who'll take care of our son?

248
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
Big fools all...

249
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,800
I still haven't asked you

250
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,480
about that fight you got into.

251
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,730
What fight? Come on, who was fighting?

252
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,520
There's a fundamental difference.

253
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,119
That conflict happened when

254
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,800
Xu Ke and I had just entered the bar.

255
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,530
I suddenly noticed two big guys

256
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,200
staring at us with hostile looks.

257
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,460
I kept an eye on them but didn't tell Xu Ke.

258
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,520
And then think about it,

259
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,880
we were just sitting there having a drink.

260
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,040
Although I'm quite handsome myself,

261
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,560
when two young ladies sat on our laps,

262
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,400
I knew someone was setting us up.

263
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,120
Besides, I didn't start it.

264
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,920
He pushed me twice.

265
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,720
I only hit back because I couldn't take it anymore.

266
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,290
Well, Xu Ke didn't see that.

267
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
As they say, birds of a feather

268
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,600
flock together.

269
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,460
He and your bestie are both fools.

270
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,520
Wait, so you did hit Qin Gang?

271
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
Qin Gang?

272
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,520
Well,

273
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,560
good job.

274
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,120
No, he fell. He fell.

275
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,330
No, this isn't right. I need to change.

276
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
You're something else. Behind my back,

277
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,930
you came here by yourself without telling me.

278
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,200
No, I told you.

279
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,080
People need to constantly challenge themselves.

280
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,130
I wanted to see if I could overcome my fear of heights.

281
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,800
Do you remember when we

282
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,930
made wishes under the big banyan tree?

283
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,220
What did you wish for that day?

284
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,840
What would a materialistic person like me wish for?

285
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,800
You know, prosperity and wealth.

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,520
Really.

287
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,600
I saw that note.

288
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,160
That's impossible. That yellow ribbon?

289
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,280
No way.

290
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,160
That huge tree had so many yellow ribbons.

291
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,000
How could you possibly see it?

292
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,530
I didn't even write my name.

293
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,360
One small oversight.

294
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,840
So does this mean

295
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,400
you won't be avoiding me anymore?

296
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,000
That's so cheesy. Why would I avoid you?

297
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,440
Can you be more sensible?

298
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,240
My little boy is all grown up now.

299
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,420
You should choose when to cry, don't you see?

300
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,520
Our life is full of sunshine.

301
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,330
Good morning, Chef Hua.

302
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,400
Morning, young miss.

303
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,330
So many delicious dishes! What are all these?

304
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,560
I made them for you.

305
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,440
Steamed cabbage, stir-fried cabbage,

306
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,360
fried cabbage, and boiled cabbage.

307
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,400
It's all cabbage.

308
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,800
You're good at naming dishes.

309
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,480
Right.

310
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,000
Here, your favorite.

311
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The base for super spicy and sour beef noodles.

312
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,880
No, it's my new creation.

313
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,080
Try it. Have a taste.

314
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,720
How is it?

315
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:20,880
Good.

316
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,040
What do you think?

317
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,640
It's okay.

318
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,540
You can't be like this.

319
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,000
What do you mean 'okay'? It must be delicious.

320
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,260
I used to think you were

321
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
always cold and quite introverted.

322
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,760
Now I realize you're just

323
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,620
an incredibly reserved man with a hidden wild side.

324
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,000
Your expression is quite inaccurate.

325
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,480
Do you know what I used to be?

326
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,200
Before you and Bao showed up,

327
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,240
I was just a pressure cooker.

328
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,760
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

329
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,840
Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.

330
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,720
It's going to explode!

331
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,200
Okay.

332
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
Don't touch it. Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

333
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
I was just a pressure cooker.

334
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,960
I never had an outlet to

335
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,680
express my youth.

336
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,620
But after you and Bao appeared...

337
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,800
No, I'm your punching bag.

338
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,240
The eggs are burning! The eggs are burning!

339
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,170
What's going on?

340
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,600
Just wait.

341
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,200
Our life is full of sunshine.

342
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,160
No.

343
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,220
What's wrong with you? Who upset you?

344
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
So you finally decided to come back.

345
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,240
You're a grown adult,

346
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,640
why are you running off like that?

347
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,840
And going so far away.

348
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,120
If something happened to you,

349
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,240
what would I do?

350
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,300
So you do care about me.

351
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,280
I thought you only cared about my brother-in-law.

352
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,760
No, I'm an adult. I know what I'm doing.

353
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,280
What do you know?

354
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,120
You were living fine at Qin Gang's place.

355
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,360
Why did you come back?

356
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,210
Don't mention him to me.

357
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,460
What happened?

358
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,320
What happened?

359
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,400
He asked me to come back but had no intention of remarrying me.

360
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,880
I caught him cheating again.

361
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,440
Really?

362
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,960
How can he be such a jerk?

363
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,540
He's just garbage.

364
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,700
I shouldn't have trusted him.

365
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,520
A leopard can't change its spots.

366
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,400
This time I'm truly heartbroken.

367
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,200
My heart is shattered into powder.

368
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,090
I will never forgive him again.

369
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:28,800
I...

370
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,160
You sound pretty casual about it,

371
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,800
not like someone whose heart is shattered into powder.

372
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,960
No, I was just using a metaphor.

373
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,680
That's not a good comparison either.

374
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,320
You're

375
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,120
recovering pretty quickly, aren't you?

376
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,080
Xinxin, come put this underneath.

377
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,920
Spread this out.

378
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,840
Where should I put it?

379
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,600
Here, good.

380
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,200
Sis, stay for dinner later.

381
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,060
You two chat. It'll be ready soon.

382
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,580
Well...

383
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,040
So you

384
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,210
only came back because you found someone new.

385
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,160
Don't talk nonsense, sis.

386
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,440
After how Qin Gang treated me,

387
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,300
what else could I do but come back?

388
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,160
Fine, I won't say anything more.

389
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,960
As long as you're doing well and living a good life,

390
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,840
I'll be at ease.

391
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,680
No, your expression doesn't look like you're at ease.

392
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,640
Who upset you?

393
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,240
Your coming back is one thing,

394
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,780
but will Qin Gang let your brother-in-law off the hook?

395
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,880
Look, my brother-in-law's situation

396
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,200
has nothing to do with me.

397
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,680
These are completely separate issues.

398
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,200
My brother-in-law has been doing great work there,

399
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
generating revenue for several years in a row, right?

400
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
You think Qin Gang cares about that?

401
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,440
He'll definitely make things difficult for him,

402
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,570
maybe even fire him.

403
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
When your brother-in-law gets upset,

404
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,240
he comes home and takes it out on me,

405
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,600
and then I get upset too.

406
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,160
My tooth is starting to hurt again.

407
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,400
Its appearance is grand and elegant.

408
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Alright, stop talking. I'll see for myself.

409
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,040
Not 3.0, it's 3.0. I'll check myself.

410
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,760
It's V6, I'll look at it myself.

411
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,890
What's the problem?

412
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,960
Mr. Qin.

413
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,220
Take some time off.

414
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,320
It's not National Day today.

415
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,960
It's not even Labor Day.

416
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
Did I do something wrong? Did I make a mistake?

417
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,480
You didn't.

418
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,800
I was wrong.

419
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
I owe you all. Happy now?

420
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,240
Please don't.

421
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,840
I understand.

422
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,400
Did you have another fight with Xinxin?

423
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,660
It's okay. All couples fight sometimes.

424
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,320
Let me give you an example.

425
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,680
This thing is just like stir-frying.

426
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,340
The spoon always hits the wok.

427
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,640
Well, that would be making soup, right?

428
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,480
Yes, sometimes marriage is like making soup.

429
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,720
You need a gentle flame, take it slow.

430
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,120
And look at our

431
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,160
store, it's developing so well now.

432
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,840
This is all thanks to your wise leadership

433
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,000
and all our employees'

434
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,400
hard work. They're inseparable.

435
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,560
We need to consider the bigger picture.

436
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,160
Don't talk to me about the bigger picture right now.

437
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,960
I need to take care of myself now.

438
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,880
Go convince Wan Xinxin to come back to me immediately.

439
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,120
If you can't convince her,

440
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,520
then you can stay on holiday indefinitely.

441
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,200
So willful!

442
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,940
What does it have to do with me?

443
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,930
Just a dime's worth anyway.

444
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,960
Mom, have some ginseng soup.

445
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,840
I've taken my medicine. I don't want any.

446
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,530
Mom, you're crying.

447
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
What good does crying do?

448
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,800
Even if I cry myself blind, what's the point?

449
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,480
Even if I cry myself to death,

450
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,320
can I bring my grandson back?

451
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,480
Please calm down.

452
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,180
I'll think of another way.

453
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,120
Xiaogang, tell me the truth.

454
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,600
Are you still seeing that Liu Wei?

455
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,720
What are you trying to do?

456
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,140
What exactly are you trying to do?

457
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,840
I really didn't remember what you told me before.

458
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,100
I was still seeing Liu Wei.

459
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,400
But I swear now,

460
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,600
from now on, I won't see Liu Wei anymore.

461
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,840
It's over between us.

462
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,440
You don't need to swear to me.

463
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,120
Xiaogang, whatever you tell me now,

464
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,360
I can't believe it anymore.

465
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,800
When you were little,

466
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,440
I had to work hard to make money.

467
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,800
I didn't give you enough attention.

468
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,720
I truly feel guilty about that.

469
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,320
But no matter what,

470
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,920
I never forgot

471
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,400
to remind you

472
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,840
how to be a good person.

473
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,520
But look at yourself now,

474
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,960
what have you done?

475
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,960
I feel like I don't even know you anymore.

476
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,920
Mom,

477
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,160
I really did wrong by Wan Xinxin in this matter.

478
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,320
But I don't love her.

479
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,650
I really don't love her.

480
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,360
Fine, you don't have to love Wan Xinxin.

481
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,090
But what about your son?

482
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,360
Don't you even love

483
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,560
your own son?

484
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,160
Xiaobao is living with Xinxin.

485
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,490
Isn't that good enough?

486
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,160
What do I need to say for you to understand?

487
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,080
Your son will grow up day by day.

488
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,720
By the time you realize it, it will be too late.

489
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,920
When you want to make up for it then,

490
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,120
it will be too late. Do you understand?

491
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,040
Mom,

492
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,680
you...

493
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,140
Don't call me mom. Stop it.

494
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,640
Mom.

495
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,440
You're back. No social obligations today?

496
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,500
What obligations?

497
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,560
Where else would I go if not home?

498
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,320
What? You want to kick me out?

499
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,200
I was just asking.

500
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,320
Don't take your anger out on me.

501
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,080
If not you, then who?

502
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,040
That sister of yours.

503
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,280
I had such a promising future.

504
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,320
I was just one step away from becoming the manager.

505
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,880
Ruined.

506
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,360
Because of her, my career is destroyed.

507
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
She is her and I am me.

508
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
It's all the same.

509
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,320
You got that job at Qin Gang's place.

510
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,050
Wasn't that because of Xinxin?

511
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,740
I put in a good word for you too.

512
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,800
Isn't that what you should do, Xu Chunli?

513
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,520
Shouldn't you contribute something to this family?

514
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,200
Let me tell you, Xu Chunli.

515
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
If I get fired,

516
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,720
our family will have no income at all.

517
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,220
What are you implying?

518
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,880
You want our Xiaoxiao to have no tuition money?

519
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,940
You want her to drop out of school? Is that it?

520
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,280
Xinxin has her difficulties too.

521
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,240
I can't push her into a fire pit.

522
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,080
Fire pit? What fire pit?

523
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,440
Let me tell you, even if it is a fire pit,

524
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,160
it's one that burns with money.

525
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,720
Why can't I, Jiang Kaiyang, find such a fire pit?

526
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,880
If I found one, I wouldn't need anyone else.

527
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,520
I'd jump in myself.

528
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,360
Let it burn, burn hard, burn me to death.

529
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,520
Hurry up and convince her to go back.

530
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,240
I can't convince her.

531
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,640
Xu Chunli, let's break up then.

532
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,840
What do you mean?

533
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,240
Are you having dinner or not?

534
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,130
If you're not eating, fine. I won't cook anymore.

535
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,860
Have some lemon water.

536
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,920
Thank you.

537
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,060
Why did you suddenly want to paint again?

538
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I just suddenly felt like painting.

539
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,570
You know, when I was little,

540
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,880
whenever I felt upset,

541
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,200
I really wanted to paint.

542
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,260
When did you start learning to paint?

543
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
When I was little.

544
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,600
My dad was raising me then.

545
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,170
Back then, other kids always asked me,

546
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,010
why don't you have a mom?

547
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And that made me really angry,

548
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,280
so I would fight with them.

549
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,960
I started with the boys,

550
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,480
then eventually fought the girls too.

551
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,450
In the end, I'd fight anyone who asked me about it.

552
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,600
Please don't pass that trait to our baby.

553
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,660
Now I know why you always pull my hair.

554
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,980
When have I ever pulled your hair?

555
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,180
You're so violent.

556
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,800
Anyway, I was really tough when I was little.

557
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,760
I couldn't stand being bullied.

558
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,800
Later, guess what happened?

559
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
I suddenly realized

560
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,360
there was no one around. No kids would play with me anymore.

561
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,090
So I started playing by myself,

562
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,180
writing and drawing on my own.

563
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,840
Believe it or not, I found more and more inspiration

564
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,600
and my paintings got really good.

565
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,730
Later my dad even sent me to art school.

566
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,800
You really are talented.

567
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,880
If you became a designer,

568
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,680
you'd definitely be a great one.

569
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,680
Come on, don't flatter me.

570
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,330
I'll get conceited.

571
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,920
No need to be conceited. Look how well you paint.

572
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
No, I haven't drawn a single stroke.

573
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,780
You're kidding me.

574
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,360
Isn't this a snow scene?

575
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,840
All white, with these shades of light and dark,

576
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,760
these angles and these lines.

577
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,940
You're just trying to cheer me up.

578
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,600
You're so worried when you're unhappy.

579
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,060
But that doesn't solve the real problem.

580
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Listen to me. Here, have some water.

581
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,600
I'll take you out tomorrow to clear your mind.

582
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,200
Really?

583
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,560
Really.

584
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,080
Really?

585
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,320
That's great!

586
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Come here.

587
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Mommy is a little crazy.

588
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,400
It fell down.

589
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,680
Okay, we're done playing.

590
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,410
Give it to me.

591
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm so thirsty.

592
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,200
This place...

593
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,440
This place is really wonderful.

594
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,300
We can do this kind of activity more often in the future.

595
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,500
Come often? I don't have that much free time.

596
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,250
Wan Xinxin, I really need to find a job.

597
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,260
I've been idle for months.

598
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,330
If I continue like this,

599
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,720
I'll end up drinking spinach soup made with seawater.

600
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,680
Aren't you going to be a doctor anymore?

601
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,200
Don't eat that one.

602
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,000
This one is really sweet. Try it.

603
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,900
Don't change the subject.

604
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,160
No, there's a story.

605
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,400
A love story.

606
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,360
Well, I'm really nosy.

607
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,200
Tell me about it.

608
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,080
Satisfy my gossip cravings.

609
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,720
Try it. This one is really sweet.

610
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,400
I'm not lying to you.

611
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
You got dumped by a nurse.

612
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,800
Didn't we just agree

613
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,660
to build a sand sculpture and take a photo together?

614
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,660
Who said anything about building sand sculptures and taking photos?

615
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,520
You did.

616
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,720
That's for children.

617
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,720
I'm not doing it.

618
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,760
No, you are a child. Come on.

619
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,620
I don't want to.

620
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,520
And the door to happiness opened wide.

621
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,780
The prince and princess lived

622
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,130
happily ever after.

623
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,060
Can you talk normally?

624
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,820
Finally finished.

625
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,280
That wasn't easy.

626
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,320
No, I need to take a photo for social media.

627
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,880
Okay.

628
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm not taking a photo of you. Move aside.

629
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,280
This isn't a mermaid.

630
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,480
Come on, take a photo.

631
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Get out of the way.

632
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,679
No, it is a mermaid.

633
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,659
Don't block it. You're blocking the whole wall.

634
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,199
Let me tell you, Wan Xinxin.

635
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,639
I'm really getting annoyed now.

636
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,960
Whenever I see the ocean and rocks

637
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,920
I think of you.

638
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,679
Really, look at the mermaid.

639
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,480
You're drunk.

640
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,300
A mermaid, huh?

641
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,880
Mermaid.

642
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,780
Wan Xinxin.

643
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,360
Could you show your affection for me

644
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,960
in a different way next time?

645
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,290
A different way?

646
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:54,960
Sure.

647
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,040
So many people are watching. What are you doing?

648
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,200
Move aside so I can take a photo. So annoying.

649
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,800
You can't get everything in the frame like that.

650
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,040
I need to be higher. Come, get on.

651
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,600
Get on.

652
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,820
Don't move.

653
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,400
Ready?

654
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,700
Stretch out your hand.

655
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,640
Stop messing around.

656
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,280
Hurry up.

657
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,940
Don't move.

658
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,840
Good.

659
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,520
Stop.

660
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,200
Try a different way.

661
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:20,760
Is it high enough?

662
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,620
Move back a bit.

663
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,600
No, it's not high enough.

664
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,880
This isn't working.

665
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,290
Nothing is impossible for your Uncle Hua.

666
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,800
Wait, don't move.

667
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,320
Don't move.

668
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,360
Hurry up.

669
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,920
One more.

670
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,650
Hurry up. My back is killing me.

671
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,400
Why don't you want to be a doctor?

672
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,210
I told you. I just don't want to be a doctor.

673
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,890
There must be a story behind it.

674
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,560
Otherwise, let's

675
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,800
finish what we didn't

676
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,980
complete yesterday, right here.

677
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
I'm afraid of you.

678
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,360
Environment.

679
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,140
Environment, stop it.

680
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,920
I'm going to eat you up.

681
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,720
Wait a minute.

682
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,840
Phone.

683
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,640
The phone is ringing.

684
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,680
The phone is ringing.

685
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,540
Just ignore it.

686
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,720
No, no. What do you mean ignore it?

687
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,400
Don't.

688
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,040
It's Xu Ke.

689
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,080
Your bestie.

690
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,170
Don't answer it.

691
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,400
Hello.

692
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,880
What's up?

693
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
Where are you?

694
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,960
I'm busy.

695
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,360
I'm in the middle of something. Just tell me what you need over the phone.

696
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,280
Come see me.

697
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,960
No, just tell me over the phone.

698
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,620
Something serious happened.

699
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,600
I'm telling you, if you don't come

700
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,560
to see me within 30 minutes,

701
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,020
you'll never see me again.

702
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,800
Are you serious?

703
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,700
Fine, I'll be right there.

704
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,800
What's wrong?

705
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,170
It's Xu Ke. He's acting strange today.

706
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,640
I should go check on him.

707
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,720
Then you go ahead.

708
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,440
What about Bao?

709
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,200
I'll take Bao back with me.

710
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,760
I'll take photos of all these pictures

711
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,290
and send them to your phone.

712
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'm leaving then.

713
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:25,970
Go ahead.

714
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,360
Environment.

715
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,520
Be careful on your way.

716
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,450
I'll be waiting.

717
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,760
Huahua, what's wrong?

718
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,880
My lady, I have cancer.

719
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,650
What kind of cancer?

720
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,440
Lovesickness. Terminal stage.

721
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,360
You're crazy!

722
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,960
Why don't you just die?

723
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,480
Someone's coming!

724
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,040
After you die, angels will love you on my behalf.

725
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,760
Oh my god!

726
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,240
You...

727
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,440
Sit down.

728
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,120
I really have something important.

729
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
That's the thing.

730
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,800
Do you know that this phone call

731
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,120
almost made me miss

732
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
my chance at happiness?

733
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,920
No, my lady.

734
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,780
My door to happiness is completely blocked now.

735
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
How is it blocked?

736
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,850
It's about me and Shi Lu.

737
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,440
Okay.

738
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,860
You have five minutes. Talk fast.

739
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,890
The relationship between me and Shi Lu

740
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,640
has just... just stalled.

741
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,560
It's like a cold train

742
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,120
stopped on the tracks,

743
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,440
missing a driver.

744
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Now we need to get the engine running

745
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,530
to make it

746
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,920
move forward.

747
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,200
Wait, what's the current

748
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,730
situation between you two?

749
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,400
Right now,

750
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,330
we see each other at work every day,

751
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,200
but whenever others are around, she treats me like I'm invisible.

752
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,260
I understand that.

753
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,200
But after work,

754
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,600
she accepts when I invite her to dinner,

755
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,480
she agrees when I offer to go shopping with her.

756
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,000
When we're free,

757
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,880
she asks me to help her relax and stuff,

758
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,080
it's all pretty good.

759
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,120
But when I try to take a step forward,

760
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,610
I feel like there's a firewall around her,

761
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,360
and I can't get through.

762
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,880
When you two are together,

763
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,000
do you ever feel

764
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,730
that heart-pounding excitement?

765
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
That heart-pounding feeling is when

766
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,680
two hearts

767
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,200
suddenly, for a moment,

768
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,660
come very close together,

769
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,000
and then whoosh! There's a spark like lightning.

770
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,560
Okay.

771
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,480
It's that whoosh moment.

772
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,320
I do! I do!

773
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,200
But I don't know if she feels it too.

774
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,600
And I'm afraid of pushing too hard.

775
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,770
That whoosh might turn into a boom,

776
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,300
exploding into a fireball, you know?

777
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,250
Don't laugh.

778
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,240
How about this?

779
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,200
I'll propose to her.

780
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,320
Propose?

781
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,640
Yes.

782
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Red roses, diamond ring, a romantic proposal...

783
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,160
Are you sure that's what she wants?

784
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,280
What if she rejects you in public?

785
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,360
Wouldn't that be embarrassing?

786
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,520
Then what should I do?

787
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,200
You need to see if she gets jealous over you.

788
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,760
You mean I should find someone to test her?

789
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,920
Of course.

790
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,600
If she doesn't get jealous,

791
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,480
then you won't have to face any embarrassment, right?

792
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,080
Then I need to find someone.

793
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,970
Don't look at me. It's impossible.

794
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,880
Time waits for no one.

795
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,480
I'm already washed up.

796
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,040
You should find someone born after 2000.

797
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,120
The more impossible it seems, the more surprising it will be.

798
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,680
So it's decided then.

799
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,280
Wait, how is this decided?

800
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,130
I'll buy you breakfast for a month.

801
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,760
Jianbing.

802
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,280
Is that all I'm worth?

803
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,960
At least add two eggs.

804
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,920
Add a three.

805
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,240
Done.

806
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,180
Thanks.

807
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,320
If there's nothing else, let's adjourn.

808
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,450
Meeting adjourned.

809
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,120
Let's go.

810
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,880
Mr. Shi, I have something to announce to you.

811
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,250
I mean, I wanted to tell you something.

812
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,080
Um...

813
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,520
Honey.

814
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,810
Darling, what brings you here?

815
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,520
Did you forget?

816
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,600
We agreed to have lunch together today.

817
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,840
I'm sorry. I forgot.

818
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,040
Mr. Shi, long time no see.

819
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,890
What are you doing here?

820
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,490
Haven't you told Mr. Shi about our relationship?

821
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,640
It happened so suddenly. I haven't had a chance to tell him.

822
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,280
What's wrong? Does your company

823
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,680
forbid relationships between employees?

824
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,000
I'm not an employee of your company anymore.

825
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,600
Don't you dare keep our relationship secret.

826
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,120
I won't.

827
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,920
When it comes to relationships,

828
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,360
we should let everyone congratulate us

829
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,040
and give us their blessings.

830
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,480
Right, yes, I know.

831
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,200
Mr. Shi,

832
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,040
we are together now.

833
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,560
You two are together?

834
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,240
Don't you think we're a good match?

835
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,880
If you think so, that's fine.

836
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li
