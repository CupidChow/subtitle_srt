1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,640
You are his mother.

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,680
You keep saying you love him.

4
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,900
If you love him, you should give him everything.

5
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,759
Give the child to me and he'll have everything.

6
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,520
I should give him to you?

7
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,640
Has he ever gone hungry or without clothes?

8
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,370
You can feed him?

9
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,180
Don't I still have to feed him?

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
What he needs most right now

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
is me, his mother.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,040
Give him to me.

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,850
You'll still be his mother.

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,720
If you want to see him,

15
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,280
you can come anytime. You're always welcome.

16
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,160
Xinxin.

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I have a card here.

18
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,020
It has about 800,000 or 900,000 in it.

19
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,540
I've already arranged it.

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,540
You can withdraw from it anytime.

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,329
If you need money in the future,

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,120
you can always let me know.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,930
What do you mean?

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,890
You want to buy my son with 800,000 or 900,000?

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,320
Don't put it that way.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,730
What do you mean 'buy your son'?

27
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,410
You're still young now.

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
But someday you'll grow old.

29
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,960
You need to think about yourself too.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,880
Besides,

31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,600
what makes you think this man is reliable?

32
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,200
No, I've already told you.

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,000
He's the landlord of this house.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,640
He's just a good friend of mine.

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Why do you keep linking us together?

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,480
Wan Xinxin.

37
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
I just don't understand.

38
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,690
You clearly did something,

39
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,520
yet you're trying every way to justify yourself.

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,840
Isn't it because

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,920
of this...

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,720
this muscle man

43
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,520
that you divorced our Xiaogang?

44
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,840
Muscle man?

45
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,480
Ma'am,

46
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,120
could you please get your facts straight before speaking?

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm just

48
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,880
the landlord, not some 'muscle man.'

49
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,240
I want to tell you

50
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,920
could you please keep your voices down,

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,120
the baby is sleeping.

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,060
I'll finish washing the rest of the clothes.

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Alright, Xinxin.

54
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,840
I don't want to say anything more.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,960
I'm taking the baby with me now,

56
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,200
while I'm still in a good mood.

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
Auntie, I don't want to say much either.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
While I'm still in a good mood,

59
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
please take your card and your bag,

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,040
and go home to rest.

61
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
Fine, Wan Xinxin.

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,410
This is what you told me.

63
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,680
Let me be honest with you.

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,600
If you won't let me take the child today,

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,000
then I'll come back tomorrow.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,120
If you won't let me take him tomorrow, I'll come the day after.

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,050
I'll keep coming until you let me take my grandchild.

68
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,520
If you don't let me take my grandson,

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,380
I'll make sure you never have a peaceful day.

70
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Take care, ma'am.

71
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,490
Goodbye, ma'am.

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,280
She's your elder. Aren't you going to see her out?

73
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,000
Shh.

74
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,700
What's with the shushing? They're all gone.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,530
However,

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,620
this Madam Qin seems really difficult to deal with.

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,170
It's all your fault.

78
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,520
No.

79
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,280
How is it my fault?

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,920
You had to show up at my place at this time today.

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,210
She saw everything.

82
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,210
This is my house.

83
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,360
I came here out of goodwill to help you take care of the child.

84
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Look at how you wash clothes.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
These are all

86
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,360
impossible to clean properly.

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes, so what should we do?

88
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,240
What a coincidence then.

89
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,200
She's so old,

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,970
and she's sick too. I don't dare upset her.

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,420
Give me some advice. What should I do?

92
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Why should I give you advice? This is your problem.

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,520
Aren't you my elder, uncle?

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,440
How am I your elder just because you call me uncle?

95
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,680
There's quite an age gap between me and that auntie.

96
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,810
Not that many years.

97
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,520
It's a big difference, okay?

98
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,450
You're both elders. You two can communicate better.

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,360
Didn't you say you're my little stool?

100
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,220
A little stool needs to step up at critical moments.

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,480
Yes.

102
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,400
Master, how about this.

103
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
When I help someone,

104
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,159
I go all the way.

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,840
I let you stay in my house for free and help you take care of the child.

106
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,120
Now tell me how I should help you with this situation.

107
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,320
You come up with the idea, and I'll follow your lead.

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,400
No, I'll pay you rent for the house.

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,120
But since you put it that way,

110
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,360
I won't be polite anymore.

111
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's do this.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,440
Starting today, you move back here.

113
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,120
Be on duty 24 hours a day.

114
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
As soon as she comes back, you rush over.

115
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,000
Wan Xinxin, is your brain working properly?

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,960
Me moving back?

117
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,200
I can't even explain one encounter with her.

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,160
If I really move back,

119
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,280
and she sees this every day,

120
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,200
how can I explain it clearly?

121
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,880
Won't it make things worse?

122
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400
You think if you don't move back,

123
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,440
you can explain things clearly?

124
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,400
Anyway, she already thinks that way, so I don't care anymore.

125
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,280
Let her think whatever she wants, right?

126
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,880
Besides, this is your house.

127
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,810
Don't you want to move back?

128
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,480
Yes.

129
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,290
That's right. This is my house.

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,530
Why wouldn't I be willing to move back?

131
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,920
Right, uncle?

132
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,000
But I really don't approve of you.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you even know how to take care of children?

134
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
These clothes shouldn't be washed in a washing machine.

135
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,159
You need to wash them by hand, understand?

136
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,560
I did wash them by hand!

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,580
You did a terrible job.

138
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Let me show you how it's done. This is how they should be washed.

139
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,680
See, I told you you're an elder.

140
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,600
Elders should

141
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,480
pass down this knowledge

142
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,760
to me gradually, right?

143
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,520
I'll go hang the clothes.

144
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,560
Let me do it. Let me.

145
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,440
You take a rest.

146
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,050
Rest a bit and then go pack your things.

147
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,480
Elder.

148
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,040
Those clothes on the side are dry. Take them in.

149
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,040
Wan Xinxin is so hateful.

150
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
She's terrible.

151
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,660
Hurry, get me some water. I need to take my medicine.

152
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,960
These young girls nowadays,

153
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,610
why are they all like this? So unreliable.

154
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,400
Mom, don't get upset.

155
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,000
Are you sure you're taking the right medicine?

156
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
How could I take the wrong medicine?

157
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
It's for blood pressure.

158
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,720
This Wan Xinxin,

159
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,440
she hasn't been divorced from you for long,

160
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,320
how could she already

161
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,120
be living with another man?

162
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,020
And that's not all.

163
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,640
Have you seen the living conditions there?

164
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,040
In those conditions, my grandson

165
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,540
must be suffering.

166
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,800
Mom, Xinxin actually cares a lot about our son.

167
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
She's just a bit careless sometimes

168
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,170
because she's young and doesn't have much life experience.

169
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
I actually think

170
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,640
it's good that Huaming is there taking care of her.

171
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,480
She's made you wear

172
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,000
such a huge green hat.

173
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,200
And you're still defending her?

174
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,440
How can you be so useless?

175
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,450
Xinxin's choices are her freedom.

176
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,000
As long as she and my son are happy, that's what matters.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,330
That's not acceptable!

178
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,660
The baby wasn't made by her alone.

179
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
The baby is a member of our Qin family.

180
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,200
I don't care if you're spineless.

181
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,260
Do you know who I am?

182
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,960
If she doesn't return my grandson to me,

183
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,890
I'll never let her have a good life.

184
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,360
Miss.

185
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
Why are you crying?

186
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,880
Miss, come on, don't cry.

187
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,930
Have some cherries.

188
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,040
I've prepared some. Have a Hami melon.

189
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,200
Try this heart-shaped apple.

190
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,980
I don't want it.

191
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,160
No.

192
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,240
Coconut jelly. It clears phlegm and feels smooth.

193
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,760
Eat more and you won't cry.

194
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,290
It's your favorite.

195
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,610
I can't eat anymore.

196
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
You have to eat.

197
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,920
After you finish eating,

198
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
you'll have strength to deal with Mrs. Qin, right?

199
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,220
I'm not fighting with her.

200
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,120
Besides, I have you, don't I?

201
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,570
Yes, you have me. So why are you crying?

202
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,560
Don't you know what it means

203
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,720
to be young, sensitive and emotional?

204
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,320
Now I do.

205
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,000
Stop crying. Just imagine

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
with a light above your head.

207
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,960
And then?

208
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,640
People across from you might think they're seeing a ghost.

209
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,800
It's scary. And you're still-

210
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,520
One less person if they're scared to death.

211
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
I feel wronged.

212
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,440
Their whole family is unreasonable.

213
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,640
Her son was clearly the one who cheated,

214
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,900
but she insists I'm a flirtatious woman.

215
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,160
Let me tell you, I'm not afraid of her at all.

216
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,120
If she weren't an elder,

217
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,160
it wouldn't be appropriate for me to argue with her.

218
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,640
But not standing up for myself isn't right either.

219
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,600
Yes, it's complicated.

220
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,530
There's no good way to handle this.

221
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,400
But, uncle,

222
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,200
I believe with your intelligence and wisdom,

223
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
if you confront Mrs. Qin,

224
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,800
you'll definitely leave her speechless and frustrated.

225
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,880
No, no, not frustrated.

226
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,440
Utterly miserable.

227
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,000
Why are you crying and laughing?

228
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,360
You're so-

229
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
That's a huge difference.

230
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,160
No,

231
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,010
no, you'll get used to it. This is just how I am.

232
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,160
But tonight you voluntarily took the bullet for me,

233
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,490
and I'm really touched.

234
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Caught in the crossfire, that's what you mean, right?

235
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,940
That's exactly it.

236
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,400
Listen, eat something.

237
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,060
I only do this for my daughter.

238
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,360
Heart-shaped apple.

239
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Xinxin.

240
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,320
Hello.

241
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,360
Mrs. Qin.

242
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,700
Why aren't you at work?

243
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Where's the baby?

244
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,400
She's asleep.

245
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,680
Your house is not clean.

246
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,880
I'm going to give it a thorough cleaning.

247
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,640
Let's go.

248
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,930
Put some muscle into it!

249
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Careful!

250
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,200
Ma'am, this hard-to-reach spot...

251
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,560
In a moment, stand on the stool

252
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,090
and help me clean it better.

253
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,600
Mrs. Qin, these bowls

254
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,360
have sentimental value to me.

255
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,720
Please be careful with them.

256
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,320
Alright.

257
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,000
Fine.

258
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,120
Look, could you wipe over there?

259
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,740
Everyone come out!

260
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,040
What is it?

261
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,480
Mrs. Qin, could you come here for a moment?

262
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
Ladies,

263
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,360
please stop what you're doing and

264
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,480
gather around here.

265
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,340
Thank you. Please gather around.

266
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,880
What's going on?

267
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,920
I have something important to say, Mrs. Qin.

268
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,380
Come on, ladies. Hurry up.

269
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,440
First, I'd like to thank all you beautiful ladies

270
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,160
for giving me such a spotlessly clean home.

271
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,020
I can tell you're a professional cleaning company.

272
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Everyone in line!

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,460
Come on!

274
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,400
Eyes right!

275
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,800
Eyes front!

276
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,320
Good!

277
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,920
Alright, let me say something. At ease.

278
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,360
I know you all came today

279
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,080
for the baby in the house,

280
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,050
to give him a clean environment

281
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,240
and comfortable surroundings.

282
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,680
But why did I ask you to stop?

283
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,920
It's also because of the baby.

284
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,280
Can you smell anything?

285
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,490
Take a sniff.

286
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
Please smell it, ma'am.

287
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,480
I don't smell anything.

288
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,080
No, go closer and see if you can smell anything.

289
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,490
I don't smell anything.

290
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,840
I don't even need to get closer.

291
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,320
How can you not smell such a strong odor?

292
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,080
What smell?

293
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
Does anyone here keep dogs?

294
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,640
I have a dog.

295
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,400
Look at this.

296
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,120
Sebaceous cyst fungal infection.

297
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,490
Have you heard of it?

298
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,770
It's a contagious skin disease from animals.

299
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,560
90% of cases are transmitted

300
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,050
from animals to humans.

301
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,680
It's highly contagious.

302
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,780
Don't scare us.

303
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,560
I'm not trying to scare you, ma'am.

304
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,020
Really.

305
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
This disease is extremely contagious.

306
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,360
Once infected, it can trigger conditions

307
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,280
in family members, especially children.

308
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,200
Those with children at home.

309
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,880
It can cause eczema

310
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,680
and these red rashes.

311
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,290
And it's quite difficult to treat.

312
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,890
Do all of you have children at home?

313
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,120
We all do.

314
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,490
Everyone has children.

315
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,920
When you were cleaning just now,

316
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,480
did you wash all the rags in the same bucket?

317
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,040
Yes.

318
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,640
Who washed the dishes?

319
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,360
I did.

320
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,840
Ma'am, these dishes need to be disinfected again.

321
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,680
Please don't let this infect the children.

322
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,440
All of you might be

323
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,240
carrying these germs right now.

324
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,920
Listen, don't be too scared or nervous.

325
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,740
It can actually be prevented.

326
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,200
When you go home, use this

327
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,480
75% alcohol.

328
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,960
First disinfect yourselves.

329
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,680
Then use this 1:100 disinfectant solution

330
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,720
to disinfect your entire body.

331
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,640
Whatever you do, don't spread it to your children.

332
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
You should go now.

333
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,720
No, no, don't leave.

334
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
We're not finished here yet.

335
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,840
Just going out, that...

336
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,880
You can throw away these cleaning tools later.

337
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,640
I understand.

338
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,240
I know you're very worried about your son,

339
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,600
but this really won't work. What you're doing

340
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,800
could infect him if you're not careful.

341
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,520
You're not a doctor. Why should I listen to you?

342
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,250
Ma'am, look at those trophies.

343
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,690
I may not be a doctor,

344
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,800
but each of these is an award for my medical research papers.

345
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,130
I used to be a physician,

346
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,400
and now I'm a professional veterinarian.

347
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,680
I have a professional veterinary license.

348
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,010
Would you like to see it?

349
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,800
Auntie, where are you going?

350
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm going to see my grandson.

351
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,440
You might have been infected with bacteria.

352
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,570
You don't want to pass it on to the baby.

353
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,320
Really?

354
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,160
Of course.

355
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,520
What should I do then?

356
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,000
Why don't you go to the hospital for a full body disinfection?

357
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,130
Otherwise you might infect your family when you go home.

358
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,200
Okay.

359
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,480
Wait, what about you?

360
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,360
Won't you be contagious too?

361
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,090
Yes, I might be carrying germs.

362
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,210
But as I told you,

363
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,360
I'm a professional doctor.

364
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
I'm an expert at disinfection.

365
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
After you leave, I'll thoroughly

366
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,200
disinfect the entire house,

367
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,080
and then I'll go see the baby.

368
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
That makes sense.

369
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,730
Makes sense.

370
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,240
Huaming, I'll trust you this once.

371
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,200
I'll go get disinfected now.

372
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,320
But I want you to know,

373
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,250
once I'm completely disinfected,

374
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,200
I'll be back.

375
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,560
I'm actually feeling a bit dizzy now,

376
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,359
aren't I?

377
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,880
Take care, auntie.

378
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,400
What kind of disease is this exactly?

379
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,800
How did you get infected?

380
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,440
How would I know?

381
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,240
How was I supposed to know those hourly workers were sick?

382
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,640
Anyway, I'm sweating now.

383
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,770
And having trouble breathing.

384
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,120
Mr. Qin, the examination is complete.

385
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,650
How is it?

386
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
What's wrong with me?

387
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,120
There's nothing wrong with you.

388
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,040
Nothing wrong? I...

389
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,610
How can I not be sick when I'm like this?

390
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,140
You were just frightened.

391
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,130
Frightened.

392
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,360
First of all, everything is normal with you, nothing unusual.

393
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,720
Sebaceous cyst isn't a serious condition.

394
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,920
It's not contagious.

395
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,240
Then why is there

396
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,240
a strange odor on my body?

397
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,320
If I'm not mistaken, it's creolin.

398
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,890
Coal tar soap solution.

399
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,880
Commonly known as stink medicine.

400
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,160
It's a veterinary medicine.

401
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,420
Used for disinfecting pet tools.

402
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
For pets?

403
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,480
Yes.

404
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,340
He must have prepared the solution beforehand.

405
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,660
When you took the hourly worker to clean,

406
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,490
he splashed it on your clothes.

407
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,960
You wouldn't have noticed while working.

408
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,360
After cleaning the room,

409
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
that's when you smelled the stench.

410
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
All right.

411
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,280
Ms. Qin, I'll be going now.

412
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
Okay, thank you.

413
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,320
Take care.

414
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,200
Goodbye.

415
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,640
Mom, I'm sure Huaming is behind this.

416
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,520
Damn that Huaming. He's against me.

417
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,620
I won't let him get away with this.

418
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,440
The older ginger is spicier indeed.

419
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,480
The young can be just as clever as the old.

420
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
There was a nanny at Mrs. Qin's house

421
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,700
whom I easily persuaded to leave.

422
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,720
You're becoming my hero now.

423
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,920
Getting rid of Mrs. Qin required some acting skills.

424
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,280
I must give you a performance award.

425
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,640
I don't need your award.

426
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,080
Let me tell you.

427
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,040
Back when I was in the medical system comedy competition,

428
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,920
I won a gold medal.

429
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,680
See? Right?

430
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,640
In my prime,

431
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,160
every department had a few fans of mine.

432
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,760
Right?

433
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Then why did you leave the hospital?

434
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,600
How many nurses were chasing after you?

435
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,280
No, we're not talking about me but about you.

436
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,080
Why are you worrying about this?

437
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,440
My solution

438
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
is just temporary. You can't avoid the inevitable.

439
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,690
She'll be back sooner or later.

440
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,850
I know she'll come back.

441
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,360
So what should we do? I won't let her come.

442
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,160
That's impossible.

443
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,480
She's the child's grandmother.

444
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,200
It's her right to visit her grandchild.

445
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,130
I can't stop her.

446
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,080
I didn't say that. The child's grandmother

447
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,040
can certainly come to see the child.

448
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,840
But every time you bring a whole crowd of people,

449
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,900
it's not good for the child's health.

450
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,680
I know. The key is that you still need to work, right?

451
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,800
You know I need to work.

452
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm not working as a doctor anymore.

453
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,760
I'm not going to the pet hospital either.

454
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,220
You're not paying me rent.

455
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,690
Of course I have to work.

456
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,730
No, talking about money hurts our relationship.

457
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,080
She's already suffered such a big loss.

458
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
She'll need a few days to recover, right?

459
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,610
I'm not asking for much now.

460
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,560
I just want her

461
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,540
to let me have a peaceful weekend.

462
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,880
Here, have some water.

463
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,460
Let's toast with water. Have a nice weekend.

464
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,940
Happy weekend.

465
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,320
Hello.

466
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,280
Come in.

467
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,010
Put it there.

468
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,600
Replace this one. This won't do.

469
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,860
Get a different brand.

470
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,240
This food is no good. None of this can be used.

471
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,320
We can't keep this.

472
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,760
Don't throw it away!

473
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,000
This one, a little boy can't use this.

474
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,400
Quick!

475
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Don't throw it away!

476
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,800
Come here.

477
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,280
Come, Xinxin.

478
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
This is for little girls. No, this won't do.

479
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
Look, this one is not acceptable.

480
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,940
What else is not suitable?

481
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,880
This pink one, don't want it.

482
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,440
No, nothing pink.

483
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,680
Don't want any of these. That one, this one.

484
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
This one, this one.

485
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,280
Don't want this child's one either.

486
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,840
This one is fine.

487
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,640
This food is not acceptable.

488
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,400
This one.

489
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,840
Start over.

490
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Open this one too.

491
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,090
This one is good.

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,240
Yes, change it.

493
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,960
Oh my, really!

494
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,800
Buying something for my grandson

495
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,060
why is it so difficult?

496
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,520
How is this even...

497
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,520
Darling.

498
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,160
Darling, darling.

499
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,160
Darling.

500
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,760
Darling, darling.

501
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,480
Darling is crying.

502
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,860
Darling is crying.

503
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,980
Darling is crying.

504
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,320
Hurry.

505
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,280
What's wrong? Come here.

506
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,880
No need. Step aside.

507
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,520
No.

508
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,570
Here, take this.

509
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,120
Don't cry, darling.

510
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,020
I raised Xiaogang myself.

511
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,160
Darling.

512
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,200
Darling.

513
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,480
Don't cry.

514
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,840
Don't cry.

515
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,040
Come, look.

516
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,560
The trophy.

517
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,100
Okay. He doesn't want the trophy either.

518
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,480
He doesn't want the trophy.

519
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,290
No, auntie. This is Huaming's trophy.

520
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,800
What's so special about a stupid trophy?

521
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,400
The child is crying.

522
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,000
It's okay.

523
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,880
Come here quickly.

524
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,600
No, auntie.

525
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,530
Why are you being so unreasonable?

526
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,480
I'm being unreasonable?

527
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,880
Wan Xinxin.

528
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,680
Am I the unreasonable one or are you?

529
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,000
You've barely been married to my son for any time at all.

530
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,480
And you've already abandoned him.

531
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Do you know how much you've hurt him?

532
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,210
He's almost depressed now.

533
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,600
I don't know what spell she cast on him.

534
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,260
He still speaks highly of her.

535
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,100
Wan Xinxin, don't you forget.

536
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,960
After you married my son,

537
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,480
how many things he bought for you,

538
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,940
how much money he gave you.

539
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,860
Don't you know?

540
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,520
Fine, even if you have no feelings for him now,

541
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
when you see all those things,

542
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,360
you should at least be grateful.

543
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,760
Even if you don't know how to repay kindness,

544
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,120
you should at least understand basic courtesy, shouldn't you?

545
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,760
How can you speak

546
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,090
to your elder like this?

547
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,450
I really can't talk to you anymore.

548
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,080
Explain yourself clearly to me.

549
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,160
Don't take him away. Tell me what's going on.

550
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,040
Ma'am.

551
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,920
You heard her. She said I was rude, right?

552
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,720
Fine. Let her tell me clearly.

553
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,160
Which one of us is being unreasonable.

554
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,520
Ma'am.

555
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,240
Let's go outside. I need to talk to you.

556
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,440
No. Why should we go outside?

557
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,040
I'm staying right here.

558
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,640
Make her come out and listen to me face to face.

559
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
Listen to what I have to say.

560
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,520
Why should I go outside?

561
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,280
To talk to you privately.

562
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,200
I want to speak right here.

563
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Come, ma'am.

564
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,960
What's wrong with talking inside?

565
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,240
Why are you pulling me out here? Let's talk right here.

566
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,160
Don't pull me.

567
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,480
Why not talk in the room instead of out here?

568
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,080
No, ma'am.

569
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,080
I brought you out here

570
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,410
because you were shouting the whole time.

571
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,800
Was I shouting?

572
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
You were the one shouting. How did it become me?

573
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,680
No, ma'am.

574
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,200
I didn't say anything up there.

575
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,760
You were the one making all the noise.

576
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,690
The way you talk,

577
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,460
it's like that child is yours.

578
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,930
That's my grandson.

579
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,680
I was worried about disturbing him, you know?

580
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,520
Alright, I apologize to you first.

581
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,160
My behavior just now was inappropriate.

582
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,760
I'm sorry.

583
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,280
You're the elder, you're reasonable.

584
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,880
You don't need to flatter me.

585
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
Fine, I won't flatter you.

586
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,600
But let me reason with you.

587
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,130
Listen and see if what I'm saying makes sense.

588
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,720
Ma'am, marriage is between two people.

589
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,840
Qin Gang and Wan Xinxin got divorced.

590
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,760
Have you asked Qin Gang

591
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
what actually happened?

592
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,580
You should ask him, right?

593
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,400
Also, Qin Gang and Wan Xinxin divorced so quickly.

594
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,080
Did Wan Xinxin ever make

595
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,200
any demands about property during their marriage?

596
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,760
Did she? No, right?

597
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,610
She's now squeezed into this small place with me.

598
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,560
That says a lot already.

599
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Right? Have you thought about that?

600
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,940
That's not because of you.

601
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,740
Ma'am, you suspect me,

602
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,720
suspect the relationship between us.

603
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,360
You have even less reason for that.

604
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,890
When I first met Wan Xinxin,

605
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,890
she was dead broke with a child.

606
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,120
Really, this apartment isn't rented by her.

607
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,580
She doesn't pay me a penny.

608
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,040
If you think I'm after Wan Xinxin for her looks,

609
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,600
Wan Xinxin is just,

610
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,170
just average-looking.

611
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Isn't she as skinny as a matchstick?

612
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,530
Fine, I won't talk about others, I'll talk about myself.

613
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,520
I'm older than your Qin Gang.

614
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,880
I'm not as rich as Qin Gang.

615
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,600
I'm not as successful as Qin Gang, right?

616
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm divorced with a ten-year-old daughter.

617
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,200
You tell me, with all this,

618
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,460
why would Wan Xinxin be interested in me?

619
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,490
When you put it that way,

620
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,890
it does make some sense.

621
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,650
What if you two fell in love at first sight?

622
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,380
Love at first sight is a beautiful thing.

623
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,040
But have you ever seen

624
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,500
such a miserable case of love at first sight?

625
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,200
Wan Xinxin really has it tough.

626
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,930
Raising a child all by herself.

627
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,620
And her parents are both gone.

628
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,200
So please give her a peaceful environment.

629
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,660
Let her have some time to recover.

630
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,960
Alright, I've said what I needed to say.

631
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,890
Goodbye, ma'am.

632
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,520
Mom?

633
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
What's wrong?

634
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,380
Didn't you visit the child today?

635
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,360
I did.

636
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,290
I was kicked out.

637
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,410
I need to talk to you about this.

638
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,880
Going back and forth every day is exhausting.

639
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,810
You should rest.

640
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,240
Didn't you understand what I just said?

641
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,560
I was thrown out.

642
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,500
Xinxin does have a bad temper,

643
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,340
but she's not a bad person.

644
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,480
Xiaogang, tell me the truth.

645
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,840
How did you break up with Xinxin?

646
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,880
Why did you divorce her?

647
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,600
Mom, please stop digging into this.

648
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
It's nothing to be proud of.

649
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,690
I need to hear the truth.

650
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,640
You've seen it yourself.

651
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,970
You've met Huaming too.

652
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,920
Yes, I have.

653
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,440
And that makes me even more confused.

654
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,680
Look,

655
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,640
you and Xinxin had feelings for each other,

656
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,880
you got married,

657
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,730
you even have a child together.

658
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,920
And Huaming? He's inferior to you in every way.

659
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,000
Why would Xinxin

660
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,760
leave you for someone like Huaming?

661
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,040
How would I know?

662
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
Besides, when it comes to feelings,

663
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,480
they can't really be explained.

664
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,730
Can't be explained?

665
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,080
Just like when you

666
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,520
broke up with Liu Wei,

667
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,080
that couldn't be explained either, right?

668
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,200
Mom,

669
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,640
that's ancient history.

670
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,700
Why bring it up now?

671
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,490
Besides, Liu Wei is doing well in America.

672
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,730
You're still in touch with Liu Wei?

673
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,840
No, I heard it from a classmate.

674
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Mom, what would you like for dinner? I'll cook for you.

675
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,860
I have no appetite.

676
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,740
I don't want to eat.

677
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,720
Go do your things. I need to rest.

678
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,400
Call me if you need anything.

679
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,240
It's me.

680
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,210
Help me look someone up.

681
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,200
No way! You're chatting with people online?

682
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,280
That's so outdated.

683
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,680
Everyone uses WeChat and Momo these days.

684
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,280
Online chat is so yesterday.

685
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,930
What chat? This is online medical consultation.

686
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,840
No, what's this?

687
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,240
Stop it. Don't touch anything.

688
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,000
This is professional business. Don't mess around.

689
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,200
This isn't something to play with.

690
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,330
Messing around could cause problems.

691
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,400
But you're just answering a few questions online.

692
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,600
Is that even helpful?

693
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,410
Remove that question mark.

694
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,920
Let me tell you, going to hospitals nowadays...

695
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,840
There are often long queues, right?

696
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,880
So when some patients get sick,

697
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,440
it's more convenient for them to go online.

698
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,280
I provide initial online medical consultations,

699
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,080
basic medical advice.

700
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,320
Usually for domestic patients,

701
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,680
I offer these consultations for free.

702
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,540
Of course, there's a daily limit.

703
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,240
My main revenue model

704
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,080
is cooperating with some major foreign hospitals

705
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,340
and medical websites.

706
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,280
Then I provide them with

707
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,520
surgical plans and case analyses.

708
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,960
That's impressive!

709
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,520
I'm seeing you in a whole new light.

710
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,570
I type really fast. Let me help you.

711
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,340
Really, don't mess with this.

712
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,930
Don't bother looking. You wouldn't understand anyway.

713
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,500
How much can you earn from these consultations?

714
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,440
It depends on the level.

715
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,700
Generally, in my case,

716
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,800
if my rating level is high,

717
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,040
I can earn quite a bit.

718
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,880
How much exactly?

719
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,130
Enough to get by.

720
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,000
Could you...

721
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,660
Get me a glass of water, quick.

722
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,600
Okay.

723
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,880
Wan Xinxin! Wan Xinxin!

724
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,690
Stop acting like nothing's wrong!

725
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,480
Mrs. Qin won't let this go.

726
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,340
You need to figure something out!

727
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,640
Calm down.

728
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,480
No.

729
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,370
Here we go again.

730
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,450
Anyone home?

731
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,800
Delivery for 601.

732
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,100
Why are you so nervous? It's just my package.

733
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,060
Turn around first.

734
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,920
What's with all the secrecy?

735
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,540
Just turn around, please.

736
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,120
Okay.

737
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,800
No peeking.

738
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,330
Alright.

739
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,180
Ladies and gentlemen,

740
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,120
welcome to the 25th Academy Awards.

741
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,260
The award we're presenting now is

742
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,800
the Best Living Room Performance.

743
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,240
And the winner is

744
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,840
Mr. Hua Ming.

745
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,680
Now, let's invite Mr. Hua Ming

746
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,640
to give his acceptance speech.

747
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,800
Should I look here for my speech?

748
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,720
Look here.

749
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,740
Can I start now?

750
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,290
Go ahead.

751
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,560
First, I'd like to thank the committee

752
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,370
for presenting me with this award.

753
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,920
I especially want to thank my family

754
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,520
for their support from afar.

755
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,320
There are two more important people I must thank:

756
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,640
one is Miss Wan Xinxin,

757
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,320
and the other is

758
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,520
little Bao who's sleeping in the other room.

759
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,560
There's one more important person -

760
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,160
Mrs. Qin.

761
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,450
It's because of their presence

762
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,360
that I was able to give such a brilliant performance.

763
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,320
Once you receive an honor,

764
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,720
it's no longer just an honor in that moment.

765
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,560
In my future life, I will certainly

766
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,920
face challenges head-on.

767
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,000
If there are no challenges, I'll create some,

768
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,280
striving to give them a better life.

769
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,800
Thank you all.

770
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,920
Reliable.

771
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,890
You're done?

772
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,640
I didn't realize you were such a talker.

773
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,280
Xinxin, is this

774
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,860
the trophy you specially ordered for me?

775
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,960
Although it's different from your previous one,

776
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,290
I just couldn't find the old one anywhere.

777
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,280
So I ordered this one instead. Is that okay?

778
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,840
Thank you.

779
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,440
Your mood changes pretty quickly, huh?

780
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,940
Not really.

781
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,680
Let me tell you, I'm keeping track of all these little things

782
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,320
one by one in my little notebook.

783
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,760
I'll settle the score with Qin Gang later.

784
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,880
How about that? Not bad, right?

785
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,010
Good. How was my performance just now?

786
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,210
I hope Mrs. Qin isn't coming again.

787
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,210
How to be a mom? When you hear crying, it means hunger.

788
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,040
I'll go check.

789
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,520
Thank you, little Bao.

790
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,020
That's not the same thing.

791
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,520
Mr. Shi.

792
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,920
Mr. Wu, Mr. Zhang, hello.

793
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,280
It's been a long time.

794
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,040
A beautiful woman like you,

795
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,640
with such a successful career. How wonderful!

796
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,440
Not at all. Just a small startup company.

797
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,600
It's going well. Quite reassuring.

798
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,120
My, you're so fortunate.

799
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,720
Thank you.

800
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,160
I still need all your support and guidance.

801
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,160
Come here.

802
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,440
This one is beautiful.

803
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,770
What are you doing here?

804
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,460
Listen to yourself. Why shouldn't I be here?

805
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,600
This is an event. I was hired to take photos.

806
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,160
You're everywhere.

807
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,680
Fine, you can photograph others.

808
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,360
But not me.

809
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,060
No, this is an event venue.

810
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,520
Everything in this venue,

811
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,320
including people, I can photograph.

812
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,980
It's my job.

813
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,730
Fine. Take your photos.

814
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,180
Just stay away from me.

815
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,440
Mr. Chen

816
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,600
Xiao Shi

817
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,240
No, no. Mr. Shi.

818
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,160
Wait, I thought the auction was tonight.

819
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,820
Why was it changed to daytime?

820
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,530
This friend urgently needs money,

821
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,380
so we need to start right away.

822
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,240
Many of my friends haven't arrived yet.

823
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,120
Don't worry, there's another session tonight.

824
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,920
Okay.

825
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,160
How have you been lately? Still single?

826
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,600
I've been busy. Haven't had time to think about that.

827
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,480
Look, a woman,

828
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,160
especially one as young and beautiful as you,

829
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,620
how could you possibly lack male attention?

830
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,880
If you need anything,

831
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,690
you can call me anytime.

832
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,220
My number hasn't changed.

833
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,900
Mr. Chen, you're quite the comedian.

834
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
Fine. I also have your wife's number.

835
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,320
Hers hasn't changed either.

836
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,050
I called her just the other day.

837
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,600
Is that so?

838
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,280
Here's to you.

839
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,360
Don't think you're so powerful now

840
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,880
that you can talk to me like this.

841
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,720
Don't forget,

842
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,040
when you used to work under me,

843
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,120
how you relied on me to climb up the ladder, you little nobody.

844
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Your husband.

845
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,840
Mr. Chen.

846
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,720
Honey.

847
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,520
Honey.

848
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,640
What are you doing?

849
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,280
I'm sorry.

850
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,360
How embarrassing.

851
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,380
Honey, let me explain.

852
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,640
She insisted on meeting me alone.

853
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,120
I was just telling her I won't go.

854
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
See? You witnessed it yourself.

855
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,840
Manager Zhang.

856
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,880
Come back here!

857
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,400
You shameless woman trying to seduce my husband!

858
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,000
I

859
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,200
Ma'am.

860
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,720
Calm down.

861
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,360
Brother, come here.

862
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,960
This is a charity event.

863
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,200
Let's all be charitable.

864
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,360
And you, sir.

865
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,300
This is my girlfriend.

866
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,780
Why do you keep staring at her?

867
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,080
No, I...

868
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,080
There's a mirror in the bathroom.

869
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,040
You can go check it out. It's really nice.

870
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,640
Excuse me.

871
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,040
Get back here!

872
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,440
No, it's my hairstyle...

873
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,880
Keep up!

874
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,040
Thank you very much for your attendance.

875
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,000
Due to space limitations,

876
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,240
I'm telling you, stop following me.

877
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,320
So this morning our auction

878
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,850
has added an extra session.

879
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,880
For today's daytime auction, we have

880
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,680
prepared a premium highlight item.

881
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,240
That is our

882
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,330
South African sapphire necklace.

883
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,180
Let me introduce it to you.

884
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,280
This necklace

885
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,680
is made with sapphires from South Africa.

886
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
In your brochure,

887
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,800
all origin information is clearly stated.

888
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,280
The starting price is 100,000,

889
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
with minimum increments of 20,000.

890
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,760
Everyone is welcome to bid.

891
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,520
Alright, 140,000.

892
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,040
This lady bids 140,000.

893
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,760
Everyone appreciates beauty.

894
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,840
South African sapphire necklace.

895
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,500
Any bids higher than 140,000?

896
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,250
180,000.

897
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,440
200,000.

898
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,450
Alright, 200,000, going once.

899
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,760
300,000.

900
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,440
300,000. This gentleman bids 300,000.

901
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,360
I'm buying it for my wife.

902
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,800
Cheapskate.

903
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,240
Honey, you're so sweet.

904
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,840
Of course.

905
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,400
Sir,

906
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,120
see how much he loves his girlfriend.

907
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,320
300,000, going once.

908
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,620
Any bids higher than 300,000?

909
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,100
300,000, going twice.

910
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,880
400,000.

911
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,440
I'm buying it for my girlfriend.

912
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,240
Deal.

913
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Sir, please wait.

914
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,020
Let's complete the paperwork first.

915
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,480
Mom.

916
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,060
What's so urgent that you called me back?

917
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,680
Come, sit down.

918
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,920
This is my will.

919
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,440
I've made two changes. Take a look.

920
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,040
Mom, you're in good health.

921
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,530
Don't talk about wills.

922
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,360
It's bad luck.

923
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,090
You must read it. Right now.

924
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,600
No relatives or third parties may challenge the heir's inheritance rights.

925
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,480
No relatives or third parties may challenge the heir's rights.

926
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,880
Huh?

927
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,520
What are you confused about?

928
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
I've just modified two conditions.

929
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,080
First, get back with Wan Xinxin and bring my grandson home.

930
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,440
Second, never see Liu Wei again.

931
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,380
Huaming was right.

932
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,540
I've been wise all my life but foolish this once.

933
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,800
My own son.

934
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,760
I misjudged him completely.

935
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,840
Xiaogang, you're married with a child.

936
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
You're a married man.

937
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,120
Why is Liu Wei still pursuing you?

938
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,880
What kind of decent woman would do that?

939
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,480
Mom, you've misunderstood.

940
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,520
Liu Wei just returned to China.

941
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,720
She just wanted to meet me for a meal.

942
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,360
Stop right there.

943
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,320
She's been back for months.

944
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,440
You two have been meeting regularly.

945
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,560
And having all kinds of interactions.

946
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,360
You're my son.

947
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,210
I wouldn't be your real mother if I couldn't see through you.

948
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,620
Listen carefully.

949
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,000
I've made these two changes. If you can't fulfill them,

950
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,530
then the Qin family fortune

951
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,480
will have nothing to do with you.

952
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,320
Mom.

953
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,560
I was wrong.

954
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
I shouldn't have kept this from you.

955
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,720
Mom.

956
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,890
Liu Wei and I had a relationship for 6-7 years.

957
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,920
Your son is sentimental about the past.

958
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,520
When Liu Wei appeared before me,

959
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,050
I was completely confused.

960
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,090
Mom, please don't be angry.

961
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,800
Li.
