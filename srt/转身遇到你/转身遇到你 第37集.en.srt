1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,479
I want you to transfer

3
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,009
at least half of the money to this account first thing tomorrow.

4
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,080
You're being too impatient.

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,120
Didn't we have an agreement?

6
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,770
Qin Gang's company is investing in a new project now.

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,860
Even if all the money is spent,

8
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,280
they won't notice anything for a while.

9
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,920
I don't care. I want my money.

10
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,810
Fine. I'll transfer it to your account tomorrow.

11
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,600
I hope you keep your word.

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,180
Otherwise,

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,130
you know the consequences.

14
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,250
Kaiyang.

15
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,240
Tell me what you've done.

16
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
Say something.

17
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,720
Speak up. Don't scare me.

18
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,720
Stop drinking.

19
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,480
Just tell me.

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,960
Let me ask you something.

21
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,740
Do you think I, Jiang Kaiyang,

22
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
am a good husband?

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Of course you are.

24
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,920
In my heart,

25
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,480
you're the best man in the world.

26
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,080
Bullshit.

27
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,240
What a joke.

28
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm not.

29
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,040
Not at all.

30
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,400
Let me tell you.

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,000
What kind of man am I?

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
I used to be a respectable

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,480
deputy director, right?

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,079
But now...

35
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,600
Just look at now.

36
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,520
What are all those people I know doing?

37
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,200
What kind of houses do they live in?

38
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,530
What cars do they drive?

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,200
Compared to them,

40
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,000
am I even a man anymore?

41
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,280
Kaiyang, don't you understand?

42
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,560
I don't need a big house or fancy car.

43
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
I just want you to be well.

44
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,840
Living a simple life together is better than anything.

45
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,500
The daily necessities are what make a real life.

46
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,200
You're right.

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
You're absolutely right.

48
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,040
Completely right, but...

49
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,519
But it's too late.

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,640
There's no turning back.

51
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,200
I can't escape prison now.

52
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,760
Listen to me, Chunli.

53
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,180
Before I go in, I want to do something for our family.

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,680
One last thing.

55
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,320
Chunli, tomorrow...

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Once I get this money back tomorrow,

57
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,720
I'll feel at peace.

58
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,720
We don't need this money!

59
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,760
I can do hard labor. I can sell my blood.

60
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,520
If you get this money back,

61
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,000
I won't spend a penny of it.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,000


63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,660
You're being ridiculous.

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,960
The sun must be rising from the west today.

65
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,890
It's rare for me to make breakfast.

66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,200
It's been a long time since I made you

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,330
a decent breakfast.

68
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,040
Lately, either you're busy or I'm busy.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm afraid if I don't make you breakfast now,

70
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,260
I'll definitely regret it later.

71
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,770
Listen to yourself.

72
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,450
As if we'll never see each other again.

73
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,440
There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

74
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:52,920
Yes.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
But time waits for no one.

76
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,409
I need to quickly catch time by its tail

77
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,600
to accomplish what I want to do.

78
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,770
Yesterday you were saying I was in a hurry.

79
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,380
But I think you're more anxious than anyone.

80
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,000
Eat quickly. It's getting cold.

81
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,340
Delicious.

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,180
My mom just doesn't know you well enough yet.

83
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,680
If she knew,

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,340
you'd be the perfect wife in her eyes.

85
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,380
Why aren't you eating?

86
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,560
What's wrong?

87
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,210
I feel really upset.

88
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

89
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,360
No.

90
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,320
I should have been this good to you earlier.

91
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,000
You've always been good to me.

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,530
It's different.

93
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,050
Maybe I should never have left you before.

94
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,360
If I had shown earlier

95
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,060
that I could be a good wife and mother,

96
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,450
perhaps your mother wouldn't have made us separate.

97
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,840
Maybe everything would be different now.

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Why are you bringing this up now?

99
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,960
Nothing. I'm just

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,000
rambling.

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,700
There's some good news today.

102
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,159
Huaming Online has been completely shut down.

103
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,400
They can't operate until the investigation is complete.

104
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,480
I want to see

105
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,970
how long he can keep up his good guy act.

106
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,120
What's fake will always be fake.

107
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,860
Sooner or later, the truth will come out.

108
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,650
Now I've caught him by the tail,

109
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,220
let's see where he can run.

110
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,320
Here.

111
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,720
I feel so happy right now.

112
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,690
You feel happy just because I'm eating your food?

113
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,480
Alright, I'll give you this chance.

114
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,880
I'll keep eating your cooking forever.

115
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,520
This is a foreign medical website.

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,560
That authorization plan,

117
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,620
please help me communicate about it.

118
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,640
Hello.

119
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,970
Are you Dr. Huaming?

120
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm a reporter from the City News.

121
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,680
May I ask you a few questions?

122
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,140
Sure, please sit here.

123
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:07,970
Okay.

124
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,410
Please sit down.

125
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,400
Thank you.

126
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
I heard you've been running

127
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,320
a medical website called Huaming Online.

128
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
And it has achieved some success.

129
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,360
But last night,

130
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,920
the website's server was suddenly shut down

131
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,560
and its IP address was suspended.

132
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,760
Could you tell us why?

133
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,700
Could you first tell me

134
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,520
what your version of the story is?

135
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,880
We heard that Huaming Online

136
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,760
obtained medical funds through fraudulent means.

137
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
And during your time in America,

138
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,920
these funds weren't fully used for patients.

139
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,120
Is this true?

140
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,770
You heard...

141
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,560
And fraudulent means to obtain medical funds?

142
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,760
If these medical funds

143
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
could help more patients,

144
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,520
I wish I had such ability.

145
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,240
Would you really do that?

146
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,600
Can you tell me

147
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
what your source of information is?

148
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,120
Well,

149
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,130
I can't disclose that. It's just hearsay.

150
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
By the way, I forgot to ask your name.

151
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
My surname is Chen.

152
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,300
Hello, Reporter Chen.

153
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,640
You're recording this, right?

154
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,080
Yes.

155
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,140
It's like this.

156
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,800
I need to be responsible for what I say.

157
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
Since you're recording, I can tell you

158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,800
I take responsibility for every word I say.

159
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,800
The same applies to you.

160
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,760
As a news organization,

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,460
as the voice of the people,

162
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,540
what you say must also be backed by evidence, right?

163
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,880
Alright, regarding the medical funds,

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,600
if it has become a social issue

165
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,960
that prompted you to interview me,

166
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,600
I can disclose to the public.

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,840
I can tell you

168
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,960
all the uses of the medical funds,

169
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,280
every single transaction.

170
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,600
We have clear records of everything,

171
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
both the hospital and I personally.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,530
I can match them completely

173
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,680
and make them public.

174
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,400
If during this process,

175
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
you find that I've broken any laws,

176
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,800
any illegal actions whatsoever,

177
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
the law will punish me accordingly.

178
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,000
So I think today,

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,800
since you keep saying 'I heard,'

180
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,560
I think this interview

181
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,490
should end here.

182
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,960
Dr. Hua, may I ask you one last question?

183
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,280
Go ahead.

184
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,480
I heard that you once caused a medical accident

185
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,160
that killed a professor who was a Good Samaritan.

186
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,240
And later, to atone for your sins,

187
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,400
you started dating the deceased's daughter

188
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,660
and even tried to marry her. Is that true?

189
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,400
Reporter Chen, you seem quite young.

190
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,520
You probably haven't been working long.

191
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,440
Let me tell you again,

192
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,700
don't rely on hearsay.

193
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
You need factual evidence, okay?

194
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
The questions you're asking now

195
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,940
concern my personal privacy.

196
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,960
I won't press the matter with you.

197
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,560
By the way,

198
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,680
if you disturb that girl

199
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,080
and violate her privacy,

200
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,680
I reserve the right to take legal action against you.

201
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,210
Goodbye.

202
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,440
Dr. Hua,

203
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,540
you're really keeping your cool.

204
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,920
There are many reporters and people outside.

205
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,380
How will you explain this?

206
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,160
I can understand the public not knowing the truth,

207
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,000
but reporters are just making things worse.

208
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,060
It must be Qin Gang.

209
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,640
Isn't he just suspicious about the surgical procedure

210
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,500
that led to his mother's death from complications?

211
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,000
Why don't you show them the surgical records?

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Wouldn't that solve it?

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Senior,

214
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,860
it's really difficult being a doctor nowadays.

215
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,760
If we had to publish and explain

216
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,780
every surgical plan to patients,

217
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,880
imagine the workload.

218
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,520
How could we get any work done?

219
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:10,960
Zhongxin Jikang

220
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,320
I remember when I was in college,

221
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:12,920
you told me something.

222
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,280
You said,

223
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,640
in the end, being a doctor

224
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,040
isn't about how skilled you are,

225
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,120
it's about having a conscience.

226
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,320
Zhongxin Sale

227
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,760
For this surgery,

228
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I, Hua Ming, can face my conscience.

229
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,650
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

230
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
Since things have come to this,

231
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,040
if all else fails, I'll just leave.

232
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,360
Zhongxin Jikang

233
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,240
Zhongxin Jikang

234
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,700
Then why did you come back?

235
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,690
For someone.

236
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,580
Wan Xinxin.

237
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,480
Zhongxin Jikang

238
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,680
True love is truly great!

239
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,320
So now you're willing

240
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,020
to explain things to Qin Gang?

241
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Explanations must be given.

242
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,800
By the way,

243
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,200
I need your help with something.

244
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,260
All the accounts for Hua Ming Online,

245
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,720
please have the hospital finance department make them public.

246
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,650
Xinxin is right.

247
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
If I have to leave, I won't take the blame

248
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,780
or leave with a cloud over my head.

249
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,560
Wan Xinxin is trying so hard to keep you here.

250
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,440
Has she forgiven you?

251
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,140
I'll figure it out.

252
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,180
Sorry for the trouble.

253
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I'll head out now.

254
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,560
Zhongxin Guikang

255
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:13,800
Zhongxin Guikang

256
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Zhongxin Guikang

257
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,760
Excuse me, are you Miss Wan?

258
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,400
Yes, I am.

259
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,360
We're reporters from the City News.

260
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,160
I have a friend at an auction house in France

261
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,040
who saw your paintings

262
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,960
and admired them very much.

263
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,800
He asked us to interview you.

264
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,410
May I sit down and chat with you?

265
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,040
Please, have a seat.

266
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,640
Thank you.

267
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,880
I've heard about your sharp painting style, Miss Wan,

268
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,010
and seeing it today, your reputation is well-deserved.

269
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,640
I've noticed that your painting style

270
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,480
has undergone a transformation recently.

271
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,140
We know that

272
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,090
your father died in the hospital emergency room.

273
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,080
I heard the doctor's name was Hua Ming

274
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,960
and he and you...

275
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,560
I'm sorry,

276
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,000
but I don't want to answer this question.

277
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,480
Miss Wan, please don't worry.

278
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,940
Can we change the subject?

279
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,600
Recently, someone has been attacking Huaming Online,

280
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,440
accusing them of profiting from treating patients.

281
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,520
They're also questioning Huaming's

282
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,120
professional integrity as a medical expert,

283
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,240
calling him a fraud.

284
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,840
What's your opinion on this?

285
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,380
I have no authority to speak on medical matters.

286
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,120
But he has won numerous medical awards,

287
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
which I believe are all legitimate.

288
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,160
In my eyes,

289
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,740
Huaming is an honest, kind, and passionate person.

290
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,240
You think so highly of him,

291
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,890
so why did you give up on him?

292
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,680
Was it because of what happened back then?

293
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,920
I'm sorry, no comment.

294
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,160
Would you please leave?

295
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,960
Please leave.

296
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,480
Miss Wan.

297
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,940
Get out!

298
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,280
One last question - will you two ever get back together?

299
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,480
No. Never.

300
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,100
Are you satisfied now?

301
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,770
Why don't you try again?

302
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,130
Liu Wei definitely took the money and ran.

303
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,960
I'll go find her right now.

304
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll tell the police

305
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,040
that she forced you to do this.

306
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,640
Come back.

307
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,360
It's useless.

308
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,460
I, Jiang Kaiyang, schemed so carefully,

309
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,080
but in the end it was all for nothing.

310
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,040
This is just my fate.

311
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Kaiyang, I don't believe in fate.

312
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,280
Let's turn ourselves in.

313
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,520
The mortgage and Xiaoxiao's tuition,

314
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,450
I can handle it. I'll find a job.

315
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Chunli, you should still sign the divorce papers.

316
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,360
No, I won't sign.

317
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,810
Kaiyang.

318
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,980
I just think you're the one for me.

319
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,770
I don't care about anyone else.

320
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,500
I don't care how many years you're sentenced to,

321
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,160
three years, five years, ten years, eight years,

322
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
I'll wait for you.

323
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
When you come out,

324
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,520
when you return to this home,

325
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,690
the home will still be the same,

326
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,010
and I'll still be your wife.

327
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,320
Lili.

328
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,690
I'm sorry. All these years,

329
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
it's all my fault.

330
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,720
Don't say that.

331
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,010
I don't want to hear any of this.

332
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,040
Promise me

333
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,720
you'll behave well in there.

334
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,420
Don't think about anything else.

335
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,650
Just think about

336
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,680
the day you come out,

337
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,770
we'll have a good life together again.

338
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,280
We'll still be together.

339
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,290
Nobody's working anymore?

340
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,280
Hello?

341
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,160
Hello?

342
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,440
I'm from the city police department.

343
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,560
Your company has serious financial losses.

344
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,160
We've already submitted a bankruptcy application to the court.

345
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,250
And also,

346
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,760
after I'm gone,

347
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,370
no matter how tight money gets at home,

348
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,540
don't work yourself to death.

349
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,340
Your health is the most important thing,

350
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,760
especially at our age. Understand?

351
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,800
And in the future, no matter what,

352
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
if you encounter any difficulties,

353
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,490
go to Xinxin.

354
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,080
Discuss things with her.

355
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,770
That child can handle responsibilities.

356
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,960
Oh, right.

357
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,760
You must help me

358
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,530
explain clearly to Qin Gang

359
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,820
that his mother's death had nothing to do with Huaming.

360
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,060
He shouldn't take the blame for this.

361
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,120
And also,

362
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,620
That's enough.

363
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,090
No need for more instructions.

364
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,580
I'll take care of everything.

365
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
Don't worry.

366
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Trust me.

367
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,760
I need to contribute to this family too.

368
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,180
By the time you get out,

369
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,600
I'll make this home better than it is now.

370
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,080
I swear to heaven. I promise.

371
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,940
I'm turning myself in.

372
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,010
I want to turn myself in.

373
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,120
Vivi.

374
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:28,640
Vivi.

375
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,680
Vivi.

376
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,620
Liu Wei.

377
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,920
Liu Wei.

378
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,440
Liu Wei.

379
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,960
Liu Wei.

380
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Mr. Qin Gang?

381
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,200
Hello.

382
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm from the bank. These two are from the prosecutor's office.

383
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
The situation is this:

384
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,480
your mortgage has expired,

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,440
and according to the mortgage agreement,

386
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,520
we must legally repossess your house.

387
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,120
I never mortgaged this house!

388
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,050
Here are your mortgage documents.

389
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,690
They were processed by your agent Liu Wei.

390
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,160
She did this. It has nothing to do with me.

391
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,660
I'm sorry, Mr. Qin,

392
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
but we must follow the regulations.

393
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,480
What she did has nothing to do with me.

394
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,140
I didn't mortgage this house.

395
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,450
This house is mine. This is my home.

396
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,200
I'm afraid from today,

397
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,860
this house is no longer yours.

398
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,760
Xinxin.

399
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,400
Sis.

400
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,760
What's wrong?

401
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,520
Your brother-in-law

402
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
has turned himself in to the police.

403
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,660
What happened?

404
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,340
Liu Wei.

405
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,560
Where is Liu Wei?

406
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,920
She has already resigned.

407
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,360
What?

408
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,490
She's not here anymore.

409
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,600
Liu Wei.

410
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,360
Liu Wei.

411
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,400
Liu Wei.

412
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,040
Liu Wei.

413
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
So now Liu Wei and my brother-in-law

414
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,760
have emptied the Qin family's assets.

415
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,680
Yes.

416
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,520
And on the day when Mr. Qin collapsed,

417
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,760
I really did see Liu Wei

418
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,160
running out of her house.

419
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,720
Your brother-in-law prevented me from telling anyone before,

420
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,800
I had no choice.

421
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,440
But if I don't speak up now,

422
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,320
my conscience will haunt me for the rest of my life.

423
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,280
I can't let Huaming take the blame.

424
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,920
Huaming, can you come over?

425
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,280
Liu Wei, you bastard!

426
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,720
How have I wronged you?

427
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,540
Treating me like this.

428
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,840
Hey, Qin Gang.

429
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,080
Where are you?

430
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,440
Xinxin.

431
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,420
I'm such a fool.

432
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,160
I'm worse than a pig.

433
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,560
Where are you?

434
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,360
I should never have listened to Liu Wei.

435
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,210
And I shouldn't have betrayed you because of her.

436
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,400
I'm sorry.

437
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,890
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.

438
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
Only now do I understand.

439
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,520
Who truly loves me.

440
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,240
Thank you.

441
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,400
If there's another life.

442
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,250
I'll treat you well, I promise.

443
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,290
I'm leaving.

444
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,280
I'm going away now.

445
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,040
Hello?

446
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,440
Where is he?

447
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,260
He didn't say where he was.

448
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,320
But from the phone call,

449
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,180
he seemed emotionally unstable.

450
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,290
Sis, maybe I should go look for him.

451
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,320
What's wrong?

452
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,440
Something might have happened to Qin Gang.

453
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,720
Is Bao inside?

454
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,160
Wait a moment.

455
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,940
What are you doing?

456
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,520
No.

457
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Hurry up, Xinxin.

458
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,740
How could this happen?

459
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
Quick, make a call

460
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,440
to me.

461
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,660
Still powered off.

462
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
Why is he acting like a child?

463
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,340
Xinxin.

464
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,340
Do you think he went there?

465
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,890
Let's go.

466
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,360
Mom.

467
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,880
I'm sorry.

468
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,960
All the money you worked so hard

469
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,240
to earn for me,

470
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,600
I've wasted it all.

471
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,840
I'm such a disappointment.

472
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
I'm just a good-for-nothing.

473
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,800
I've let you down, Mom.

474
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,300
I'm coming to find you now.

475
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,980
Qin Gang's car is here.

476
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,330
Qin Gang!

477
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:39,880
Qin Gang!

478
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,140
Don't come any closer!

479
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,570
Qin Gang.

480
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,760
Don't do anything stupid.

481
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,690
Come down first.

482
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,600
Qin Gang.

483
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,880
Whatever it is, let's talk about it when we get back, okay?

484
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,140
There's no going back.

485
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,720
No way back.

486
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,000
It's all gone.

487
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,810
Everything is gone.

488
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,980
How bad can it be, Qin Gang?

489
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,780
You can start over with anything.

490
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,500
Nothing is more important than life.

491
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,200
I have nothing now.

492
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,960
I've lost everything.

493
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,760
You're a man, Qin Gang.

494
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,800
Listen.

495
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,700
Your son will start talking soon.

496
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,280
You've lost everything, yet you have everything.

497
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,200
Look at your son.

498
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,760
Turn around and look at him.

499
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,490
With him, you have everything.

500
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,360
You're only 30 years old.

501
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
They say a man should be established by 30.

502
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,560
Who says you have to stand tall at 30?

503
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,650
If you can't stand, then crouch or lie down first.

504
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,200
As long as you're alive, everything else will come.

505
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,130
Come down first.

506
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,770
Qin Gang.

507
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,050
You can't be so irresponsible.

508
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,760
Your son is watching you.

509
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,970
When he grows up and asks me,

510
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,300
where his father went,

511
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,080
what am I supposed to say?

512
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,490
Qin Gang.

513
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,930
You're the only family I have left now.

514
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,840
When your son grows up,

515
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,800
how would I explain to him if something happened to you?

516
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,660
You're the only family I have now.

517
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,780
Look, Qin Gang.

518
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,210
Look at your son.

519
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,400
Look at your baby boy. What are you doing, Qin Gang?

520
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,840
You scared me to death.

521
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,080
How could you even think like that?

522
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,000
If something happened to you, how could you face your son?

523
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,720
Please don't scare me like that.

524
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,930
Huaming, you go back first.

525
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,220
Lie down properly.

526
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,810
Qin Gang,

527
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,010
come, drink some water.

528
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,360
Thank you.

529
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,920
I must find her.

530
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,140
I won't let her get away with this.

531
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,200
I must find her.

532
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,640
Don't scare me, Qin Gang.

533
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
You really scared us to death today.

534
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You know, you're Xiaobao's father.

535
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,690
I won't allow you to have such thoughts again.

536
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,300
Did you hear me?

537
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,920
I must find her.

538
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,620
I won't let her get away with this.

539
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,420
Nothing is more important than life.

540
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,020
Money can always be earned again.

541
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,780
You can't give up on yourself.

542
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,800
Okay?

543
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,540
Where are you going, Qin Gang?

544
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,120
I'm going to find Liu Wei.

545
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,100
Where will you find Liu Wei this late?

546
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,000
You're staying here tonight.

547
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,460
Just make do for one night.

548
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
You can sleep on the couch.

549
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,220
Haven't you always wanted to play with your son?

550
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,560
Don't you miss him after not seeing him for so long?

551
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,040
Look at daddy.

552
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,700
Come, play with daddy for a while.

553
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,440
Look at your son, he's growing bigger and bigger.

554
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,170
He looks more and more like you.

555
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,000
His eyes and nose...

556
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,080
They look like they were carved from the same mold as yours.

557
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,800
You know?

558
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,740
He's already started eating solid food now.

559
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,320
You want to talk to daddy too, right?

560
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,520
Daddy, I know you're feeling terrible right now.

561
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,820
I know you're facing a big challenge.

562
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,050
But when we face difficulties, we overcome them.

563
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,480
There's no hurdle we can't get over, right?

564
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,560
You said when you grow up, you'll play with me, right?

565
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,370
Play soccer with me.

566
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,920
Right?

567
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Isn't that right?

568
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:03,980
Dr. Hua.

569
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,880
Dr. Hua, we finally meet you.

570
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,600
You got here quickly. Here again.

571
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,730
You're even faster.

572
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,199
You not only disclosed the surgical records,

573
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,320
but also all of Huaming Online's

574
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,980
financial accounts in the US.

575
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,320
Because what's fake can't become real, and what's real can't be faked.

576
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,040
It was very simple for me to do all this.

577
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
But if it was so simple,

578
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,159
why weren't you willing to do it before?

579
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,159
Doctors have their own principles.

580
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,679
Was it also based on principle when you treated

581
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,719
the criminal before

582
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,920
Wan Xinxin's father?

583
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,840
You're Reporter Chen, right?

584
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,159
Yes.

585
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,880
Reporter Chen, I want to ask you,

586
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,480
as a journalist,

587
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,560
do you find it particularly satisfying

588
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,600
to constantly pick at other people's wounds?

589
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,880
Actually, besides the truth,

590
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,719
we're more interested in the development

591
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,400
of your relationship with Wan Xinxin.

592
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,130
Could you talk to us about that?

593
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,080
Let me be frank with you.

594
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,440
Why would I discuss this with you?

595
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,000
I've told you,

596
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,199
this is a matter of my personal privacy.

597
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,360
Would you like to see the footage

598
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,620
of Wan Xinxin's interview this morning?

599
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,320
Please leave.

600
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,340
Never. Never ever.

601
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,720
Dr. Hua! Dr. Hua!

602
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,260
Everything has been explained clearly.

603
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,930
When are you planning to leave?

604
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,170
I wasn't planning to leave.

605
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,420
You came to say goodbye to me, didn't you?

606
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,930
If that wasn't the case,

607
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,890
I'd already be on the plane.

608
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,130
Then I'm sorry for delaying your trip.

609
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,940
I thought you would ask me to stay.

610
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,500
Because you've already forgiven me, right?

611
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,520
I asked you to stay before

612
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,210
completely for my own sake.

613
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,880
I didn't want others to say I had poor judgment,

614
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,540
that's all.

615
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,820
Now that everything has been explained,

616
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,540
you can leave anytime.

617
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,720
Xinxin.

618
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,520
I know you. When you say this,

619
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,890
you're just looking for a way to save face.

620
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,060
That's completely unnecessary.

621
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,760
You're overthinking it.

622
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,600
Why would I need to save face?

623
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,970
Everything I'm saying is true.

624
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,480
What about what you told the reporters?

625
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,360
That was all true too.

626
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,720
I've booked the tickets.

627
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,600
Xinxin.

628
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,900
Let's leave together.

629
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,810
Go to a new place.

630
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,320
We'll only bring good memories with us.

631
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,520
Leave all the unpleasantness behind.

632
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,770
We'll definitely overcome these shadows together.

633
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,780
I can't move past this.

634
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,490
You can get through this. Trust me.

635
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,810
Because between us,

636
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,600
you, me, and baby.

637
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,050
We were good together, weren't we?

638
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,650
Give me a chance.

639
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,600
Give us a chance.

640
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,740
I'm sorry, Huaming. I can't do it.

641
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,930
I just can't.

642
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,530
Give me a chance.

643
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Give us a chance.

644
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,120
I won't love again.

645
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,360
Spring flowers don't bloom for me.

646
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,800
Yet I happened to meet you

647
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,480
in this crowded sea of people.

648
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,400
I thought after all these changes,

649
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,160
my heart would never race again.

650
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,240
Yet I happened to meet you,

651
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,800
but I'm already gone.

652
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,360
Just go.

653
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,840
Believe in love.

654
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,880
Don't come looking for me anymore.

655
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,400
It's not that I don't want to love,

656
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,200
even though I've been hurt before.

657
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:44,200
Who can predict what fate has in store?

658
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,680
It's not that I don't want to love,

659
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,360
but love has become as vast as the ocean.

660
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,800
Perhaps I'm destined to wait a lifetime.

661
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,090
When he wakes up,

662
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,560
change his diaper.

663
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,530
The formula is here.

664
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,820
I'll be right back.

665
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Xinxin just left.

666
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,180
I came to check on the baby.

667
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,100
Have a seat.

668
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,400
So you're living here now?

669
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,090
We're making do for now.

670
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Qin Gang, can I ask you something?

671
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,250
Go ahead.

672
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,280
What is it?

673
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,680
If Liu Wei

674
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,680
came back now to apologize

675
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,800
and returned your money,

676
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,140
could you forgive her?

677
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,260
I would never forgive her.

678
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,560
Well,

679
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,200
it's just hypothetical.

680
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,680
What if she took your money

681
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,480
to make an investment,

682
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
and now that investment is profitable,

683
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,960
she returns triple the amount,

684
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,280
would you forgive her then?

685
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,010
Impossible.

686
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,940
After everything I've been through,

687
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,320
I finally understand

688
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
what my mother told me

689
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,410
all those years ago.

690
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,370
Money isn't important.

691
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,120
More or less, you can't take it with you when you die,

692
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,660
it's all just material possessions.

693
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,280
What matters is family, relatives, loved ones -

694
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,200
these are what truly matter.

695
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,340
Now, it doesn't matter if Liu Wei comes back,

696
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,330
or anyone else for that matter,

697
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,450
I will never leave Xinxin and the baby.

698
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,690
That's all I needed to hear.

699
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,400
Good.

700
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,680
I'm leaving next week.

701
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,440
I don't know when I'll be back,

702
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,920
or if I'll ever return.

703
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,760
So anyway,

704
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,500
my house will be empty.

705
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,130
It might as well be used.

706
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,040
You, the baby, and Xinxin

707
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
would be comfortable there.

708
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,080
I'd like that,

709
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,010
but I'm afraid Xinxin won't agree.

710
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:44,800
Li

711
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:46,800
Li

712
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:47,980
Wang Yaping

713
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,120
Li Wengang

714
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:49,800
