1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,360
Liu Wei

3
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,690
I've already promised you.

4
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,210
I'll leave as soon as possible.

5
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,600
Yes, tomorrow you'll take your precious son

6
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,280
and leave this city together.

7
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,740
Don't let me see you again.

8
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,680
And don't let me hear

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,480
anything about you from anyone.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,760
Right away.

11
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,840
Wan Xinxin, I'm warning you.

12
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,919
If you want to keep this child,

13
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,200
you'd better leave soon.

14
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,079
If Qin Gang fights you for custody,

15
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,720
I think for both of us,

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
there will be consequences.

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,040
Liu Wei, you're going too far.

18
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,840
What do you take us for?

19
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,960
You have to give me some time

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,440
to get settled.

21
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,120
Weiwei, what are you doing?

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,320
Nothing. I'm coming right away.

23
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,700
Let me warn you,

24
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,480
if you try any tricks this time,

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,520
I'll immediately send a legal notice to Shi Lu.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,800
Did you hear me?

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,920
Fine. I promise.

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,360
Darling, go to sleep.

29
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,440
What are you rustling about over there?

30
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,560
I'm talking to my lover on the phone.

31
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,730
Then why are you still here?

32
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,560
Go to him.

33
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
Why aren't you getting angry?

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,660
Do you have a lover too?

35
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,820
Tell me. Don't go to sleep.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,260
Stop it. I'm sleeping.

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
Stop sleeping. Get up.

38
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,440
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,960
Let me tell you about Wan Xinxin.

40
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,560
Local cucumbers and water celery. Very fresh.

41
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
Honey.

42
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,640
I don't want to eat today.

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Why don't you just go back first?

44
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,320
Miss Wan Xinxin, as a housekeeper,

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,640
I must fulfill my responsibilities.

46
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,760
Whether you eat or not is your business.

47
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,320
Whether I cook or not is mine.

48
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,250
Right, brother?

49
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,720
Alright, go sit over there.

50
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,600
Go sit down.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,920
Sit down.

52
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,399
You sit too.

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,079
Sit.

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,529
Chat with me for a while.

55
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,960
Don't go.

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,020
Let's talk.

57
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
What exactly do you want?

58
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,400
What grudge do you have against me?

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,530
Why are you trying to ruin me like this?

60
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Sit.

61
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,440
Sit down.

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,360
I just

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,680
don't like seeing you act that way.

64
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
I don't like it.

65
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,620
Did I ask you to like me?

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,330
Do I need your approval?

67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
What right do you have to control me?

68
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,280
I just don't like

69
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,760
the way you grovel to others.

70
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,480
That's not who you really are.

71
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,200
Don't you have any self-respect?

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,620
Self-respect?

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,360
You think I enjoy humiliating myself?

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,680
But there are over a dozen people in the company.

75
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,040
Do you want me to watch them all lose their jobs?

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,900
Let me tell you,

77
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,040
today is my last chance.

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,450
I absolutely cannot

79
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,080
watch over a decade of my hard work be destroyed in an instant.

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,880
My dignity isn't that precious.

81
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,600
Yes,

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,480
to me, you are.

83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,409
Everything about you is precious.

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,680
You...

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
Don't worry. With my promise,

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,730
I'll definitely help you solve this problem.

87
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,970
I think you've watched too many Hong Kong movies.

88
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,360
Not everything

89
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,740
can be solved with just your word.

90
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,800
Today you can indulge yourself

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,480
and show off your sense of justice.

92
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,340
Making yourself look very manly.

93
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,490
Tomorrow when you're sober, you'll be back to your heroic self.

94
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
But what about me?

95
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,400
I have to face a 2 million deficit.

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,520
I have to face a lawsuit

97
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,380
that could bankrupt the company.

98
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,760
Tell me, can this dignity you speak of

99
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,680
solve any of these problems?

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,160
Okay.

101
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,220
Let me tell you.

102
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,520
I'll sell my house.

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,320
Then give you the money.

104
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
That will solve the problem.

105
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:37,680
The key.

106
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,960
Oh right.

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,440
My key is

108
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,480
under the doormat at my front door.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,260
Nobody knows about it.

110
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,040
Come with me and take it now.

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,560
Yes, let's go.

112
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,020
Come with me. Let's go.

113
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,120
Sell the house quickly.

114
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,400
Dignity is something you earn yourself,

115
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,600
not just empty words.

116
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,250
Look at the state you're in.

117
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,840
All you do is shout slogans and pour out your feelings.

118
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,970
What else can you do?

119
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,760
You dare talk to me about dignity?

120
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,620
Are you worthy?

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,320
Lulu.

122
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,000
You have to believe me.

123
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,240
I like you.

124
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,240
I can help you.

125
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Just wait and see.

126
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,100
Wan Xinxin.

127
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,920
Xinxin, dinner's ready.

128
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,540
Time to eat.

129
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,000
I told you, I don't want to eat.

130
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,640
How will you have energy to take care of your baby brother if you don't eat?

131
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,040
Eat.

132
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,760
Don't want to.

133
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,980
What are you doing?

134
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,840
Come on, eat.

135
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,560
Hurry up and eat.

136
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,920
Hey, why are you throwing a tantrum?

137
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,380
Remember this.

138
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,440
You shouldn't just think about your own feelings.

139
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
You need to consider others' feelings too.

140
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,210
Eat slower. No one's fighting you for it. It's bad for your stomach.

141
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,679
You scolded me when I didn't eat.

142
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,559
Now you're scolding me again.

143
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,480
Should I eat or not?

144
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,880
Fine, I'll eat.

145
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,360
Keep eating while I talk.

146
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,240
So.

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,680
How's the lawsuit going?

148
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,860
They dropped the case.

149
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,280
That's our Xinxin.

150
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,220
Impressive, really impressive.

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
And also.

152
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,370
Those things Qin Gang gave you.

153
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,450
I accepted them on your behalf.

154
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,000
No, you shouldn't have.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,640
Keep eating. Don't look at me like that.

156
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
If you don't want these things,

157
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,840
we can donate them to children who need them more.

158
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,370
Right? It'll be a good deed.

159
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,400
Also, Qin Gang said

160
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,920
his mother is coming back and wants to see her grandson.

161
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,440
Right?

162
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,080
We can't keep her from seeing her grandson,

163
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,280
he didn't mean any harm, he was just a bit harsh with his words.

164
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,540
Try to understand him.

165
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,160
Starting tomorrow,

166
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,770
you don't need to come anymore.

167
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,560
It's not that.

168
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,520
I

169
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,810
can take care of my baby brother by myself now.

170
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
So you're not going to work anymore?

171
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,040
Nodding. Quitting your job?

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Listen, Xinxin.

173
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,940
Stop eating. Stop eating.

174
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
Still eating food I made.

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,440
Can't you be a little more reliable?

176
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,040
You've been unreliable since the day I met you.

177
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,280
You quit your job just like that.

178
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,940
You decide to resign on a whim.

179
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,000
You're not a carefree single woman anymore

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
who can do whatever she wants.

181
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,200
You have a child.

182
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,440
You're a mother.

183
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
How will you live?

184
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
How will you survive without a job?

185
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,740
How will you raise him?

186
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,560
Are you thinking about Xu Ke?

187
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,720
Having Xu Ke as a friend.

188
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,280
Living off her every day,

189
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
do you have the nerve?

190
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,690
Can you live like this forever?

191
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I don't want to lecture you, but

192
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,940
what are you thinking?

193
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,520
You haven't just met me.

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,600
I've always been unreliable.

195
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,730
Don't you know that?

196
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,840
What's wrong with relying on Xu Ke?

197
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,720
Am I relying on you?

198
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,320
I'm relying on Xu Ke, and she's willing to help.

199
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,840
Who do you think you are?

200
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,520
What right do you have to boss me around?

201
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,320
You're just a male nanny I hired.

202
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,840
Starting from now,

203
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,720
you're fired. I don't need you anymore.

204
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,520
Get out.

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Don't interfere with my life anymore.

206
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,330
Leave right now.

207
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,920
We're getting louder and louder.

208
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,360
The baby is sleeping.

209
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't worry about the child.

210
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,760
You won't need to take care of the baby anymore.

211
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,720
Leave now.

212
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,880
Go.

213
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,760
Let me see the baby.

214
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,720
You don't need to see the baby.

215
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,200
I want to see the baby.

216
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,600
No one is allowed to see my baby.

217
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,730
Close the door when you go downstairs.

218
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,960
Let me see the little one.

219
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,580
Wan Xinxin.

220
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,960
I don't even want to cook for you.

221
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,820
Let me tell you,

222
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
I cook and bring it upstairs for you.

223
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,760
Take it or leave it.

224
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,640
Listen to me.

225
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,000
I've already fed the baby 300 milliliters.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,360
Just feed him another 180. He's on stage two formula.

227
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,480
If you weren't so irritable,

228
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,680
if I really quit, you'll have to breastfeed him yourself.

229
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,720
Ming.

230
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,130
What's the rush?

231
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm just grabbing something.

232
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Oh, I need to tell you something.

233
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,160
Wan Xinxin was actually hacked.

234
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,280
Who did it? Why would anyone hack her?

235
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
It has something to do with Qin Gang.

236
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,420
Is this breakfast?

237
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
I'll have one too.

238
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,160
Wan Xinxin.

239
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,760
Madam.

240
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Stop yelling. I have your house key.

241
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,980
You came in.

242
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,940
Acting like this is your own home.

243
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,880
Xinxin.

244
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
Let me see her.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,520
Ming.

246
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,420
Later, tell Wan Xinxin

247
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,920
that I can definitely help her solve this problem.

248
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,480
Ming.

249
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,040
Mr. Shi.

250
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,040
Come in.

251
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,680
What is it?

252
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,920
The lawyer has been contacted,

253
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,050
but they need us to pay 30% as a deposit.

254
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,200
Then pay it.

255
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,960
But the money we advanced for the previous event

256
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,040
hasn't been recovered yet.

257
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,280
Right now our company account

258
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,210
has no available working capital.

259
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
You may leave now.

260
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,820
Wan Xinxin.

261
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,420
What are you doing?

262
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm sorry.

263
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,730
I mistook you for someone else.

264
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,450
I might have to break my promise this time.

265
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,080
I may need to leave for a while.

266
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,960
I promised I would always stay by your side.

267
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,760
But don't worry, I'll be strong.

268
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,240
Now I have your grandson with me.

269
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,840
I must stay strong.

270
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,600
Hello, Lady Company.

271
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,760
Mr. Shi, it's me,

272
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,240
Hui.

273
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,160
Hui, I'm so glad you contacted me.

274
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,200
I apologize for my poor hospitality last time.

275
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,930
Please give me another chance.

276
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,690
You're being very polite, Mr. Shi.

277
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,440
Please hear me out.

278
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,120
If your company withdraws the lawsuit,

279
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,050
we will do our best to compensate for all your losses.

280
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,640
Mr. Shi, you're really thorough.

281
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,200
We've already received the compensation.

282
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,680
I've called Mr. Li.

283
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,540
He's instructed that we drop the matter.

284
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,440
You received the compensation?

285
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,080
Yes.

286
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,200
Your boyfriend delivered it personally this morning.

287
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,130
Didn't you know?

288
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,200
My boyfriend?

289
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:47,980
Anyway,

290
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,880
I have another meeting to attend. Let's talk later.

291
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,880
I hope we can work together next time, okay?

292
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,440
Mr. Shi.

293
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,920
Mr. Shi.

294
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,760
UBay Group just called.

295
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,119
They've officially withdrawn their lawsuit against us.

296
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,200
Also,

297
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,960
two minutes ago our company account received money from

298
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,400
a private account under the name Xu Ke,

299
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,260
a transfer of 1.5 million in cash.

300
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,840
Wan Xinxin.

301
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,300
Wan Xinxin.

302
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,260
Why didn't you tell me when something happened?

303
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,720
No. Telling anyone about this is useless.

304
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,250
I have to solve this myself.

305
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,680
How will you solve it?

306
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,680
By running away with your child?

307
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,060
Is that your solution?

308
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,820
Where can you possibly run to?

309
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,120
No, if I stay here...

310
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,600
I can't let Mr. Shi's company go bankrupt.

311
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,560
But I also can't let Qin Gang

312
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,020
take my child away from me.

313
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,960
Do you think that by doing this

314
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,620
Shi Lu will be grateful to you?

315
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
If you do this,

316
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,520
you'll have a clear conscience?

317
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,900
You're forcing others to accept your kindness.

318
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,360
After you run away with the child,

319
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,420
the father will be gone from his life.

320
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,240
I'll just tell him

321
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,600
his father died when he was born.

322
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,060
That's called deception.

323
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,240
When the child grows up, he has the right to know his origins.

324
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,570
You can lie to yourself,

325
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,810
but you can't lie to him.

326
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,400
Because you're his mother.

327
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,000
You don't-

328
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:50,880
Hello?

329
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,760
She's right here with me.

330
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,140
Tell her yourself.

331
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,680
Xu Ke.

332
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,560
Xinxin, um...

333
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,600
I'm sorry.

334
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,680
I didn't discuss it with you,

335
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,120
but I've sold the house.

336
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,840
What?

337
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,440
But don't worry.

338
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
I've already spoken with the buyer.

339
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,280
You can stay for two more days,

340
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,290
we'll figure things out later.

341
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,960
However, after that,

342
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
you and your son will have to make do.

343
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,640
You can stay at my

344
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,490
small rented apartment, okay?

345
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,040
Alright, don't be so dramatic.

346
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,680
I need to pack for a business trip.

347
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,240
Wait until I get back.

348
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,760
Take good care of yourself and your son.

349
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,040
I got it.

350
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,400
No, but do you think this guy will be okay?

351
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,800
He sold his house to pay back Shi Lu's money.

352
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,200
So he's your bestie.

353
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,800
You two think exactly alike.

354
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,560
Oh no, how did I end up dragging him into this too?

355
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,400
Anyway,

356
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,880
what Xu Ke did was really decent.

357
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,930
Even if you're running away, you should thank him in person.

358
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,120
Hello, Mr. Shi.

359
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,880
Wan Xinxin, where is Xu Ke now?

360
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,520
You must help me find him.

361
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,120
I have something to tell him.

362
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,440
Is there an apartment building across from your place?

363
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,500
He should be there.

364
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,320
What? He lives across from us?

365
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,880
Are you crazy, Xu Huahua?

366
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,410
Why did you sell your house?

367
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,000
Um, Xinxin, I'm sorry.

368
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,460
What are you sorry for?

369
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
This has nothing to do with you.

370
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,760
No, I was the one who recommended this job to you.

371
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,320
If something goes wrong, I must take responsibility.

372
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,050
This has absolutely nothing to do with you, okay?

373
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,540
You can't say that.

374
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
You're my friend.

375
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,800
That person over there is my future lover.

376
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,240
And there's my godson too.

377
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,900
Both emotionally and rationally, I have responsibility in this.

378
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,600
Alright.

379
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,680
No more drama.

380
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,220
So here's the plan.

381
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,840
I just got a big job.

382
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,360
When I come back with the money,

383
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,720
we'll rent a bigger place. How's that?

384
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,080
Ming,

385
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,240
about the moving stuff,

386
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,800
please take care of it, okay?

387
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,860
Sure, don't worry.

388
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,920
My keys

389
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,800
are under the doormat at my place.

390
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,140
Nobody knows about it.

391
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,490
Is that okay?

392
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,440
Slow down.

393
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,080
Okay.

394
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,480
No, why don't you meet her later?

395
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,360
I won't.

396
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,340
Why not? Just meet her once before you go.

397
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,820
Forget it. Better not to meet.

398
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,600
No, wait!

399
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,530
I already told her you're here.

400
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,200
No, you...

401
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
Why do you always make things difficult for me?

402
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,080
She's my boss.

403
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,000
Look,

404
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,240
tell her later

405
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,120
that what I'm doing

406
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,850
isn't to win her over, you know?

407
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,920
No, how am I supposed to tell her?

408
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,800
Just meet her once before you go.

409
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,770
Look, you talk to her yourself.

410
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,680
You deliberately came to see me off.

411
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,680
Why did you do that?

412
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,180
Don't worry. It's not for you anyway.

413
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,920
I just want you to know

414
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
not all men are just smooth talkers.

415
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,440
You don't need to prove anything to me.

416
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,100
I don't need your help either.

417
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,130
Can you not be so intense when you talk?

418
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,250
Can you be a little gentler?

419
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,640
What does it matter to you whether I'm gentle or not?

420
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,760
Of course it matters.

421
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,420
I like you, so it matters to me.

422
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,280
I will never like you.

423
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,000
Don't think that by doing this,

424
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,930
I'll be touched.

425
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,120
Let me tell you, it's impossible.

426
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,720
I'm not trying to touch you either.

427
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
Me liking you is my own issue.

428
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,720
It has nothing to do with you.

429
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,050
And I'm not asking for anything in return.

430
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,240
Investing in something with no return?

431
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,400
Are you an idiot?

432
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,920
Love isn't an investment. Why be so smart about it?

433
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,490
Cat got your tongue?

434
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,600
Don't be so uptight. Relax.

435
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,210
I'll pay you back within three months.

436
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,980
I'll also pay you the appropriate interest.

437
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,400
That won't do.

438
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,320
Then I'd be working for nothing.

439
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,000
What else do you want?

440
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,240
Shares.

441
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:49,800
What?

442
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,200
I've wanted to invest for a long time.

443
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,480
But before, your company was so big.

444
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,800
So now when your company is at its most difficult time,

445
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,160
I'm taking advantage of the situation.

446
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,840
What's that professional term called?

447
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,770
Bottom fishing.

448
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,320
Then I'll become a shareholder in your company.

449
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,480
When your company develops well,

450
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,680
I'll rise to prosperity with it, right?

451
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,760
After that, I won't have to worry about my livelihood

452
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,760
and run around everywhere anymore.

453
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,000
Director Shi, do you agree with what I'm saying?

454
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,480
Fine. I'll give you a proportional share.

455
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,040
That's a must.

456
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,280
Well, I

457
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,280
will be a shareholder in your company from now on.

458
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,680
You're all my employees.

459
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,410
You all need to work hard for me.

460
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,920
Work harder and take good care of my little investment.

461
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,840
I'm counting on you all for the rest of my life.

462
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,020
Give me a break.

463
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,320
Hey, Ming.

464
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,520
So...

465
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
While I'm gone, I'm leaving these two in your care.

466
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,130
Take it easy.

467
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,680
He's gone.

468
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,560
Take care.

469
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,170
Just go already.

470
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,330
Wait for me to come back.

471
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,570
Go after him.

472
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,520
Xu Ke.

473
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,970
I'll see you off.

474
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,380
Great. That's wonderful.

475
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,760
If I don't personally see you off far away,

476
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,890
I won't feel at ease.

477
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,680
That's fine, that's fine. Whatever works.

478
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,960
Director Shi, slow down.

479
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,240
Goodbye.

480
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,130
Let's go.

481
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,940
This outcome is a bit unexpected.

482
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,040
Kaiyang.

483
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,490
Yesterday I heard you on the phone with Mr. Zheng.

484
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,920
He said their factory

485
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,240
wanted you to come by,

486
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
and they've kept a position for you.

487
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,560
It's just a small rundown machinery factory without even a Party committee.

488
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,680
What's the point?

489
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,040
Well...

490
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,640
I heard Liu's timber factory

491
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,880
is importing equipment to process wooden doors.

492
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,610
Why don't you go work with them?

493
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,050
I'm not a carpenter.

494
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,040
What would I do there?

495
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,680
Run errands? Sell doors?

496
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,680
What about Mr. Zhang's place?

497
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,040
Enough, Xu Chunli.

498
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,280
Do you feel

499
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,540
I'm in your way at home?

500
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,400
Listen to yourself.

501
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,320
I'd love for you to stay home with me all day.

502
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,320
But you can't just stay at home forever.

503
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,720
Why don't you find something to do first,

504
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,380
and if it doesn't work out, you can change later?

505
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,440
How's the relationship between Qin Gang

506
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,620
and Wan Xinxin now?

507
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,880
What do you expect?

508
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,560
Qin Gang keeps pestering Xinxin now,

509
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,980
wanting to see his son.

510
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,740
Serves him right. Now he cares about his son?

511
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,400
Where was he before? I won't let him see the boy.

512
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,080
That's not right, Xu Chunli.

513
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
We can't do that.

514
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,960
Even though they're divorced,

515
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,840
Qin Gang is still the child's father.

516
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,600
Not letting a father see his child

517
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,460
makes no sense. It's our mistake.

518
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,530
Why are you taking his side?

519
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,520
Have you forgotten how Qin Gang treated Xinxin before?

520
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
You don't understand. Since ancient times...

521
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,040
Get out of the way!

522
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,400
Since ancient times, people always advise reconciliation, not separation, right?

523
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,660
As her sister, you should be helping her.

524
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,640
What do you mean?

525
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,120
What I mean is that as her sister,

526
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,680
when Xinxin is in trouble,

527
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,610
you as her sister

528
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,560
should help her as much as you can.

529
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
For example, help her look after her child

530
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,980
to lighten her burden.

531
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,460
Shouldn't you do that?

532
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,840
You're right.

533
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,640
About that 100,000 yuan,

534
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,500
we really did wrong by Xinxin.

535
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,290
I'll go check on her in a bit.

536
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
Yes, exactly.

537
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,560
Hey,

538
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,100
do you understand?

539
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,040
Got it. I'll check on her later.

540
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,440
No, can you smile a bit?

541
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,680
Don't be so cold, okay?

542
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,900
It's just that you seem

543
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,540
like you're carrying some deep heartbreak.

544
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,920
You can tell me about it.

545
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,020
I can help you work through it.

546
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,890
Why are we stopping?

547
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,760
We haven't reached the airport yet.

548
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,180
What's wrong with you?

549
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,920
Even if you're a shareholder,

550
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,180
I'm not obligated to fake a smile for you.

551
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,280
I was just kidding.

552
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,420
Why are you upset? Look, you're angry again.

553
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,160
What I mean is,

554
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,880
someone like you must have either

555
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,720
lost your parents as a child,

556
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,600
or

557
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,400
met some jerk when you first fell in love,

558
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,800
completely destroying your beautiful outlook on the world.

559
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,610
You want to hear a story, right?

560
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,560
Well, I have an even more touching story.

561
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,080
Would you like to hear it?

562
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,240
Of course.

563
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,610
Go ahead and tell me.

564
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,420
Now is the perfect time for us to open our hearts.

565
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,180
Do you want to walk to the airport?

566
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,760
Is that the story?

567
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,520
That's it.

568
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,920
It's over.

569
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,760
No,

570
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,260
no, that's just...

571
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,320
so boring.

572
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,210
How awkward. You really are...

573
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,120
You're finally smiling when you're with me.

574
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,960
Look how beautiful your smile is.

575
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,000
When you're with me in the future,

576
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,660
could you smile a little more?

577
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,720
What? The lawsuit was withdrawn?

578
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,890
What's going on?

579
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Vivi, are you ready?

580
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,000
I'll be right down. Go start the car first.

581
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,730
Then I'll bring the car around.

582
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,760
How do you people work?

583
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,200
Alright. Let's leave it at that.

584
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,320
Sunbathing for calcium.

585
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,560
Come, get some sun.

586
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,170
You shouldn't expose your eyes to the sun.

587
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,100
The problem is solved now.

588
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
Does that mean I don't have to leave?

589
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,320
No need to leave.

590
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,160
Hey!

591
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,810
You're something, Wan Xinxin.

592
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,940
I really underestimated you.

593
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,450
But don't get too cocky.

594
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,700
Even if you escaped this time, there will be a next time.

595
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,130
As long as you stay here,

596
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,960
you'll never have peace.

597
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,640
Mister.

598
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,440
I still have to leave. Don't worry about me.

599
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,560
No, no, no, no.

600
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,220
Isn't the problem solved?

601
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,040
If it's solved, then don't go.

602
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,120
No, you don't understand.

603
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,400
The ENUE issue isn't resolved at all.

604
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,680
The problem isn't solved at all.

605
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,960
If I don't leave, they won't let this go.

606
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,490
I can't let them take my baby brother away.

607
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,000
Just stop worrying about me.

608
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,920
No, no, no.

609
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,480
Listen to me, Wan Xinxin.

610
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,920
It's exactly because they won't give up.

611
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,560
That's why you shouldn't be running away now.

612
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,219
You should be defeating them.

613
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
How can I defeat them?

614
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,500
I have nothing now.

615
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,120
I don't even have a job.

616
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,960
I'm just a burden.

617
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,139
I have to leave.

618
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,320
Fine, fine.

619
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,330
Listen to me.

620
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,719
Wan Xinxin, why do you always do this?

621
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,719
No, you run away whenever you face a problem.

622
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,440
You just run when there's trouble.

623
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,040
You won't survive anywhere.

624
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,600
You know that, right? And you have your baby brother with you.

625
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,560
I can survive on my own.

626
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,480
I'll come back someday.

627
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,520
I'll make everyone look at me with new eyes.

628
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,920
Fine. Let's talk when that day comes, okay?

629
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,300
Stop interfering.

630
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,679
You may control me for now,

631
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,080
but can you control me forever? Move aside.

632
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,480
Xinxin.

633
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,040
What are you two doing here?

634
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,000
I could see you two tugging at each other from far away.

635
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,930
What's going on?

636
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,520
Why are you here?

637
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,760
Your brother-in-law said we've been unfair to you.

638
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,040
So he asked me to come check on you

639
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,770
and help take care of the child.

640
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,720
No need. I'm already preparing to leave.

641
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,850
Where are you going?

642
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,600
Sister.

643
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,160
Hello.

644
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,240
Um, could you please watch the child?

645
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,960
Where are you two going?

646
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,520
Baby, it's just the two of us now.

647
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,200
Let's go home.

648
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,970
Enjoy the sunshine.

649
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,640
Be happy.

650
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,930
Wait, where exactly are you taking me?

651
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,480
Alright, Wan Xinxin.

652
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,080
I know I'm nobody important,

653
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,040
but considering I'm much older than you,

654
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,370
I'm like an elder to you.

655
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Besides, I didn't invite you

656
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,400
to hide in my car trunk.

657
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,160
Since we've met, it must be fate.

658
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,960
Didn't you say

659
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,000
you could prove you can live independently?

660
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,880
If you can prove your independence,

661
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,940
then I'll let you go with my blessing.

662
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,240
But if you can't prove it,

663
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,120
sorry, I'll stick to you like glue,

664
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,980
not letting go.

665
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,700
Zhiji Pet Hospital

666
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,080
Come on. We're here.

667
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,880
Where is this?

668
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,480
Come on.

669
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,280
No.

670
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,140
Where are we going?

671
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
Listen, Miss Wan Xinxin.

672
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,720
Don't worry.

673
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,440
Our brother Ming is our pet hospital's

674
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,920
famous confidant.

675
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,600
Whether it's for dogs or people,

676
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,820
everything gets sorted out with him.

677
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,760
No.

678
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,050
See these iron bars?

679
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,410
Our brother Ming calls it the Gate of Life.

680
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,680
You go in as a young girl,

681
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,340
you come out as a mature woman.

682
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,800
No, no.

683
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,040
Don't worry, he misspoke.

684
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,400
You go in as a young girl,

685
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,760
and come out as a more mature young lady.

686
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,290
Right, a mature young lady.

687
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,600
A young man goes in, an old man comes out.

688
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,980
Stop the nonsense.

689
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,280
Let's go in then.

690
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,200
Alright.

691
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,930
Wait, don't you know the rules?

692
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,400
What do you mean?

693
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,000
The bag.

694
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,400
No way.

695
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,200
Phone.

696
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,920
You're out of money, aren't you? Do you have any?

697
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,780
I have nothing.

698
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,600
Check your pockets for money.

699
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,640
No, I have nothing.

700
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,840
Why are you taking my bag?

701
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,480
Get us another bottle of water.

702
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,410
Our rule is just one bottle. Sorry.

703
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,240
Make do with it.

704
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,920
Let's go.

705
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:33,800
Okay.

706
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,840
The usual place.

707
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,280
Fine.

708
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,640
Liu Chang, don't go! Wait.

709
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,320
See you tomorrow.

710
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,720
Wait, where are we going?

711
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,640
Hey, where are you taking me?

712
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,480
What are you doing?

713
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,160
Get in.

714
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,640
I can't go in.

715
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,160
You can't escape. You can't beat me anyway.

716
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,960
Hurry, get in!

717
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,890
Go ahead and eat.

718
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,570
Hurry up.

719
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:53,920
Is it good?

720
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,450
Why is he calling me?

721
00:37:59,480 --> 00:37:59,840
Who?

722
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,300
Jiang Kaiyang.

723
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Hello. What is it?

724
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,160
Qin Gang, I have the child with me.

725
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,000
What? The child is with you?

726
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,010
I know you really want to see the child.

727
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,920
It's only natural.

728
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,580
I know Xinxin's temperament better.

729
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,840
After all, we used to be

730
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,440
close relatives, right?

731
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,720
What I'm suggesting is

732
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,640
that we should meet up.

733
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,240
Can we talk?

734
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,320
I think I might be able to help you.

735
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,080
Just you wait.

736
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,850
What's going on?

737
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,400
The baby just had milk.

738
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,320
Already fed.

739
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,640
Baby.

740
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,090
Who are you calling?

741
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,200
Qin Gang.

742
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,980
I asked you to come help me.

743
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,600
Why are you calling him?

744
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,120
Xu Chunli, let me ask you something.

745
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,760
Don't you want Wan Xinxin to have a good life?

746
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Of course I do.

747
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,240
That's good.

748
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,440
I just called Qin Gang to come see the baby.

749
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,840
What did you say? No way!

750
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,200
Xu Chunli, let me ask you something.

751
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Is this child Qin's flesh and blood?

752
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,050
Isn't it?

753
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,240
If the Qin family acknowledges him, then in the future...

754
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,170
The baby will have a share of the Qin family's assets.

755
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,360
If you keep preventing him from seeing the child...

756
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,480
He might get tired of it eventually.

757
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,040
And he might not want this child anymore.

758
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,400
What will happen to Xinxin then?

759
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Won't it be all effort and no reward?

760
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,040
Raising a child for nothing.

761
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Isn't that right?

762
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,290
How could it be for nothing?

763
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,570
Who would abandon their own child?

764
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,600
Wrong.

765
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,120
Wrong. Xu Chunli...

766
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,180
Let me tell you.

767
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,600
People are emotional creatures, right?

768
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,800
But if someone doesn't invest emotionally...

769
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Then there's even less connection.

770
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,460
Let me give you an example.

771
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,480
Throughout Chinese history, emperors of any dynasty...

772
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,800
Had many children and grandchildren.

773
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,760
But they didn't necessarily like them all.

774
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,640
Only one would succeed to the throne.

775
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,840
A man like Qin Gang...

776
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,240
Women are constantly crying and begging...

777
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,640
To have his children. There are plenty of them.

778
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,000
If you don't quickly...

779
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,500
Get Qin Gang to invest his emotions in this child...

780
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,720
Someone else will definitely take his place in the future.

781
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,640
You mean...

782
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,330
You really want to give this child to Qin Gang?

783
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,980
Give him the child? That would ruin our plan.

784
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,930
Let him see the child but not raise him.

785
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,720
Understand?

786
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,210
That's how we'll keep him interested.

787
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

788
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,960
It's a universal principle.

789
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,760
Think about it. Let it sink in.

790
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,450
What twisted logic is this?

791
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,530
Listen to me. When Qin Gang arrives...

792
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,130
Don't get upset.

793
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,960
You must consider the bigger picture. Understand?

794
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,160
Why don't you go back first?

795
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,180
I'll wait for you here.

796
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,200
Alright. I'll go up and say a few words, then come back down.

797
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,730
Go ahead.

798
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,940
I'm not really targeting Wan Xinxin.

799
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,960
I won't neglect the child either.

800
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,960
It's just that Wan Xinxin keeps making trouble for no reason.

801
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,880
She initially agreed

802
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,480
to let my mother see the child.

803
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,960
But now she's changed her mind

804
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,600
making me look bad to everyone.

805
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,760
You can see the child whenever you want?

806
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,090
When you abandoned her,

807
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,400
did you ever think about whether you were being human or not?

808
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,920
I believe that when it comes to relationships,

809
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,880
they're not one-sided, right?

810
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,400
What's most important now is

811
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,200
how to ensure this little baby

812
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,200
grows up happy and healthy. Don't you agree?

813
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,360
Come.

814
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,200
Look how adorable.

815
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,400
Yes.

816
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,280
Now as long as we can let my mother

817
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,360
fulfill her wish.

818
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,720
You can do whatever you want.

819
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,640
As long as the baby is well,

820
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,290
I'm fine with anything.

821
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,160
Yes, that's for sure, right?

822
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,840
Look, this is how things stand now.

823
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,480
In the future, this child will definitely be

824
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,400
taken care of by his sister, right?

825
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,720
Well, it's like this.

826
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,000
No matter if in the future you

827
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,840
or your mother want to see the child,

828
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,570
just let us know in advance.

829
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,890
After you tell us in advance, we can

830
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,960
create time and opportunity for you.
