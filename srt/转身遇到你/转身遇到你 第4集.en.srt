2
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
Sir, please take it slow.

3
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,479
Miss.

4
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,080
Thank you.

5
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,360
Dr. Hua, thank you for your trouble.

6
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,680
Sir, for the remaining matters, please follow Liu Chang's guidance.

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,920
He knows what to do.

8
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,090
Please accept my condolences.

9
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,160
I'll take care of everything else.

10
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
You all can go now.

11
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,280
Alright. Thanks, Liu Chang.

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,640
Okay.

13
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
That was quick. No way.

14
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,920
I sent it.

15
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,260
What are you trying to say?

16
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,890
I don't mean anything else.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,560
I just want justice.

18
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,880
Child support, emotional damages,

19
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,880
and compensation for Xinxin's lost youth.

20
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,640
I won't settle for less on any of them.

21
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Bring 100,000 yuan to the children's park to meet me.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Or you'll never see the child again.

23
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,960
Hello? Hello?

24
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,860
You really can understand what dogs say.

25
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,880
But anyway,

26
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,480
thank you.

27
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,880
Thanks for coming up with this idea to make the elderly happy.

28
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,640
This wasn't my idea.

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,920
My dad taught me all this.

30
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,400
Your dad?

31
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,280
Yes.

32
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,840
Do you want to hear his story?

33
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,200
My mom died when I was born.

34
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,079
I was raised by my dad alone.

35
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
When I was little,

36
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,440
I saw other kids had mothers.

37
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,240
So I asked my dad, 'Where is my mom?'

38
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
My dad said,

39
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,580
'You and your mom are both angels.

40
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,280
If two angels were both on Earth,

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,560
heaven would be lonely.

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,240
The sky wouldn't be beautiful anymore,

43
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,760
so I sent her up there.'

44
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,380
When I was little, my dad got sick.

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,420
I was too young to understand.

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,440
I said, 'Dad, why are you sweating?'

47
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,000
My dad said, 'I'm sending you energy,

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,040
I want you to grow up quickly.'

49
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,480
When I was little, after school

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,340
he would always come to pick me up.

51
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,400
He would carry me on his back all the way home.

52
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,320
He said he would carry me

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,600
until my wedding day.

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,770
He would help me find a new angel to take care of me.

55
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,520
But before my wedding day came,

56
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,020
he had an accident and left us.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,680
You said I like to lie, right?

58
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,800
Actually, my dad was the real liar.

59
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,720
He created a fairy tale world for me

60
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,680
and then he disappeared.

61
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,160
But even though he's gone,

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
I still believe

63
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,920
fairy tales still exist.

64
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,360
You know what?

65
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,320
When I came to see you today,

66
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,680
I was in a really terrible mood.

67
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,380
But after talking about all this,

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,640
I realized

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I feel better now.

70
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm honored to listen.

71
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm glad you're feeling better.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
By the way, I need to apologize to you.

73
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,280
I wasn't in a good mood at the pet hospital,

74
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,700
so I wasn't very nice when talking to you.

75
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,640
It's okay.

77
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,700
Wan Xinxin, you know what?

78
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,000
I think you're

79
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,880
a very kind girl.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,480
I really want to see you doing well

81
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,410
and being happy.

82
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,760
So if we're friends,

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,020
I'd like to share some honest thoughts with you.

84
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,160
Honest thoughts?

85
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,890
But you can't get angry.

86
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,840
Go ahead.

87
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,010
Alright, here goes.

88
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,840
I think...

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,200
Between you and your ex-husband,

90
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
I think what you did was a bit too much.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,400
I went too far?

92
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,960
A bit.

93
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,840
He cheated first.

94
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,320
You didn't see him with that homewrecker,

95
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,960
hugging intimately.

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, yes.

97
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,720
When problems arise in a marriage,

98
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,760
it's not about who's right or wrong.

99
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,280
It's really just two people hurting each other.

100
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,760
Yes, you young people nowadays,

101
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,880
there's a saying among you that goes...

102
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,320
To get by in life, you might have to wear some horns.

103
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,640
Your ex-husband took a brush

104
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,480
and painted a little green on your face.

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,160
But you dumped an entire bucket of green paint over his head.

106
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,600
What man, upon learning his wife

107
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,440
is pregnant with someone else's child,

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,800
wouldn't have a strong reaction?

109
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
I think his reaction is actually quite mild.

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,880
So I think you went a bit too far.

111
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,280
Actually, this matter is quite simple.

112
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,410
You could just apologize to him and...

113
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,600
So that's what you think of me.

114
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,640
No, it's just that day...

115
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,540
I used to thank you for helping me.

116
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,000
From now on,

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,930
I won't disturb your life anymore.

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,440
Wan Xinxin!

119
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,900
Wan Xinxin!

120
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
Didn't you say you wouldn't get angry?

121
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
Leave me alone!

122
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,320
Wait...

123
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,180
And to think I trusted you so much.

124
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,320
Hey, I'm at the park. Where are you?

125
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,720
I can see you.

126
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,640
Turn around.

127
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,120
Do you see a flower bed?

128
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,810
What's going on?

129
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,370
Go to the flower bed.

130
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,640
Okay, I'm at the flower bed now.

131
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,360
Go left.

132
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,600
No, go right.

133
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,240
What next?

134
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,240
Good. Stay there.

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,840
Where's the money?

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,640
It's in my hand.

137
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,159
Who are you trying to fool?

138
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,960
How do I know if you're holding money or just paper?

139
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,960
How can I prove it?

140
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,960
Show me one stack first.

141
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,560
Let me see.

142
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
Take the stack at the bottom.

143
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,560
Hold it higher.

144
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,280
Can you see it?

145
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,680
Put it back.

146
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,840
See that path in front of you?

147
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,420
Keep walking straight ahead.

148
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
All the way to the end.

149
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,400
Go to the end. I'll call you again later.

150
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,280
Hello? Hello?

151
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Hey, I'm here.

152
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,960
Look up. Do you see a kneeling woman?

153
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,640
A kneeling woman?

154
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,720
I don't see any.

155
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,050
How can you miss such a big kneeling woman?

156
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Oh, you mean that statue?

157
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,520
Yes. Stay right where you are.

158
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,280
Put the money in the trash can.

159
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,880
Turn around.

160
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,360
Do you see a white sign?

161
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,960
Yes, there's a warning sign.

162
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,800
Right, that's the one.

163
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
Stay right there.

164
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll be there soon.

165
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,680
Bao, we won!

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
Let's go.

167
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,040
Push.

168
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,380
Now, change your pose.

169
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,960
Great, that's good.

170
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,720
Let your hair down. Yes, that's it.

171
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,180
Right, like that. Come on.

172
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,200
Good. Nice. Take a break.

173
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,810
Um, you guys wait here for a moment.

174
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Hello, sir. Who are you looking for?

175
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
The woman who just went in is my friend.

176
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,160
Which building does she live in?

177
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,680
I'm sorry, this is a private residence.

178
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,880
We can't disclose client information.

179
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,960
Sir, can I help you?

180
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm waiting for someone.

181
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,760
Could you please wait somewhere else?

182
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,800
This is my post.

183
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,890
What's going on?

184
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,760
What are you doing?

185
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
Nobody followed you,

186
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,080
did they?

187
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,450
Come, I need to tell you something.

188
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,280
What's with all the secrecy?

189
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,920
I stood up for you today.

190
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,080
I...

191
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh my!

192
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,740
Why is there so much money?

193
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,250
Where did you get this from?

194
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,040
Fresh from this morning.

195
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,360
How about that? Smart, aren't I?

196
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,410
What did you do this for?

197
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,920
This is to support you and your son.

198
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,560
Don't tell me you went to see Qin Gang today.

199
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,180
You should have seen that bastard today.

200
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,480
I pushed him right into the lake.

201
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,610
He swallowed a lot of water down there.

202
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
Sis, you've really lost your mind.

203
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,020
Why did you go looking for him?

204
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,920
You need to return

205
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,450
this money to him right now.

206
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,820
What's going on? You don't want to return it?

207
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,840
If you won't,

208
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,720
I'll burn this money myself.

209
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,020
Burning money is illegal.

210
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,800
Oh please! Fraud is illegal too.

211
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,080
You... just look at you.

212
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,440
You're all grown up but still so stubborn.

213
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,840
Fine, I'll return it.

214
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,680
Did you change your SIM card?

215
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,160
Yes.

216
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,360
Look at you. What happened?

217
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Genetic markers.

218
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,760
Is this report real?

219
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,800
I've checked with the hospital.

220
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,460
Xiaobao is definitely my son.

221
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
Have you seen Wan Xinxin?

222
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,880
She refuses to see me.

223
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,160
She even threatened that

224
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
if I tried to find her,

225
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,600
she would take Xiaobao and disappear,

226
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,130
so I'd never see them again.

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,800
If she really wanted to leave,

228
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,840
why would she let you know

229
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,440
that the boy is your biological son?

230
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,480
Then why is she putting me through all this?

231
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
Is it just to divorce me?

232
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
Speak of the devil.

233
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,240
Hello, Mom.

234
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,960
You brat! You finally answered your phone.

235
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,680
Is something wrong?

236
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,720
Are Xinxin and my grandson okay?

237
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,120
Everything's fine.

238
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Don't try to fob me off with those words every time.

239
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,120
Of course nothing could be wrong.

240
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,450
If anything were wrong,

241
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,760
I'd find out as soon as I get back.

242
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,920
You're coming back? When?

243
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,640
I'm actively getting treatment here.

244
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,720
As soon as they clear me to leave,

245
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
I'll buy a ticket and come right back.

246
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,320
Bye now.

247
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,280
Hello? Hello?

248
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,000
What's wrong now?

249
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,560
My mother could come back any time now.

250
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,960
Once she's back, she'll find out I'm divorced

251
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,440
and don't have custody of my child.

252
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,840
I'm completely done for.

253
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,480
This isn't really your fault.

254
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,210
Wan Xinxin deceived you first.

255
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
But my mother doesn't know any of this.

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,240
She'll think it doesn't matter

257
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,700
and that it's all my fault.

258
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,040
Then go win her back.

259
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,520
If I could persuade her to come back,

260
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I would have done it already.

261
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,920
Would we be divorced now?

262
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,480
Yes,

263
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,760
you shouldn't have gotten divorced.

264
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,020
It's all because of me.

265
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,320
Weiwei, that's not what I meant.

266
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,880
I know.

267
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,400
If this child isn't yours,

268
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
you can still explain it to your mother.

269
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,680
Then we can be happy

270
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,210
and live together in bliss.

271
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,480
But now?

272
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,080
You're caught between these two women.

273
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,690
How could I make things harder for you?

274
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Don't worry.

275
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,480
Actually, there's no woman

276
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
who doesn't want her ex to come back.

277
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,000
Go sweet-talk her. There must be a way.

278
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,200
Silly.

279
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,080
As long as you have me and I have you,

280
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,040
nothing else matters.

281
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,920
Weiwei, don't worry.

282
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,690
Now that you've come back to me,

283
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,130
I won't let you go again.

284
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,119
Listen, Xu Chunli.

285
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm the kind of person

286
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,660
who doesn't mind having some plain noodles for breakfast.

287
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,080
But you could fry an egg,

288
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,610
it's not that much trouble.

289
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:36,840
Look.

290
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,650
Where did all this money come from?

291
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,000
This is what Qin Gang gave to Wan Xinxin

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
as compensation for wasting her youth.

293
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
What do you think?

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Let me tell you about these young people nowadays.

295
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,320
They make such a big deal about love.

296
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,960
All this talk about romance.

297
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,200
And then what happens after they break up?

298
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,560
They still use money to solve their problems.

299
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,800
How is that any different from prostitution?

300
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,760
You know what?

301
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,360
Xinxin actually refused it.

302
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
She asked me to return it to Qin Gang.

303
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,720
But this... don't you think she's crazy to turn down

304
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,360
100,000 yuan?

305
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,840
100,000.

306
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,120
Your Wan Xinxin has quite a high level of awareness.

307
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,720
What's the use of awareness?

308
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,080
She's lost her job now,

309
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,120
and she has a child to raise.

310
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,980
How will she manage in the future?

311
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,240
So what are you planning to do?

312
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,250
I definitely need to return it.

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,080
What's going on

314
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,240
with you?

315
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm telling you, you women

316
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,680
have no flexibility at all.

317
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,250
What did I teach you?

318
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,440
Think about it. Someone with Wan Xinxin's personality

319
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,640
is bound to get into trouble wherever she goes.

320
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
If she doesn't have this money with her,

321
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
in case of an emergency or disaster.

322
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,000
Look, you can just

323
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,460
hold onto this money for Qin Gang for now.

324
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,640
When Xinxin finds a job,

325
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,600
you can return it to him. Isn't that better?

326
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
That's true.

327
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,200
Right?

328
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,560
See? You should be the department head.

329
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
You're smart and have a system.

330
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,800
Hello? Security?

331
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,800
I'm a resident. I think there's a creep following me.

332
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,960
Please remove him immediately.

333
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,290
What are you doing here?

334
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,690
Get up. What's going on?

335
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,980
What's this all about?

336
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,480
I'm not drunk.

337
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,200
Nobody said you were. Why is it you again?

338
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm waiting for someone.

339
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,280
Waiting for whom?

340
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,080
It's the middle of the night. You might as well be waiting for ghosts.

341
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,040
Oh my!

342
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,120
No, she came back.

343
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,680
You didn't even tell me.

344
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,320
I just told you, didn't I? Go home now.

345
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,960
Go away.

346
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,920
I told you to go back right now.

347
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,840
Let me take a look.

348
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,320
Go, hurry up.

349
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
How annoying.

350
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Who's annoying?

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,930
So you're really going for it, huh?

352
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
No, Xu Ke.

353
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,480
Stop it, stop it.

354
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,120
Listen to me.

355
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,920
How annoying.

356
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,880
You don't even know her name.

357
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,360
You don't know if she lives in that apartment.

358
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,420
Yet you're waiting for her to show up.

359
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,600
As they say, sincerity can pierce through stone.

360
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,400
My approach might be clumsy.

361
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,880
But I believe heaven

362
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,360
will be moved by my sincerity.

363
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,880
And give me another chance to see her.

364
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,320
You're really hopeless.

365
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,720
I am hopeless.

366
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,200
I'm telling you, in this world right now,

367
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,240
only she can save me.

368
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,040
Baby, look at your godfather.

369
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,480
Quick, look at your godfather.

370
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,760
That pathetic look on his face.

371
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,290
Isn't it exactly like how mommy was back then?

372
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,120
Go on. Go find your true love.

373
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,440
You're being so reasonable today.

374
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,360
Not picking on people anymore?

375
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,720
If you dare to die, I dare to bury you.

376
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,920
What about you and the baby after I'm gone?

377
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
Don't worry about me at all.

378
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,880
Let me tell you who I, Wan Xinxin, really am.

379
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,480
I'm Wan Xinxin, a star in the PR industry.

380
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,720
You think just because Lady doesn't want me,

381
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,760
no other company will?

382
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,220
Plenty of companies are lining up to hire me.

383
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,800
Here, take this.

384
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
That's a lot of money.

385
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,580
This is the money from selling your bags.

386
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,040
I was worried it wouldn't be enough, so I added a bit more.

387
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,280
Listen, Xinxin.

388
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,730
I've already paid your utilities.

389
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,200
This is living expenses for you and Bao.

390
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,680
No buying bags.

391
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,800
I won't.

392
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,640
Taobao.

393
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,120
I won't, I won't, I won't.

394
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,570
I'll cut my hands off if I buy anything.

395
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,080
Xu Huahua.

396
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,680
Thank you.

397
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,320
Enough.

398
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,000
Stop with the fake sentimentality.

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,800
Let me tell you, this money is just a loan.

400
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,320
You need to pay me back.

401
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,280
If you really want to thank me,

402
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,800
make yourself look presentable,

403
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,930
go out and find a job,

404
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,680
and then earn money to support your family.

405
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,160
Maybe you'll even hook a rich husband,

406
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,080
and I'll be set for the rest of my life.

407
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,960
Don't worry.

408
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,220
As long as you don't let love destroy you,

409
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,000
stick with me,

410
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,330
and you'll have plenty of good days ahead.

411
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,040
Alright.

412
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,080
Your Highness, I'll take my leave now.

413
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,780
Take care of yourself.

414
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,160
I'm off now. Starting my journey of love.

415
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,240
Are you...

416
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,170
Who are you looking for?

417
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,600
Who are you?

418
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,690
I'm the owner of this house.

419
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,580
You must be Mrs. Jiang.

420
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,680
Who are you? What business do you have with him?

421
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,940
My name is Shen. Director Jiang knows me.

422
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,720
Well, since Director Jiang isn't home,

423
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,920
I think I'll come back another day.

424
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,360
Wait.

425
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,000
You can tell me whatever you would tell him.

426
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,760
Please tell him

427
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,120
about what Director Jiang promised me.

428
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,480
I've been waiting for his response.

429
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,740
Please ask him to let me know as soon as possible. Thank you.

430
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,640
Liu Chang.

431
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,970
I was just about to call you when you showed up.

432
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,840
Come in.

433
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
It's all my fault.

434
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,690
You know that

435
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,680
according to regulations, animals that die in our hospital

436
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
must be cremated.

437
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,040
But this old man

438
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,000
absolutely refused to let me cremate his dog

439
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,840
and insisted I bury it in their yard.

440
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,240
I had already taken the dog to the crematorium,

441
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,640
but I had to bring it back.

442
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,460
Who would have thought the Health Department found out

443
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,880
and said we violated regulations

444
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,080
so they shut us down for rectification.

445
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,400
Well done, Liu Chang.

446
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,960
In my eyes, you're just a crooked businessman.

447
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,490
I can't believe you'd do something like this.

448
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,800
Let me tell you, I thought my heart

449
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,040
was made of stone, completely impenetrable.

450
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,320
But who would have thought

451
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,650
that after the little girl made such a fuss

452
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,080
I got a bit emotional too.

453
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,660
I just indulged myself this one time.

454
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,410
So what's your plan now?

455
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080
It's fine. We all get to take a vacation anyway.

456
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,860
Let me tell you,

457
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,360
just forget about it all.

458
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,530
Don't overthink it.

459
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,300
I'm off.

460
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,240
Xu Chunli.

461
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,120
Xu Chunli.

462
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,810
She went to bed so early.

463
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,880
So you finally decided to come home.

464
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,140
I had to work overtime.

465
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,580
Working overtime or fooling around?

466
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,240
Don't be unreasonable.

467
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,480
I've been working hard all day.

468
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,820
Could you make me a cup of tea, please?

469
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,770
What's going on?

470
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,760
Why are you just standing there?

471
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,080
Look at this mess in your room.

472
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,960
You didn't even clean up.

473
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,360
You have hands and feet. Clean it yourself.

474
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,400
I'm not your maid.

475
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,480
What's wrong with you?

476
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,930
Did you take the wrong medication?

477
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,680
Before I completely lose it,

478
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,490
let's get things straight.

479
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,000
What's gotten into you?

480
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,400
What am I supposed to say?

481
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,120
Keep pretending.

482
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,800
She's already come looking for you.

483
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,480
Who? Who came here?

484
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,860
That mistress of yours. Her surname is Shen, right?

485
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,440
She came to our home.

486
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,960
Kaiyang, is all this true?

487
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,260
Did you really trade favors? Do you have a mistress?

488
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,640
Chunli.

489
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,200
So any woman who comes to see me

490
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,520
is my mistress?

491
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,600
There are four women in my office.

492
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,360
You've met them all.

493
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,890
Are they all my mistresses?

494
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,600
You should use your brain.

495
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,800
She came to get approval for documents.

496
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,200
Approval?

497
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,880
Yes.

498
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,640
Then why didn't she come to your office?

499
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,120
Why come to our home?

500
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,360
Her documents have issues. She needs special consideration.

501
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,440
Can this kind of thing be discussed at work?

502
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,900
She had to come to our home.

503
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,000
But she said you already agreed.

504
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,240
Are you trading favors? Taking bribes?

505
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,200
For the sake of this family, you can't do such things.

506
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,720
Enough!

507
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,440
Chunli, let me tell you something serious.

508
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,120
People like you

509
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
watch too many TV dramas.

510
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,520
You're completely brainwashed.

511
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,920
Have you ever thought about

512
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,520
what the nature of my job is?

513
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,560
I have to socialize frequently.

514
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,640
If I don't make small talk, how would I get by?

515
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,720
Society today is so complicated.

516
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,960
A casual joke at a social gathering

517
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
can become ammunition against you.

518
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,760
It could ruin you.

519
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,780
And have you considered this?

520
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,540
We've been married for so many years.

521
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,680
I'm a deputy division-level official

522
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,740
with full division-level benefits.

523
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,560
Would I make such a fundamental mistake?

524
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,680
Please use your brain, will you?

525
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,960
You're driving me crazy.

526
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,520
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

527
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,880
Would it have helped if I told you earlier?

528
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,160
You have a wooden fish for a brain.

529
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,720
I just told you.

530
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
You watch way too many TV dramas.

531
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,600
You shouldn't watch that stuff.

532
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,360
You should watch the national news broadcast.

533
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,520
Watch the national news.

534
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,160
Your ideological level will improve.

535
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Then you won't have so many worries.

536
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,320
Alright, stop being so unreasonable.

537
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,720
If I had your level of enlightenment,

538
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,450
I'd be a department head by now.

539
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
This is infuriating.

540
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,400
What tea did you say you wanted?

541
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
Longjing or Tieguanyin?

542
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,650
Chrysanthemum.

543
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,040
Alright, my aunt will be here soon.

544
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,080
I'm sorry.

545
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,760
What took you so long?

546
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,560
I fed them this morning. I'll head out now.

547
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,480
Go, hurry up.

548
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,560
By the way, did you pay that money back?

549
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,410
Let's just say I did.

550
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,690
Then I can rest easy.

551
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,040
You're so considerate.

552
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm leaving then.

553
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,840
Bye-bye.

554
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,320
Be careful on your way.

555
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,400
Okay, got it.

556
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,560
Be careful.

557
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,840
When will you ever grow up?

558
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,560
Still acting so crazy.

559
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,520
Honey, sleeping like this.

560
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,360
This is the first payment, Director Jiang.

561
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,320
Okay, thanks.

562
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,250
Please count it.

563
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,440
No need.

564
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
How is it? I didn't lie to you, right?

565
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,840
How could you?

566
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,680
Today is a good day.

567
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,640
Smiling.

568
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,200
All your wishes can come true.

569
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,960
Tomorrow will be another good day.

570
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,400
Then I can rest assured.

571
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,160
We're even now.

572
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,400
What do you mean by 'even'? What are you saying?

573
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,080
Well, you see, our business

574
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,800
has been going extremely well,

575
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,960
so during this period,

576
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,290
I want to put the small deals aside for now.

577
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,040
In the future, we'll probably only work with

578
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,770
clients worth 500,000 or more.

579
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,120
Good. That's good, that's good.

580
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,080
However, if Director Jiang wants to participate,

581
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,560
I would very much welcome it.

582
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,360
I really enjoy working with you.

583
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,640
So do I.

584
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,980
So, Director Jiang, are you willing to continue our cooperation?

585
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,330
Let me think about this matter carefully.

586
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,720
What's there to think about?

587
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,520
Let's go somewhere else to talk.

588
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,440
Come, this way please.

589
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:09,970
Alright.

590
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,720
You're Huaming, right?

591
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,680
Who's there? You scared me to death.

592
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,880
Please help me. Watch my child for a moment.

593
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,160
Well, if it isn't little Bao.

594
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,920
Thank you.

595
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,140
There's no point in staring at me.

596
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,860
Your whole family is unreliable.

597
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,480
You used to be a PR at Lady Company.

598
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,100
Yes, that's right.

599
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,920
Shilu is a formidable person.

600
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,210
Why did you choose to leave her?

601
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,280
I do admire Shilu very much.

602
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,280
But everyone has their own choices to make.

603
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,520
Your marital status is divorced.

604
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,490
Recently divorced.

605
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,440
You don't have children, do you?

606
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,700
I do. My child is not even one year old yet.

607
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,240
Are you raising the child yourself?

608
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,500
Of course. My child, my responsibility.

609
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,080
Alright. Please go home and wait for my notice.

610
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,600
Are you raising your child by yourself?

611
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,480
Of course I'm raising my own child.

612
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,200
Are you taking care of your child by yourself?

613
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,600
Certainly. My child is my responsibility.

614
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,250
We'll let you know our decision later.

615
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,160
A bunch of blind fools who deserve each other.

616
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,960
What's wrong with being a single mother?

617
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,320
What's wrong with having a child?

618
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,840
Does having a child mean I can't be dedicated to my work?

619
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,040
Let me tell you something.

620
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:05,840
It's precisely because of my child

621
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,960
that a single mother has the motivation to work harder.

622
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Seriously.

623
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,320
You should all experience childbirth

624
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,650
then you'd understand.

625
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,600
What do you want, you beast?

626
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,120
I have nothing to discuss with you.

627
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,360
You may not want to talk,

628
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,440
but my son is half mine.

629
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,920
How dare you deceive me?

630
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,650
Why are you keeping him from me?

631
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,020
Let me tell you,

632
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,480
my son has nothing to do with you,

633
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,760
he's mine alone.

634
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,250
Listen, Wan Xinxin,

635
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,480
you can barely support yourself now.

636
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,360
What right do you have to keep my son?

637
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
I'll tell you one more time,

638
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,440
you don't get to decide whose child this is.

639
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,719
Don't hang up. I'm coming to find you

640
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,250
so we can talk this through.

641
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,040
Hello?

642
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,440
Hey sis,

643
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,280
Xinxin.

644
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,130
I left your son with your neighbor.

645
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,000
You said that old guy was nice.

646
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,720
I have an urgent matter now,

647
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,410
definitely more important than your son.

648
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,300
I'm hanging up.

649
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,640
Seriously, is something wrong with all of you?

650
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,100
Don't you know how to greet people properly?

651
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,400
Why is the child with you?

652
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,100
I'm doing someone a favor.

653
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,680
No need for favors. Just give him to me.

654
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,560
What?

655
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
Why would I give him to you?

656
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,160
This is my son.

657
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,720
What do you mean your son?

658
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,120
This is Xu Ke and Wan Xinxin's child.

659
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,680
You don't know anything. This is my son.

660
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,600
Listen, keep your hands to yourself.

661
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,860
We're all adults here.

662
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,650
Why are you being so unreasonable?

663
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,980
Come over there. I need to talk to you.

664
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,600
Come on.

665
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,200
Why is there a traffic jam?

666
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,920
Well...

667
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,520
I wasn't lying to you, was I?

668
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,080
No.

669
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,440
I'm this child's father.

670
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Yes.

671
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,120
So shouldn't you return the child to me?

672
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,640
No.

673
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,000
Why not?

674
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,560
I promised Wan Xinxin I'd look after her child.

675
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,920
So only after she comes back,

676
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,980
I can give the child to her, not to you.

677
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,900
Why are you being so stubborn?

678
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,880
You've already seen

679
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
and you know I'm the child's father.

680
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,320
So why can't you just give me my child?

681
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,280
If I could reason with Wan Xinxin

682
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,360
and get her to give me the child,

683
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,960
I wouldn't need to beg you.

684
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,240
No, how am I being stubborn?

685
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,480
This is called having principles.

686
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,440
I promised someone I'd watch their child,

687
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,160
so I have to wait until she returns.

688
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,020
No, I understand that reasoning,

689
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,040
but the problem is Wan Xinxin isn't reasonable.

690
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,080
No, listen to me,

691
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,000
many things are just misunderstandings.

692
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,530
Just like how I misunderstood that this child

693
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,680
was Wan Xinxin and Xu Ke's child.

694
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,720
You also misunderstood that Wan Xinxin and I are on the same side,

695
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,380
didn't you?

696
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,200
So if you clear up these misunderstandings,

697
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,960
talk things through properly,

698
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,040
everything will be resolved.

699
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,500
Any problem can be solved.

700
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,090
I do want to talk properly with Wan Xinxin,

701
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,440
but every time

702
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,480
I try to have a reasonable conversation with her,

703
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,010
she explodes like thunder.

704
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,120
One wrong word and boom, she blows up.

705
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,820
How can I resolve this?

706
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,850
Wan Xinxin is your ex-wife, right?

707
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Don't you understand her personality?

708
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,080
She's just a bit impatient sometimes,

709
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,120
but she has a good heart.

710
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,760
If you have something to say,

711
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,290
you need to coax her gently.

712
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,800
If you can just calm her down,

713
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,460
what problem can't be solved?

714
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,340
Do you really have to be like this?

715
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,880
I do want to resolve this,

716
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,800
but the problem is it can't be resolved.

717
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,200
Anyway, I've made up my mind.

718
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
If we can't resolve this, we'll settle it in court.

719
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,880
No, your behavior right now

720
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,200
is exactly like a child's, you know?

721
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,760
My behavior right now

722
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,040
is exactly like a neighborhood committee lady.

723
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,200
Going to court?

724
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Do you really have to take it this far?

725
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,600
If things get to that point, it will be even harder to resolve.

726
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,200
You should give each other some time, you know?

727
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,240
I can have time,

728
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,880
but the problem is my mother might not have time.

729
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,320
What's wrong with your mother?

730
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,800
My mother has been living abroad for a long time.

731
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,600
She has high blood pressure with complications.

732
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,200
Recently,

733
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,060
she was hospitalized for a while.

734
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,210
Now she's insisting that I bring my son to see her.

735
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,360
But the problem is, my mother doesn't know

736
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,720
about my divorce from Wan Xinxin.

737
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,320
Let alone me taking the child abroad to see her.

738
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,800
If the old lady

739
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,240
accidentally gets such a shock, what if...

740
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,460
So what am I supposed to do?

741
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,720
I understand now.

742
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,120
Your mother is abroad right now, isn't she?

743
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,720
In poor health,

744
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,160
right.

745
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
If I give you the child now,

746
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,120
Grandma won't be able to see him, right?

747
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,920
Isn't that so?

748
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,840
Then why are you here?

749
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,960
You just want to take the child

750
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,600
to take a photo and send it to Grandma,

751
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,000
isn't that what you mean?

752
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,360
Then just take the photo and be done with it.

753
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,320
Thank you.

754
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,260
No problem.

755
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,320
Take this money.

756
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:03,970
What for?

757
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,440
Just take it.

758
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,240
Why?

759
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,080
This money isn't for Wan Xinxin.

760
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,160
It's not for you either.

761
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,200
It's for my son.

762
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,160
If there's anything he needs,

763
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,360
please buy it for him.

764
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,600
Okay.

765
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,560
Your dad cares about you too.

766
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,850
Alright, I'll keep it for your son.

767
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,290
How much is this?

768
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,970
I don't know. I didn't count it.

769
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,160
We need to count it properly.

770
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,840
Thank you.

771
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,810
You're welcome.

772
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,040
How far did you count?

773
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,450
What are you guys doing?

774
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,000
Well, I... he... you...

775
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,760
Miss Wan.

776
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,880
Wan Xinxin.

777
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,880
I am this child's father.

778
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,610
I have the right to see my child.

779
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,960
You're the child's father?

780
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,200
When other women were by your side,

781
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,880
did you remember you were his father?

782
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,560
Get out!

783
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,320
Wan Xinxin, are you being reasonable?

784
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Whoever stops me,

785
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,200
I'll make them collect my and my baby's bodies.

786
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,040
Miss Wan.

787
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,680
I never thought you were this kind of person.

788
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,080
Anyone who tries to mess with me and my baby,

789
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,760
I'll fight them to the death.

790
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,240
Miss Wan misunderstood.

791
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,680
Look.

792
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,640
You can't even speak properly.

793
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,960
Did you speak properly just now?

794
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,570
See? This has nothing to do with me.

795
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,370
She's misunderstanding me again.

796
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,880
Who?

797
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,560
Who is it?

798
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,600
Who's there?

799
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,560
Open the door.

800
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,240
Why are you here?

801
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,890
We just met less than a day ago and you already miss me.

802
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,080
Honey.

803
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Do you miss daddy?

804
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,570
Shaking your head means no?

805
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,780
Let mommy hold you.

806
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,840
What's wrong?

807
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
What happened?

808
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,000
Something serious happened.

809
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,400
Your godson was almost sold by that Hua guy.

810
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,360
Really?

811
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,280
Tongchang
