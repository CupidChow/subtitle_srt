National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,880
Xu Huahua, you're asking for trouble.

3
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,080
It took you forever to answer the phone.

4
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,930
Don't think I don't know

5
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,400
where you took your phone.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,330
I'm holding the phone to my ear now.

7
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,360
I'm listening.

8
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,840
Your Highness, what are your orders?

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,530
I'm in a hurry, so please make it quick.

10
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,600
What urgent matter?

11
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,360
You're just chasing girls. Don't think I don't know.

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,120
Let me ask you.

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,650
Why won't the gas stove light up at your place?

14
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,560
The gas, huh?

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,840
I reminded you to pay the gas bill before I left.

16
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,240
Did you pay it?

17
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,200
No.

18
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,640
Wait, you never told me to pay it.

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,320
Serves you right.

20
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,680
I'm not messing with you anymore.

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,079
Look, here's what you do.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,380
Go across the street and find that uncle.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,850
Just borrow some water and you'll be fine.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,040
Xu Huahua, how dare you hang up on me!

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,880
I'm drawing a circle to curse you.

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,280
Hello.

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,340
I'm not interested in men.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
Please leave. Thank you.

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,720
Three seconds ago,

30
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,520
I thought I'd never find true love again.

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,640
But in the final second of my despair,

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,820
heaven let me meet you.

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,650
Sounds cheesy, doesn't it?

34
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm not interested in you.

35
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,650
Would you please leave?

36
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,120
I'm really tired.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
Do you know the difference between water and alcohol?

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,520
Water makes you colder, alcohol makes you warmer.

39
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,240
So?

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Right now you need a strong drink

41
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,210
to warm yourself up.

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,040
Save those Wong Kar-wai lines

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,060
for the post-90s generation.

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,320
Not bad. You even know about this.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,460
Quite artistic. I like it.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,880
Alright.

47
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,180
Mommy will find you something to eat.

48
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,160
Hello? Anyone home?

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,460
I'm your next-door neighbor.

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,420
I'd like to borrow some hot water.

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:00,840
Hello.

52
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Hi, I...

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,760
You live here too?

54
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,050
Your door is closed.

55
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,279
Sir.

56
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,360
The two of us...

57
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,940
We really have such a connection.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,520
You're being quite awful.

59
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,720
No, stop drinking.

60
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,720
Stop drinking.

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
Didn't you promise to buy me drinks?

62
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,159
Are you being stingy?

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,280
I'm not being stingy.

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,840
Don't throw the glass.

65
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,840
You've had too much.

66
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,120
I'm thinking about your health. It's for your own good.

67
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,240
We've known each other for less than two hours.

68
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
How can you care about my well-being?

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,720
You just want me to get drunk, don't you?

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Could you please make your call away from the baby?

71
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,530
Don't you know there's radiation?

72
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
You always let me down at critical moments.

73
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,980
Do you have a spare key?

74
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,250
Yes, it's at the property management office.

75
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,440
Call them.

76
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,680
I just called but no one answered.

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,860
When will your friend be back?

78
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,880
I don't know.

79
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,340
She's unreliable.

80
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,440
Then call your husband.

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,560
Ask him to pick you up.

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,090
I don't want to contact him.

83
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,720
Fine, then I'll have to take you back to the maternity center.

84
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Because I was the one who

85
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,090
brought you out from there.

86
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,320
Mister,

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,200
have you no humanity?

88
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,040
It's so late now.

89
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,700
I don't mind if you trouble me,

90
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,440
but my son is just a baby,

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
and you're disturbing him too.

92
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
Excuse me, miss, when you say that,

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,810
do you have any conscience?

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,880
How am I being unconscionable?

95
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,600
You call this having a conscience?

96
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
You claim you have conscience while saying I have no humanity.

97
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Let me tell you, regardless of everything,

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,440
wasn't I the one who rescued

99
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,300
you and your child from the rocks?

100
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,320
I won't argue with you anymore.

101
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,400
Do you have any relatives or friends?

102
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,120
It's midnight now.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Where do you expect a helpless mother and child to go?

104
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,520
Oh my, I...

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,820
Why don't you just put up with it, mister?

106
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Fine.

107
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,120
I must have owed you something in my past life.

108
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,090
Just stay here then.

109
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,180
Then you can leave.

110
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,250
What did you say?

111
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
Didn't you tell me to stay here?

112
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
Yes, I did tell you to stay here.

113
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
This is my home. Why should I be the one to leave?

114
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,920
No, I'm just concerned that

115
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,200
a single man and woman staying together

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,800
might not be appropriate.

117
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,730
The way you are, you're worried I might do something?

118
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,159
Fine.

119
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,600
If I'm not mistaken, you need baby formula,

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,060
which you left at your place across the hall?

121
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,360
Okay.

122
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,640
Write down what formula your baby uses.

123
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,680
Before his breakfast tomorrow,

124
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,920
I'll definitely buy it for him,

125
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,240
alright? Then I'll take you back to the maternity center.

126
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,040
Really?

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,780
Mister, you're really a good person.

128
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,450
It's nothing. You have a place to stay now.

129
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,520
Just help me buy that

130
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,960
for 0-3 months will do.

131
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,960
Listen carefully to every word I'm about to say.

132
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,220
Don't touch my things,

133
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,440
especially my books.

134
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,320
I don't even read books.

135
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,600
You don't need to say that. Just listen carefully.

136
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,800
Listen to every word. Don't touch my things,

137
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,860
especially my books. Remember that.

138
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,400
Bye-bye, mister.

139
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,480
Have a nice evening.

140
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,160
Mister?

141
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,720
Do I look that old?

142
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,290
You can't hold your liquor,

143
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,780
but you've got quite a temper.

144
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,880
Go away.

145
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,080
Get up.

146
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,520
Come on, get up.

147
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,000
None of you men can be trusted.

148
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,480
Trustworthy or not, you need help.

149
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
How will you get home without me?

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Where do you live?

151
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,540
Why are you hitting me?

152
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,530
No, just tell me where you live.

153
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,280
Tomorrow.

154
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,900
Why do you keep hitting me?

155
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,400
Get away.

156
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,800
Wait.

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Where's your home? I'll take you there.

158
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,640
I don't need men.

159
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,760
I... I can manage by myself.

160
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,040
Don't need men.

161
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,760
Don't need you.

162
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,080
I don't need men.

163
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,120
No, don't slide down.

164
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,080
Get up, come on.

165
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,520
Get up, come on.

166
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,240
Here, I'll carry you on my back.

167
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,360
Come over here.

168
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,440
Ready, one, two, three.

169
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,040
One, two, three, go.

170
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm asking where you live.

171
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,740
I'll take you home.

172
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,880
How is she?

173
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,040
She's asleep.

174
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,160
Hey, you can't do this.

175
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,520
Thank you, sir.

176
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,840
Where is everyone?

177
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,490
You've never seen me before. I don't know you either.

178
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,500
Oh my goodness!

179
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,440
No.

180
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,480
Ouch!

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,360
Xu.

182
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,560
Xu Ke, you...

183
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
You're such a playboy.

184
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,440
How could you make women...

185
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,980
Are you hungry?

186
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,890
Well, mom...

187
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,680
This has all gone cold.

188
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,410
I'll make you something to eat.

189
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,800
This man's life is so miserable.

190
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,640
Oh my God.

191
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,220
Oh no, I'm done for.

192
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,770
He's not going to kill me, is he?

193
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,320
Miss Wan, I'm coming in.

194
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,280
Coming.

195
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,320
No, I can't open it.

196
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
So you blew up my house, huh?

197
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,120
Mister.

198
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,160
What's wrong?

199
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,490
No, you should put on more clothes.

200
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,760
I am wearing clothes already.

201
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm not used to having women around my house.

202
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,530
Cover yourself up more.

203
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,720
Mister, help me up first.

204
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,600
Wait, I think I pulled my back.

205
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,520
I can't get up. Give me a hand.

206
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,560
Is your baby okay?

207
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,400
The baby is fine.

208
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,080
Come on, get up.

209
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,240
Don't move your waist.

210
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,520
Keep your back straight.

211
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
Don't sway. Hold onto me.

212
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,840
Grab my hand.

213
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,340
I'm holding on.

214
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,660
Don't move your waist.

215
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,210
The baby is fine.

216
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,480
Here, sit down slowly.

217
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,140
Don't move.

218
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,610
Are you hurt anywhere else?

219
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,140
Stay still.

220
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,160
You...

221
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,120
Don't move your waist carelessly.

222
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,980
I'm not moving.

223
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,840
Sir.

224
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,520
I know you're very angry.

225
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,280
Could you wait until

226
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,920
I finish cleaning up all this stuff

227
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,250
before you decide whether to skin me alive

228
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,000
okay?

229
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,640
Can you please stop talking?

230
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
Just stop talking, will you?

231
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Listen, you think I want to be responsible for you?

232
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,120
Since I took you from the maternity center,

233
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,400
I need to get you back safely.

234
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,280
If I can't return you,

235
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,480
and something happens to you while you're with me,

236
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,610
wouldn't it all be my responsibility?

237
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,850
Bear with it.

238
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,480
No, don't worry about it.

239
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,839
Really, it's just a small wound.

240
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,119
It'll heal soon.

241
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,650
Don't move. Let me check for glass fragments.

242
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,000
Really...

243
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,680
It's okay. The wound isn't deep.

244
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
You're really a nice person.

245
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,760
Okay, that's enough.

246
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,420
Don't worry about it anymore.

247
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,120
Miss Wan.

248
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,360
I remember telling you

249
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,680
not to touch my things, didn't I?

250
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,120
Especially my books.

251
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,840
No, you...

252
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
Do you know how important this book is to me?

253
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
And this coffee mug.

254
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,880
It was the year I graduated from medical school.

255
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,640
My college classmates pooled money to buy it for me.

256
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,560
Do you know how important it is to me?

257
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,720
Now it's broken and doesn't match the set anymore.

258
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,380
I've used it for so many years.

259
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,860
Was your generation really that poor

260
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,360
that you had to pool money?

261
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,520
What do you mean 'my generation'?

262
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,050
We're not from the same era.

263
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,480
Yes, yes.

264
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
I don't think so.

265
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,800
Sir, I know I was wrong.

266
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,080
I'll replace this coffee mug for you.

267
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,480
But...

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,480
Did you burn out the electricity?

269
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,200
No.

270
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,560
The circuit breaker just tripped.

271
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,920
I'll go to the property management office right now.

272
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,280
Was there any smoke when it tripped?

273
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,360
No smoke. Where would there be smoke?

274
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,760
How could there be smoke?

275
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,160
I...

276
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,260
You never want to see me again. I understand.

277
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,410
Don't move. Don't move!

278
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,480
Please, I'm begging you.

279
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,720
Miss Wan, I'm begging you.

280
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,440
Please don't move.

281
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,000
If something happens to you,

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
I can buy another mug,

283
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,240
but I can't afford to compensate for your life.

284
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,320
Really, after this incident I've realized,

285
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,560
whenever I see you, I have bad luck.

286
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's not meet again in the future.

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,560
Whatever else there is, don't worry about it.

288
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,890
Don't handle anything.

289
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,960
How about I go to the property management?

290
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,360
I'll ask them to come fix it for you.

291
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,960
Stop begging.

292
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,640
I'll get the keys while I'm there.

293
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,760
Please, please.

294
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Just take it easy and go to your child.

295
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,520
Don't worry about anything.

296
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
It's fine. Everything's fine.

297
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,840
What are you doing?

298
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,900
What are you doing?

299
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,480
You've been on the phone all day.

300
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,280
You think we own the phone company?

301
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,040
You think phone calls are free?

302
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,460
What's wrong with you?

303
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,560
I'm just worried.

304
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,600
If Xinxin doesn't show up soon,

305
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,840
Qin Gang will definitely divorce her.

306
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,900
She brought this divorce on herself.

307
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,080
Why are you men so heartless?

308
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,320
Xinxin at least gave Qin Gang a child.

309
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,960
How can he just decide to divorce her like that?

310
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,560
Listen, Xu Chunli.

311
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,800
Your sister is the most unreliable person.

312
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Don't you know that?

313
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,760
Acting crazy all day without any consideration.

314
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,960
She married Qin Gang after knowing him for just a few days.

315
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,280
Let's not talk about it anymore.

316
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,520
You have a child now.

317
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,760
Shouldn't you be a good mother?

318
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,040
Look at her, still acting crazy.

319
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,560
There's an 80% chance they'll divorce now,

320
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,020
and it's all her fault.

321
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,040
How can you be so unsympathetic now?

322
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,120
When things were good, you said

323
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,400
having a rich relative wasn't a bad thing.

324
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,880
You even asked them to help Xiaoxiao study abroad.

325
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
Now that they're having problems,

326
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,300
you start making these cold remarks.

327
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,960
If something happens to Xinxin,

328
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,040
how can I face her dead father?

329
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,680
Tell me.

330
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,760
No.

331
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,920
Xu Chunli, I did say those things.

332
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,760
I admit it.

333
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,280
But it was for the child, right?

334
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,400
For my child,

335
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
I, Jiang Kaiyang, would do anything,

336
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
because I am a father.

337
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,440
It was like this before and will be like this in the future.

338
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,360
My character is not in question.

339
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,440
Who said there's anything wrong with your character?

340
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
The baby is awake.

341
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,440
I really didn't mean to do that just now.

342
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,660
I'm not your uncle.

343
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,010
Did you get the key back?

344
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
Yes, I did.

345
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,880
The baby has been fed.

346
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,240
And I've burped him too.

347
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Hurry up and pack your things.

348
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,320
I'll take you back to the maternity center.

349
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,520
Wait.

350
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,240
Slow down.

351
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,040
I know I broke your stuff.

352
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,880
I'll definitely pay you back for it.

353
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
I already told you, you don't need to pay me back.

354
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,960
I have work to do. Hurry up.

355
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,080
Why won't you listen to my explanation?

356
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,360
You must be a Taurus.

357
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,360
No, you're determined to push me into trouble.

358
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,480
First, you dug this hole yourself.

359
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,600
Second, you lit the fire yourself.

360
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,200
It has nothing to do with me.

361
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,060
I just want to take you back to the maternity center.

362
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm going to

363
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,850
go home right now and pay you back for your things.

364
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,960
Hello, Credit Card Center.

365
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,440
Why is my credit card suddenly not working?

366
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,960
I didn't exceed my limit.

367
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,040
My daily limit is 100,000.

368
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,960
Okay.

369
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,320
Card number, just a moment.

370
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:48,960
The card number is 52865551482116005.

371
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,610
Alright.

372
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,560
What? The primary card is suspended?

373
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,400
It's not like I won't pay you back.

374
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
Stop holding me back.

375
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
Behave yourself.

376
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,920
Where are we going?

377
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,000
Back to the postpartum care center.

378
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,800
How could you bear to push someone like me,

379
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,320
a beautiful young woman,

380
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,680
into such misery?

381
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,200
You're going to a postpartum care center.

382
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,880
Do I really have to go to the postpartum center today?

383
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,760
I promised someone

384
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,490
to take you back to the postpartum center safely.

385
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,370
Hold this for me.

386
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,920
What are you doing?

387
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,280
This is the communication age.

388
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,810
Are you trying to kidnap me?

389
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,800
I'll post your photo on my

390
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
WeChat and Weibo.

391
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,040
Let me tell you, I have tons of followers.

392
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,570
Fine. Do whatever you want.

393
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,800
Now you need to come back to the postpartum center with me.

394
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,040
I'm telling you, you're such a

395
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,300
cold-hearted person.

396
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
Ruthless.

397
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Expressionless.

398
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,640
You...

399
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,970
Alright, you can think about it in the car.

400
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,520
So you're taking me back to the postpartum center, right?

401
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,850
Are you a broken record?

402
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,040
You don't need to take me back to the postpartum center.

403
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,500
Just take me home instead.

404
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,560
Master Hua.

405
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,880
I really have a question.

406
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,400
I'm quite curious.

407
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,800
What's your zodiac sign?

408
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,040
You must be a Taurus.

409
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,760
Oh my, you're so stubborn!

410
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,840
Ever since I met you,

411
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
you've been saying only one thing:

412
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,880
I'm going to send you to the postpartum center.

413
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,080
You still want that postpartum center.

414
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,970
We've arrived at your home.

415
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,120
Indeed, nobody's here.

416
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Is this your home?

417
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,480
No. Why don't we go up and sit for a while?

418
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,600
Exactly. I feel like you're playing me again.

419
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm starting to regret this.

420
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,840
Let me take you back to the maternity center.

421
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,920
I just need to go upstairs to get something.

422
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Looking at your living conditions,

423
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,760
why don't you just buy what you need?

424
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,120
Buy?

425
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,840
What am I supposed to use to buy things?

426
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,360
That Qin guy canceled my credit card.

427
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,160
You don't know that.

428
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,640
I can't even pay for the cup I broke at your place.

429
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,370
I can't afford to buy anything.

430
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,440
Why don't you lend me your card?

431
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
Why should I lend you my card?

432
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,900
Well, there you go.

433
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,640
Listen, about the things you broke at my place,

434
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,370
I don't need you to pay for them.

435
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,360
I'll just take you back to the maternity center,

436
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,880
and then you can run around or make a scene all you want.

437
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,600
It's none of my business anymore.

438
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm taking you back to the maternity center now.

439
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,520
No, if you take me back to the maternity center now,

440
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,440
I'll still have to divorce that Qin guy.

441
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,680
I'll end up homeless on the streets,

442
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,880
a single mother and child suffering from hunger and cold.

443
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
And it will all be your fault.

444
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,560
Me?

445
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,360
How is this my fault?

446
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,640
Why should I be blamed?

447
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,680
Why do you only think about yourself?

448
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,520
What about me?

449
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm thinking about myself?

450
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,040
I don't have a single decent piece of clothing now.

451
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,320
I have nothing to change into.

452
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,360
If you take me back to the maternity center,

453
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,690
what am I supposed to do, run around naked?

454
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,810
Fine, go ahead then.

455
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,680
Wait!

456
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,160
I'll watch the baby for you.

457
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,840
What are you trying to do?

458
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,240
I know you don't trust me.

459
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,280
Here, take the car keys.

460
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,340
Do you have a spare key?

461
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,400
No spare key.

462
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,520
I'll watch the baby for you. Don't worry.

463
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,920
Alright, I'll trust you this once.

464
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,240
Don't try any tricks.

465
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,040
I hope you'll live up to my trust.

466
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I still have your photos on my phone.

467
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,120
I won't betray your trust. Hurry up.

468
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,480
My darlings, I've missed you all so much.

469
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,680
My darlings, I've missed you terribly.

470
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,740
I came today

471
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,400
to rescue all of you.

472
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,440
Get some sunshine.

473
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Sunshine helps your hair grow.

474
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,960
Sunshine gives you calcium.

475
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,860
What are you doing?

476
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,100
You're getting me all wet.

477
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,320
What's this about?

478
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,920
Alright!

479
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,120
Put your pants on.

480
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,530
Looks like I can't rescue all of you today.

481
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,260
Don't be sad or disappointed.

482
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,570
Once I buy a mansion,

483
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,570
I'll come back and move you all out.

484
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,040
Any news from Wan Xinxin?

485
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,240
Not yet.

486
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,600
I'm worried about the baby.

487
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,600
Having such an irresponsible mother.

488
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,260
They won't cause any trouble.

489
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,400
Don't worry.

490
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,040
Wan Xinxin may be a bit ridiculous,

491
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,880
but there's so much public scrutiny these days.

492
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
One piece of bad news

493
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,040
would immediately get hundreds of thousands of shares.

494
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,920
Trust me.

495
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,880
If anything had happened to your child,

496
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,410
you would have known by now.

497
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,770
What are you looking at?

498
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,880
Nothing.

499
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,180
Just checking out your place.

500
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,340
I guess you could call this a home.

501
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,080
Come on, don't be upset.

502
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,680
Look how pale you've been lately.

503
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,360
Here, let me massage your head.

504
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,720
Qin Gang

505
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,360
Didn't you say

506
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,600
that you bought this house for me?

507
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,120
Yes.

508
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,920
Six years ago when I got

509
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,520
the keys to this house,

510
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,570
you were the first person I wanted to tell.

511
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,040
Because I wanted you

512
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,570
to be the lady of this house.

513
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,970
But I never expected

514
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,620
that what I'd hear instead was

515
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,020
news of your engagement to someone else.

516
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm sorry.

517
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,880
I should be the one apologizing.

518
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,610
Because I promised to wait for you.

519
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,180
But I failed to keep that promise.

520
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,700
If I had come back earlier,

521
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,560
would you have not married Wan Xinxin?

522
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,760
That's right.

523
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,360
Qin Gang

524
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,280
Can we start over?

525
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,280
Disgusting.

526
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,680
Wan Xinxin

527
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,280
None of you deserve me throwing my heels at you.

528
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,720
Wan Xinxin

529
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,820
Wan Xinxin, open the door!

530
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,160
Wan Xinxin, my son!

531
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,280
The child is mine. He has nothing to do with you.

532
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Go to hell!

533
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,080
Wan Xinxin!

534
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,000
Wan Xinxin.

535
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,720
Are you crazy?

536
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
What are you doing?

537
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,240
What? Is this your bag?

538
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,300
Wan Xinxin, where are you going? Come back here!

539
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,240
Go to hell!

540
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,200
Huaming, it's you again.

541
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,060
What are you doing?

542
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,680
Did you steal something from someone?

543
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,410
You're the one who's stealing!

544
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,680
Take it slow.

545
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,760
Hurry up!

546
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,889
Does it hurt?

547
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,340
No, it doesn't.

548
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,690
If it hurts, just say so.

549
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,170
It's okay to cry.

550
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,600
In my dictionary,

551
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,260
there's no such word as 'cry'.

552
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,460
There's an old saying.

553
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,880
It's rough but true.

554
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,480
What's meant to be yours will be yours.

555
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
What isn't yours,

556
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,160
you can never get no matter how hard you try.

557
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

558
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,850
It's nothing serious. Just a soft tissue contusion.

559
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,850
Come on, try taking a few steps.

560
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,680
It's better already?

561
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,280
Just try.

562
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,880
It seems

563
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,000
it really is much better.

564
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,640
I didn't realize you actually had some skills.

565
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,900
I have a few more tricks

566
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,810
that you might never get the chance to see.

567
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,860
Thank you, Master Hua.

568
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Don't mention it.

569
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,920
I just didn't want you to end up disabled

570
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,650
or the postnatal care center would come after me.

571
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,880
Are you even human?

572
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,120
Never mind whether I'm human or not. I'm just an outsider.

573
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,040
I can see

574
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,840
that you and your husband had a serious fight.

575
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,920
But in situations like this,

576
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
running around with your child won't solve anything.

577
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,120
You need to face it yourself.

578
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,160
Right, you are an outsider.

579
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,340
Stop meddling in my business from now on.

580
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,640
You think I want to interfere? I just happened to see you.

581
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,120
What were you thinking?

582
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,920
Drinking beer by the seaside

583
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,040
with your child just left beside you.

584
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,800
I mean,

585
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,000
what if something happened to you? What about your child?

586
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,480
Don't cry.

587
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,100
Here. Stop crying.

588
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,400
Leave me alone. Just let me fend for myself.

589
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,440
It's all because of you.

590
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,680
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have gotten married.

591
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,440
How dare you cry?

592
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,720
Look at the state I'm in, and you're still crying.

593
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,200
What are you crying for?

594
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,360
If it weren't for that limited edition LV bag,

595
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,600
would you even exist?

596
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,520
I'm the one who should be crying.

597
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,690
Can you stop being so childish?

598
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,880
You're using your youth as an excuse for everything, aren't you?

599
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,800
A child doesn't understand anything.

600
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,920
Why take your anger out on the child?

601
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,160
Is that how a mother should behave?

602
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
How am I not behaving like a mother?

603
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,320
What's wrong with how I'm mothering?

604
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,600
Did I abandon him or kick him?

605
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,280
Other mothers get pampered and spoiled by their families,

606
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,760
with husbands who treat them like queens.

607
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,080
But look at me.

608
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,340
What happened to me after having a child?

609
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,200
One problem isn't enough, so I get two.

610
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,960
Two aren't enough, so I get a whole basketful.

611
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,520
Is it because I had a baby

612
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,680
and got old and ugly?

613
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,760
That heaven decided to dump

614
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
all these misfortunes on me at once?

615
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

616
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,400
My tone was a bit harsh just now.

617
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,580
This is none of your business.

618
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,000
I was stupid. I lost my mind.

619
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,960
I had his baby when I was just 23.

620
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,960
He just said he loved me.

621
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,280
Bought me a bunch of designer bags.

622
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,880
I thought he really loved me.

623
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,880
I felt everything I did was worth it.

624
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,320
But he's rich, so he does whatever he wants.

625
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,050
Being selfish means cheating?

626
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,260
The baby is still so young.

627
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,740
If you liked someone else, why come to me?

628
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,960
Do you feel really hurt right now?

629
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,880
I'm sorry.

630
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,440
Do you feel really resentful?

631
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,040
Yes, I'm extremely resentful.

632
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,520
If you're resentful, you should focus on living well.

633
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,720
After you've built a good life, tell him.

634
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,380
That his choice was a mistake.

635
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,760
Right?

636
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,280
Bastard.

637
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,880
Master Hua.

638
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,640
Could you not take me back to the maternity center?

639
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,320
Okay.

640
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,000
But you have to promise me I can find you.

641
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,530
Pinky swear.

642
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,930
Where should I take you?

643
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,170
I don't know.

644
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,700
How about this?

645
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,040
You can take the baby

646
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,760
to the lounge over there to rest.

647
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,080
If you feel you haven't vented enough

648
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,810
and still want to let it out if you have the energy,

649
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,600
you can

650
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,940
help me take care of my dog.

651
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,260
What are you doing?

652
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,240
Kaiyang, you have to help me.

653
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,280
If you don't help me,

654
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,880
I'm going to lose my mind.

655
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,600
Tell me, where could Xinxin have gone?

656
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,200
When she left that day,

657
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,040
Qin Gang said she didn't take her ID card.

658
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,240
Without an ID, she can't stay at hotels.

659
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,880
And she has a child with her.

660
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
She must be staying with someone she knows.

661
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,120
Look, she's been in Xiamen for three years.

662
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,880
Why can't I find out where she's living?

663
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,090
This problem is simple.

664
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,920
Who have you called?

665
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
Right? All women.

666
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,480
Wasn't Wan Xinxin the campus beauty?

667
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,490
Doesn't she have a few backup guys?

668
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,760
Kaiyang, you're so quick-witted.

669
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,370
Let's go.

670
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,240
Judy.

671
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,240
Healthy and beautiful.

672
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,280
Come on, let's find your mom.

673
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,240
Thank you.

674
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:52,840
You're welcome.

675
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,880
Let's go home.

676
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,160
Take care.

677
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,200
She's asleep.

678
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,920
Miss Wan.

679
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,560
I didn't expect you to be so good with animals.

680
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,240
How are you feeling? You must be tired after such a busy day.

681
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
It's good to be tired.

682
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,380
When you're tired, you don't have energy to think about other things.

683
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,320
Miss Wan.

684
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,770
Please don't do anything dangerous like that again.

685
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,120
Do you know?

686
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
When you're taking care of animals

687
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,320
and telling stories to Bao,

688
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,760
your whole demeanor changes.

689
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,360
You transform from neurotic to goddess,

690
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,200
radiating a gentle and dazzling light.

691
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,000
Wait, am I really that neurotic?

692
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,800
No.

693
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,490
You're a goddess. It feels wonderful.

694
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,770
But if I come here often,

695
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,320
don't get annoyed with me.

696
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,520
This door will always

697
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,800
be open for you and Bao.

698
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,610
Let's go.

699
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,120
Where to?

700
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,970
To your friend's place.

701
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,780
You don't wear glasses when driving?

702
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,760
I have mild astigmatism. I can wear them or not.

703
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,090
Go change your clothes.

704
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm sorry for troubling you.

705
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,240
Why don't we go inside?

706
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,880
I may have found Wan Xinxin.

707
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,560
What? You found Wan Xinxin?

708
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,460
Tongchang.

709
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li.
