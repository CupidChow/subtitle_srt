1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,200
Gesturing

3
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,020
Qin Gang, we're divorced.

4
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
It's over. Completely over.

5
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,320
I'm not your doll

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,800
that you can discard whenever you want,

7
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,460
and come back for a hug whenever you feel like it.

8
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,160
Fake.

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,760
Fake. Fake. So fake.

10
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Anyone can see she's just putting on a show for you.

11
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,079
Give me a break.

12
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,920
You weren't even there. How would you know?

13
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,840
Let me tell you, I wasn't even there.

14
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,170
But I can imagine what those two were up to.

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,920
You're just too naive.

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,480
You just want to call me stupid, don't you?

17
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,040
No, no. Being stupid and being naive are different things.

18
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,900
You'd be better off being stupid.

19
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,960
You really touched Qin Gang.

20
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
That was an accident, not touching.

21
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,370
Don't get physical with me in front of the kid from now on.

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,440
I clearly used my foot just now.

23
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,960
You should be more careful.

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,360
Right? Mom needs to be more careful.

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,760
I won't. I have no heart.

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
It's that simple.

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,079
Let's go to bed.

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,520
Time to sleep.

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,560
Good night.

30
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,680
Bye-bye.

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,680
Fake.

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,200
Phony.

33
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,200
Pretend.

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,520
Vivian.

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,600
Are you upset?

36
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I'm not upset.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,770
You two are getting back together.

38
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,329
I should congratulate you.

39
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,180
You're like this and still not angry?

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,400
I'm only doing this

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,280
to put on a show for Wan Xinxin.

42
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,920
That Wan Xinxin

43
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,240
is always hanging around you all day.

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,640
Who knows if you can resist her?

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,440
I swear to God.

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Everything I've done

47
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,280
was following your plan.

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
Why are you upset now?

49
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,920
But when I see you two together now,

50
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,050
it makes me unhappy.

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
It won't be long. Just hang in there.

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,200
Wan Xinxin is stubborn and needs to be coaxed.

53
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,519
If she's happy, my mother will be happy.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,560
And if my mother is happy,

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
I can take over all the family business.

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,160
Alright, I know.

57
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,100
You've said it hundreds of times.

58
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
But when I see you two together,

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
it hurts me.

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,640
That's only during the day at the company.

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,400
At night, I'm all yours, aren't I?

62
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
The font size must be consistent.

63
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,360
Okay, go ahead.

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,200
Zhang Hao.

65
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,200
What's wrong?

66
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,360
Um, the attendees

67
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
can get a free bottle of mineral water.

68
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,360
Put this text in a prominent position.

69
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,920
Got it.

70
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,160
Then later ask Lu Beibei

71
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,920
to contact the printing shop we worked with last time

72
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
to make it into a pull-up banner.

73
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,610
Okay, leave it to me.

74
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,690
Don't worry.

75
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,800
Beibei.

76
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,060
Come here for a moment.

77
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:34,800
What is it?

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,600
It's the same printing shop as last time.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,930
We need 10 pull-up banners and 30 posters.

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,940
Alright, thank you for your help.

81
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,600
Okay.

82
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,200
Remember to return the USB drive when you're done.

83
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,800
Got it.

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,240
Good.

85
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Hello, Manager Liu.

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,640
Hello. So,

87
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,480
I've already got the USB drive.

88
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,340
How would you like me to modify it?

89
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
I understand.

90
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,200
That doesn't seem appropriate.

91
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,770
Wouldn't that implicate Manager Qin as well?

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,900
You won't even leave my company's employees alone.

93
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,200
Mr. Shi seems to know something.

94
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,620
Lu Beibei told me everything.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,280
Completely useless.

96
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,720
Mr. Shi, just say what's on your mind.

97
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,240
You want to sabotage my company's project.

98
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,970
What do you think I'm planning?

99
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,600
Sue me? Or tell Qin Gang?

100
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
I came here to warn you.

101
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,680
Don't scheme behind my back.

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,660
You care so much about Wan Xinxin.

103
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,840
I care about my company and my projects.

104
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,720
Next time I won't be so polite.

105
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,820
You'd better watch yourself.

106
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,800
If you really care about your company that much,

107
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
you shouldn't leave.

108
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,159
If you do this for me,

109
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,920
I'll sign a contract with your company immediately.

110
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,760
From now on, your company will handle

111
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,960
all global promotion for our magazine.

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,700
Don't have any doubts.

113
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,920
I can sign the contract with you tomorrow.

114
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,280
I keep my word.

115
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,320
But you need to keep this confidential for me.

116
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,120
Actually, Qin Gang's lousy 4S store

117
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,400
doesn't spend much on advertising each year.

118
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,960
But you know very well

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,800
the influence our magazine has.

120
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
If you cooperate with us, your company

121
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,600
will immediately join the top-tier ranks.

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
The auto show is the day after tomorrow at noon.

123
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,400
Tomorrow at 3 PM,

124
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
if I don't see your contract, the deal is off.

125
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,560
Okay, no problem.

126
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,600
Also, I won't fire

127
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,200
Wan Xinxin over this matter.

128
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,040
You can't force me on this issue.

129
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,120
No problem.

130
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,360
Xinxin.

131
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,920
You've been living at my place for so long.

132
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,920
You haven't paid me a penny in rent.

133
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,600
Don't you think we need to talk about this?

134
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
It's okay if you don't have money.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,960
How about offering yourself instead?

136
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,240
No, no. Just now...

137
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
I'm just kidding.

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,840
Well...

139
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,320
Look.

140
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,560
I really like you.

141
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,960
I like you too, brother.

142
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,680
Let's not talk about the distant future, let's focus on the present.

143
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,600
Would you be my girlfriend first?

144
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,960
Do you think that sounds okay?

145
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,860
What I just said...

146
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

147
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,280
I don't have that kind of luck.

148
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,640
Your mom will never fall for me.

149
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,000
Your Uncle Huaming is really miserable.

150
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,960
Your mom, she really is...

151
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Every time when...

152
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,520
She always lets me down at crucial moments.

153
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,080
It's either too much free time or too much work.

154
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,320
I fell asleep.

155
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,240
By the way,

156
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,520
are you hungry? I can heat up some steak for you.

157
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Look at the time. I'm not eating.

158
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,450
I still have a ton of work to finish.

159
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,080
No, you need to eat when it's time to eat.

160
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,940
You haven't fully recovered yet.

161
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,640
All you ever think about is food.

162
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,920
Am I a pig?

163
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
You never care about me,

164
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,000
about my work.

165
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,010
Ask me how the project is going,

166
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
if I'm busy, tired, or need any help.

167
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,080
I don't know anything about your work progress,

168
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,010
and I can't help with the auto show.

169
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,700
How do you know you can't help when you never ask?

170
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,940
How's it going?

171
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,600
If I ask too many questions,

172
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,060
you'll say I'm talking about Qin Gang again.

173
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
This has nothing to do with Qin Gang.

174
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,040
So annoying.

175
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,440
How are you doing now?

176
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,010
Frustrated.

177
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,240
What are you frustrated about?

178
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm tired and annoyed.

179
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,640
How did I end up with

180
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,320
such useless teammates?

181
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,080
Wan Xinxin, have you ever thought about

182
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,200
why you have such useless teammates?

183
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,760
Why?

184
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,000
Because pigs find other pigs to be teammates.

185
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,420
This pig just fell asleep.

186
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,800
Fine.

187
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Where's the baby?

188
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,680
I put him to sleep and already fed him.

189
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,480
I'll go check on him.

190
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,650
You're pouting.

191
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,960
Don't pout.

192
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,080
Let me tell you, I have a strong heart.

193
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,320
I can adjust myself.

194
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,880
No need to apologize. I don't mind.

195
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,420
You're overthinking.

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,120
Fine, I'm in a bad mood.

197
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm so annoyed with all these things today.

198
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,560
These people,

199
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
I don't know how they survived the past few years.

200
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,490
They don't know how to do anything.

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,920
So why are you going out to work now?

202
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,080
What's it for?

203
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,220
To prove yourself?

204
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,440
Yes, I must prove myself.

205
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,240
I caused such big trouble for Shi Lu before.

206
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,280
If I don't prove myself now,

207
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,810
what if she looks down on me?

208
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,890
Move over there.

209
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,880
Let me ask you again,

210
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,560
are you working outside

211
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,200
just to prove yourself to others?

212
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,080
Also for our baby, isn't that right?

213
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,880
I admire you. Keep it up.

214
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm going to check on the baby.

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,880
Hey,

216
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,760
you're smiling, in a good mood. Let me tell you something.

217
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,380
I...

218
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,280
You're definitely up to no good.

219
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:47,880
Good things?

220
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,600
Come on.

221
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,890
Good things only last for a moment.

222
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,880
I don't have that kind of luck.

223
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,800
Have the models get ready to enter.

224
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,360
Okay.

225
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,810
Let's get started soon.

226
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,570
We're waiting for our laptops.

227
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,970
It's about to begin.

228
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,400
Look, it says right here.

229
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,660
Attend the car show, get a laptop.

230
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,400
Attend the car show, get a laptop.

231
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,200
Yes, exactly.

232
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,640
It's written very clearly.

233
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,880
We've been waiting in line all morning.

234
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,640
Right? And nobody has come to help us.

235
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,520
Right? And there are no prizes to be seen.

236
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,480
Let me tell you something.

237
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,360
It's not 'attend the car show, get a laptop.'

238
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,440
It's for customers who purchase a car today.

239
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
But that's exactly what it says here.

240
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,160
Look.

241
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,560
Listen to me, listen.

242
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,620
Everyone, please quiet down.

243
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,560
I'm sorry, due to a work error,

244
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,640
this is not 'get a computer for attending the car show.'

245
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,000
What do you mean by error?

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,280
Just let us in already.

247
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,530
What's going on?

248
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,560
I don't know how the flyer ended up saying

249
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,480
that everyone gets a free computer for attending the car show today.

250
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240
How could it be printed wrong? Why didn't you say something earlier?

251
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
I just checked it.

252
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,920
I specifically reviewed it before sending it to the printer.

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,250
I'll go explain to them.

254
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,520
Let them all in.

255
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,340
I'll give them all computers.

256
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,560
With so many people, you'll have to

257
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,160
give away so many computers.

258
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,970
It's okay. Your mistake is my mistake.

259
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,570
I'll take responsibility.

260
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,120
No, Qin Gang.

261
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,100
Let them all in.

262
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:22,880
Qin Gang.

263
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,480
Wait a minute!

264
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,260
Xinxin, what's wrong?

265
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,280
Xinxin?

266
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,040
Xinxin!

267
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,170
Have some water.

268
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,600
No, where is everyone?

269
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Where did they go?

270
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,010
I sent them all away.

271
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,250
So the computer is gone?

272
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,980
All delivered.

273
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,560
How did I mess up again?

274
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,050
Qin Gang.

275
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,250
Stop blaming yourself.

276
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,120
I did so many bad things before.

277
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,490
Just consider this my punishment.

278
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,730
I feel like heaven is punishing me.

279
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,640
Every time I try to do something, I fail.

280
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,120
Always running into all kinds of problems.

281
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,680
It's not your fault.

282
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,040
Don't worry.

283
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,480
I'll find a way to pay you back.

284
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,400
Why don't you understand?

285
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,100
Why are you being so calculative with me?

286
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,680
Everything I do for you is willingly.

287
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,890
That's a different matter.

288
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,640
Where's Shi Lu?

289
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,210
She went back to the office.

290
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,560
I'll be going then.

291
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,160
Where are you going?

292
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,040
Well, I'm also going back to the office.

293
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,600
Let me walk you out.

294
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,240
No need.

295
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,400
I'll walk with you.

296
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,250
What's wrong? Why are you running?

297
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,920
Are you okay?

298
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,240
I'm sorry, everyone.

299
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,000
You've all been working hard with me for the past month and a half.

300
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
But due to my negligence,

301
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,680
I've let you all down.

302
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,280
I'm truly sorry.

303
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,720
Aren't you going to investigate

304
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,780
which part of the process went wrong?

305
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,700
I'm the one in charge of this project.

306
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,680
All problems are my responsibility.

307
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,290
I didn't check thoroughly enough.

308
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,000
It was Lu Beibei who mixed up the files.

309
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,240
I've already fired her. It has nothing to do with you.

310
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,760
Director Shi.

311
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,960
Thank you for wanting me to stay.

312
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,050
These past few months, I've only caused you trouble.

313
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,160
I really can't face staying any longer.

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,330
You don't have to leave.

315
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,200
Director Shi.

316
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,650
Thank you for asking me to stay.

317
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,040
I really don't want to leave,

318
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,220
but I must take responsibility for my mistakes.

319
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,080
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,880
Thank you.

321
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,600
Thank you all for putting up with my bad temper.

322
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,520
I hope in the future,

323
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,120
I'll have the chance to work with you all again.

324
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,060
If I get that opportunity,

325
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,080
I'll definitely make it up to everyone.

326
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,280
Director Shi.

327
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm sorry.

328
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,140
What are you all standing around for?

329
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,240
Get back to work.

330
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,680
Drink it.

331
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,640
What is

332
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,740
this medicine?

333
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,530
I'm not sick.

334
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,140
If you're sick, take medicine. Drink it.

335
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
I have heartache. It can't be cured.

336
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,520
I can cure heartache too.

337
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,650
Just drink it first.

338
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,880
Aren't you a vet?

339
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,280
I treated humans first.

340
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,140
Besides, if you don't drink it, that's fine with me.

341
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,680
Fine.

342
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,010
I'll drink it first.

343
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,920
There.

344
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,600
Wait, what's going on here?

345
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,120
Good, drink it. Be good.

346
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,080
Swallow it.

347
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:56,840
Good.

348
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,640
I'm going to change and go out for a while.

349
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
No, wait.

350
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,050
What's going on?

351
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,240
Right, I almost forgot.

352
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,040
What's the name of that person you fired last time?

353
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:07,880
Lu Beibei.

354
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,840
Lu Beibei.

355
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,900
What's the matter?

356
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,340
Nothing. Just think it's a nice name.

357
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,920
Hey, Xu Ke.

358
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,080
I need you to find someone's number for me.

359
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,480
She's from Shilu Company, named Lu Beibei.

360
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,360
What? This isn't a joke.

361
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,490
This is serious. Stop messing around.

362
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,700
Hello, Miss Lu.

363
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
I'm Hua Ming, Wan Xinxin's friend.

364
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,640
Xinxin told me

365
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,320
you two were best colleagues at the company.

366
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,580
I heard you were fired.

367
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,940
I'm here on her behalf to check on you.

368
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,930
Tell her I'm fine. She doesn't need to worry about me.

369
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,040
If there's nothing else, I'll be going now.

370
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,020
Since you're already here, let's talk for a bit.

371
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,120
We're not acquainted. There's nothing to talk about.

372
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,080
Miss Lu.

373
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,920
I understand.

374
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,480
I know it's abrupt of me to ask you out today.

375
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,960
Let me first clarify that I have no right

376
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,090
to make you answer any of my questions.

377
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,800
I just want to tell you

378
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,730
that one should be able to face their own conscience.

379
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,280
So after I ask my questions,

380
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,410
you can choose not to answer and leave.

381
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
Did you know about the poster issue beforehand?

382
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,320
I didn't know. Don't ask me.

383
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,740
Wan Xinxin has already resigned.

384
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,560
She's suffering now. You owe her an explanation.

385
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,800
If you tell the truth,

386
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,530
you'll feel better too, right?

387
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,530
I've already left the company.

388
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,040
It was my fault.

389
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,160
But why did Xinxin resign too?

390
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,640
Because Wan Xinxin has changed.

391
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,770
She's not the same person anymore.

392
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,160
She's become more responsible.

393
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,680
Do you know she's suffering now?

394
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,000
She's sick - heartbroken.

395
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,600
And only you can cure her.

396
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,120
I switched the USB drive.

397
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,200
Do you know Liu Wei?

398
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
I've heard of her.

399
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,960
She asked me to do it.

400
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,160
She paid me.

401
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,160
But I returned all the money later.

402
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,760
I really didn't want to do it.

403
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,280
Now Mr. Shi knows about it too.

404
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,360
Shi Lu knows about this?

405
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,890
Here's the real poster.

406
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,960
Don't ask me anything else.

407
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,520
Please tell Xinxin

408
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,880
that I'm sorry.

409
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,120
Thank you.

410
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,400
Are you saying

411
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
that Shi Lu and Liu Wei were in this together?

412
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,520
It must be so.

413
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Shi Lu knew there would be a problem but didn't stop it.

414
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,600
Liu Wei must have offered her a bigger benefit.

415
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,320
So what exactly do you want from me?

416
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
What do you mean?

417
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,360
I'm afraid you'll get drunk and cause trouble again.

418
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,760
One is your best friend Wan Xinxin,

419
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,420
the other is your girlfriend.

420
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,280
You'll have to weigh your options carefully.

421
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,520
Brother Ming.

422
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,000
Get to the point.

423
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,320
Don't touch me. What is it?

424
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,960
Ming.

425
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,440
I was drunk last time.

426
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,200
I was a bit out of line.

427
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,780
Don't take it personally.

428
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,120
Let me tell you two things.

429
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,560
First, don't mumble around me.

430
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,000
You're a grown man. Stop being so fidgety when you talk.

431
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,040
Second, if you get physical with me again,

432
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,120
I won't let you off the hook.

433
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,080
I won't, I won't.

434
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,400
No, but this time you need to

435
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,880
help me figure out a solution.

436
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,020
Your own problems,

437
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,060
just follow your conscience.

438
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,370
I told you not to come looking for me again.

439
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,410
I just want to ask you one question.

440
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,960
Do you really hate Wan Xinxin?

441
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,640
This has nothing to do with whether I like her or not.

442
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,120
You do hate her.

443
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,520
She's already suffering so much, yet you're still trying to destroy her.

444
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,640
Why?

445
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,340
If she had any principles,

446
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,890
she shouldn't have taken Qin Gang's project.

447
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,920
That's really unfair of you to say.

448
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,960
So disloyal.

449
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,480
Wan Xinxin took this job

450
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
just to repay the favor she owed you.

451
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,520
And you were the one who forced her to do it. Have you forgotten?

452
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,450
So I had no intention of firing her.

453
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,010
She insisted on leaving the company herself.

454
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,800
So you think

455
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,320
you're being humane?

456
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,540
I don't think about humanity.

457
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,100
I only think about the company's growth.

458
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,360
When facing better opportunities and better projects,

459
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,640
I have no other choice.

460
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,560
For a company to develop,

461
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,240
someone always has to make sacrifices.

462
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,130
It's just unfortunate that

463
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,140
that person is Wan Xinxin.

464
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,000
You should at least have some humanity.

465
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,520
Get out.

466
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,240
No, Lulu...

467
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,280
You need to think clearly.

468
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,160
Don't you know what kind of person Liu Wei is?

469
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,960
You can't work with her.

470
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,560
If you work with her, she'll be the death of you.

471
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,560
Get out now!

472
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,400
I make my own decisions.

473
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,040
I don't need you telling me how to live my life.

474
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,640
Fine. I'll leave in a minute.

475
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,960
But let me tell you something.

476
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,520
Even though you're my... whatever,

477
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,920
Wan Xinxin is my good friend.

478
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,580
You can't treat her like this.

479
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
If you keep this up,

480
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,040
I won't like you anymore.

481
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,500
I don't need you to like me.

482
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,560
I don't need anyone.

483
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,400
I only believe in myself.

484
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,970
Without my company's support,

485
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,280
I am nothing.

486
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,650
Nothing is more important than my career.

487
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,080
Fine. Go live with your career then.

488
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,920
Just be alone.

489
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,400
Live in your loneliness.

490
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Live your selfish life by yourself.

491
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,160
Get out!

492
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,600
Get out!

493
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,920
Your Majesty.

494
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm so sorry.

495
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,920
I was really wrong.

496
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,600
I've let you down.

497
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,120
Your Majesty.

498
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,360
I was wrong.

499
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
I shouldn't have drunk last time.

500
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,260
What shouldn't you have done?

501
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
I thought you were dead.

502
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,280
So you finally decided to come back.

503
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,040
I'm sorry.

504
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,800
What happened?

505
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
I've wronged you.

00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,200
The business was doing fine and suddenly it's closed.

676
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,520
I don't know either.

677
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
I'm completely confused right now.

678
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,580
Look, I was about to close several deals.

679
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,440
This... you...

680
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,240
Is this good news or bad news?

681
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,800
You're really going all out this time.

682
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,400
The company is only closed for a couple of days.

683
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,640
I can still manage.

684
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,100
I have enough for this small expense.

685
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,340
I'm just afraid Wan Xinxin won't appreciate it.

686
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,000
Yes, she's so stubborn.

687
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,530
She needs something earth-shattering to be convinced.

688
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,520
But I hope this time,

689
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,920
she'll take the bait.

690
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,440
Otherwise,

691
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,130
I'm really out of patience.

692
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,040
Oh right, what about Jiang Kaiyang?

693
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,200
I wonder if that idiot

694
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,930
has managed to get the job done.

695
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,280
Is he capable?

696
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,680
I asked him to have a heart-to-heart with Hua Ming.

697
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm sorry. I was planning

698
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,120
to take us somewhere else,

699
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,840
but I realized this matter is urgent.

700
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,760
It's fine. This is good.

701
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,200
We'll have to make do with our staff cafeteria.

702
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,960
It's perfectly fine.

703
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,160
Where should I begin?

704
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,840
This lady,

705
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,320
things were better before she showed up.

706
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
As soon as she arrived, Mr. Qin

707
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,800
took his anger out on the company.

708
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:29,080
He thinks the company is causing her trouble,

709
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,200
so he simply decided to close the store.

710
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,240
So you want me to beg Wan Xinxin

711
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,160
to persuade Qin Gang?

712
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,840
Beg? Absolutely, brother.

713
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,960
Just think about it.

714
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,980
It wasn't easy for me to find this job. Not at all.

715
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,280
This 4S dealership is a cushy position.

716
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,480
My current salary

717
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,720
is double what I made at my previous job.

718
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,920
Look, if he closes the store,

719
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,880
my livelihood is gone.

720
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,000
At my age,

721
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,280
going around for job interviews,

722
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,080
wouldn't that be embarrassing?

723
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,200
Don't you think?

724
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,120
I'm also sitting at home without a proper job.

725
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,180
You're different.

726
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,480
You're a respected doctor with substantial savings.

727
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,000
You don't need to worry about supporting a family.

728
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,060
I have children studying abroad too.

729
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,740
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware of that.

730
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,620
What I mainly wanted to say is that

731
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,200
my wife

732
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,360
will start acting up in just a few days.

733
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
It can't be that bad.

734
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,040
It is. She's always wanted to

735
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,840
rise up and be the one in charge.

736
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,170
Brother, you invited me for lunch,

737
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,560
can you be honest with me?

738
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,440
Is Qin Gang really closing the store

739
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,060
because of Wan Xinxin?

740
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,280
I think it's true.

741
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,140
Let me show you something.

742
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,080
Take a look.

743
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,760
What's this?

744
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
The account book.

745
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,720
Look.

746
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,260
I brought back all the account books.

747
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,040
This means that

748
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,600
after organizing these things,

749
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,610
I'll probably take some dividends

750
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,360
and just stay at home.

751
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,100
The financial deficit is quite serious.

752
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,600
Wait, isn't your company profitable?

753
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Profitable? It should be making money.

754
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,660
Look, our salaries

755
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
have basically never been delayed.

756
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,560
But there seems to be some issues with these books.

757
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,040
Well, I don't know about other things.

758
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,040
Dr. Hua.

759
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,480
I'd like to toast you.

760
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,440
Please help your sister.

761
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,050
Look, I don't have a job,

762
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,820
and your brother-in-law might lose his too.

763
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,640
No, sis.

764
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,260
Brother-in-law is just unemployed at most.

765
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,480
Don't nitpick, my dear.

766
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,640
I was there when he closed the store.

767
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,600
Couldn't stop him at all.

768
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,960
I don't know how to help.

769
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,890
He just cares about your feelings.

770
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,000
If you feel better and get over this,

771
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,120
he won't be so stubborn anymore.

772
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,640
Listen, go talk to him quickly.

773
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,080
Tell him to reopen the business.

774
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,880
He'll definitely listen to you.

775
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,440
How would my persuasion work?

776
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,920
What can I say about you?

777
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,000
You really don't know how good you have it.

778
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,530
What's wrong with Qin Gang?

779
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,920
He knows how to repent now.

780
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,920
Just give him a chance.

781
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,760
A prodigal son who returns is worth more than gold.

782
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,890
He's good-looking,

783
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,200
wealthy,

784
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,730
where else could you find such a catch?

785
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,540
Just for your brother-in-law's job,

786
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,800
you're willing to sacrifice me?

787
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,840
Didn't you just call him a prodigal son?

788
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,040
And now you're pushing me into the fire.

789
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,660
You two should get back together anyway.

790
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,900
After all, you have a child together.

791
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,360
I only agree to see him because of our child.

792
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,290
Without the child, I wouldn't even acknowledge him.

793
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,130
The child isn't a reason at all.

794
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,040
Fine, I won't say anything else,

795
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,280
but you must help with this job situation.

796
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,560
Mr. Qin closed his business because of you.

797
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,000
You're acting like nothing happened. That's not right.

798
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,880
No,

799
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,800
I need to think about it.

800
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,420
I need to figure out what to say to him.

801
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,960
Really?

802
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,840
Alright, take your time.

803
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,840
I'll go get your brother-in-law's phone first.

804
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
Think it through.

805
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,760
Sis.

806
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,320
Have some water before you go.

807
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,240
No need for water.

808
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,700
Just think about it, okay?

809
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,370
They made you the mediator.

810
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,240
Exactly.

811
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,540
But thinking about it,

812
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,060
I do share some responsibility for this.

813
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,320
Wan Xinxin, are you okay?

814
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,480
Can you stop being so naive?

815
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,360
This has nothing to do with you.

816
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,800
How is it not related to me?

817
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,400
He closed the shop because of me, didn't he?

818
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,530
Your brother-in-law Jiang

819
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,560
has account books that I've seen.

820
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,680
His shop was already failing completely.

821
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,320
He was losing money and just hanging on.

822
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
The car show just gave him an excuse

823
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,040
to save face. That's all.

824
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,540
You've seen the books?

825
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,240
I don't believe it.

826
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,000
When I was with him,

827
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,360
his shop was always profitable.

828
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,760
How could it be in the red?

829
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,370
Maybe it's just been a rough patch lately.

830
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,480
Wan Xinxin, haven't you always said

831
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,040
that experience counts for something, right?

832
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
Aren't I older than you?

833
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,920
Shouldn't you trust my judgment?

834
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,050
No, you're just jealous of him.

835
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,340
How about this,

836
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,840
I've said what I needed to say.

837
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,880
The truth will come to light.

838
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,080
It's up to you whether you listen or not.

839
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,560
Are you jealous?

840
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,920
No. Can you be serious?

841
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,320
I'm trying to tell you...

842

850
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:25,920
