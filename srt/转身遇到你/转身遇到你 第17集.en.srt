1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
Sir, I'm here to pick up my phone.

3
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
The one I brought in a few days ago.

4
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,120
The one with the broken screen.

5
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,640
Okay.

6
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,039
Is this the one?

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,920
It's fixed.

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Yes, thank you.

9
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
You're welcome.

10
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,560
Jiang Kaiyang, you heartless man!

11
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,120
Who are all these little vixens?

12
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,520
Models.

13
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Stop lying to me. Since when do models have price tags?

14
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,480
Those are dates.

15
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,300
You're talking nonsense.

16
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,900
Is there even a March 50th?

17
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,440
It's clearly 350 yuan.

18
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,320
What 350? They're not that cheap.

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,280
Xu Chunli, listen to me.

20
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
This is work. This is business entertainment.

21
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,920
You always say it's business entertainment.

22
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
I don't believe it anymore.

23
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,840
Without these social engagements, you can't close any deals?

24
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,300
Actually, I really can't.

25
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,920
Fine. You don't need to entertain clients anymore.

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
The shop is closed now.

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,360
Just entertain guests at home

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,160
then.

29
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,780
It won't taste so bitter after eating it.

30
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,720
Not so bitter now, right?

31
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,000
You know what? If my life

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,060
could always have a sweet candy in it,

33
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,520
how wonderful would that be?

34
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,920
Forget about candy.

35
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,640
Listen, your health is poor right now.

36
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
You're always getting sick.

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,240
You need more outdoor exercise.

38
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,770
I'll take you out sometime.

39
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,180
Don't I have you to take care of me?

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,079
Phone.

41
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,079
Hello?

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,860
Is this Wan Xinxin?

43
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm a teacher from the Southeast Art University administration.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,280
Our university is

45
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
holding an alumni gathering tomorrow.

46
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,760
Your academic performance was outstanding when you were a student.

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,320
Some of your student artwork

48
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,480
will be displayed tomorrow.

49
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,600
If you have time,

50
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,000
please come and attend tomorrow.

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Really?

52
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
It would be my honor. Yes, of course!

53
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,600
What's the time and location?

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,040
Tomorrow at 9 AM,

55
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,440
meet on the lawn by the school entrance.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,500
Great, no problem. See you tomorrow.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,660
Tomorrow I'll take you to see my art exhibition.

58
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
Wait, really?

59
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
I've known you all this time and never asked,

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
you graduated from college, right?

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,840
Of course I graduated from college.

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
What was your major?

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,400
Fine arts.

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,120
Fine arts?

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,280
Yes.

66
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,450
I never would have guessed.

67
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,440
You can't see that I'm

68
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,010
radiating artistic vibes?

69
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,600
Not at all.

70
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,840
What?

71
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,560
Are you blind?

72
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Really, there's

73
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,720
not a hint of artistic flair about you.

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,120
I have many good qualities. You'll discover them gradually.

75
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,420
Come with me tomorrow.

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,960
Art exhibition?

77
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,250
I'll open your eyes.

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,760
Okay.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,760
Come on, let's take a photo together.

80
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,880
Let's not take it.

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:26,880
Fine.

82
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,970
The old bacon still looks quite fresh.

83
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,600
Wan Xinxin.

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,640
Something feels strange to me.

85
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,120
Isn't this supposed to be this year's art exhibition?

86
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,450
If these are all alumni,

87
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,960
the age gap seems too big.

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,540
You mean those older ones?

89
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
They might be teachers.

90
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,080
No, if this is an art exhibition,

91
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,780
how would they display it?

92
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,480
The setting isn't right.

93
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,980
You don't know?

94
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,120
Our school often does these fancy events.

95
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Maybe in a while, a luxury car will come

96
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,120
and take us all to another location.

97
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
That fancy, huh?

98
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,880
This person... I almost got fired because of him.

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,600
Excuse me, may I ask

100
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,160
are you here for

101
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,640
the Southeast University art exhibition?

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,130
Isn't this the New Education seminar?

103
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,720
No, isn't this the foreign trade clothing sale?

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,880
Then what's going on?

105
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,040
What's happening here?

106
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,570
What's the situation here?

107
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,240
I'm sorry I'm late.

108
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,220
Please have a seat.

109
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,760
Sit down.

110
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
Wait, what's going on?

111
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,120
This is for you.

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,240
Everyone here today

113
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,560
are my teachers, neighbors,

114
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,440
classmates, and my wife.

115
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,400
From my past.

116
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,560
I had to gather everyone together

117
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,360
this way because I had no choice.

118
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,680
Let's get out of here.

119
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
Where would you run to? Sit down.

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,120
In everyone's eyes, I'm just a...

121
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,980
There's no art exhibition at all.

122
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,980
This was all arranged by Qin Gang.

123
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,360
Xinxin.

124
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,160
Since we're here, let's make the best of it.

125
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,890
Don't worry. I'm here with you.

126
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,000
What would I be afraid of?

127
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,880
You may

128
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,210
not understand why I'm doing this.

129
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,580
Because I feel regretful.

130
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,680
I regret all the mistakes

131
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,880
I've made before.

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,290
Especially in the past six months,

133
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,010
I've experienced a major life change.

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
After this incident, I've been reflecting on myself.

135
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,400
I was wrong.

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,840
I regret all the mistakes

137
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
I've made before.

138
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,040
So I've gathered everyone here today

139
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,040
to apologize to each of you personally.

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,640
Teacher Li.

141
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,520
You taught me before.

142
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,500
I was young and foolish back then.

143
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,240
I knew your eyesight was poor,

144
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,770
so I often sprinkled chalk dust in your lunch.

145
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,720
And I knew you had trouble walking.

146
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
So I deliberately damaged

147
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,480
your bicycle many times,

148
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,280
forcing you to push it all the way home.

149
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,120
Today I'm giving you an electric scooter.

150
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,520
Because I know you don't have a driver's license.

151
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,980
When you get your license,

152
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,640
I'll give you a car.

153
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,600
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

154
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Xiaohui.

155
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,020
When we were kids, our families were neighbors.

156
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,640
I'm 3 years older than you.

157
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
As the older one,

158
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,680
I should have looked after you.

159
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
But instead I bullied you every day.

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,250
I don't know how to make it up to you.

161
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
But I heard that

162
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
you now work for a shipping company.

163
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,960
You're often at sea and can't take care of your mother.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
This is a membership card for a senior living facility.

165
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,640
I've already registered your mother

166
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,920
and paid the membership fees.

167
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,000
The place has 24-hour care,

168
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,260
nutritious meals,

169
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,690
and doctors who do regular check-ups.

170
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
From now on, when you go to sea,

171
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,600
you won't have to worry about things at home.

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,880
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

173
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,040
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,720
Qin Gang, have you lost your mind?

175
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,850
Please let me finish what I have to say.

176
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,280
I know I owe you too much.

177
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,200
I've hurt you deeply.

178
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,120
I don't even know where to begin.

179
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,240
But since the day you left me,

180
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
I've been re-examining myself.

181
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,640
Only then did I realize how many mistakes I've made.

182
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,050
With so many people here today,

183
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,160
I don't know who will forgive me.

184
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,920
But you are the most important person to me.

185
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,400
I don't know how to make it up to you,

186
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,320
or if you'll even accept my amends.

187
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,320
But if I have the chance,

188
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,700
I will give everything I have,

189
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,720
my entire life to make it up to you.

190
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,580
Because I understand now,

191
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,490
you and Xiaobao are the most important people in my life.

192
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,800
Please forgive me.

193
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
You still can't forgive me, can you?

194
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,040
It's okay. I won't give up.

195
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,480
I will love you forever,

196
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,600
until the day you can forgive me.

197
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,400
Qin Gang.

198
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,320
You'd better mean everything you just said.

199
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,720
And you kept talking about love.

200
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,940
If you truly love someone,

201
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,290
you shouldn't make her sad.

202
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,500
You should make her smile.

203
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,080
Big brother Bao is asleep.

204
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,280
Like a withered little flower.

205
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,320
Pour some water, sprinkle some dew,

206
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,520
let the sunshine make it flourish.

207
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
Have a drink.

208
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,260
I don't want to.

209
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,640
Listen, Xinxin,

210
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,080
you shouldn't have let your sister leave.

211
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,680
She could've watched the baby.

212
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,560
If she were watching the baby, I could take you hiking.

213
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,880
You could see how scared I get in the mountains.

214
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,240
Or we could do this instead:

215
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,120
go see a movie.

216
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,040
I got movie tickets at half price today.

217
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,520
The theater will definitely be empty,

218
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,580
it'll feel like a private screening.

219
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,360
Or I could go shopping with you,

220
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,620
or get your nails done.

221
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,440
What do you say?

222
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,970
I'll stay with you even if it takes 5 or 6 hours.

223
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,010
I know you're trying to cheer me up,

224
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,320
but for some reason...

225
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm feeling really upset right now.

226
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
What are you upset about?

227
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
Actually, I also feel that what happened today

228
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,520
seems a bit off.

229
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,170
You think Qin Gang is lying to me again?

230
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,240
No, not exactly.

231
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,840
I just felt the atmosphere was really awkward.

232
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,680
Of course an apology meeting would be awkward.

233
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,200
But I

234
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,000
am happy to see him behave this way today.

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm actually quite pleased for him.

236
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,120
So you're

237
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,040
planning to forgive him?

238
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,640
What else can I do?

239
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,290
He's my baby's father, my ex-husband.

240
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,760
If he can truly change,

241
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,000
there's no need to treat him as an enemy forever,

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,480
right?

243
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,400
Yes.

244
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,120
So you're planning to take him back?

245
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,760
No, not that.

246
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,840
I just think

247
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
he's my baby's father,

248
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,340
and we'll always be connected through that.

249
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
So

250
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,560
I can't avoid seeing him forever, can I?

251
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,240
Right.

252
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,080
But Xinxin,

253
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
as an outsider watching from the sidelines,

254
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,320
I think you still have feelings for him.

255
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,560
I just feel that

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,400
he has changed somewhat.

257
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,040
He's grown up and matured.

258
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,160
Don't you think all this is too coincidental?

259
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,520
Can you stop being so suspicious of others?

260
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,680
Everyone can change.

261
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,520
Look at me,

262
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,440
I've changed a lot recently too.

263
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,440
I think as people grow,

264
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,880
and experience different things,

265
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,440
their perspectives will change.

266
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,920
Don't you think what happened today

267
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,180
is too much of a coincidence, Wan Xinxin?

268
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,200
You're not stupid.

269
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,280
He hired you for the car show,

270
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,240
then the show had an incident. It all seems too convenient.

271
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,040
His 4S store...

272
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,800
It's been losing money for a long time. It's not for you.

273
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't you think all of this was planned?

274
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,920
Oh come on,

275
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,600
you can't always analyze people with conspiracy theories.

276
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,240
How can I...

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,200
Listen, I know you've been hurt before.

278
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
But you can't use your past experiences

279
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,240
to judge others, right?

280
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,120
You should live more positively,

281
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,050
don't always stand in the shadows.

282
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,720
Fine,

283
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:57,720
okay.

284
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,600
Xinxin, you stay here.

285
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,160
Think about it.

286
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,080
I'll go cool off.

287
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
I'm going to

288
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,010
stop living in the shadows and get some sunshine.

289
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,000
Isn't it?

290
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,800
Xinxin has forgiven you.

291
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,800
Not yet.

292
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,000
But I can see

293
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,920
her attitude is getting better.

294
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,240
Great! That's a good start.

295
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,450
You need to keep trying.

296
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,760
I'll tell you again what I always say:

297
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,960
if you put your heart into it, you'll win Xinxin back.

298
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,920
Okay.

299
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,440
Mom.

300
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,680
When Wan Xinxin really comes back,

301
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,240
I'll take good care of her and Xiaobao.

302
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,600
And of course, you too.

303
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,720
Good. Looking forward to it.

304
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,920
Mom.

305
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,680
I have something to do. I need to go out again.

306
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,080
Alright. Come back soon.

307
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,120
Get some rest early.

308
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,480
Okay.

309
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
Call me if you need anything.

310
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,640
Son! Son!

311
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,760
Son! Son!

312
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,360
Son.

313
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,800
Can you send your dad a message?

314
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,600
Alright, you're forgiven.

315
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,090
Think quickly. What do you want to eat?

316
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,880
Fine. I'll tell you when I decide.

317
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,300
Good. Wait there. I'll be right over.

318
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,640
Wang, I need to criticize you about this.

319
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
I just don't understand.

320
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
Let me ask you something.

321
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,170
When you clean windows at home,

322
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,160
do you really clean like this?

323
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,360
People can tell you're cleaning windows,

324
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,800
but they might think you're

325
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,200
dancing to some pop song.

326
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,480
Look, there are fingerprints all over it.

327
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,140
This is unacceptable.

328
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,040
Do you see?

329
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,440
If this continues, I'll have to deduct points.

330
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,600
Do you understand?

331
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,880
Really, cleaning windows like you're dancing.

332
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,960
Where have you been all day?

333
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,200
What do you mean?

334
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,160
I don't understand.

335
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
Do I need to inform you

336
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,000
wherever I go?

337
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,020
You're getting irritated again.

338
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,880
Remember this, Xu Chunli.

339
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,080
I'm telling you, I, Jiang Kaiyang,

340
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,200
will make a comeback one day.

341
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
You look down on me now.

342
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,880
Come home early tonight.

343
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,540
We need to have a serious talk.

344
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,000
Mr. Qin

345
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,280
what are your instructions?

346
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,680
Having family troubles?

347
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,360
Not really.

348
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,800
You know what they say,

349
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,130
give a woman an inch and she'll take a mile.

350
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,060
Then let the facts speak for themselves.

351
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,120
Take this ledger home to show your wife.

352
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,360
Let her see that

353
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,040
our store

354
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,290
has made millions in profit this year.

355
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,800
If things continue like this,

356
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,280
in another 2 or 3 years,

357
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,930
you should become the manager.

358
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,040
You're back.

359
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,300
Didn't you say you had something to discuss with me?

360
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,240
Did I say that?

361
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,800
You dressed up so nicely to go out looking for a job.

362
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,280
You could have at least told me you were job hunting.

363
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,640
Fine. I'm officially informing you now.

364
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,760
I found one.

365
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,560
That was fast.

366
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Let me tell you.

367
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,960
I got my old job back. Understand?

368
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,520
Let me tell you, women are just

369
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,560
long on hair and short on wisdom.

370
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,600
I've only been unemployed for a few days,

371
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,680
and look at how you've been treating me.

372
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,280
I...

373
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,420
You're still bullying me.

374
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,640
No, who's bullying you?

375
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,200
Look at all those photos of women you have.

376
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,160
Can't I be a little upset about that?

377
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,520
No, you weren't just a little upset.

378
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,440
What you meant was...

379
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,400
You wanted to gather all the people in my phone photos

380
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,200
so you could interrogate them all.

381
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,960
Isn't that what you meant?

382
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,880
No.

383
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,060
Xu Chunli, let me tell you something.

384
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,440
I want to show you something.

385
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,080
The company ledger.

386
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,780
President Qin entrusted it to me.

387
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,000
Do you know our company

388
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,060
makes millions in profit every year?

389
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,460
And it will be even more in the future.

390
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,290
I knew you could make money.

391
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,880
Have some self-respect.

392
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,240
Didn't you want a divorce?

393
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,520
I was just joking.

394
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,120
I was just trying to scare you a little.

395
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,480
No, it wasn't just scaring me.

396
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,210
A few days ago you wouldn't even let me in the door.

397
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,520
But I let you in eventually,

398
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,240
and even made braised ribs for you.

399
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,400
It's no use, Xu Chunli.

400
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,760
Even if you made me braised ribs every day,

401
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,040
it wouldn't heal my wounded heart.

402
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,220
What should we do then?

403
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,560
There's nothing to do.

404
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,600
Two words: let's divorce.

405
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,080
I...

406
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,720
Kaiyang.

407
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,640
Kaiyang.

408
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,720
Kaiyang, open the door!

409
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,480
Come on, sis.

410
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,120
Stop crying.

411
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,520
Why are you and my brother-in-law

412
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,320
acting like kids playing house?

413
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,120
It's different this time.

414
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,050
He ignored me all night yesterday.

415
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,040
Wouldn't even let me in the bedroom.

416
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I had to sleep on the couch all night.

417
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,160
Look, do this.

418
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,250
When you go home, cook a few dishes,

419
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,160
have a drink with him,

420
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,560
say some nice things,

421
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,560
and sweet-talk him a little. That'll work.

422
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,490
You have no idea.

423
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,130
He's so full of himself now.

424
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,380
Qin Gang's company has reopened,

425
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,240
and they want him to be the manager.

426
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,240
They say the company can make millions a year,

427
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,770
and he'll get a commission.

428
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,800
Does that company actually make money?

429
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,840
Make money? I've seen the books.

430
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,880
Did you really see the books?

431
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,320
I did.

432
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,560
That old fox.

433
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,680
He really is an old fox.

434
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,640
What? You're saying I talk too much?

435
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,640
I didn't say that. Go on.

436
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,600
What am I supposed to say?

437
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,560
You just said I talk too much.

438
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,880
What can I possibly say now?

439
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm leaving.

440
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,600
No, sis.

441
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,040
I told you so.

442
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,480
Qin Gang definitely had ulterior motives asking you to work for him.

443
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,410
What does this have to do with Qin Gang?

444
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,160
Then who does it involve?

445
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,240
Actually, I think in this matter,

446
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,770
Qin Gang is quite innocent.

447
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,320
Ah, Qin Gang?

448
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:48,840
Yes.

449
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,360
Think about it. If I hadn't gone to work for him,

450
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,080
Liu Wei wouldn't have known, and he wouldn't have set this trap.

451
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,140
You know, it caused Qin Gang to lose quite a bit of money.

452
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,840
Of course, Xinxin.

453
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,640
As an outsider, I've been watching from the sidelines.

454
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,840
I think you still have feelings for him.

455
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,480
I just feel that

456
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,320
he has changed somewhat.

457
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,920
He's grown up and matured.

458
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,440
Sunbathing?

459
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,080
It's cloudy.

460
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,080
There's no sun.

461
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
It's in a bad mood.

462
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,370
I'm keeping it company to get some UV rays.

463
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,850
It should definitely get some sun.

464
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,480
I was a bit harsh earlier. I'm sorry.

465
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,120
I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at myself.

466
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,700
But you can't always look at others this way.

467
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,340
Qin Gang's 4S dealership is really profitable.

468
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,120
And now they've reopened.

469
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
Have you seen the books?

470
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,520
My sister has.

471
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,240
Trust me, your sister doesn't understand financial statements.

472
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,040
Why do you always have this know-it-all attitude?

473
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,440
Yes, Qin Gang hurt me.

474
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,560
But I've forgiven him.

475
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,440
Why can't you forgive him too?

476
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Wan Xinxin, you really don't trust me?

477
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,000
I trust you.

478
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,680
But I also trust my sister.

479
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,440
I know you're worried I'll get taken advantage of.

480
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,120
But you don't need to lie.

481
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,360
Is that how you see me?

482
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,320
I meant white lies.

483
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,720
I don't like lying.

484
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,340
But I have lied before.

485
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,160
Like when we went camping.

486
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,760
What I told my daughter Ruirui.

487
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,420
What I said.

488
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,960
I love you.

489
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,240
What are you laughing at?

490
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,080
I think I'm quite ridiculous.

491
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,760
What's wrong?

492
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,440
I came back this time hoping to get back together with you,

493
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,040
but now I'm helping you chase after Wan Xinxin.

494
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,560
To help you pursue her,

495
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,440
I even have to create scenarios for you.

496
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
I think I'm so talented.

497
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,960
I could be a screenwriter.

498
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,080
You're not a screenwriter. You're a director.

499
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,290
Everything is under your control.

500
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,840
But I just can't understand your heart.

501
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,240
Who knows what you're really thinking?

502
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,680
If you really win them back,

503
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,640
and enjoy family life as a happy trio,

504
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,040
what about me?

505
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,920
At this moment,

506
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,000
let's not fight among ourselves, okay?

507
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,040
We should be seeing

508
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,520
Hua Ming and Wan Xinxin arguing instead.

509
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,640
Right.

510
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,040
Let's not waste time.

511
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,760
Go do what you need to do.

512
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,000
Yes, Director Liu.

513
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,240
I'm leaving.

514
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,890
Going to see your uncle?

515
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,160
Yes, it's his birthday today.

516
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,560
Let me go with you.

517
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,760
No need. I can go by myself.

518
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Are you sure?

519
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,120
I managed on my own before I met you.

520
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,770
Remember to wear your coat. It's windy by the sea.

521
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,720
Dad.

522
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,040
I'm not sure if it's still appropriate to call you that.

523
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,800
I was immature before and rarely came to see you.

524
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,920
Today is your birthday.

525
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,040
I...

526
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,300
I came specifically to apologize to you.

527
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,240
Dad.

528
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,720
I've been living in a bubble.

529
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,330
The day my father left my mother and me,

530
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,200
my mother became a strong woman.

531
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,320
She was afraid I'd be bullied out there.

532
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,480
I've never suffered any hardship since childhood.

533
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,840
Let alone consider others' feelings.

534
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:16,960
But when Xinxin

535
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,890
took our child and left me that day,

536
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,800
I suddenly felt

537
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,880
completely hollow inside.

538
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
I had nothing.

539
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,220
I was wrong, plain and simple.

540
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,240
Xinxin has every right to hate me.

541
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,720
But now I just

542
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,280
want Xinxin to give me another chance.

543
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,280
I want to open my heart

544
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,800
and show her, let her know

545
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
that I love her.

546
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
I can't live without her.

547
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,040
You don't need to do this.

548
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,120
Xinxin.

549
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,360
What are you doing, Qin Gang?

550
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,800
Let go of me.

551
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,840
Xinxin, I'm begging you.

552
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,010
Please give me one more chance.

553
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,280
I love you.

554
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,460
I love Xiaobao. I love our family.

555
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,840
Are you really going to just watch

556
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,570
Xiaobao grow up without a home?

557
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,800
If you knew this would happen, why did you do it?

558
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,720
I really don't know how to face you anymore.

559
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,360
I need some time to process this.

560
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,480
How long will it take?

561
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,520
I don't know. I really don't know.

562
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,960
It's okay.

563
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,000
As long as you come back.

564
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,400
I'm willing to wait for you.

565
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,800
I can wait forever.

566
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,600
Even if it takes 30 or 50 years.

567
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,920
I'm willing to wait even if it costs me my entire life.

568
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,250
As long as you come back.

569
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,040
I thought I would never love again.

570
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,320
Spring flowers wouldn't bloom for me.

571
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,640
Yet I happened to meet you.

572
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,440
In this bustling crowd.

573
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:51,200
I thought after all life's changes,

574
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,000
My heart would never race again.

575
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yet I happened to meet you.

576
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,560
But I no longer believe in love.

577
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,000
It's not that I don't want to love,

578
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,000
Even though I've been hurt before.

579
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,440
Who can predict what fate has in store?

580
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,200
It's not that I don't want to love,

581
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,920
But love has become as vast as the ocean.

582
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:39,800
Perhaps I'm destined to wait a lifetime.

583
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,500
After visiting my father,

584
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,440
I had some work to take care of.

585
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,970
Why are you back so late too?

586
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,240
I went to the beach bar

587
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,680
to talk with a friend.

588
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,080
Today I...

589
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,800
Um,

590
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,240
I suddenly have a headache.

591
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,400
I want to go out for a walk.

592
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,239
Get some rest.

593
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,940
That's not how you drink alcohol.

594
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,400
Brother,

595
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,639
six bottles.

596
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,739
Take it easy on the drinks.

597
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,840
Look, Ming,

598
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,480
I can't keep up with you drinking like this.

599
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,180
I didn't ask you to join me.

600
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,520
Just watch.

601
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,640
It's not that I don't want to love,

602
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,360
even though I've been hurt before.

603
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,560
Who can see through

604
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,040
the arrangements of fate?

605
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,760
It's not that I don't want to love,

606
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,360
but when I turn around, love has become an ocean.

607
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,440
Perhaps it's destined

608
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,320
to take a lifetime.

609
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,440
Hey, you're just drinking without saying anything.

610
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,120
It's scary.

611
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,300
Talk to me a little.

612
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,660
What's wrong with you?

613
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,440
Who bullied you?

614
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,300
Did Huaming bully you?

615
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,240
What's going on?

616
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,880
I feel terrible inside.

617
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,130
What's wrong? Tell me quickly.

618
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,560
I can't say it.

619
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,840
What can't you say? I'm dying of anxiety.

620
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,880
I'm mainly afraid you can't accept it.

621
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,640
What can't I accept?

622
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,120
Just tell me quickly.

623
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,400
I thought I would never love again.

624
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,080
Spring flowers would not bloom for me.

625
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,140
The lyrics are too cliché.

626
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,960
Yes. When I first heard it on the radio,

627
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,320
I also thought it was a very cheesy song.

628
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,120
But this cheesy song really touched my heart.

629
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,760
You know,

630
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,880
at our age,

631
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,360
what's the most torturous and frightening thing?

632
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,370
The most torturous thing at your age is

633
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,920
drinking yourself to death without saying anything.

634
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,040
The most torturous thing at our age is

635
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,360
no matter how much I drink, I stay sober.

636
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,090
It's drunk here,

637
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,040
but here can never get drunk. Always clear-headed.

638
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,770
I've been controlling myself.

639
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,170
Stop explaining. What's with you?

640
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,960
Are you afraid I'll cling to you?

641
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,840
As if I would.

642
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,200
I'm already 40 years old.

643
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,240
About 10 years older than you.

644
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,960
And my daughter is already 10.

645
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
I just feel like...

646
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,880
All that kneeling down, diamond rings,

647
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,640
flowers and such things,

648
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,360
all those romantic gestures,

649
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,760
they're all in the past for me.

650
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,600
Do you understand me?

651
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,880
I'm tired. Going to sleep.

652
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
Old man.

653
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,320
Do you like me?

654
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,160
No.

655
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,320
Then why are you so nice to me?

656
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,800
I just feel sorry for you.

657
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,090
Your pity has gone beyond normal boundaries.

658
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,680
Has it?

659
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,960
Yes. Many times.

660
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,620
Then I'll tone it down from now on.

661
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,920
I'm 40 years old.

662
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,480
Divorced with a 10-year-old daughter.

663
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,080
This door of mine, for everyone,

664
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,640
is now closed.

665
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,660
Except for Ruirui, of course.

666
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,880
My daughter.

667
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,130
But strangely enough, Wan Xinxin,

668
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,760
somehow by coincidence,

669
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,120
has walked into my life.

670
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,360
She came to this door and pushed it open.

671
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,440
Let her push it. That's fine.

672
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,200
Do you like her?

673
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,120
I've fallen for Hua Ming.

674
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,250
You really have feelings for Hua Ming?

675
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,560
Well...

676
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,000
Hua Ming is a good man.

677
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,440
But the gap between you two is too big.

678
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,800
I don't care about any gap.

679
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,080
I like him and that's that.

680
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,320
Does he know?

681
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,040
That's just it, he doesn't know.

682
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,800
The key is that I...

683
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,520
I think I'm just imagining things.

684
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,360
Every day I...

685
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,840
He doesn't respond.

686
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,040
I like her.

687
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,520
I don't just like her,

688
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,080
I also like her brother Bao.

689
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Why?

690
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,880
In your words,

691
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,520
she should be what you call my right person,

692
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,960
the one meant for me.

693
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,960
Isn't it good that you two are like this?

694
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,450
That's what makes it so torturous.

695
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,160
Exactly. It's really torturous.

696
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,680
Usually,

697
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
I feel like he really cares about me.

698
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,240
Whenever I try to get close to him,

699
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,360
he backs away.

700
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,640
I don't know what he's thinking,

701
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,760
being hot and cold.

702
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,000
What should I do?

703
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,600
What do you think I should do?

704
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,600
I don't know what to do either.

705
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,040
I just think Huaming isn't reliable.

706
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,320
You should get back together with Qin Gang.

707
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,560
Qin Gang

708
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,120
has been pursuing me quite intensely lately.

709
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,880
Exactly.

710
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,000
And he's Bao's father.

711
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,960
That's right.

712
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,410
But I don't know if we can

713
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,000
get back what we once had.

714
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,720
Take it slow and those feelings will come back.

715
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,080
The key issue is that I still

716
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,490
have feelings for Huaming.

717
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,880
Love won't put food on the table.

718
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,600
You're a woman,

719
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,330
you need someone to rely on.

720
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,820
Don't take this the wrong way.

721
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,080
What I'm telling you,

722
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,680
you'll understand someday.

723
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,280
Life is really too much sometimes.

724
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
Right person, wrong time.

725
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,680
We shouldn't have met each other at this time.

726
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,810
And we shouldn't have fallen for each other at this time.

727
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,650
Between us, there's always

728
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:38,920
something off.

729
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,680
We're always out of sync.

730
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,020
If you're out of sync, just find a rhythm that works.

731
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,640
No, what are you planning to do next?

732
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,650
It's not about what I plan to do.

733
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,420
The decision has to be left to Wan Xinxin.

734
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
It's up to her.

735
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,040
Yes.

736
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,520
Bro, let me ask you.

737
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,970
Have you ever confessed your feelings to Wan Xinxin?

738
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,720
There were a few times I wanted to.

739
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
But something always interrupted.

740
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,450
If you get interrupted, find another chance.

741
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,800
No, you're giving up without even confessing.

742
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,240
You're even worse than me in this regard.

743
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,480
I pursued Shi Lu and although I didn't succeed,

744
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,880
I kept trying.

745
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,880
Ming, listen to me.

746
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,760
You must confess to her.

747
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,980
You need to hear the answer from Wan Xinxin herself.

748
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
Hear it directly from her.
