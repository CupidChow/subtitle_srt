1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,200
His teeth aren't good lately. Didn't you know?

3
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,440
He likes tender food.

4
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
Have some shredded chicken.

5
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,420
You don't know about this, do you?

6
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,890
Age has its advantages.

7
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,960
As long as it's cooked right,

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
it has more flavor than tender food.

9
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,360
Come on, Ruirui, eat your vegetables.

10
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,800
When we eat,

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
Will he eat, Uncle?

12
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,600
we don't talk during meals.

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,400
Daddy likes vegetables and vegetarian food.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
Ruirui likes vegetables and vegetarian food.

15
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,320
Eating vegetables helps you grow taller.

16
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
We don't eat meat.

17
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,560
Uncle.

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,010
What are you doing the day after tomorrow evening? Are you free?

19
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,079
What's up?

20
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,160
Well, let's go see that

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,520
Finding Mr. Right. It's really good.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
Finding Mr. Right?

23
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,760
Wasn't that released years ago?

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,440
It's a classic re-release. Come on.

25
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,480
Let's do this,

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,050
we'll talk about it when the day comes.

27
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,680
What do you mean 'we'll talk about it'?

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,040
What important thing do you have that day

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,120
that's more important than watching a movie with me?

30
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,840
Are you coming?

31
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,800
Or not?

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,760
Well, that day...

33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll go when I'm free.

34
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
Can you get me some frozen milk from the fridge?

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,240
Sure, I'll heat it up.

36
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,960
The measured portion, right?

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,360
Yes.

38
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,040
Okay.

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,720
Eat up, Ruirui.

40
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,160
Eat quickly.

41
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,200
Mister.

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
The milk is ready here.

43
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,040
Come, give it to me.

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,760
Let me feed them.

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,740
Give it to me first.

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,000
Alright.

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,320
You all eat.

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,360
Here.

49
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
Come, give it to me.

50
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,410
I've already eaten.

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,600
Help yourselves.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Look at you, you're truly the sweetest guy ever.

53
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,480
See? The baby stops crying as soon as you hold him.

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Baby, baby.

55
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,760
Don't cry. Have your milk.

56
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,440
Gross.

57
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,960
Ruirui.

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,520
Eat first.

59
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,240
No.

60
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,170
Xinxin, can I talk to you about something?

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,450
Could you be a little more careful?

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,440
What? What's wrong?

63
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,840
Does my haircut look bad?

64
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,280
No, I mean...

65
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,010
Are you happy that Huarui is like this?

66
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,820
What's wrong with her?

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,680
What's wrong with me?

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,440
It's not about you. You're a mother too.

69
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,120
The way you talk and act in front of the kids...

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,840
You need to be more mindful.

71
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,210
What should I be mindful of?

72
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
What exactly do you want me to watch?

73
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Look.

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,040
It doesn't matter how much we adults argue.

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,800
Huarui isn't a little kid anymore.

76
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
She understands everything.

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,480
She sees it all.

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,400
She ran out crying.

79
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you think that's okay?

80
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,120
Wait, what did I say or do?

81
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,240
Did I use foul language or what?

82
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,560
Did I say anything inappropriate?

83
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,600
Fine.

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,480
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,160
Okay, don't cry.

86
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
No, it's my fault.

87
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,640
Go to mommy.

88
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,140
Now is exactly when the enemy will attack fiercely.

89
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,320
We absolutely cannot back down.

90
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,040
Didn't Ming say he really dotes on his daughter?

91
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,720
Exactly.

92
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,680
So you need to start by getting to his daughter first.

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,280
Win his daughter over first.

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,040
I won't eat it.

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,240
You're mean. You just want me to get fat.

96
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,980
Fine. You don't have to eat it.

97
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
Why don't you draw a portrait of me instead?

98
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,880
I don't feel like drawing you.

99
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,380
Then I'll draw one for you.

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,360
No thanks.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,940
Then let's draw together.

102
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,640
Look, this teddy bear is you.

103
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,000
This is me, and this is your mom.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,240
And we live in this house

105
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,640
that belongs to your dad.

106
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,080
We'll grow up together in this house.

107
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,240
Your dad will shelter us from wind and rain.

108
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,600
But don't worry,

109
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,320
I will never take your dad away from you.

110
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,360
And you're luckier than many other kids.

111
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,640
Do you know why?

112
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,680
Why?

113
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,240
Because you have two moms.

114
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,040
Two moms who both love you.

115
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,040
Both can help you when you need it most.

116
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,120
For example,

117
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,080
I can teach you singing, dancing, and painting.

118
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,560
Most importantly,

119
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
I'll let you eat ice cream.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,160
Really?

121
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,540
Pinky promise.

122
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,940
Pinky promise.

123
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,320
But not too much.

124
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Actually, this picture you drew is really beautiful.

125
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,090
Then I'll give this picture to you.

126
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,760
Okay.

127
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,220
Thank you, Sister Xinxin.

128
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,360
My mom would never do this.

129
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,960
She just lectures me all the time.

130
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,690
Then sends me to after-school programs to study.

131
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,120
If you want to in the future,

132
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,080
I'll study with you and play with you.

133
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,680
I'll be your best friend. How about that?

134
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,840
But I really don't want you

135
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,320
to take my dad away.

136
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,760
Mom always says

137
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
that you took Dad away.

138
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,640
And prevented him from returning to America to be with me.

139
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,000
I hope Dad belongs to all of us.

140
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
I swear to you,

141
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,480
I never intended to take your father away.

142
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,610
Dad truly belongs to everyone.

143
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,000
Just like in the future,

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,640
you're welcome to come back and live in this house.

145
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,400
You can visit your dad whenever you want.

146
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,680
Then I feel relieved.

147
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,960
Does this drawing look like you?

148
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,880
This drawing.

149
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,680
Isn't it less cute than you?

150
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,040
What are you two pretty girls whispering about?

151
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,040
Should we tell him?

152
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,920
No, let's not.

153
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,520
Right. This is our secret.

154
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,680
Good girl, Ruirui. Your drawing is beautiful.

155
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
What are you doing?

156
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Thank you.

157
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,680
What are you thanking me for?

158
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,640
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,040
Are you still mad?

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,080
Who would be that petty to get angry?

162
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I've been having headaches lately.

163
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,900
I'm giving you headaches?

164
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,600
I haven't had headaches for years, but now they're back.

165
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,640
Of course. Three women would give anyone a headache.

166
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,440
Oh my!

167
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,720
Oh dear!

168
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,320
Oh!

169
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,160
Ruirui.

170
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,320
Oh, my head hurts.

171
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
Have some water.

172
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
Thank you, Mom.

173
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
My head hurts too.

174
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,080
There, there.

175
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,800
It hurts.

176
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,240
Just take some medicine for the headache.

177
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,570
Go get me some medicine.

178
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,900
Take a painkiller.

179
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,880
Sit down.

180
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,320
What medicine? Sit properly.

181
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,200
I really don't have pain anymore.

182
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,520
Sit still. Don't pretend with me.

183
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,440
The best neurosurgeon

184
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,480
has the worst migraines.

185
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,080
Don't you know that?

186
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,920
It doesn't hurt anymore.

187
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,040
Sit still.

188
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,760
I've always been the one massaging your headaches.

189
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,160
Stop pretending with me.

190
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,520
Feel better now?

191
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,680
Daddy, let me give you a massage too.

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,920
Good girl.

193
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
Ruirui, Mommy has a suggestion.

194
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,400
Why don't you draw a picture for Daddy?

195
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
And Mommy will massage Daddy's head.

197
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,680
That's enough.

198
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
Sit properly.

199
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,880
Don't pretend with me.

200
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,060
Is this more comfortable?

201
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,320
Look who's here!

202
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,600
What's wrong, Master Wan?

203
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,880
Bad mood?

204
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,120
Please don't speak English to me.

205
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,780
I can't handle that right now.

206
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,960
All right.

207
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
What's going on?

208
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,480
Not happy to see me?

209
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,360
It's not about seeing you.

210
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,620
I can't be happy seeing anyone right now.

211
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,040
That won't do.

212
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,160
Nothing should interfere with our creative work.

213
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,480
Now I have two pieces of good news.

214
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,620
Do you want to hear the good one or the better one?

215
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,400
Finally some good news.

216
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,160
Just tell me either one.

217
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,220
Listen carefully.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,960
This is a new commission contract.

219
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,840
Since your paintings have increased in value,

220
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,640
therefore,

221
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,760
to better control the quantity of your work,

222
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,090
we'll only create this one painting for the rest of the year.

223
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,480
This is quite extraordinary.

224
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,610
What's so extraordinary about it?

225
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,610
An invitation from the French Academy of Contemporary Art.

226
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,200
After completing this painting,

227
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,080
you can go directly to study in France.

228
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,480
Just think about it. France,

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,640
the dream destination for so many young artists.

230
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,240
Paris, my dear!

231
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
If you want,

232
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,480
you can stay there after graduation.

233
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,320
You can sign directly with their academy's art gallery

234
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,080
and become their contracted artist.

235
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,520
They can also process your immigration,

236
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,320
and from then on, you'll be French.

237
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,000
No, no, wait.

238
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,400
Hold on a second.

239
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,920
You mentioned signing a contract. What contract? I don't understand.

240
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,920
A lifetime contract as an artist with the French Academy of Contemporary Art.

241
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,440
I

242
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,360
Yes.

243
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,640
No way. Is this for real?

244
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,300
It's in black and white. How could it be fake?

245
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,240
Wait a minute.

246
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,930
This is where so many masters got their start.

247
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,280
With this platform,

248
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,080
you'll probably say goodbye

249
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,140
to me as your agent.

250
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,320
That's impossible.

251
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,600
You're my agent,

252
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,720
my benefactor.

253
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,680
How could I ever say goodbye to you?

254
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,080
I'm so touched.

255
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,280
Those words mean everything to me.

256
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,840
Xinxin,

257
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,490
make the most of this opportunity.

258
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,880
Let me think about it a bit more.

259
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,610
I mean...

260
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,520
What is there to think about, miss?

261
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,600
No, wait.

262
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,400
This is such a big deal and it's too sudden.

263
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,960
Suddenly going to France...

264
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,520
My entire life path will have to change.

265
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,200
And my personal life will have to change too.

266
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,920
Fine.

267
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,400
You're so weird.

268
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,240
If it were someone else,

269
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,370
they'd be crying their eyes out by now.

270
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,300
I don't understand it.

271
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,420
But I'll respect your choice.

272
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,170
You're not doing this for that older guy, are you?

273
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,320
Some people you only meet once in a lifetime.

274
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,240
Some opportunities only come once in a lifetime.

275
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,860
Think about it carefully.

276
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,560
Hey, why did you call me here?

277
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,730
Can't you just keep me company?

278
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,160
You've got it all now - a wife, a child, and an ex-wife.

279
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,880
One big happy family of four.

280
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,360
How exciting.

281
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,080
Wife,

282
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,560
child,

283
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,080
ex-wife -

284
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,080
not one of them is easy to deal with.

285
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,740
I'm completely overwhelmed.

286
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,320
I heard about it from Wan.

287
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,200
So what's your plan?

288
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,000
Are you going back to your old flame or marrying your new love?

289
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,320
Who told you that? It's not that serious.

290
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,360
How nice. Two women fighting over you.

291
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,160
Unlike me.

292
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,440
In front of Shi Lu, I'm just like

293
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,840
glass - completely transparent.

294
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,000
You're always hanging around her.

295
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,370
Seeing someone and ignoring them are two different things.

296
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,800
Brother Ming, give me some advice.

297
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,560
How can I get her to notice me?

298
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,680
To care about me?

299
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,960
Come here.

300
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,400
What? What is it?

301
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,120
Ouch!

302
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,100
Damn it!

303
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,930
Does it hurt?

304
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,360
Of course it hurts! What are you doing?

305
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,320
Good. That's exactly my advice -

306
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,920
make your presence felt.

307
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,760
What do you mean?

308
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
Presence means

309
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,440
making her aware of you first.

310
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,480
Like how I just made you aware of me.

311
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
For example, when Wan Xinxin appeared

312
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,200
in my trunk with her baby brother,

313
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,520
she entered my world.

314
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,560
I became aware of her.

315
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,720
Later, whenever she showed up, I got annoyed.

316
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,599
Every time I saw her, I was irritated.

317
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,800
But eventually, I fell for her.

318
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,599
Wait a minute.

319
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,640
Why are you talking about Wan Xinxin?

320
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,839
I'm asking about Shi Lu, not Wan Xinxin.

321
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,440
You can't expect me to punch Shi Lu!

322
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,319
I'd be crazy! That would be suicide!

323
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,859
Your intelligence...

324
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,839
What time is it?

325
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,480
That barbell. Get under it.

326
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,240
What do you mean?

327
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,640
Squat down.

328
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
I don't know how.

329
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,120
I'll teach you. Lift it up.

330
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,600
Up!

331
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,640
Up! Get up! Quickly!

332
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,240
Now squat down slowly.

333
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,560
Squat.

334
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,000
Squat!

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,660
Squatting.

336
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,280
Now stand up. Can you get up?

337
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,480
Up!

338
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,080
Push harder!

339
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,240
I can't!

340
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,000
Can't get up, huh?

341
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,480
You're stuck.

342
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,160
Perfect!

343
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,600
Sorry, buddy.

344
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
I really need to go check on my kid.

345
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,360
I'm completely overwhelmed.

346
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,280
I can barely help myself. I've got to go.

347
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,080
Call someone if you need help.

348
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,200
Hey! What about drinks tonight?

349
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,060
Not happening.

350
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:06,680
Wait!

351
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,760
Is anyone there?

352
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,960
Help!

353
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,560
Presence.

354
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,040
Shi Lu's presence.

355
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,360
That's awful.

356
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,160
I'm up.

357
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Kaiyang, can we not go?

358
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,200
There are plenty of other jobs out there.

359
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,280
Why bother?

360
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm just one step away.

361
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,240
If I can secure all these contracts,

362
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,320
do you know how much commission I'll get?

363
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,000
What if I can stay on as the store manager?

364
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Have you thought about that?

365
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,200
But they've already fired you.

366
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,160
If you keep pushing like this,

367
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,320
aren't you just setting yourself up for disappointment?

368
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,280
Xu Chunli, please don't be like this.

369
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,760
You can't be so discouraged.

370
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,200
At this critical moment, you're not supporting me.

371
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,720
Instead, you're being negative.

372
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,840
What are you trying to say?

373
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,760
I just don't want you to get hurt.

374
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,080
Here, have some apple.

375
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,400
Chunli.

376
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,120
As long as I can get this commission,

377
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,980
I'd even crawl through their legs if I had to.

378
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,440
Crawl.

379
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,120
Do you like Paris?

380
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,000
I've been to Paris as a tourist before.

381
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,440
They call it the city of romance, but I think

382
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
people there are actually always in a rush,

383
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,920
nothing special really.

384
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
What if

385
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,960
we lived in Paris together?

386
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,530
Would you like that?

387
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,560
Why bring this up suddenly?

388
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,000
No reason. Just thinking out loud.

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,240
I just imagined

390
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,880
if the two of us

391
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,080
were walking along the Seine at sunset,

392
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,440
it would be beautiful.

393
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,280
I've actually been to many places,

394
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,960
and I spent the most time in Seattle.

395
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't know why,

396
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,600
but even after living abroad for 10 or 20 years,

397
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,400
a foreign country still feels foreign to me.

398
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,360
I never feel like I truly belong there.

399
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,290
Maybe it's because I can't find a sense of belonging.

400
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,580
Sounds like you're quite nostalgic.

401
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,580
Would you like some coffee? I can bring you a cup.

402
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
Xinxin, you're a liar.

403
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,360
I heard you want to take my dad to Paris.

404
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,640
You want to steal my dad and take him to France.

405
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,960
You're just a liar.

406
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,220
Who said I want to take your dad to France?

407
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,000
Ruirui.

408
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,040
Ruirui.

409
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,960
What's wrong?

410
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,240
Come quickly.

411
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,320
Ruirui.

412
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,580
Ruirui, what's wrong?

413
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,920
Xinxin pushed me.

414
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,760
Come, get up.

415
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,800
Where did you hurt yourself?

416
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,120
Where are you hurt?

417
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,080
Let daddy take a look.

418
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,800
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

419
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,480
Why argue with a child?

420
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,120
No, I didn't push her.

421
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:26,880
Xiaqing

422
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,800
You did push me.

423
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,320
Alright. It's okay. Let's find your mom.

424
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,080
Xiaqing

425
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,800
Who pushed you?

426
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,320
I'm here.

427
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,880
How did I push you?

428
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,960
She pushed me.

429
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,640
Um, just now...

430
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,600
She fell, she fell.

431
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,400
Get up.

432
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,320
She just pushed me.

433
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,480
I didn't push her.

434
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,360
I know, I know.

435
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,040
Wan Xinxin.

436
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,680
I've put up with you long enough.

437
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,520
Now you're even going after children.

438
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
Is that appropriate?

439
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,160
No, I...

440
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
It wasn't intentional. I know.

441
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,600
I...

442
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,800
Is Ruirui okay?

443
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,620
It's alright, Ruirui.

444
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,140
Xiaqing, check if her bones are injured.

445
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,920
I really didn't push her.

446
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,120
It wasn't Xinxin's fault. She's just a child.

447
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,960
Why are you making such a big deal out of this?

448
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,420
Just talk it out properly.

449
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,040
I didn't push her. She fell by herself.

450
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,840
I'm just saying...

451
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,960
I'm just saying you need to know I didn't do it.

452
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,120
I know.

453
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
Huarui is my daughter. I believe her.

454
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,800
No, Huaming.

455
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,560
I've noticed since the child came back,

456
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,290
there's absolutely no trust between us anymore.

457
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,200
You're all ganging up on me, aren't you?

458
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Caishen.

459
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,450
What's wrong, Master? Why are you crying?

460
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,600
It's nothing.

461
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,000
I won't interfere with your personal life,

462
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,280
but I need to remind you about work.

463
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,090
It's the 25th today. The deadline is here.

464
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,940
I've already finished the drawings.

465
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,560
I left them at home.

466
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600
What date did you say it is?

467
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,520
The 25th.

468
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,000
It's already the 25th?

469
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes, it is.

470
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,440
Xiaoyu, can you watch my son for me?

471
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,280
All his things are in this bag.

472
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,640
Take whatever you need.

473
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,100
I'll go get the drawings and come right back.

474
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,720
Okay.

475
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,560
I'm going now.

476
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,960
What's going on with you?

477
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,220
You picked leaves from my tree to make coasters.

478
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,160
Give me back my leaves.

479
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,320
Alright.

480
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,600
Go get the knife.

481
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,560
Have a seat.

482
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,760
Huaming.

483
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,640
Today marks 15 years since we first met.

484
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,840
Let's celebrate.

485
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,280
Today

486
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,700
is the third anniversary of our divorce.

487
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,160
Actually, what I did

488
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,680
wasn't entirely for myself.

489
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,320
I just wanted

490
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,040
to give our child

491
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,300
a healthy and happy family environment.

492
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,600
I wasn't wrong to do that, was I?

493
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,860
No, you weren't wrong,

494
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,120
Xiaqing.

495
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,680
Actually, since you came back, I've been wanting to tell you something.

496
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,200
We'll talk about it later.

497
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,880
Time to cut the cake!

498
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,960
Let's cut the cake!

499
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,680
Cake time!

500
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,080
Okay, let's cut the cake.

501
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,040
Let's cut the cake now.

502
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,040
Come on, light the candles.

503
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,560
Ready? One, two, three!

504
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
Mom and Dad, let's dance together!

505
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,240
The king invites his princess to dance with him.

506
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,040
Okay.

507
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,160
The princess should stay close to the king.

508
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,400
Mom,

509
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
come join us.

510
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,620
Come on.

511
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,040
Okay.

512
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,760
Come on.

513
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,280
Mom and Dad, dance together.

514
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,610
I'll play the piano for you.

515
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,680
Let's begin.

516
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Let's dance. Our child is watching.

517
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,200
It's been a long time since I've been this close to you.

518
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,560
Do you remember?

519
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
The first time we met

520
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,480
was at a college dance.

521
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,120
You were the one who invited me.

522
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,040
If not now, when?

523
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,000
Besides,

524
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,200
Ming is emotionally vulnerable right now.

525
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,000
You can't let your enemies take advantage of that.

526
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,800
15 years have passed in the blink of an eye.

527
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,060
It feels so good right now,

528
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,970
like we're back to 15 years ago.

529
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,940
Let's not talk about this.

530
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,880
Didn't you say we would never hate each other?

531
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,760
Why won't you forgive me?

532
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Xiaqing, I have forgiven you.

533
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,480
I've never hated you either.

534
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,720
I know you took Ruirui away

535
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,520
to give her a better life.

536
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,000
I've never hated you.

537
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,040
But the past,

538
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,100
can we just not talk about it anymore?

539
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,280
Let the past be the past.

540
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,880
Do you remember

541
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,360
when we danced for the second time?

542
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,080
It was at our wedding.

543
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,520
That day you happily spun me around,

544
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,760
until I was dizzy.

545
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,460
Just like this.

546
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,130
Do you remember?

547
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,800
Xiaqing.

548
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,920
No matter how many more times we spin,

549
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,370
we can never go back to the past.

550
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,080
Maybe we can.

551
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,560
The dance is over.

552
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,920
And after the dance,

553
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
the man must give the woman a kiss.

554
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,080
Kiss her now!

555
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,240
Come on, kiss!

556
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,570
So boys are supposed to kiss girls, right?

557
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,320
He kissed her!

558
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,800
No, kiss your mom!

559
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,120
Hurry up!

560
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,480
Come on!

561
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,880
Quick!

562
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,240
Hurry up! Kiss her already!

563
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,480
You little rascal!

564
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,280
Huaming, go back.

565
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,680
Dad, did I do something wrong?

566
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,640
You didn't do anything wrong.

567
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,320
I'm happy just seeing you.

568
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,120
Let's go home.

569
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,080
Okay, let's go home.

570
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,610
Let's go.

571
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,720
What happened? You look so disheveled just picking up a painting.

572
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,040
Right now,

573
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,840
I just want to fly to Paris immediately.

574
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,560
Did he agree?

575
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,880
Don't mention him to me.

576
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,920
What did he do to you?

577
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,840
No, don't mention him.

578
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,360
Didn't you tell me

579
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,520
he's the most caring man in the world,

580
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,280
just like Baymax?

581
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,800
If he's Baymax,

582
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
then I'm a complete idiot.

583
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,280
I'm an idiot.

584
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,140
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

585
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,120
This...

586
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,240
Did you two have a fight?

587
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,690
I didn't fight with him.

588
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,490
And I won't fight with him anymore.

589
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,480
I know his ex-wife will always be in his heart.

590
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,840
He'll always believe his daughter unconditionally.

591
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,720
And me? What am I?

592
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,360
To him, I'm nothing.

593
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,960
Absolutely nothing.

594
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,560
Wait, what happened between you two?

595
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,480
Mr. Yang.

596
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,720
Okay.

597
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,240
I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

598
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,160
Alright, no problem.

599
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,160
See you soon.

600
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,800
Okay, see you soon.

601
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,600
Okay.

602
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,360
It's a woman, right?

603
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,800
Xu Chunli.

604
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,940
You can't control who I meet, even if it's a ladyboy.

605
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,560
If you were really meeting a ladyboy, I wouldn't even bother.

606
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,160
This Yang girl...

607
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,440
I remember she used to work

608
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,770
at your company, right?

609
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,800
The one with the big eyes.

610
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
When she first joined your company,

611
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,800
you helped her a lot.

612
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,050
What do you mean?

613
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm just saying

614
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
it's only right for her to help you now

615
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,320
in return.

616
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,440
Do you know we have several car models

617
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,760
All business class.

618
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,920
What brand are they?

619
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,320
Very big brands.

620
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,000
I need to take this call. Take your time eating.

621
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,040
Hello?

622
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,520
Yes, I'm outside.

623
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,720
I'm in a business meeting.

624
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,640
Thank you everyone.

625
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,600
Well, okay, right.

626
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,040
Let me tell you how things stand.

627
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,719
I'm not worried about anything else.

628
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,080
I'm just concerned about

629
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,600
after this whole thing is over,

630
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,760
whether I

631
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
will get promoted or not.

632
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,620
Think about it, I'm not getting any younger, right?

633
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,280
Yes.

634
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,520
Okay.

635
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,050
I'll wait for your call.

636
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,880
Alright.

637
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,540
Excuse me, please.

638
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,800
I...

639
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,440
Listen to me.

640
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,720
I...

641
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,120
Listen to me.

642
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,280
Kaiyang.

643
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,600
Kaiyang, listen to me.

644
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,760
You misunderstood. I was just passing by.

645
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,080
I was in a hurry.

646
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,040
Xu Chunli.

647
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,720
Please stop talking.

648
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,840
Do you know why I came out?

649
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,960
I was asking someone to help me find a job.

650
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,160
You followed me because you suspect me.

651
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,000
I don't suspect you.

652
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,880
I really was just passing by.

653
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,240
I went to the bathroom and didn't see it.

654
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,440
Men's room.

655
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,000
You don't know these three words?

656
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,520
Even if you only graduated from middle school,

657
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,120
you should recognize these three words.

658
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,800
I didn't see it.

659
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,880
You're saying this,

660
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,320
but how could it be such a coincidence? Really.

661
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,200
Divorce.

662
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,280
I've made up my mind. We must divorce.

663
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,720
Please don't say that.

664
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,960
Don't say that.

665
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,640
Kaiyang.

666
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,640
Kaiyang.

667
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Ruirui.

668
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,760
Stop playing. Come have some water.

669
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,700
Who are you chatting with?

670
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,640
That's my personal privacy.

671
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,960
What privacy could a little kid like you have?

672
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,800
Let me see it.

673
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,080
No. You have no right to look.

674
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,560
You're not even an adult yet.

675
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,490
Why don't I have the right to see it?

676
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,520
Give the child some privacy.

677
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,880
Thank you, Dad. You're the best.

678
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,160
Xiaqing.

679
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,380
I need to talk to you about something.

680
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,980
What do you want to tell me?

681
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,020
How long are you planning to stay?

682
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,400
You're bothering us.

683
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,840
Do you think it's fun to keep stirring things up like this?

684
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,040
I didn't plan for things to be like this before I came back.

685
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,400
Ruirui is young and doesn't know better.

686
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400
I can understand whatever she does.

687
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,760
Really, three years ago I respected your decision.

688
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,620
I hope you can respect my life now.

689
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,720
Huaming.

690
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,680
Are you blaming me now because of your girlfriend Wan Xinxin?

691
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,440
Is that right?

692
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,400
No.

693
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,400
I know this isn't nice to say.

694
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
But I want to tell you.

695
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
I want to tell you now.

696
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,450
We can't get back together.

697
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,000
I know.

698
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,200
Then why are you acting like this?

699
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,480
Who benefits from what you're doing?

700
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,000
What are you doing here?

701
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,050
I'm actually doing this for your own good.

702
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,040
I wanted to test.

703
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,240
How Wan Xinxin really feels about you.

704
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,000
Including her attitude toward Ruirui.

705
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,420
She's only a few years older than Ruirui.

706
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,480
At most she's like an older sister.

707
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,320
I'm afraid she might mistreat Ruirui in the future.

708
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,850
You're overthinking this.

709
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,320
We've raised Ruirui well, you should feel at ease.

710
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,860
They're on equal footing.

711
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,800
Huaming.

712
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,000
Do you really love her?

713
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,560
Yes, I really love her.

714
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,460
Huaming, you've really changed.

715
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,650
All these years I've known you.

716
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,560
You've never dared to easily admit your feelings.

717
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,880
This is the first time I've heard.

718
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,280
You say you love someone.

719
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,560
To be honest, I'm quite jealous of her.

720
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,840
Xiaqing.

721
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,840
I know that.

722
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,560
These past three years you've been raising Ruirui.

723
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,240
Living abroad all by yourself.

724
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,760
I can close my eyes and imagine.

725
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,920
How difficult it must have been for you both.

726
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,280
I know it was extremely difficult.

727
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,920
Very hard.

728
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
But I...

729
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:44,920
Can I...

730
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,520
From now on, in my own way.

731
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,880
In a way that you can accept.

732
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,400
Make it up to both you and our daughter.

733
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,600
I will definitely...

734
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,080
No, you don't understand.

735
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,600
Huaming, you have no idea.

736
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,680
A woman alone with a child.

737
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,680
Staying in a completely unfamiliar place.

738
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,340
How difficult that really is.

739
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,160
Do you know? Every morning when Ruirui wakes up.

740
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,610
She asks when daddy is coming to see us.

741
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,720
I don't know how to answer her.

742
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,420
It's been three years.

743
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,720
I've been trying to meet other people.

744
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,080
I hoped to give Ruirui a complete family.

745
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,440
But it's impossible, Ruirui can't accept anyone else.

746
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,600
For three years, she couldn't accept it. In her heart, there's only you.

747
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,330
That's why I chose to come back.

748
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,940
I hoped we could try again.

749
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,080
But as soon as I got off the plane, I knew.

750
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,940
I knew you had changed.

751
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,410
You're not the Huaming I used to know anymore.

752
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,000
Xiaqing.

753
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,280
I'm sorry.

754
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,880
It's all in the past.

755
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,960
We can't go back.

756
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,280
Think about it.

757
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,080
How are you planning to explain this to Ruirui?

758
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,520
I...

759
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,560
Is there a beautiful lady who ordered takeout?

760
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,160
Is there a beautiful lady who ordered takeout?

761
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,680
Nobody ordered takeout.

762
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,380
Hello, beautiful.

763
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,810
Huaming's Delivery is at your service 24 hours a day.

764
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,320
24-hour delivery at your sincere service.

765
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,340
Hello, beautiful.

766
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,520
Huaming's Delivery, 24 hours

767
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,040
at your service, on my knees.

768
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,720
Nobody ordered any takeout.

769
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,320
Come here, son. Give me a kiss.

770
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,440
Kiss mommy again.

771
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,160
I didn't know delivery guys offered this service.

772
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,760
This is part of the delivery.

773
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,440
Our delivery company also says

774
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,360
we're not allowed to leave

775
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,800
until we see the customer finish eating.

776
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,360
Come on.

777
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,040
Look, it's all your favorites.

778
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,600
Come on, take a bite.

779
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,200
I don't want it.

780
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,920
I don't want it.

781
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,440
Right? We're not eating.

782
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,400
Don't be angry.

783
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,760
Give me a break.

784
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,600
You all just bully me.

785
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,330
Your entire family bullies me.

786
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,720
How is my entire family bullying you?

787
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,880
Of course they are.

788
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,320
Ruirui is just a little girl.

789
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,280
She just wants her dad to pay more attention to her.

790
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,080
Then what am I to you?

791
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,320
The most important person in my life.

792
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,440
What about your daughter?

793
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,500
The most important person in my life.

794
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,240
Are you a parrot?

795
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,280
How can you have so many 'most important people'?

796
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,010
They're both flesh of my flesh.

797
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Just go back and be with them.

798
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,360
Don't be angry.

799
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,760
I just...

800
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,680
You're really pushing it.

801
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,280
What's wrong with me getting worked up?

802
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,760
You definitely won't go back.

803
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,080
No, you definitely won't go back.

804
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,920
I won't go back.

805
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,680
You're certain.

806
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,810
I'm absolutely, completely certain.

807
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,380
I'm sure you'll regret it.

808
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,820
Regret is for dogs.

809
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,440
Do you know why you'll regret it?

810
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,640
Miss Wan Xinxin, you're giving up

811
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,120
the precious opportunity to have time alone with me.

812
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,880
Understand?

813
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,570
They've already moved out.

814
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
Wait, why did you make them move out?

815
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,450
I didn't make them move out.

816
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,040
They thought they were giving us space.

817
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
They're all good people.

818
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,770
Don't think so badly of others.

819
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,720
Why should I go back?

820
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,520
Aren't I just your tenant?

821
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,010
Wang Yaping.

822
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,140
Li Wengang.

823
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:50,520
Qiaohua.
