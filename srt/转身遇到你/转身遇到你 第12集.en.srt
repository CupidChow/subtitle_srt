1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,440
Mom.

3
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Liu Wei and I had a relationship for six or seven years.

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,820
Your son is a sentimental person.

5
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,479
When Liu Wei appeared in front of me,

6
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,009
I was completely confused.

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
Mom, don't be angry.

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,520
Don't get upset.

9
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,039
Your health is the most important thing.

10
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,039
I'll definitely do as you say.

11
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,240
I was wrong about this.

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,920
I want to be with you until you're

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,160
80, 90, 100 years old.

14
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,840
May you live a long life.

15
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,300
I'll definitely win Xinxin back.

16
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,600
And then give you two chubby grandsons.

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,000
These grandsons will have sons, and those sons will have grandsons.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,660
Generation after generation, a house full of descendants, okay?

19
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,440
Silly boy.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,980
You just know how to make me happy.

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,480
Fine, I believe everything you said before.

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,040
But these two conditions I want to change,

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,240
you must fulfill them too, understand?

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,120
Okay, I promise you, Mom.

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,200
I'll talk to Liu Wei and make things clear tonight.

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,280
Good.

27
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,170
Why are you here so late?

28
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,040
Didn't your mother just come back?

29
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,370
You should be keeping her company at home.

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Let's break up.

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
Why?

32
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,329
Weren't we fine yesterday?

33
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,400
I was confused before.

34
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,320
I was bewitched

35
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,540
and that's why I divorced Wan Xinxin.

36
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,400
I used to have a perfect family

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,640
and an adorable child.

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
But now I've lost everything.

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,810
I don't think this is right.

40
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,960
The two of us

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,640
shouldn't be together anymore.

42
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,920
Don't call me anymore

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,980
or come looking for me.

44
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,360
I want to win Wan Xinxin back.

45
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,560
Let's go.

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
If we stay together,

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,920
it will hurt Wan Xinxin.

48
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,720
Alright, the call's over.

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,740
You really have the nerve to say that.

50
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,210
You really put on a good show for me.

51
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,160
I believe I'll soon

52
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,560
get custody of the child.

53
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,620
When that happens,

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,280
my mother can hand over the family business

55
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
to me completely.

56
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,770
I'll make Wan Xinxin leave with the child right away.

57
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,770
I'll just give her some extra money

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
as compensation.

59
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,320
You know

60
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,640
you're the most important person to me.

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,300
And your family's assets too, right?

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,960
You wouldn't want to be with a penniless man,

63
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,040
would you?

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,690
Actually, I really don't care.

65
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,400
When I left you for America before,

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,460
it was the biggest mistake of my life.

67
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,159
I only realized after I got to America

68
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,800
that I really can't live without you.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Now I'm back.

70
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,440
As long as you're by my side,

71
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,700
nothing else matters.

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,920
Okay, I understand.

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,920
Alright, I need to get back quickly

74
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,240
or my mother will get suspicious.

75
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,760
Okay, okay, I know.

76
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,400
Just hang in there a little longer. It will be over soon.

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,530
It will be over soon.

78
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,330
I'm leaving.

79
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,160
Alright, I'm going now.

80
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,040
Hello.

81
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,000
Whose flowers are these?

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
They're yours, of course.

83
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,170
Who else has such charm but you?

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,920
No, the way you all talk.

85
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,180
You're all acting like desperate girls.

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,120
We just don't accept yellow roses.

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
If any, we'd prefer red roses.

88
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,200
Yellow roses mean apology.

89
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,760
Apology?

90
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
Look, there's a card.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Quick, see who sent them.

92
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,960
So willful.

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,120
This isn't cheap.

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,210
Any sin would be forgiven for this.

95
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,800
If you like it,

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,240
I'll give you the trash can with the flowers

97
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
all together.

98
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,000
You...

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go ahead, take it.

100
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,880
Wan Xinxin.

101
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,840
Come here.

102
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,680
Okay.

103
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Where's the proposal I asked you to prepare?

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,130
Well, Mr. Shi...

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,200
I've had a lot of family issues lately.

106
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
My mother-in-law...

107
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,620
I don't want excuses. I want results.

108
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,560
The result is...

109
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,940
I haven't finished it yet.

110
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,840
Then don't bother doing it anymore.

111
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,560
No, Mr. Shi.

112
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,760
It's my fault for not finishing it.

113
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,360
I shouldn't have let those family matters...

114
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,320
affect my work.

115
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,600
But could you please try to see things from my perspective?

116
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
As a single mother...

117
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,560
taking care of my child every day...

118
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,560
And Qin Gang's mother keeps bothering us all the time.

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,560
Look, I'll just be bold enough to say...

120
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,400
If we weren't boss and employee...

121
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,760
but just regular friends...

122
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,680
you would definitely understand my situation, right?

123
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,940
Could you please give me another chance?

124
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,210
I told you, you don't need to do it anymore.

125
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,120
But...

126
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,170
haven't I been trying my best to make up for it?

127
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,200
If you won't do it for me...

128
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,920
could you at least do it for Xu Ke's sake?

129
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,250
Shut up. Stick to work and don't bring up irrelevant things.

130
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,960
I'm giving you a new case.

131
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,170
A promotional project for a car brand.

132
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,560
Go talk to their CEO.

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,760
Here's the meeting address.

134
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,680
Hurry up and go. They're already there.

135
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Wait, wait. Could you brief me first...

136
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,080
about what this is all about?

137
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
They'll brief you themselves.

138
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,940
Just go meet them first and we'll talk later.

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,720
Wan Xinxin.

140
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,120
I...

141
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,000
This is your last chance.

142
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,530
If there's any problem again, no one can help you.

143
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,560
Okay, I'll go right away.

144
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,520
Like a gentle breeze passing through my heart,

145
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,080
melting away past attachments.

146
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,040
A maple leaf falls,

147
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,160
scattering my vision and taking away my longing.

148
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,560
If fate is meeting a stranger

149
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,200
with a familiar feeling in just an instant.

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,800
The heart flutters, pauses in this moment as we fall in love.

151
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,160
I want to stay like this,

152
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,840
nestled close beside you,

153
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,440
forgetting about time.

154
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,360
If love could have no expiration date,

155
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,120
only after turning around do I discover my

156
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,360
and your happiness line,

157
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
right here beside me.

158
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,200
I want to stay like this, accompanying you in your world forever,

159
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
forgetting about place.

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,600
No matter what day, you're there, I'm there.

161
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,960
In my heart.

162
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,400
Hello.

163
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,720
Is there a reservation under Miss Shi?

164
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,840
Hello, over there.

165
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,680
Like a gentle breeze passing through my heart,

166
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,960
melting away past attachments.

167
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,920
A maple leaf falls,

168
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,040
scattering my vision and taking away my longing.

169
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,440
If fate is meeting a stranger with a familiar feeling.

170
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,890
Why are you here?

171
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,600
Xinxin, do you remember this place?

172
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,160
Where we had our first date.

173
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
It was raining that day.

174
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,160
We were watching those people

175
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,690
running around in the rain.

176
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,330
Listen to this song.

177
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,840
This should be considered our

178
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,040
song that sealed our relationship.

179
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,120
I went to great lengths

180
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,180
to have them find it and play it for us.

181
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm so stupid.

182
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,360
When Shi Lu told me it was an automotive project,

183
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,020
I should have known it was you.

184
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,480
What's the point of saying all this now?

185
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,640
Mr. Qin, let's talk about work.

186
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm not very familiar with this project yet.

187
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,220
Please give me a brief introduction.

188
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,300
I'd like to know about these aspects.

189
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,280
Xinxin.

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,840
Can we not talk about work today?

191
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,000
I came here today specifically to discuss work.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,720
Since you're not in the right mindset,

193
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,380
let's schedule another time.

194
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,520
Xinxin.

195
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,960
Don't rush off.

196
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,210
I want to tell you

197
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,200
I'll make a thousand times more effort

198
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,400
to help you forget those unpleasant memories.

199
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,040
We'll be happy again.

200
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,020
You're really shameless.

201
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,380
You think you're a 25-year-old baby?

202
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,880
You think cheating can just be forgotten?

203
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,560
You may forget, but I can't.

204
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,520
No, you misunderstood.

205
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,640
That day at Liu Wei's place,

206
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,300
nothing happened between us.

207
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,960
She had just returned to the country

208
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,220
and just got divorced.

209
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,000
She was feeling down, so I just went to keep her company.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
Your son had just been born,

211
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,880
and you left us both at the maternity center

212
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,340
to comfort another woman.

213
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
Do you think that's appropriate?

214
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
I know I was wrong. I was immature

215
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,880
and thoughtless.

216
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,880
But now I finally understand.

217
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
Since our divorce,

218
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,460
I've realized how much I love you.

219
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,840
Then it must be after marrying me

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,460
that you realized how much you loved Liu Wei.

221
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,480
Sorry, I'm not second-choice grass.

222
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,200
Hello?

223
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,960
Huaming, it's me.

224
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,200
Who?

225
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,600
Wan Xinxin's cousin.

226
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Hello. What's up?

227
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,680
I have something very important

228
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,880
I need your help with.

229
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
If you do this well,

230
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,400
you'll not only be completely free,

231
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,560
you won't have to look after the child,

232
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,400
but you'll also earn major points with Xinxin.

233
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, cousin,

234
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm not interested. That's it.

235
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,760
Don't hang up!

236
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,780
I haven't even told you what it is.

237
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,820
How can you not be interested?

238
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,080
Well, go ahead then.

239
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,010
Let me be straightforward.

240
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,900
I want you to keep an eye on Jiang Kaiyang.

241
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,560
No way.

242
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
Why not?

243
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,880
First of all,

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
this is your family's private matter.

245
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,520
And I'm not a private detective.

246
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,680
I won't do this.

247
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,000
If I could find a private detective,

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,130
why would I need you?

249
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,130
If you help me with this,

250
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I'll help you look after your child in the future.

251
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,600
No need.

252
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,200
Actually, with the child,

253
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,120
I'm quite good at childcare.

254
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,840
It's nice taking care of them myself.

255
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,160
What's wrong with you?

256
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,040
Why are you so stubborn?

257
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,160
After all, I am Xinxin's cousin.

258
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,080
If you want to pursue Xinxin,

259
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,410
you'll need to stay on my good side, right?

260
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,880
Well, I'm not worried.

261
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,320
Fine! You...

262
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,680
You're tough.

263
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,600
Alright then. I'll have Xinxin talk to you herself.

264
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,760
OK, goodbye then.

265
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,170
What was all that about?

266
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,650
What kind of person is this?

267
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,780
It's driving me crazy.

268
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,340
This...

269
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
Hey, sis.

270
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,360
Xinxin, what kind of person is Huaming?

271
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,480
I just asked him for a tiny favor.

272
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,000
He keeps saying no to everything.

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,280
He's driving me insane.

274
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,340
Why should he have to help you anyway?

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,640
I'm helping you watch your child.

276
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
I don't have time to keep an eye on your brother-in-law.

277
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,010
You can't let your sister be bullied, can you?

278
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,180
Besides, the way he is,

279
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,040
he wants to pursue you? No way!

280
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,040
I won't allow you two to be together.

281
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,840
Why would we have to be together?

282
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,420
What's going on today?

283
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,580
Why is everyone bothering me?

284
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,140
I'm done talking. I'm hanging up.

285
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,760
Xin?

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,200
She hung up on me!

287
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
Who's bothering you?

288
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,180
Xinxin is back.

289
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,920
Life is really so hard.

290
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,280
There's one more dish for dinner.

291
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,120
The baby is asleep.

292
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,500
Take a rest.

293
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,320
Xinxin, get the door.

294
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,400
Coming.

295
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,210
Huaming.

296
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,140
Please come in.

297
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,820
I see you're about to have dinner.

298
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,280
I've come at a bad time.

299
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,200
Auntie, please join us.

300
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,880
Have something to eat if you don't mind.

301
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,720
No.

302
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,160
Xinxin just got back.

303
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,480
Good. I need to talk to her about something.

304
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,080
Okay.

305
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,650
Alright.

306
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,760
Xinxin.

307
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,780
Auntie, no.

308
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,680
Here.

309
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,120
No, what are you doing?

310
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,320
This is for you. And this is for the baby.

311
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,600
No, Auntie, you don't need to.

312
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,360
We have everything we need.

313
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,120
Please take it back, Auntie, really.

314
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,800
No, sit down.

315
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,440
Sit.

316
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,240
Xinxin, I came today to tell you about

317
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,330
something very important.

318
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,240
I was too hasty before.

319
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,290
I've wronged you terribly.

320
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,640
I blamed you unfairly.

321
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,360
You know the truth now.

322
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm just too impatient by nature.

323
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,920
Of course, I meant well.

324
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,220
I've talked with Qin Gang.

325
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,880
He knows he was wrong.

326
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,120
Could you give Qin Gang another chance?

327
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,960
No, Mrs. Qin.

328
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,880
You came today

329
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,610
just to talk about this, right?

330
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,800
I saw Qin Gang today.

331
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,720
I've told him everything that needed to be said.

332
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,180
He'll tell you everything when you get home.

333
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,800
Xinxin, I've been through a lot.

334
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,480
I've definitely experienced much more than you have.

335
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,220
Won't you just think about it?

336
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,920
You and Qin Gang being together

337
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,480
is a fate that took years to build.

338
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,880
If you and Xiao Gang could reconcile,

339
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
you would love each other even more.

340
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,880
Please give Qin Gang another chance.

341
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,320
I believe he will love you even more.

342
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,930
We really can't get back together.

343
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,800
He and I

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,280
are impossible, really.

345
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,940
Don't be so absolute about it.

346
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,680
Look, you're raising a child all by yourself now.

347
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,760
This child will gradually grow up.

348
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,420
Will you need to find someone else in the future?

349
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,200
Have you thought about it?

350
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,060
Men nowadays are very practical.

351
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Who would want to be with

352
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,800
a single mother with a child?

353
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,760
Then you'll inevitably remain single.

354
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,400
Rather than staying single,

355
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,320
you might as well give Qin Gang another chance.

356
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,720
Mrs. Qin, you think I can't find anyone else, right?

357
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,850
No, no, I absolutely didn't mean that.

358
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Actually, I...

359
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,840
Let me be honest with you.

360
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,700
I have a boyfriend now.

361
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,240
Who is it?

362
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,840
Lao Hua.

363
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,680
Lao Hua.

364
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,960
Shh.

365
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,700
I just put the little one to sleep.

366
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,520
Come here, come here.

367
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,160
Come over here first.

368
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Okay, coming.

369
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,450
Excuse me, Mrs. Qin.

370
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,680
Let me get you some water.

371
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,080
No need, don't be so polite.

372
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,640
Mrs. Qin.

373
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,420
He is my boyfriend.

374
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,330
That's impossible.

375
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,240
Didn't you two tell me

376
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,890
that you couldn't possibly have that kind of relationship?

377
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,400
Yes, that was before.

378
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,600
Wan Xinxin.

379
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,000
Be honest.

380
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,400
Mrs. Qin, this...

381
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,440
It's my fault. I never said anything.

382
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,570
No, it's your fault.

383
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,080
You said we should be honest with our elders sooner.

384
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,200
After being honest with our elders,

385
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,160
everyone will feel better.

386
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,020
How long should we keep it secret?

387
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
You're blaming me for not being honest earlier?

388
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,240
It's my fault.

389
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,060
Mrs. Qin, this is all my fault.

390
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,400
You know...

391
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,240
No matter what, Wan Xinxin

392
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,280
is still your former daughter-in-law.

393
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,680
That's why I couldn't bring myself to say it.

394
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,010
Of course, I feel we can't hide it anymore.

395
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,000
I love Xinxin.

396
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,920
We are together now.

397
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,800
I will take good care of Xinxin from now on.

398
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,600
And take care of her brother too.

399
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,120
Thank you for all

400
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,100
your care and concern for Xinxin.

401
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,200
Actually, before I came here,

402
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,280
I had anticipated this outcome.

403
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,000
Xinxin, you should understand what I want to say.

404
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,120
I still hope you will

405
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,640
carefully reconsider this.

406
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,410
I'm leaving.

407
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,680
Auntie, let me walk you out.

408
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,020
Take care, Auntie.

409
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
Goodbye, Auntie.

410
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,160
Is the show finally over?

411
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,480
What's wrong?

412
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
You feel shortchanged pretending to be my boyfriend?

413
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,700
You old fossil.

414
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,720
No, it's just that I'm putting on this act for you.

415
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,250
What's with your attitude?

416
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,640
I don't mind acting. I can play any role.

417
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,040
But how long do I have to keep doing this?

418
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,800
Don't ask me. I really don't know.

419
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,040
I'm annoyed too.

420
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,120
Look, if they keep bothering me for a day,

421
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,440
then you'll act for a day.

422
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,240
If they bother me for a year, you'll act for a year.

423
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
And if they bother me for a lifetime,

424
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
then you'll be my boyfriend for a lifetime.

425
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,320
Why should I?

426
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,210
Did I owe you something in my past life?

427
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,560
Well, when your precious brother sleeps, make sure he lies on his side.

428
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Turn around. Your face looks small.

429
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,820
If you're hungry, I can heat up some food for you.

430
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,850
Morning.

431
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,720
Morning, Xinxin.

432
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,250
Morning.

433
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,780
I'm hungry.

434
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,770
Let's go eat.

435
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,560
Okay.

436
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,760
Hello, are you Miss Wan?

437
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,080
Yes, and you are?

438
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,880
Hello, I didn't order anything.

439
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Someone ordered for you.

440
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,690
A nutritious lunch.

441
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,400
Enjoy your meal.

442
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,960
Nutritious lunch.

443
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,720
Who needs a nutritious lunch? Anyone who hasn't eaten?

444
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,580
I'll have some.

445
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,640
There's more here. Anyone else want some?

446
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
If it's that good, I won't hold back.

447
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,880
Please, don't be polite.

448
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,320
Thanks.

449
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,960
There's rice too.

450
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,800
Thank you.

451
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,540
Come in.

452
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,140
Director Shi, what instructions do you have for me?

453
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,000
Did you close the deal on the auto show project?

454
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,520
Didn't Qin Gang tell you?

455
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,440
You clearly know about the relationship between us.

456
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,170
Why are you putting on this act?

457
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,160
I don't care what relationship you two have.

458
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,490
What I want are results.

459
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,290
I hope you can separate business from personal matters.

460
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,320
I think you're the one who hasn't made that distinction.

461
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,400
How could it be business when Qin Gang contacts me?

462
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,920
Yet you still ask me to negotiate projects with him.

463
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,560
It's like two people having a meal together.

464
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,220
One wants something upscale.

465
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,480
Wine with steak.

466
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,520
And the other person?

467
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
Just wants street food spicy hot pot.

468
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,570
The two can never eat at the same table.

469
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,560
If there's nothing else, I'll be going now.

470
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,410
I don't care how you negotiate.

471
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,000
You must take this deal.

472
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,000
Wan Xinxin, you know the company's situation

473
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,560
better than anyone else.

474
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,800
Every project is crucial to the company.

475
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,360
Don't you have

476
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,660
any feelings for this company at all?

477
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,440
Fine, I'll compromise.

478
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,600
I promise I'll convince Qin Gang's company

479
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,640
to cooperate with us.

480
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,120
But my condition is

481
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,120
you find someone else to work with them,

482
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,640
and I'll no longer be responsible for this project.

483
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,770
If he doesn't agree,

484
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,780
then there's nothing I can do.

485
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,840
Hello? What are you doing?

486
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,610
I'm downstairs. Hiding from your sister.

487
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,800
Come with me for a bit.

488
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:40,920
Wait.

489
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,200
Where did the boss go during work hours?

490
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,000
How do you think they manage

491
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,780
to sell all these cars?

492
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,340
Look how he fooled you.

493
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,760
You believed everything.

494
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,960
I think he really has the brains

495
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,020
to sell those cars.

496
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,800
Whose side are you on?

497
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,280
Yours.

498
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,520
Speak up for me.

499
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,970
But you really need to back me up later.

500
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,840
You didn't see

501
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,760
Shi Lu's demonic face today.

502
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,040
Wan Xinxin, don't mix personal and professional matters.

503
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,000
I need results.

504
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,040
Just thinking about her face now

505
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,440
makes my hair stand on end.

506
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,320
Look.

507
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
It's terrifying.

508
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,170
If I mess up again this time,

509
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm really finished.

510
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,520
Xinxin, game over isn't scary.

511
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,280
When a game ends, you can start over.

512
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,160
As long as you can beat the level when you try again,

513
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,480
that's when you're truly the best.

514
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,240
But I'm just a rookie with only one life.

515
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,100
Why else would I ask you, old-timer, to save the day?

516
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,680
Right, you could ask your brother-in-law Lao Jiang.

517
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,040
Ask him?

518
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,920
Ask him where Qin Gang is?

519
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,400
If he could tell me that, it would be a miracle.

520
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,000
By the way.

521
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,280
Your sister really wanted me to work here

522
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,850
so I could be her undercover agent.

523
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,280
You actually believe my sister?

524
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,800
Undercover? What is this, Infernal Affairs?

525
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,730
I'm not waiting anymore. Let's go.

526
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,800
Sit down.

527
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,280
I've been sitting here for ages.

528
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,960
You always call me old-timer, right?

529
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,160
You say I'm an old-timer,

530
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,090
so what's the difference between me and you rookies?

531
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,690
You're old. More wrinkles.

532
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,880
Hmm, what else?

533
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,080
That's it. You're old with lots of wrinkles.

534
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,530
And I'm more seasoned than you.

535
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,480
I've eaten more salt than you've eaten rice.

536
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,940
So you should listen to me.

537
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,080
Just tell me one thing.

538
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,560
What's the most important reason you came here?

539
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Isn't it to close the deal? Isn't it?

540
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,280
Of course. If I didn't come here to close the deal,

541
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,480
why would I waste my time here?

542
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,940
I have a lot to do every day.

543
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,930
As the old saying goes, make the best of where you are.

544
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,960
Old sayings, old sayings. Why so many old sayings?

545
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,680
Here's another old saying.

546
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,760
Since you're here, have a double coffee.

547
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,160
Wait, I'll get it for you.

548
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,680
Mr. Shi.

549
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,720
I heard Wan Xinxin came looking for me, is that right?

550
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,360
If she came to reject me,

551
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,680
then I hope you understand

552
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,210
our cooperation ends here.

553
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,680
Mr. Qin, I don't want to lie to you.

554
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,770
Wan Xinxin doesn't want to see you.

555
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,800
She went there to ask you

556
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,090
to assign the project to someone else.

557
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,200
Mr. Qin.

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,800
You could actually try a different approach.

559
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,320
Let me emphasize again

560
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,880
the purpose of our cooperation.

561
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,160
Whatever promotion fee you need,

562
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,600
just name your price.

563
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,840
But I have only one condition:

564
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,240
Wan Xinxin must come back to take this case.

565
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,650
I've talked to her several times already.

566
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,560
But she's very firm about it.

567
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,080
Since you know her temperament so well,

568
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,560
fine, go find her relatives and friends

569
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
to persuade her, work on her

570
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,920
and get her back.

571
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,320
If she doesn't come back,

572
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,180
fine, our cooperation ends here.

573
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,290
I'll be waiting for your good news.

574
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,160
Be patient.

575
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,000
To win her back

576
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,850
will certainly take some time.

577
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,360
They say a reformed rake is priceless,

578
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,080
I've already changed so much,

579
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
yet she's still playing hard to get.

580
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,640
I mean, why doesn't she understand

581
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,920
that not every Cinderella

582
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,250
gets to have her prince?

583
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,280
If you were a prince,

584
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,730
then what would I be?

585
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,220
You would be the crown.

586
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,120
I need you, this crown, to be crowned king.

587
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,880
So I have to carefully

588
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,680
wear you on my head every day.

589
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,480
Am I really that important?

590
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,740
Yes, of course you are.

591
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,040
I've waited for you for so many years.

592
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,840
You've finally come back.

593
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,370
I can't let you go so easily.

594
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,760
But I'm afraid I can't compete with that Cinderella.

595
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,560
What if you end up falling for her for real?

596
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,690
What would I do then?

597
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,170
That's impossible.

598
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,960
If my mother wasn't so eager for grandchildren,

599
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Wan Xinxin would mean nothing to me.

600
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,000
We can have our own children too.

601
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,840
It's not like that.

602
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,520
My mother thinks I'm abandoning my child.

603
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,120
She can't accept that.

604
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,610
But don't worry.

605
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,200
Right now I'm working on

606
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,600
keeping my mother happy.

607
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Once I take over

608
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,920
all the family business,

609
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,920
I'll let my mother enjoy her retirement,

610
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,400
give Wan Xinxin some money,

611
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,200
and by then,

612
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,370
no one will disturb our life together.

613
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,800
Really?

614
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,360
Will you keep your word?

615
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,680
I'll keep my word.

616
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,920
Whatever you want, I'll make it happen.

617
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,400
Buddy, pay me back.

618
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,360
Phone.

619
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,660
It's my girlfriend's.

620
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,610
It really is my girlfriend.

621
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,560
Look, I can't.

622
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,920
I can't pay you back.

623
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,090
You have the nerve to date someone?

624
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,680
No, come on.

625
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,040
What does that have to do with anything?

626
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,720
Cut the crap.

627
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,400
I want to see the money today. Pay up.

628
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Listen, man.

629
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,440
I really don't have any money right now.

630
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,400
Can you give me a couple more days?

631
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,810
Is this how you brush me off?

632
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,960
How am I supposed to report back?

633
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,040
Wait.

634
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Let me tell you what, how about this.

635
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,120
I'll take two of your fingers.

636
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
I have it!

637
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,160
I know you have fingers.

638
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,520
No, I mean I have the money.

639
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,000
You have money? Where is it?

640
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,200
In the back room.

641
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,440
Go get it now.

642
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,860
I'll get it right away.

643
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,680
Come out right now!

644
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,160
Come out! Hurry up!

645
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,520
Hello.

646
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,760
The number you have dialed is busy.

647
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,440
Please try again later.

648
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,000
Sorry.

649
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,920
The number you have dialed is busy.

650
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,250
Please try again later.

651
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,240
I can't drink any more even if it's free.

652
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
I've already had three bottles.

653
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,680
Drink more water to reduce the heat.

654
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,720
Let's go.

655
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,800
Hello?

656
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,440
Your Highness, I've been beaten up.

657
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,720
Please come quickly and help me.

658
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,180
Okay, I'll be right there.

659
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,520
Xu Ke is in trouble. Let's hurry.

660
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,400
Come out.

661
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,690
Who is it?

662
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Just keep hiding.

663
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,160
Who are you? Who are you looking for?

664
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,040
Who are you?

665
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,000
Who are you looking for?

666
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,480
What are you doing at my buddy's place?

667
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
Xu Ke! Xu Ke!

668
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,199
Who? Who?

669
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,239
Xu Ke.

670
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:12,940
I'm coming!

671
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,210
Who the hell are you?

672
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,679
Let go! Let go of me!

673
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,480
I won't.

674
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,199
Let go!

675
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:19,960
Are you okay?

676
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,800
I'm fine.

677
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,420
Let go or I'll kill you!

678
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,610
I don't believe you.

679
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,370
Sit down over there.

680
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,489
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

681
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,050
How much does he owe you?

682
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,600
See for yourself.

683
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,920
It's in black and white, clearly written.

684
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,480
400,000.

685
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,920
That much?

686
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,210
You did this?

687
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,760
You really go all out when chasing girls.

688
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,400
Spending 400,000 on a necklace.

689
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,080
You think you're some rich kid?

690
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,240
Hey, we've known each other for so long.

691
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,720
You never treated me like this.

692
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,280
As they say, when it comes to...

693
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,640
True love can move mountains.

694
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,300
Did it work?

695
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,850
Well, I read online that...

696
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,540
If you want to touch her heart,

697
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,040
you need to spend money to move her.

698
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,360
So I wanted to impress her.

699
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,420
Was she impressed?

700
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,000
You spent the money and risked everything. Did she end up with you?

701
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,640
No.

702
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,600
Men in love are truly idiots.

703
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,440
Xinxin, Xuke.

704
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,680
You two go inside first. I'll handle this.

705
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,540
Can you manage?

706
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,320
Be careful, brother.

707
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,560
Sit properly.

708
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,420
Listen, buddy.

709
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
A debt must be paid. It's only right.

710
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,760
Fine, the money I owe you tomorrow,

711
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,120
really, I promise I'll pay you back.

712
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,120
But if you collect these payments recklessly, I won't pay you back.

713
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,960
That won't do.

714
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,240
If I don't see the money, I...

715
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm not leaving.

716
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,180
Pay me back.

717
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,080
I'm trying to reason with you. Please leave first.

718
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,010
I'm not leaving.

719
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,360
I need to see the money.

720
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,280
I'm calling the police.

721
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,600
Even if you call the police, I'm not leaving.

722
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,860
Are you leaving or not?

723
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,060
What are you doing?

724
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,040
Are you paying or not?

725
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,720
Go ahead and try. Just try it.

726
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,260
Come on.

727
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,900
If you don't pay me, I won't leave.

728
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,240
Brother.

729
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,720
If you're going to cut your throat,

730
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,080
I can call an ambulance right now,

731
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,280
but they won't make it in time to save you.

732
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,940
You'll bleed out completely.

733
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,080
I...

734
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,120
That's your liver. Stab there and you'll die.

735
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,280
How do I know that's my liver?

736
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,200
I'm a surgeon.

737
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,400
I've dissected many bodies with your build.

738
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,880
This is

739
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,100
your gallbladder.

740
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,160
Here.

741
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,400
The pancreas.

742
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,040
Here.

743
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,010
So I'll stab here, okay?

744
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,360
No, why are you so stubborn?

745
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,560
Wherever you stab, you'll get stabbed too.

746
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,400
Doesn't that hurt?

747
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,800
I already said I'll give you the money back.

748
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,610
You should've sent more people after me then.

749
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,770
I'm just one person.

750
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,740
Come on.

751
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,400
Can you stop being so stubborn?

752
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,560
Get up first. Come on.

753
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,800
Come on, get up.

754
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,720
Get up quickly.

755
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,000
It's a deal, really.

756
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,000
Don't sit down.

757
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,120
I'll give you the money back tomorrow.

758
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,200
Alright.

759
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,440
Okay, I know it's not easy.

760
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,240
Let's go.

761
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,770
It's so hard to collect debts these days. Thanks.

762
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,400
Xu Ke.

763
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,360
You got rid of him.

764
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,260
Where's the necklace?

765
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,080
I have it. She didn't want it.

766
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,980
Listen carefully.

767
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,920
Return it where it came from.

768
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,580
Find a place to sell it.

769
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,520
You'll surely find someone more foolish than you.

770
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Did you hear that?

771
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,690
Yes, I heard.

772
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,840
The money in this card

773
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,320
should be enough for you to pay back your debt.

774
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,850
I'll text you the PIN later.

775
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,840
Here's the card. Take it.

776
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,960
Take it.

777
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,560
Don't ever do this kind of thing again. Understand?

778
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,720
Thank you so much. I don't know what else to say.

779
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,360
Are you satisfied now?

780
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,600
Hurry up and sell that necklace.

781
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,040
Pay back the money quickly. Did you hear me?

782
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,170
I will, definitely.

783
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,040
Hey, Xinxin.

784
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,920
Let's hurry back.

785
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,520
My sister is waiting for us to take over her shift.

786
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,050
Let's go.

787
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,920
Lock the door.

788
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,820
Take care, my benefactor.

789
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,140
I didn't realize, mister.

790
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,420
You were really impressive just now.

791
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,520
You've got good skills.

792
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,120
What skills?

793
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,080
I just like to practice a little.

794
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,160
You know, as a doctor, you need good stamina.

795
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,760
So I focus on staying fit.

796
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,720
Sometimes we're at the operating table for 10 hours,

797
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,520
12 hours, even 20 hours at times.

798
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,640
You're putting on an act with me.

799
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,880
Drive up there and pull over.

800
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,840
No, really.

801
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,040
You've definitely had training.

802
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,360
I've always wanted to find

803
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,560
a personal trainer to teach me.

804
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,000
You know, grappling, fighting techniques.

805
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,400
For a girl like me,

806
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,480
in case I'm walking down the street one day and encounter

807
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,360
some bad guys, right? Right?

808
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,760
Like if I meet a bad guy, I could just go bam!

809
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,960
Grab them by the neck.

810
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,640
Well, if you encounter bad guys,

811
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,320
yes.

812
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,570
Then you could do something like this.

813
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,480
Xinxin!

814
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,720
Get up!

815
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,170
Hold onto me.

816
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,640
What are you doing? Why should I hold you tight?

817
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,480
Mrs. Qin!

818
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,920
Xinxin!

819
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,040
Auntie.

820
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,440
Xinxin!

821
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,480
What are you doing here?

822
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,010
I was just about to find you.

823
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,200
I made some soup for you.

824
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,760
Come, let's talk in the car.

825
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,000
Sure.

826
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,480
Let's go, old buddy.

827
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,240
Okay.

828
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,760
Let's go.

829
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
I'll catch a ride.

830
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,560
Let me help you get in first.

831
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,480
No need.

832
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,620
I'll open the door for you.

833
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,280
Take it slow, Xinxin.

834
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:55,800
Okay.

835
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,720
Hey, I need to talk to you about something.

836
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,120
Let me help you with that.

837
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,760
Um, later if the old lady

838
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,160
offers me anything to eat,

839
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,960
I won't eat it,

840
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,520
and you'll eat it for me, okay?

841
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,780
We can't let her push us around like this.

842
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,920
It's nice to have someone cooking for us.

843
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,080
Then I don't have to do it.

844
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,210
As long as it's not black chicken soup.

845
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,280
What's wrong with black chicken soup? Did it offend you somehow?

846
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,800
I'm not picky with food,

847
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,880
but there are only two things I won't eat in my life.

848
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,920
One is, what's that thing...

849
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,960
one is durian,

850
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,920
and the other is black chicken soup.

851
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,840
No way!

852
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,120
Those two things are delicious.

853
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,380
They're my favorites.

854
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,450
You've got to be kidding me.

855
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,240
Auntie, you really don't need to go to all this trouble anymore.

856
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,600
Coming here every day must be inconvenient for you.

857
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,860
It's no trouble at all.

858
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,410
Huaming is a man. He wouldn't know how to do these things.

859
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,960
Try some.

860
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,680
This soup is my specialty.

861
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,240
It's fragrant and nutritious.

862
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,240
What kind of soup is this?

863
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,410
Black chicken soup.

864
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,080
Auntie.

865
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,840
Here, try some yourself.

866
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,920
I have soup simmering in the kitchen too.

867
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,360
Please have some fruit first.

868
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,080
Okay, thank you.

869
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,410
Mine will be ready soon.

870
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,720
The soup your aunt made for you.

871
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,160
Yes.

872
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,320
What kind of soup is this?

873
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,010
Black chicken soup.

874
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,450
I never drink it.

875
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,720
Your aunt brought it from far away.

876
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,250
Could you drink some for me?

877
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,640
Xiaogang said you love black chicken soup.

878
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,720
He doesn't understand me at all.

879
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,560
Come on, don't waste it. Hurry.

880
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,120
Mrs. Wan,

881
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,780
black chicken soup is the best for women's blood nourishment.

882
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:45,760
Is it good?

883
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,080
You got it on your clothes.

884
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,740
Look at you, just like a child.

885
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,960
Is it good?

886
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,600
It's good.

887
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,440
Come on, have another sip if it's good.

888
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,240
No more. It was made for you.

889
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,660
Just take one more sip.

890
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,040
Is it good?

891
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,760
It's so delicious!

892
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,500
This is really delicious.

893
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,720
Let me get you some more.

894
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,680
No need, thanks.

895
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,720
Alright, we're done with the black chicken soup.

896
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,120
I have dessert here.

897
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,610
Durian cake.

898
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,200
Durian cake?

899
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,360
Durian cake.

900
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,770
Durian cake.

901
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,600
Auntie, I never eat durian cake.

902
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,920
How could that be?

903
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,920
Xiao Gang told me

904
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,520
that your favorite soup is black chicken soup

905
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,850
and your favorite dessert is durian cake.

906
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
He doesn't know me at all.

907
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,180
I've never eaten either of those things.

908
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,400
Tongchang

909
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li
