1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,720
Wan Xinxin, I'm really sorry.

3
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,680
Why should I?

4
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,639
No, come back.

5
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,320
No, on what grounds?

6
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,760
If everything is destiny.

7
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,800
Time to sleep.

8
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,440
Go to sleep.

9
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,440
You're really willing to spend big money

10
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,079
chasing after your true love.

11
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,940
Have you found your true love yet?

12
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,600
It's not that easy.

13
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,840
This time I'm deeply in love.

14
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,060
So I must search carefully

15
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
and definitely find her.

16
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,090
Your camera is pretty nice.

17
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,360
Don't break it. This lens is the most expensive part.

18
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,420
Who's breaking it?

19
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,770
Let me see how good this lens really is.

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Xu Ke.

21
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,520
There's a handsome guy living across from your place,

22
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
and he's a foreigner too.

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,720
This is a camera.

24
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
What?

25
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,400
You're actually peeping on people?

26
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,880
I'm telling you, if someone catches us,

27
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,280
we'll both end up in jail.

28
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,560
So be it.

29
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,240
I'm not afraid.

30
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,200
I have nothing left anyway.

31
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,640
No job, can't go back home.

32
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,880
At least in jail I'd get food,

33
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,320
and I wouldn't have to worry about someone taking my son.

34
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,040
You've been watching too many Korean dramas.

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,320
Acting like the whole world is trying to steal your son.

36
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,240
What do you know? I saw it with my own eyes.

37
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,520
Qin Gang was holding my baby.

38
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,450
And Hua was holding a stack of cash.

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
If you ask me,

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,800
this Hua Ming isn't like what you described.

41
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,720
I mean, apart from having

42
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,360
a rather expressionless face,

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
I think he's a pretty decent person.

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,460
With how you've been tormenting him,

45
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,000
if he wanted to ruin you,

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,560
he could have done it in a minute.

47
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Besides, from what you just told me,

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,440
I think in this case,

49
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,959
it was your sister who handed

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
the baby to Hua Ming herself.

51
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,740
So there's basically no chance he planned this.

52
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,360
Are you really the child's godfather or not?

53
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,240
I'm just analyzing the situation for you.

54
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't care.

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,960
Nobody can mess with my baby boy.

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,840
Okay, okay.

57
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,640
Fine.

58
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,400
Xu Ke.

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,960
Why don't I just move in here

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,080
and you can move back home?

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,600
I'll help you keep an eye out for your true love.

62
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,460
How about that?

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
Come on, this is about love.

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,320
What are you thinking?

65
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,560
It's not something someone else can do for me.

66
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,760
Besides, do you even know her? Do you know who to watch for?

67
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,720
I don't even want to stay at your place anyway.

68
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,520
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

69
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,600
Easy for you to say.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,040
We're two mouths to feed, one big and one small.

71
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,240
Both of us need to eat.

72
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,480
The most basic needs

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,720
can still be taken care of.

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,760
But what if someday

75
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,240
you actually win over that true love of yours?

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,040
And the girl insists on committing to you?

77
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,480
Then how will you introduce me and my son?

78
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,480
Here's my ex-wife and son?

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,640
Is that appropriate?

80
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,240
Ex-wife?

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't be a burden to you.

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,360
What should we do then?

83
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
What about me?

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,440
Ever since I met

85
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,040
those jinxes Qin Gang and Liu Wei,

86
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,280
my luck has been terrible.

87
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
I've lost everything.

88
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,400
No job, can't go home.

89
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,360
They're pushing me to the edge.

90
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,080
Right?

91
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,280
Wait, your hair.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,480
I got it!

93
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,140
Tell me.

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,420
Actually, you just

95
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,200
messed up a business deal.

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,400
It's not the end of the world, right?

97
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
What do you mean it's not a big deal?

98
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,680
You don't know our female boss.

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,280
That company is her life.

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
I've basically destroyed her life.

101
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,140
She'll strangle me if she sees me.

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,600
So Lady Company collapsed overnight,

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,880
all because of you, Wan Xinxin.

104
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,210
You're something else.

105
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,960
You've really done it this time.

106
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,320
Stop talking.

107
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,720
Fine.

108
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,080
I feel like I'm going crazy.

109
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,800
I really want to make it up to the boss,

110
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
but I don't have the ability.

111
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,520
I'm almost homeless.

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,680
There is a solution.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,660
It can both make up for the loss

114
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,120
and let you return to the company with your head held high.

115
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,280
Really?

116
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,140
Is it reliable?

117
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,440
Absolutely.

118
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,480
Look, we live in a resource integration society.

119
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,520
You just need to find one client,

120
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,210
close the deal and bring them to your boss.

121
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,120
That's it.

122
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,840
That's it? You think clients are just waiting for me?

123
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,970
You think I can just grab one anywhere?

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,880
I've already thought of something for you.

125
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,940
I shot a catalog for a company before.

126
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,480
They mentioned wanting to expand.

127
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,300
They're doing quite well.

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,159
Wait, you?

129
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,440
What kind of good clients could you know?

130
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,320
Are you kidding me?

131
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,400
You think I only know how to date?

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,060
I'm also a man with career ambitions.

133
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,360
Alright, Xu Ke.

134
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,220
How about this?

135
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,240
You invite him over and I'll talk to him.

136
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
No, what are you thinking?

137
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
They're clients.

138
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,800
You think they come whenever you call like I do?

139
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
Go home, take a hot shower,

140
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,280
feed your pet,

141
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,600
get a good night's sleep.

142
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Tomorrow, I promise,

143
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,680
you'll wake up to a brand new start.

144
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,260
I guess that's all I can do.

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,880
I hope dreams come true.

146
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,200
God bless me.

147
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,480
You're back.

148
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,000
Why are you here?

149
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,120
I wanted to surprise you.

150
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,880
I'm staying with you tonight.

151
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,920
Is that okay?

152
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,600
No. You need to move in now.

153
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,810
Isn't that a bit rushed?

154
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,840
Are you that afraid of your mother finding out about me?

155
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,240
No, I just think it's a bit

156
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,320
inappropriate right now.

157
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,180
Then when will it be appropriate?

158
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,360
Weiwei, I know this

159
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,880
is unfair to you.

160
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,800
But you need to understand.

161
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,000
Everything I have comes from my mother.

162
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,920
I don't want to hurt her.

163
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,730
Alright, stop talking.

164
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,640
I know you're in a difficult position.

165
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,840
But you can't keep hiding this forever.

166
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,560
For now, I'll just hide it as long as I can.

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,820
Jiang Kaiyang.

168
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
You need to explain yourself today.

169
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,900
What are you doing? Why are you acting crazy?

170
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,600
Where were you today?

171
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,660
You didn't go to work. Where were you?

172
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,560
Xu Chunli, what are you doing?

173
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
Why did you come to my workplace?

174
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,280
You... this...

175
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,760
What? Am I not allowed to go there?

176
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,440
Are you afraid I'll discover your dirty little secret?

177
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
Let me tell you something.

178
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,200
I saw you today with that vixen.

179
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,120
Fooling around together.

180
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,520
Don't try to deny it today.

181
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,380
Xu Chunli, you've lost your mind.

182
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,960
Let me tell you.

183
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,520
If something really happens to me,

184
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
it will be all your fault.

185
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,360
Got it?

186
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,050
What's going on?

187
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,880
Explain yourself to me!

188
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,210
How dare you grab my bag!

189
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,240
Give it to me!

190
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,300
What are you doing?

191
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,280
You're going through my bag?

192
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,410
How many things are you hiding from me?

193
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,680
What is this?

194
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,160
Why do you have so much money?

195
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,620
Let me tell you, Xu Chunli.

196
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,920
I'll have more and more money in the future.

197
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,140
So you've backed down.

198
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,920
Old jerk.

199
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,000
Wait, what are you doing here?

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
I wrote that note.

201
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
I can read.

202
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,400
You call this an apology?

203
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,720
Isn't it?

204
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,820
How could it be?

205
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,640
It should count.

206
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,240
No.

207
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Doesn't it count?

208
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
Fine.

209
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,120
See?

210
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,480
Whether it counts or not, Miss Wan,

211
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,920
I would like to formally

212
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,410
apologize to you again.

213
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,120
Miss Wan Xinxin,

214
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,400
I was wrong, I'm guilty, it was my fault.

215
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,920
Actually, I wasn't planning to blame you today.

217
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,200
But remember this:

218
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,560
never take Bao to see that Qin guy again.

219
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,800
Wait, Wan Xinxin.

220
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,160
Could you let Qin Gang see Bao?

221
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,640
Say that again.

222
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,360
Don't get angry. Let me finish first.

223
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,400
No matter what happened

224
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,800
between you and Qin Gang,

225
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,200
the child is innocent, right?

226
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,930
You can't deny a child the right to see his father.

227
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,880
I was finally starting

228
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,520
to have some good feelings toward you,

229
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,920
and now they're all gone.

230
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,520
Don't worry about my business.

231
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,280
How about I write another one?

232
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,440
This definitely counts.

233
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,520
Do you understand?

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You should have explained it clearly to me.

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,280
How was I supposed to know that woman

236
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,640
was some kind of financial advisor or whatever?

237
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,560
What am I going to do with you?

238
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
How am I supposed to explain everything to you?

239
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,200
Look at you, your mind is full of

240
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
those petty affairs between men and women.

241
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,960
What else do you think about?

242
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,280
I may not understand everything,

243
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,480
but I know you.

244
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,640
Don't lie to me.

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,530
When have I ever lied to you?

246
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,640
You have nothing better to do all day.

247
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,720
You're so idle.

248
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,040
Why don't you take some time

249
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,720
to take care of our home?

250
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Look at these past few days.

251
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,560
You're always running to your sister's place,

252
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,880
neglecting our home,

253
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,880
and now you're meddling in my business.

254
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,480
I'm telling you,

255
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,120
sooner or later you'll make yourself sick with all this idleness.

256
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,400
If I'm sick, it's because you drove me to it.

257
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,160
Jiang Kaiyang, let me tell you something.

258
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,200
You better be careful,

259
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
or I'll catch you red-handed one day.

260
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,080
Impossible.

261
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,240
Xu Chunli.

262
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,560
I'm not like your nouveau riche brother-in-law.

263
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,580
How could I do such things?

264
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
I, Jiang Kaiyang, am a dignified

265
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
deputy division-level government official.

266
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I would never do anything so worthless.

267
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,600
Look at you,

268
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,040
Xu Chunli, you are

269
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,520
an official's wife, aren't you?

270
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,400
Yet you showed up at my workplace.

271
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,280
Do you know how bad that looks?

272
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,920
Do you realize what consequences this could have

273
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,800
for my political career?

274
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,000
I didn't say anything at your workplace.

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,480
Then what else do you want?

276
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,920
Let me tell you, Xu Chunli.

277
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm warning you,

278
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,320
stay out of my business from now on.

279
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,580
Take the money.

280
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,410
Don't you dare take my son away.

281
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,880
Hey, Xu Huahua.

282
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,800
Hey!

283
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,320
What time is it, lady?

284
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,920
Do you have any concept of time?

285
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,250
What are you doing so early in the morning?

286
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,560
Look, you should understand this:

287
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,760
The early bird catches the worm, right?

288
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,720
Listen to me, Xu Huahua.

289
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,400
You better give me a good reason,

290
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,880
or the moment this call ends

291
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,770
will be your last moment alive.

292
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Oh my!

293
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,240
Wait a second.

294
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,960
Um...

295
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,880
Do you have something to say?

296
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

297
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
My mistake.

298
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,240
There's a reason I called you so early.

299
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,500
I've already scheduled a client for you.

300
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,120
Is it today?

301
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,840
Yes, at 10 o'clock at Slow Coffee.

302
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,520
Well, wait for me.

303
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,080
Don't you know the early bird

304
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
catches the worm?

305
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,480
Baby, mommy will make you

306
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,960
some formula first.

307
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,080
Yes.

308
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,460
It's like this. I was thinking all night.

309
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,920
I think we should

310
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,040
meet in person.

311
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,170
Yes, at the usual place.

312
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,800
Okay.

313
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,280
Okay, I'll be there soon.

314
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,640
Okay.

315
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,200
Sis, you can't come today.

316
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,120
I still have work to do later.

317
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,000
Alright, Xinxin.

318
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
I understand, okay.

319
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,840
Hurry up.

320
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,920
What's wrong with you?

321
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,760
Why are you so late? The clients are already here.

322
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,440
I'm trying to find you a job and you're not even taking it seriously.

323
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,240
Honey, honey.

324
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,300
Thank you, master.

325
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,040
Are you reliable, Xu Ke?

326
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,800
Meeting a client is such an important matter,

327
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,360
why did you only tell me now?

328
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,080
A girl like me needs

329
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,400
at least three hours to get ready. Is that reliable?

330
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,000
Enough. I'm helping you find a job and you're still complaining.

331
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,560
Wait, why did you bring your baby brother?

332
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,880
No, my sister has something going on at home today.

333
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,560
It's not appropriate to call someone else last minute.

334
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,320
He's so little.

335
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,080
I can't just leave him at home alone.

336
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,920
Look, bringing a child to meet a client

337
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,840
is so unprofessional of you.

338
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,960
Didn't you say they make children's products?

339
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
Bringing him along might give us some bonus points.

340
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,319
Let's go.

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,760
Come on.

342
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,800
Let's go.

343
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,650
When will you ever be reliable?

344
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,680
Wait a minute.

345
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,200
What?

346
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
In a moment, you'll be Director Wan.

347
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,760
What did President Wu say?

348
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,690
Mr. Wu said since we can't get support from Frontier,

349
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,040
he won't participate in future events.

350
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,800
Alright, got it.

351
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
Mr. Shi, there's one more thing.

352
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,440
Speak.

353
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,500
Wan Xinxin's personnel file.

354
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,520
Get out!

355
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

356
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,320
Mr. Qin.

357
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,000
Quite a temper there.

358
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,920
What brings you here?

359
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,540
I'm here to see Wan Xinxin.

360
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,840
Please, come in. Have a seat.

361
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,100
Wan Xinxin has already resigned.

362
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,220
Mr. Qin, if you see her, please pass on a message.

363
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,600
Tell her never to come see me again.

364
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,400
I wonder if your company is interested

365
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,600
in our next quarter's auto show?

366
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,960
Mr. Qin, if you're willing to cooperate with us,

367
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,360
that would be wonderful.

368
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,610
Alright.

369
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,260
I have only one condition.

370
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,200
Go ahead.

371
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
Bring Wan Xinxin back.

372
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,520
I can't just

373
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
watch her raise my son without a job.

374
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,010
This request isn't too much, is it?

375
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
If your company is interested,

376
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,160
the contract is in my office.

377
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,020
We can sign it anytime.

378
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,160
Okay.

379
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,520
Alright, think about it.

380
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I'll be going now.

381
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,280
That one.

382
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,760
That one.

383
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,600
Yes, this one.

384
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,480
Mr. Li.

385
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,280
Hello, I'm Wan Xinxin.

386
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
This is my son.

387
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,800
Sweetie, come here.

388
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,640
Say hello to this handsome uncle.

389
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,970
What a cute little baby!

390
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,880
Mr. Li, let me introduce you.

391
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,140
This is Director Wan from Laidi Company.

392
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,160
Hello.

393
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
Hello, Mr. Li.

394
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,240
Miss Wan, please have a seat.

395
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,640
Okay.

396
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,840
So cute!

397
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,360
I rarely see

398
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,020
someone bringing a child to a business meeting.

399
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,800
It seems Miss Wan is

400
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,200
a very dedicated mother.

401
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,280
No, actually today

402
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,210
I asked my friend to look after him.

403
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,280
But I heard your company produces

404
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,320
children's products.

405
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,120
So I deliberately brought him along.

406
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,250
I think his experience would be more valuable than mine.

407
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,240
Miss Wan is a person with a wonderful childlike spirit.

408
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,920
Yes, exactly.

409
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,180
I believe at this point

410
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,920
our cooperation is already halfway to success.

411
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Great!

412
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
Director Jiang, have you made up your mind?

413
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,160
Yes, of course I have.

414
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,680
I was thinking that this money

415
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,960
would be better managed by you.

416
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,820
I think that's more appropriate.

417
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,520
But this isn't enough.

418
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
I know.

419
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
You're dealing with big investments now.

420
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,200
As for me,

421
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,200
I'll find a way to raise more money to give to you.

422
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,640
I just want to ask one question.

423
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,640
When can I expect the first return?

424
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,560
The first period is about three months.

425
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,440
Three months? That's quite long.

426
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,690
But the return is three times what you get now.

427
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,680
Three times?

428
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,730
Will there be any issues with the payment?

429
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,010
Director Jiang,

430
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,720
if you haven't decided yet, then forget it.

431
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,480
No, no, Miss Shen.

432
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I've decided, of course I have.

433
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,980
I definitely want us to continue working together.

434
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,800
Long-term cooperation.

435
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,460
Forever partners.

436
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,140
Jiang Kaiyang.

437
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,920
I knew you were up to no good.

438
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,840
You and this homewrecker

439
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,160
came here for your little romantic getaway.

440
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,920
What are you doing here? Go home now.

441
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,560
Don't embarrass yourself here.

442
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,800
You're worried about embarrassment?

443
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,080
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

444
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,240
I'm your wife.

445
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,600
This is the mistress, the homewrecker.

446
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,760
A wife catching her husband's mistress is perfectly justified.

447
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,490
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

448
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,680
Mrs. Jiang.

449
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,900
This is a public place.

450
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,360
Could you show some restraint?

451
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,240
You're telling me to show restraint?

452
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,760
Everyone, look at this!

453
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,640
Hurry up and leave.

454
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,120
This is what I'm talking about.

455
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,780
Stop embarrassing yourself.

456
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,680
Come on, let's go to the police station.

457
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,200
Let go!

458
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
You hit me!

459
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,400
I should be the one hitting you!

460
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,320
What's going on?

461
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,920
What's happening here?

462
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,040
You came just in time.

463
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,480
Take her to the police station right away.

464
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Give her a proper interrogation.

465
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,600
How many families has she destroyed?

466
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
How much money has she swindled?

467
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,160
Miss Shen, what's going on here?

468
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,800
Ask him.

469
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,080
You, come over here.

470
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,490
What's happening here?

471
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,120
Well...

472
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,040
This person... I don't really know her.

473
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Don't you know this is a public place?

474
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,170
Come on, you're coming with me.

475
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,680
Jiang Kaiyang, you heartless man!

476
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,880
Jiang Kaiyang, you heartless man!

477
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,160
I'm so sorry, Miss Shen. I didn't expect

478
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,120
she would follow me here.

479
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,920
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,720
Miss Shen, I'll find a way today.

481
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,920
I'll gather the 500,000.

482
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,580
I'll transfer it to you, okay?

483
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,800
So we have a deal, Director Li?

484
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
Deal or no deal,

485
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,000
it still depends on your company's implementation plan.

486
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Our company has actually

487
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,640
approached several promotion companies,

488
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,770
but because the timeline is too tight,

489
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,640
we couldn't reach an agreement.

490
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,760
I believe you must have heard about

491
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,160
Lady's event organization capabilities.

492
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,880
Otherwise,

493
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,800
we wouldn't be sitting at this table today.

494
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,160
Rest assured, I'll quickly provide you with

495
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,420
the proposal you want.

496
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,320
As expected from Lady's PR representative,

497
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
neither humble nor arrogant. Good.

498
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,080
I'll have the contract ready

499
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,400
and wait for your proposal.

500
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,130
Don't worry, I absolutely won't disappoint you.

501
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,960
Good.

502
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,480
Well then, I have other matters to attend to,

503
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,760
so I'll be leaving first.

504
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,160
Okay.

505
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,360
I hope we have a pleasant cooperation.

506
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,800
Sure.

507
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,410
Director Li, let me see you out.

508
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,680
This way.

509
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:47,960
No need.

510
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,290
Take care, Director Li.

511
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,760
Awesome!

512
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,820
I knew it! You're mommy's little lucky star.

513
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,040
It's settled.

514
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,920
Let me summarize two points.

515
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,120
First, quick response, commendable.

516
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,960
Of course.

517
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,640
But second...

518
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,940
I'm talking to you.

519
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,560
This job has tight deadlines and heavy tasks,

520
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,800
with such demanding requirements.

521
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,000
You were just blindly agreeing, you know?

522
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,240
What if you can't complete it?

523
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,840
Have you thought about that?

524
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,920
Well, let's agree first.

525
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Should we back down when facing difficulties?

526
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,440
Is that my style?

527
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,480
Besides, this juicy opportunity

528
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,360
is right in front of me. How could I not take a bite?

529
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,560
Should I just give up?

530
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,600
Yes, you've got your teeth in it.

531
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,540
But have you considered if that female devil will bite?

532
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,320
I forgot.

533
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,440
Just thinking about her face

534
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,480
fills me with deep fear.

535
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,320
Honey.

536
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,600
Honey.

537
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,040
Why don't you come with me?

538
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,440
Stop right there. I'm absolutely not going.

539
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,760
Who was it yesterday that talked about regaining

540
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
their confidence and self-respect?

541
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,240
Come on, are you reliable or not?

542
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,200
You always bail when it matters most.

543
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,760
No,

544
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,800
I can't handle this kind of older woman. I don't know how.

545
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,480
What good are you then?

546
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,500
I'm not exaggerating,

547
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,960
Every time I hear her

548
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,120
phone ring,

549
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,480
my liver trembles.

550
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,000
That would be your lungs.

551
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,280
Don't say that! No!

552
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
Rejected!

553
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,360
Hello, Director Shi.

554
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,500
This is Wan Xinxin.

555
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,480
Wherever you are right now,

556
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,640
I want you here

557
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,040
within 30 minutes.

558
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,560
Okay, I got it.

559
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Good, that makes things easier.

560
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,880
Just wait.

561
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,800
Hello.

562
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,620
Strange that you brought a child.

563
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,400
Xinxin.

564
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Hello.

565
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,120
You've already resigned and got out clean.

566
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Now you're walking right back into the trap.

567
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,480
I didn't want to come back.

568
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,940
Mr. Shi asked me to return.

569
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,520
You're just asking for trouble.

570
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,440
He's asleep.

571
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,120
Let me tell you.

572
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,440
That female devil,

573
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,280
if she corners you,

574
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
remember

575
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
there's an escape route over there.

576
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,680
Just wait and see.

577
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,050
Why are you all gathered there?

578
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,480
Don't you have work to do?

579
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,720
Buddha bless you.

580
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,320
Wan Xinxin, come to my office.

581
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,320
Mr. Shi, I came today to apologize to you.

582
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,880
Apologize to me?

583
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,500
Would you have come to apologize if I hadn't called you?

584
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,520
Wan Xinxin.

585
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,600
You really have no shame.

586
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,320
After making such a big mistake,

587
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,050
don't you feel any guilt at all?

588
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,600
Look at yourself.

589
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,400
You just hide when problems arise,

590
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,290
without any courage to take responsibility.

591
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,330
Think about it. Who deserves this behavior of yours?

592
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,160
I came back this time

593
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,940
because I really want to make up for my mistakes.

594
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Make up? How are you going to do that?

595
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,280
I haven't had a chance to tell you yet,

596
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,320
but I've been negotiating a project outside,

597
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,360
and that client has a very clear intention

598
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,400
to cooperate with us.

599
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,120
If we prepare a good proposal,

600
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,400
the client is very interested in working with us.

601
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,330
What about the client? Has the contract been signed?

602
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,040
Do you think I'm a three-year-old?

603
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,200
You expect me to believe you just based on your word?

604
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,080
No, really.

605
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,340
I just need to prepare a proposal now.

606
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,240
Once I finish that proposal,

607
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,300
I'll come back to discuss it with you.

608
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Did I say you could leave?

609
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,320
I know you can't bear to let me go.

610
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,120
Don't worry, I definitely won't disappear again.

611
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,880
You can work here at the company.

612
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,920
Stay at the company?

613
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,080
Work here at the company,

614
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,610
in your original position.

615
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,240
Okay.

616
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,580
These are the materials Mr. Shi gave you.

617
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,720
Just focus on writing a good proposal.

618
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,080
Alright.

619
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,080
I'm sorry.

620
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,280
Mommy will be done soon.

621
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,120
Keep going.

622
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,280
Don't cry.

623
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,160
Don't cry.

624
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,580
What's going on? Why so noisy?

625
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Go back and take care of your child. Don't let it affect your work.

626
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,520
Can you get your facts straight

627
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,980
before you start talking?

628
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,160
Yes, I admit

629
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,020
I was looking for Miss Shen today.

630
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,440
But do you know why

631
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
I was meeting her?

632
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,680
It was completely for our family's sake.

633
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,060
Do you understand?

634
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,000
Do you know what Miss Shen does?

635
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,960
She's a financial advisor.

636
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,440
She has many investment channels.

637
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,520
The money we made last time

638
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,980
was all thanks to her help.

639
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,720
Can't you see that?

640
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,280
Well,

641
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
who are you trying to fool?

642
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,200
If you've already made money,

643
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
why do you still need to be with her?

644
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,280
Why the secret meetings?

645
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,680
You don't even have basic logic.

646
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,160
If I wanted to date her, would I be in that kind of place?

647
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,560
I'd just get a hotel room.

648
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,400
Who knows? Maybe you would.

649
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,400
Xu Chunli, let me tell you.

650
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,240
This Miss Shen has

651
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,440
a 100-million-yuan project.

652
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,560
There's a lot of money to be made.

653
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,320
Many people want to work with her,

654
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
but she ignores them completely.

655
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,440
Why did she come to me?

656
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,800
Because I approved some documents for her before.

657
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,680
Do you remember?

658
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,360
So I had to beg and plead

659
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,520
just to catch this last opportunity.

660
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,140
And now with your scene...

661
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,840
How much money could you make

662
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,490
that's got you so obsessed?

663
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,820
Not that much, just 1 or 2 million.

664
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,920
What? 1 or 2 million?

665
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Now it's all gone. Down the drain.

666
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,080
Why didn't you explain this to me clearly?

667
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,400
Being all secretive.

668
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,040
Would telling you have helped? Someone like you.

669
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,880
You follow me around all day.

670
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,120
Let me tell you, Xu Chunli.

671
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,720
I had planned

672
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,320
to earn this money and take you traveling abroad.

673
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,560
And then for our daughter,

674
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
to transfer her to a better school.

675
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,490
With your scene,

676
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,260
I've lost what would take several lifetimes of salary to earn.

677
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,880
Look at you.

678
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,240
Look at yourself.

679
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,840
If you had explained earlier, there wouldn't have been any problem.

680
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,160
I'm not an unreasonable person.

681
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,200
Well,

682
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,280
why don't you call her again?

683
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,880
This is our situation.

684
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,920
Room and board included, with a 3-month probation period.

685
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,680
During these three months, the monthly salary is

686
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,640
2,500 yuan.

687
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,240
A 3-month probation period is quite long

688
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,600
for such little pay.

689
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,800
If you're willing to work, you can stay.

690
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,800
And if not, that's fine too.

691
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,120
Actually,

692
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,450
as long as you work hard,

693
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,360
a raise won't be a problem in the future.

694
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,400
2,500 yuan is too little, too little.

695
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,960
I don't hire male housekeepers.

696
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,880
I'm sorry, excuse me.

697
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,010
Please consider it.

698
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,900
What are you doing?

699
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,929
Miss Wan, what are you up to now?

700
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,440
Can't you tell? I'm looking for a nanny.

701
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,840
No, you.

702
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,199
Where are you looking for a nanny?

703
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,120
Online.

704
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,080
Finding a nanny online?

705
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,199
They don't even have professional training certificates.

706
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,600
How can that be reliable?

707
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,040
Why wouldn't it be reliable?

708
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,800
It's perfectly fine.

709
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,130
What's it to you anyway?

710
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,360
Excuse me, everyone.

711
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,639
Who are you calling unreliable?

712
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,440
Ladies, all of you.

713
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,280
Let me ask you something.

714
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,199
Does anyone here have a health certificate or childcare qualification?

715
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,760
Who has a qualification certificate

716
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,489
issued by a professional housekeeping company?

717
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,440
For 2,500, you still want someone certified?

718
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,920
Then find one yourself.

719
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,000
Not reliable. Let's go.

720
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,800
Don't go!

721
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,280
I'm sorry.

722
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,159
Don't go! Wait.

723
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,159
Come back! Wait.

724
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,239
I'll raise it by another 1,000 for whoever agrees.

725
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
The baby is sleeping inside, right?

726
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,080
No. What did I do to you?

727
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,280
What's going on?

728
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,160
What grudge do you have against me?

729
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,360
Look, they all left.

730
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,800
I'm doing this for the baby's sake.

731
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,840
If she doesn't have a certificate...

732
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,900
No, I just don't have that much money.

733
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,120
Can you really pay 3,500?

734
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,640
Yes.

735
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,360
If you can pay 3,500,

736
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,200
I can do it.

737
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,480
What's your name?

738
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,320
My name is Xiaomei.

739
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,580
Do you have any experience in this field?

740
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,680
Well, I haven't taken care of others' children,

741
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,210
but I have two kids of my own.

742
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Then you must be quite experienced.

743
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,520
Do you like children?

744
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
Of course I do.

745
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,560
Good. You can start tomorrow.

746
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Baby.

747
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,090
Oh my goodness! You scared me to death!

748
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,680
You're bathing the child with cold water and leaving the door open.

749
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,240
Don't you know children get sick easily?

750
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,120
It's none of your business.

751
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,080
Get out now!

752
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,600
Come here, little one.

753
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,520
Come.

754
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,480
What are you doing?

755
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,880
Okay, come here.

756
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,120
Sister Wan said strangers shouldn't touch the child.

757
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,280
Especially not you.

758
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,600
The child has a fever.

759
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,700
I'll take him to the hospital.

760
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,920
No way.

761
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,880
I used to be a doctor.

762
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,960
I think there's something wrong with the child.

763
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,880
I need to take him to the hospital.

764
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,360
Will you take responsibility if something happens?

765
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,000
Let go.

766
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,440
It's okay.

767
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,520
Wait.

768
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,520
Hey, Xiaomei.

769
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,160
Hey, Xinxin.

770
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,080
That man took the child.

771
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,210
He took him away.

772
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,440
Driver, turn around.

773
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,120
Hey.

774
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,980
What have you done with my son?

775
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,800
The child is sick. I brought him to see a doctor.

776
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,140
Come over here.

777
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,680
Changhai Hospital.

778
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,280
Okay, I'm coming right away.

779
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,290
Driver, take me to Changhai Hospital.

780
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,440
Number 16.

781
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:21,970
Okay.

782
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,920
Driver, please hurry.

783
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,400
It's fine.

784
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,200
How is it, doctor?

785
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
Nothing serious.

786
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,680
It's just a common flu.

787
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,680
Go get the medicine.

788
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,320
This doesn't seem like a common flu.

789
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,600
Look, he's been drowsy the whole time.

790
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,240
And look, he's in pain.

791
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,040
His eyes are clearly unfocused.

792
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,720
I suspect it's a sign of meningitis.

793
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,520
Can we do a cerebrospinal fluid test?

794
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,280
We can do it.

795
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,800
But the child will suffer.

796
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,960
As long as it's for the child's safety and health,

797
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,090
we have to do it despite the suffering.

798
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,640
Xinxin.

799
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,240
What's wrong with the baby?

800
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Mommy's here. Look at Mommy.

801
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,920
Baby.

802
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
He was fine when I left this morning.

803
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,320
Doctor?

804
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,120
It's not serious.

805
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,280
Well, it's mainly just a common flu.

806
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,480
No, these are symptoms of meningitis.

807
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,200
Your diagnosis might be wrong.

808
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Be quiet.

809
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,040
Okay.

810
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,680
Look, you two

811
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,280
should come back after you agree on something.

812
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,960
Next patient.

813
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,800
Thank you, doctor.

814
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,080
Alright, thank you, doctor.

815
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,540
Come on.

816
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,460
Wan Xinxin.

817
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,640
Didn't I tell you already?

818
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,400
You can't find a nanny online.

819
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,000
The baby's immune system is weak right now.

820
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,760
You can't just let anyone watch him.

821
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,920
Don't talk about that now.

822
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,320
Why didn't you tell me

823
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,480
before taking him away today?

824
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,080
Do you know how worried I was?

825
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,880
Besides, the doctor already said

826
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,400
it's just a common flu.

827
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,520
You insisted on doing some kind of puncture.

828
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,000
You're just a vet.

829
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,930
Why are you giving medical advice?

830
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,460
No puncture. No puncture.

831
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,520
Give me the baby first.

832
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,170
Why should I?

833
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,160
Look, I left in a hurry.

834
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I didn't bring enough money.

835
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
You need to get medicine for the baby.

836
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,290
Did you bring money?

837
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,560
I'm not unreliable like you.

838
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,040
Good.

839
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,770
Take it easy.

840
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,320
Okay, come on.

841
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,960
Mommy will be right back.

842
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,320
Okay.

843
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,520
It's alright.

844
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,400
Wait here for mommy.

845
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,060
Wait for me.

846
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,800
Good, wait for mommy.

847
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,560
Wait for mommy, okay?

848
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,170
Children's Hospital, thanks.

849
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,480
Have you seen a man

850
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,960
carrying a child leaving here?

851
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,280
There are so many people coming and going here.

852
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,940
How would I know which one you're talking about?

853
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,200
Where are you?

854
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,300
Why did you leave without telling me?

855
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,040
Don't just take the child for random checkups.

856
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,170
I'll be right there.

857
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,640
How's the situation now?

858
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,650
It doesn't hurt. It's okay.

859
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,880
It's okay.

860
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,440
Wait, you had the child examined?

861
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,320
What's wrong with you?

862
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,640
Who told you to have the child examined?

863
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,920
Look, if you're angry, take it out on me.

864
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,280
If anything happens to the child,

865
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,480
I won't let this go, Huaming.

866
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:02,760
Stop arguing.

867
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,820
Get out of here now.

868
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,680
Hello.

869
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,880
I'm the child's mother.

870
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,340
How is the child doing now?

871
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
The child has viral encephalitis.

872
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,400
Fortunately, his father brought him in time.

873
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Otherwise, something terrible could have happened.

874
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:24,680
Li.

875
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,320
Ming.

876
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,600
Jiang Qiaohua.
