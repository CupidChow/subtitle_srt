1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,860
We've known each other for some time now.

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,660
You can't hide things from me.

4
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,250
Whatever's bothering you,

5
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,770
you can tell me about it.

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Personal issues, work problems, tell me everything.

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
If Huaming is mistreating you,

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,460
I'll set him straight.

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,820
He wouldn't dare mistreat me.

10
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,479
Right, I wouldn't dare.

11
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,770
I don't think you would either.

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,200
Or maybe it's our Xiaogang who's been bothering you.

13
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,280
Xiaogang has been talking to me lately

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,460
about what happened between you two.

15
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,520
He truly regrets it this time.

16
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
Look, he's already broken up

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
with that Liu Wei, hasn't he?

18
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,040
He wants to reconcile with you,

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
he just used the wrong approach.

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,440
He shouldn't have

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
used work as an excuse to see you.

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,520
Auntie.

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,840
Qin Gang and I are already divorced.

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,880
We should just move on

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,480
and live our separate lives.

26
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,800
If we keep getting entangled like this,

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,660
neither of us can bear it anymore.

28
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,840
Entangled?

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,130
You and Hua Ming aren't even a real couple.

30
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
Auntie, you shouldn't say that.

31
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,520
Why can't we be a couple?

32
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,440
Yes.

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,120
You don't need to hold hands.

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,800
Even if you glued yourselves together, you still wouldn't be a real couple.

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,880
Xinxin, of course I understand.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
As a woman,

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,210
raising a child on your own is incredibly difficult.

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,000
But we are really together now.

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,120
And Huaming promised me

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
that he would take good care of me and my son.

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,040
Yes.

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,250
We will live happily together.

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
Live happily together.

44
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,160
What happened between me and Qin Gang is in the past.

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,880
We all need to move forward, right?

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,940
We all need to face reality together.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,960
You're the one not facing reality.

48
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,960
Him. Huaming.

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,240
This man.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,220
Has he made you any real promises?

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,200
If he had made you any promises,

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
why aren't you married?

53
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,280
I think

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
marriage is just a formality.

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,020
It doesn't really matter.

56
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Don't take this so lightly, will you?

57
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,140
Marriage requires responsibility.

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,640
If Huaming is truly willing to take this responsibility,

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
let him say it.

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,260
Then I'll back off.

61
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Don't look at him.

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,050
By that time, he might not even be around anymore.

63
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
He might not even live in this city anymore.

64
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,760
I...

65
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,200
I can stand on my own.

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,290
I don't need to rely on anyone else.

67
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,200
Xinxin.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,920
Come hold her for a moment. I need to use the restroom.

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,040
Go to mommy.

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,400
Come.

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,360
All right.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
Does this actually work?

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
You're here to propose too, right?

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,000
No, I'm not.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,800
This is a famous spot for proposals.

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,480
They say

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,810
over 100 couples have succeeded here.

78
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Look, proposing is a happy occasion.

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,640
Why are you sweating so much?

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,880
I don't know. I can't stop shaking.

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
And my girlfriend told me

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,560
that I should propose to her.

83
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,890
She just called and said

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,040
she has to work overtime today

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,570
and won't be here until 8 PM.

86
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
The longer I wait,

87
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,960
the more nervous I get.

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,490
Now I can barely even speak.

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,080
But I've hired extras today,

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,920
arranged for a band, flowers, everything.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,330
So I absolutely have to propose today.

92
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,960
Xinxin, come home with me.

93
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,640
It's the best choice for you.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,760
Auntie, I...

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,159
Wan Xinxin.

96
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,200
I didn't tell you because

97
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
I wanted to see you smile,

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
to make you happy.

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,280
I thought I would never love again.

100
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,480
Spring flowers wouldn't bloom for me,

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,600
yet I happened to meet you.

102
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,800
In this bustling crowd.

103
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,000
I thought after all life's changes,

104
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,600
my heart would never race again.

105
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,920
Yet I happened to meet you.

106
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,560
But I no longer believe in love.

107
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:03,040
It's not that I don't want to love despite being hurt,

108
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,640
who can predict fate's plan?

109
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,360
It's not that I don't want to love,

110
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,240
but love has become vast as the ocean,

111
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,280
perhaps I'm destined to wait a lifetime.

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Wan Xinxin, I'm over 40.

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,520
I was married before.

114
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,600
I've been living in this...

115
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,160
I live in a city I thought I knew well,

116
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,800
but it's actually quite lonely.

117
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,320
I live in a home I believed was comfortable

118
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,440
and well-organized.

119
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,840
I always thought my heart was completely closed,

120
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,000
that no one would ever again

121
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,300
create even a ripple on that lake.

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
But you, Bao,

123
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,320
appeared in my life.

124
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,000
I tell myself,

125
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
I love you.

126
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,080
I love Bao too.

127
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,410
I'm willing to spend my entire life

128
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,250
protecting you both

129
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,020
and taking care of you.

130
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,920
I love you, Xinxin.

131
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Marry him. Marry him. Marry him.

132
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,040
Marry him. Marry him. Marry him.

133
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:49,840
Oh my!

134
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,240
You're going too far.

135
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,200
I thought after all these changes in life,

136
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,680
I would never feel passionate again.

137
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,880
Yet I happened to meet you.

138
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,560
But I no longer believe in love.

139
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,000
It's not that I don't want to love,

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,960
even though I've been hurt before.

141
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,560
Who can predict what fate has in store?

142
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,080
It's not that I don't want to love,

143
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,080
but love has become as vast as the ocean.

144
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,280
Perhaps it takes a lifetime of waiting.

145
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,840
I hope to see you smile.

146
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,880
I reserved this restaurant.

147
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
I didn't arrange all this.

148
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,920
Mrs. Qin, this is for you.

149
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,940
Xinxin and I thank you.

150
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,520
You know what?

151
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,840
All of this is heaven's arrangement.

152
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,160
This restaurant is actually famous for proposals.

153
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,360
You probably didn't know that.

154
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,680
There have been 100 to 200 couples engaged here in just a few months.

155
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,160
I was originally planning for another time

156
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,680
to propose to Xinxin here as well,

157
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,280
to give her a surprise.

158
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,960
But all this is heaven's arrangement.

159
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,480
You happened to invite us to eat here,

160
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,240
so I just

161
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,940
made these arrangements at the last minute.

162
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,040
Thank you.

163
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,960
Please rest assured, I will

164
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,200
take good care of Xinxin and her little brother.

165
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,050
I will use my entire life

166
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,080
to care for them and love them.

167
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,250
Thank you, Mrs. Qin. Thank you for your blessing.

168
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

169
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,840
I'll head back first.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,560
Mrs. Qin, is your car outside?

171
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,200
Yes.

172
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,260
Goodbye, Mrs. Qin.

173
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,400
Honey.

174
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,920
Are we

175
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,840
moving too fast?

176
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,720
Wan Xinxin.

177
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,120
Can you take off the ring?

178
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,280
Huh?

179
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,320
I just

180
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,860
borrowed this ring from someone.

181
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,680
Bear with me.

183
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,720
Ouch!

184
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,120
Sorry, sorry.

185
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,960
I'm so sorry.

186
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,040
Young man.

187
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,700
Hey, young man.

188
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,080
Can you see it clearly?

189
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,000
I see it clearly.

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,880
How does it feel?

191
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,400
It's excellent.

192
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,600
Amazing! You're so good at this.

193
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,320
It's not about being good. Just remember it clearly.

194
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,920
Do you have children?

195
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,320
No.

196
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,660
It's easier without children, isn't it?

197
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,840
Just say it roughly the way I told you.

198
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,480
Organize it a bit yourself.

199
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
And that song called 'Not That I Don't Want to Love.'

200
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,200
About my age,

201
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,440
of course just remove anything about being forty.

202
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,800
Alright.

203
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,680
Okay.

204
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
Our audience here has a request.

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,720
The dance teacher just now was really excellent.

206
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,880
This kind of expression and everything was really great.

207
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,200
I hope that when

208
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,000
this guy proposes,

209
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,700
when you see him getting down on one knee,

210
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,480
opening the box and saying 'Will you marry me?'

211
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,360
You all must say,

212
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,690
'Marry him! Marry him!'

213
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,000
The expression should be passionate no matter what.

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
No, wait a second.

215
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,320
What's going on here?

216
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,120
Rehearsal?

217
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,720
This is a wedding venue, right?

218
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,520
I just met this young man in the restroom.

219
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,250
He told me that this afternoon,

220
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,720
he's going to propose.

221
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,160
So he's very nervous.

222
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,610
I'm just helping him practice in advance.

223
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,320
Not bad. Your acting is excellent.

224
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,120
Just say it like he did,

225
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,480
and the girl will definitely marry you.

226
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,800
Um, can we change back our clothes now?

227
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,720
Okay, fine.

228
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,690
Where are my clothes? Are they with

229
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,120
Xinxin, I'll go change back into my clothes.

230
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,840
Okay.

231
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,970
Remember, guitar teacher,

232
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,240
this part needs to be...

233
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,120
Good.

234
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,480
Wan Xinxin, you idiot.

235
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,680
Proposal.

236
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,360
I told you before,

237
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
they're really together now, aren't they?

238
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,800
Mom, you said they were just pretending.

239
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,200
I also think they're not right for each other.

240
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,330
Didn't Huaming say the same thing?

241
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,090
How could they possibly be good together?

242
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,840
Mom, maybe it was all your meddling

243
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,970
that actually brought them together.

244
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,760
I've been

245
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,320
humbling myself and hanging around their house.

246
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,380
What was it all for?

247
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,160
Wasn't it just so

248
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,000
I could get my grandson back?

249
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Mom, I'm still young.

250
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,520
I can give you another chubby grandson.

251
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,650
Why do we have to fight with Wan Xinxin?

252
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,840
What nonsense are you talking?

253
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,240
That's your own flesh and blood.

254
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,840
Blood is thicker than water.

255
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,540
How can you just give up on him?

256
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,960
You'll regret it if you continue like this.

257
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,760
Besides,

258
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,970
Xinxin is better than Liu Wei in every way.

259
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,680
She's also the child's birth mother.

260
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,740
You two getting back together would be the right thing.

261
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,720
Mom, she's going to marry Huaming.

262
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,240
That's not marriage, it's just a proposal.

263
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Can't you figure out a way

264
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,840
to win her back?

265
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,480
If you can't get her back,

266
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,610
then that property,

267
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
I won't give you a penny of it.

268
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,650
You know how to care for others now.

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,730
What do you mean 'know'?

270
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,040
I've always known how.

271
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,900
It just depends if I want to or not.

272
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,840
Wait. You're wearing short sleeves.

273
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,970
Why are you putting clothes on me? I'm sweating all over.

274
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,560
It's hot.

275
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,180
I thought there'd be a breeze on the balcony.

276
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,600
What are you doing up so late?

277
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Today...

278
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,560
I've been busy with this and that. Exhausted all day.

279
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
But I'm getting more and more awake.

280
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,079
You're just too excited to sleep.

281
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,410
What am I excited about?

282
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,569
What are you excited about?

283
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,720
You proposed to someone.

284
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,319
And they said yes.

285
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,520
Let's talk properly.

286
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,440
I accepted your proposal.

287
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,119
Aren't you happy about it?

288
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,079
Who's happy about it?

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,880
Wait.

290
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,680
What's wrong?

291
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,760
Having regrets?

292
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,640
This isn't about regrets.

293
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,040
It's just that you...

294
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,600
You shouldn't be putting on a show for Grandma Qin.

295
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,520
I'm just playing along.

296
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,560
We're all adults here.

297
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,440
But you can't seem to tell what's real and what's not.

298
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,840
Who can't tell what's real?

299
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
This is just acting. Seriously.

300
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,720
I was just joking.

301
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,920
You old folks are so boring.

302
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,360
Taking everything so seriously.

303
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,840
Who's taking it seriously? Not me.

304
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,320
Who's taking it seriously? I'm not either.

305
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,280
Exactly. So we're good.

306
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:51,680
Right.

307
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,800
Yes, yes.

308
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,840
But today...

309
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,760
You suddenly came out wearing a suit.

310
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,280
Even with a tie.

311
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,680
It was hilarious.

312
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,400
I've never seen you dressed so formally before.

313
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,660
I used to dress like that before I met you.

314
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,120
Always so formal?

315
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,480
I was in the bathroom.

316
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,120
I saw that guy proposing.

317
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,480
He was so nervous, sweating all over.

318
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,280
He said he was nervous about proposing.

319
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,320
And that proposal song was pretty nice.

320
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,480
I thought I could show him how it's done.

321
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,400
And I could also put on a show to help you with Grandma Qin.

322
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,760
I believe in giving roses and keeping the fragrance on your hands.

323
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,280
Why not do both things?

324
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,480
So I just...

325
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,330
No, the key is when you came out.

326
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,040
I thought you were going to dance or something.

327
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,680
But when you knelt down and told me...

328
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,920
That you'd take care of me and my son for life.

329
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
I was really touched at that moment.

330
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,920
At that time, I didn't...

331
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,760
I was thinking...

332
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,240
With the night surrounding us...

333
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,080
Then turning around, and then...

334
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,620
Alright, alright.

335
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Stop explaining.

336
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,760
What's wrong? Afraid I'll cling to you?

337
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,760
As if I would.

338
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,840
I just thought that moment was beautiful.

339
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,640
Actually...

340
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,480
I'm 40 years old now.

341
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,440
About 10 years older than you.

342
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,100
And my daughter is already 10.

343
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,600
I just feel like...

344
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,240
What I want to say is...

345
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,920
All that kneeling, diamond rings, flowers

346
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,960
and all those romantic gestures

347
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,240
are behind me now.

348
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,440
You understand me?

349
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,440
I'm tired. Going to bed.

350
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
What are you doing? Are you serious?

351
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Stop right there!

352
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,180
After the proposal, we should go on a honeymoon.

353
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,040
What honeymoon?

354
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,050
If you're going to help, go all the way.

355
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,410
Look, I can help you.

356
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,180
But we can't have a honeymoon without getting married.

357
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,130
Before and after marriage.

358
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
No, it's not appropriate for us to go on a honeymoon.

359
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,330
Too late. I already posted it on Weibo.

360
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,880
I don't care what you posted.

361
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,480
I can't go on a honeymoon with you.

362
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,960
Let me tell you.

363
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,800
I was just being nice by helping you.

364
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
We put on a show for Grandma Qin.

365
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,930
The show worked.

366
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,680
We're done now. I'm not going.

367
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Stop explaining.

368
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,810
You're just afraid.

369
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,440
Afraid of what?

370
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,280
That you can't control yourself.

371
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,960
What are you talking about?

372
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,600
Whether it's age or life experience,

373
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,200
you're the one who can't control yourself.

374
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,800
Don't overthink it, really.

375
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,320
I'm not attracted to you at all.

376
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,520
Who's afraid of whom?

377
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Who's afraid of whom?

378
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,160
Who's afraid of whom?

379
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,960
Then let's go.

380
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
You said it.

381
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,490
Brother, what should we do?

382
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,840
My sister is actually very easy to fool.

383
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,120
Sis.

384
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,040
I know I was wrong.

385
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,760
I didn't mean to do it that day.

386
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Please don't hold it against me.

387
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,240
Now you know to apologize?

388
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,940
You were so harsh to me before.

389
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,920
I know you're good to me.

390
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,600
When we were little and had only one piece of candy,

391
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,370
you always let me have it first.

392
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,760
Was our family ever that poor?

393
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,240
No, I'm just making an example.

394
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,000
Now that Dad has passed away,

395
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
you're the only family I have left.

396
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,480
If you don't treat me well,

397
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,520
then no one will.

398
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,080
Just look at my year.

399
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,500
I've only encountered terrible things.

400
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,200
I don't know what to do anymore.

401
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,800
Sis.

402
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,880
Mr. Qin.

404
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,040
Dr. Hua.

405
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,640
What a rare visitor. Are you here to bring me wedding candies?

406
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,690
Xinxin should have come herself for this.

407
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,570
Of course, you know her temper.

408
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,440
No need to beat around the bush. Just say what you want.

409
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,600
We're going on a honeymoon before getting married.

410
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,060
A pre-wedding honeymoon.

411
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,480
Don't act smug after getting what you want.

412
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,280
I'm just here to let you know.

413
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,640
No, you're really taking this seriously.

414
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
Should I give you

415
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,080
some cash gift or something?

416
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,320
We have enough money for the wedding.

417
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,000
But if you really want to give a gift,

418
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,730
I thank you on Xinxin's behalf.

419
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
Wan Xinxin is young

420
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,560
and foolish.

421
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,880
At your age,

422
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,160
you're being just as foolish as she is.

423
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,020
You're about to marry Wan Xinxin.

424
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,400
Give me back my child.

425
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,720
That child isn't even yours.

426
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,800
I love Xinxin, and after we're married,

427
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,280
her child will be my child.

428
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Not biological, but just as good as.

429
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,520
This child may be like your own,

430
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,960
but it's not your biological child.

431
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,560
It's mine.

432
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,200
If you don't return the child to me,

433
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,480
this isn't over.

434
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,760
Fine, we'll discuss this after 15 days.

435
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,610
We'll be gone for about 15 days.

436
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,200
Do I have some illness again?

437
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,400
What medicine should I take?

438
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm afraid my medicine can't cure your condition.

439
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,760
This is a matter of the heart.

440
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,760
You really understand me.

441
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
It's only been half a day.

442
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,570
But I feel this anger rising inside me.

443
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,100
I feel like I can't even get out of bed.

444
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,240
Emotional issues must be treated emotionally.

445
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,920
I'll prescribe you something to reduce inflammation and blood pressure.

446
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,480
But if you want to cure it completely,

447
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,280
you'll need to untangle your own emotional knots.

448
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,600
I'm really, really sorry.

449
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,760
Just one week.

450
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,480
I promise you.

451
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,240
Ruirui, Daddy is even more sorry that

452
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,240
the signal might be poor.

453
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,400
We might not be able to contact each other for two or three days.

454
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,640
No way. You can't go.

455
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,880
Why go so far?

456
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,760
I'm going to visit an old friend.

457
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
You're going to visit an old friend.

458
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,040
Why is she packing too?

459
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,520
She...

460
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,000
She also knows that friend.

461
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,960
So she's packing some things.

462
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,960
For Daddy to bring over.

463
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,650
You're taking her with you.

464
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,600
No, Daddy is just visiting a friend.

465
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,520
You've never taken me.

466
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,280
But you're taking her first.

467
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,480
Daddy will definitely make it up to you.

468
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,560
I'm done talking. You're definitely lying to me.

469
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,090
Bye-bye.

470
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,680
Seriously.

471
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,960
She hung up.

472
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,140
Your daughter is really a little smarty-pants.

473
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,820
Hey, why are you pacing back and forth behind me?

474
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,740
I didn't know she could see me.

475
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,300
Don't laugh at me. Let me tell you.

476
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,680
When your little boy grows up,

477
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,480
you'll have your hands full too.

478
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,160
Hey, we've been packing all this time,

479
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,290
but we haven't decided where to go yet.

480
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,160
Let's go somewhere you like.

481
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,760
I've been to too many places.

482
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
How about this then?

483
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,540
Let's choose a place together, okay?

484
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,680
I'll put it here.

485
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,120
Antarctica.

486
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,600
No. If you really want

487
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,840
to see penguins in Antarctica,

488
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,760
I can take you to the zoo

489
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,680
and buy you a ticket for 100 yuan.

490
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,720
I need to post on Weibo

491
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,250
so the whole world knows I went to Antarctica.

492
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
Are you serious?

493
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,720
See? You insisted I ask for leave for you,

494
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
and now they're after us.

495
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,960
I just want him to know

496
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,320
that I, Wan Xinxin, am doing just fine without him.

497
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
I need him to give up completely.

498
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,680
This will only make him more persistent. Believe me.

499
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,760
You don't know him at all.

500
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
He's not that kind of person.

501
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,420
Hurry up and pack your things.

502
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,780
Put the beer in the bag.

503
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
In the bag.

504
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,800
Let's go.

505
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,720
I can't get my child back anyway

506
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,780
and Wan Xinxin refuses to remarry me.

507
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,880
I'm my mother's only son.

508
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,560
She can't possibly donate

509
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,680
all of her assets.

510
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,200
How come you know your mother less than I do?

511
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,930
Don't you know what she's like?

512
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,560
She really will donate

513
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,760
most of her fortune.

514
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,690
By then it'll be too late for tears.

515
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,280
But the problem is I can't think of a solution now.

516
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,210
I don't even want to think about it.

517
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,640
Whenever I think, I think of Wan Xinxin.

518
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,970
And thinking about her just irritates me.

519
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,120
When I was in America,

520
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,580
I learned several things.

521
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,560
One of those things is

522
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,960
never give up easily.

523
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,320
Most miracles come from fighting back when all seems lost.

524
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,050
As long as there's a glimmer of hope, you must try.

525
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,060
So what do you suggest?

526
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Go after her.

527
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,600
Suddenly appear in front of her.

528
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,170
Even if it doesn't move her,

529
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,290
she'll still feel your sincerity.

530
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,080
Where should I go?

531
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,020
I don't even know where she is.

532
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,160
For a girl who loves showing off like her,

533
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,920
you must know where she is.

534
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,800
Like a gentle breeze passing through my heart.

535
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,080
Melting away past affections.

536
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,080
That maple leaf.

537
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,520
Scattered from sight, taking memories away.

538
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,680
Fate brings strangers together.

539
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,160
Familiarity comes in an instant.

540
00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:01,120
Hearts flutter and linger as we fall in love.

541
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,280
I want it to stay this way.

542
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,410
Who's a Taiwan girl?

543
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
You don't even know what a Taiwan girl is.

544
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,200
Taiwan girl means a girl who loves to argue.

545
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,400
I just realized.

546
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,040
Your happiness

547
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,400
and mine

548
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,760
is right beside me.

549
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,240
I want to stay like this,

550
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,840
accompanying you in your world forever.

551
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,280
It feels a little.

552
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,960
If love no longer has hardships,

553
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,640
if one day, you're there, I'm there

554
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,280
in each other's hearts.

555
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,600
Love never changes.

556
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Antarctica.

557
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,680
Then how am I supposed to chase her?

558
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,980
If I were you, I'd chase her to the moon if necessary.

559
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,320
If a man doesn't have this kind of drive,

560
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,610
he won't accomplish anything in life.

561
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,680
Don't be angry.

562
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,920
You're the one who brings out the wolf in me.

563
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,760
Tell me, if I didn't have you,

564
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
what would I do?

565
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,840
Since I've decided to come back this time,

566
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
I will never leave you again.

567
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,720
If you weren't in such a hurry to fight for your inheritance,

568
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,450
we could get married right now.

569
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,120
I know, I know.

570
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,360
But I can't be with you

571
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,810
and live off your money.

572
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,420
I need to take over all the family affairs

573
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,000
and make the company bigger and stronger.

574
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,960
I don't want our married life

575
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,130
to be about working long hours just to make ends meet.

576
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,100
Let's not talk about this now.

577
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,920
Okay, I understand.

578
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,290
Antarctica, right?

579
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,760
Antarctica? I'm just kidding.

580
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,280
Go back to her place

581
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,690
and you'll definitely find clues about where they went.

582
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,880
I'll go right now.

583
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,440
I love Taiwan girls, Taiwan girls love me.

584
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,040
I'm not afraid of Hou Peicen even if she's right in front of me.

585
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,160
I'm off-key.

586
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,160
Let me tell you.

587
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,880
Being with you has corrupted me.

588
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,480
I've even learned how to lie.

589
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,020
Wait, how did you learn to lie from me?

590
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,160
You're the one who lied on social media about going to Antarctica.

591
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,800
We haven't even left the southern suburbs yet.

592
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,400
If I didn't post about going to Antarctica,

593
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,860
could we have gotten away?

594
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,520
They would definitely be on our tail.

595
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,720
This trick of yours should be quite effective.

596
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,400
Of course.

597
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,320
Otherwise my ex would have caught up with us by now.

598
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,480
Who's your ex?

599
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,080
Qin Gang.

600
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,360
We really are from two different worlds, two different planets.

601
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,880
Even if you're from Pandora,

602
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,120
you'll have to cross back over to me, I'm telling you.

603
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,600
We need to synchronize to the same planet now,

604
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,440
the same world.

605
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,100
And tonight we'll have to sleep in the same tent.

606
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,570
Isn't that taking things a bit far?

607
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,920
Go big or go home.

608
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,400
I love Taiwan girls, Taiwan girls love me.

609
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,720
I'm really regretting getting in this car.

610
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,840
Lin Zhiling...

611
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,780
Min D·28212

612
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,930
Can you please drive properly?

613
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,080
How's that?

614
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,720
There are so many beautiful places,

615
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,090
why do we have to come back here?

616
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,840
Isn't this nice?

617
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,240
The air is so fresh and beautiful.

618
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,560
Ever since you brought me here last time,

619
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,290
I can't stop thinking about it.

620
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,360
Can I ask you something?

621
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,480
Let's not set up tents this time.

622
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,840
This farmhouse has all kinds of rooms available.

623
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,720
You old fossil!

624
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,120
We young people nowadays

625
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,780
don't go for that fancy stuff.

626
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,280
We're into the camping style.

627
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,280
Style?

628
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,360
Fine, style, style.

629
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,440
Style.

630
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,120
You're so lame.

631
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,920
What's wrong? Afraid I'll sell you to a village of widows?

632
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,640
Before you can sell me to a widow village,

633
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,640
I'll sell you to a bachelor village.

634
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,180
Oh right, I forgot.

635
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,980
I'm a bachelor myself now.

636
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,840
I'm so scared.

637
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,400
Don't forget,

638
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,960
you're my husband in name now.

639
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,800
Get in.

640
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,760
Let me tell you,

641
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm having an important guest in a few days.

642
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,840
Very important.

643
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,480
Good. Send me the pictures right away.

644
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
I'll be waiting.

645
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,360
Jiang Kaiyang.

646
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,290
Where's Jiang Kaiyang?

647
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,520
Jiang Kaiyang.

648
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,929
I need you to do something for me right now.

649
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,080
This is too heavy.

650
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,210
How can you be so shameless?

651
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,840
Don't just sit there. Come help move these things.

652
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,480
It's your place, you're in charge.

653
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,340
I'll just watch your decisions from the sidelines.

654
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,520
You should do more work.

655
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,360
Fine. So you're not going to help move things?

656
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,800
Then you'll sleep on the floor tonight.

657
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,920
Floor it is then.

658
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,360
I'm a grown man, what do I have to fear?

659
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,560
I can sleep anywhere.

660
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,360
You said it.

661
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,850
I'm fine with it too.

662
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,240
I can sleep on the floor as well.

663
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,500
But you'll have to hold me while we sleep.

664
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,840
I don't think that's necessary.

665
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,520
Am I that scary?

666
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,640
I'll move it! I'll move it!

667
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,160
Hurry up.

668
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,360
I'm going, I'm going.

669
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Hurry up!

670
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,840
Come on!

671
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,240
Wan Xinxin!

672
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,400
Wan Xinxin!

673
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,000
What are you standing there for?

674
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,720
No,

675
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,090
come in quickly.

676
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,520
Don't you think it's inappropriate for me to go in?

677
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,560
We're not stealing or robbing anything. What are you afraid of?

678
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,420
I just want to see what Wan Xinxin is actually doing.

679
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,760
We can't miss any details.

680
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,040
Hurry!

681
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,360
Wan Xinxin.

682
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,920
Why are you just standing there? Hurry up and look.

683
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,720
You're sitting here

684
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,920
while your bride is working over there.

685
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,080
Stop with the bride and groom talk. This is a fake honeymoon.

686
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
It's fake,

687
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,300
so we can call each other whatever we want. There's no one else around.

688
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,040
What are you doing?

689
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,970
Checking it out.

690
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Checking what?

691
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,680
The tent.

692
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,360
What did you think?

693
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,960
I was talking about the tent too.

694
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,420
Your mind is in the gutter.

695
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,600
Your mind is so pure.

696
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,640
It's getting late. We should go to our separate rooms.

697
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,300
I'm taking the king-size bed.

698
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,040
Want to share?

699
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,700
I'm just kidding. Why are you so nervous?

700
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,450
Listen, don't come knocking on a single man's door at night.

701
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,680
You think I'm a widow?

702
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,680
Old bacon.

703
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,280
Are you asleep?

704
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,520
Yes.

705
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,970
If you're asleep, why are you talking?

706
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Old bacon.

707
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,640
What is it?

708
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,860
Let's sleep together. I'm a bit cold.

709
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,640
What are you talking about? How could we sleep together?

710
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,080
No, I mean we could

711
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,160
share one tent with two sleeping bags.

712
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,720
That's still not appropriate. There's a difference.

713
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,120
What's the difference?

714
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,160
How is there no difference? Right now we're under separate roofs.

715
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,680
If you sleep in this tent, it would be like sharing a room.

716
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,280
Right now, we're neighbors.

717
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,240
Neighbor Hua.

718
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,520
Neighbor Old Man Hua, that's me.

719
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,040
If you really need anything,

720
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,370
Old Man Hua is right next door. Good night.

721
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,220
Nobody's here.

722
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,850
Everyone's asleep.

723
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,360
Open the door.

724
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,000
Good night.

725
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,160
Aren't you cold?

726
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,800
Like a gentle breeze passing through my heart,

727
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,600
melting away past attachments,

728
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,240
that maple leaf.

729
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,120
Hey, old man,

730
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,780
why don't you come help me?

731
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
Do your own things yourself.

732
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,730
Your place, your rules.

733
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,520
You have to provide food and shelter.

734
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,120
I'm telling you, I want braised fish for lunch.

735
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,120
Fine.

736
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,480
You're tough.

737
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,370
When I catch the fish later, don't you dare eat it.

738
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,840
Got one! Quick!

739
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,080
Help me!

740
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,840
Come help!

741
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,840
You've got a bite! Pull hard!

742
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,920
Just reel it in!

743
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,900
Exercise your ability to do things independently.

744
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,160
Aren't you afraid I'll fall into the river?

745
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,920
If you fall in, leave the fishing rod behind.

746
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,380
I'll use it to fish you out.

747
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Fine, fine. Don't help then.

748
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
Alright, alright.

749
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,960
If one day, you're there, I'm there,

750
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,400
in each other's hearts.

751
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,120
Keep going!

752
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,840
Love never changes.
