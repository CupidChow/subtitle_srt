1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,720
As long as Xiaobao is fine,

3
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,410
I'm okay with anything.

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,360
Yes, that's definitely right.

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,880
Look, the situation is like this now.

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,520
In the future, this child will

7
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,580
be taken care of by his sister, right?

8
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,039
Well, it's like this.

9
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:53,920
No matter when you

10
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,000
or your mother want to see the child in the future,

11
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,690
just let us know in advance.

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,850
After you tell us in advance, we can

13
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,120
create time and opportunity for you.

14
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,440
That works.

15
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,800
As long as my mother can fulfill her wish,

16
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,410
I'll do whatever you ask. That's fine.

17
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Sounds good now.

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,960
Come on, let's go inside.

19
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,960
Time to sleep.

20
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Well then,

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,040
I'll be straightforward.

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,800
Is there anything

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200
you two need my help with?

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
I actually

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,520
don't know how to tell you right now.

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,600
It's nothing.

27
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,780
You've already helped me so much.

28
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,960
If I don't do something in return,

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,640
I'd feel uncomfortable about it.

30
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
Alright, I'll just say it directly.

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,600
Go ahead.

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,280
Actually, there is something

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,200
I'd like to discuss with you.

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,480
Look, it's like this.

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,000
Recently our work unit went through restructuring.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,760
But as a senior Party member and veteran cadre,

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,920
I needed to take the lead, right?

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,520
So I

39
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,160
voluntarily stepped down.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,770
After retiring, I wanted to

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,200
travel around with my wife.

42
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,720
But that's impossible now,

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,120
because she has already decided

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,050
to help you take care of this child.

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,600
You see, it's become a situation where

46
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,079
she helps you with the child,

47
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,720
and I'm left at home with nothing to do.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,240
I'm not the type who can stay idle, you know.

49
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,360
I've been working for most of my life, right?

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,720
But once I'm idle...

51
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,680
I understand.

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,240
Director Jiang, you mean you want

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,840
to work at my company, right?

54
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,180
Yes, that's right.

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,480
I'm afraid our company might be too small

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,520
to accommodate someone of your caliber.

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Your company isn't small at all.

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,480
I've done my research.

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,079
Your automotive industry

60
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,040
is one of our country's

61
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,010
economic hotspots, right?

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,440
I really want to

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
learn and improve myself.

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,160
Besides,

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,680
I have work management experience, right?

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,520
I can contribute my remaining energy at your company.

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,200
Alright, I'll think about it.

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,440
I'll make arrangements at the company tomorrow.

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,760
That's great, Director Qin!

70
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,839
Just one request - please don't give me any special treatment.

71
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,399
I won't.

72
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
I can't go on.

73
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,840
We've made it through a day and night. Just walk a bit more.

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
I need more.

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,690
There's only this little left.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,730
You drink it.

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Aren't you drinking?

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,900
You have it.

79
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,000
Then I'll drink it.

80
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,320
It's gone.

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,760
What do we do now?

82
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,820
Give me the bottle.

83
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,200
No, how much further?

84
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,800
Look at you, wanting to take a taxi.

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,880
Neither of us has a wallet.

86
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,740
You don't want the taxi driver to think we're crazy.

87
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,280
I can't go on. I really can't walk anymore.

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,580
If you want to go, go ahead.

89
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,080
Wan Xinxin.

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,680
Let me be honest with you.

91
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,409
I actually admire you. Really.

92
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,680
You have incredibly strong willpower.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,520
Look back.

94
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,480
Turn around. Look back.

95
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Look over there.

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
Look back at the path you've walked.

97
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,280
The path you've traveled for a day and night.

98
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Do you still think that's a big deal?

99
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,010
When we were on that log bridge,

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
I rushed across quickly.

101
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,970
I left you there.

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
You were scared, weren't you?

103
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,460
But you still made it across, crying and screaming.

104
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,560
What's the big deal?

105
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,840
After crossing it, did you still think it was difficult?

106
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,520
I left you alone

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
in that dark cave.

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,440
So dark you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,400
You must have been terrified, right?

110
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,440
Screaming like a stuck pig, weren't you?

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,840
But you still ran out with your eyes closed.

112
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,280
Xinxin, honestly,

113
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,080
when you've gone through all

114
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,160
these difficulties,

115
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,200
look back at what you've overcome.

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,050
None of it is a big deal. You can get through it all.

117
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,130
Let's go.

118
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,540
I really can't compare to you.

119
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,600
You're all muscle.

120
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,170
I really can't match your stamina.

121
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,980
I'm hungry and exhausted now.

122
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,880
I really can't walk anymore.

123
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,680
Let me ask you another question.

124
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,159
Do you miss your baby?

125
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,880
I do.

126
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,800
Liu Chang's car is waiting ahead.

127
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,600
This pickup system for my training

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,360
has all the locations pre-arranged.

129
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,240
It's up to you whether to come or not. I'm going ahead.

130
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,280
Really?

131
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,600
Are you serious?

132
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
Hey, wait for me!

133
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,360
What are you trying to do?

134
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
I want to buy a couple of apples.

135
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll steam them for the child when he wakes up.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't have time.

137
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,620
What are you busy with?

138
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,180
I need to go to work.

139
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,600
So you're really going to work for Qin Gang?

140
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,960
Don't you feel guilty taking his money?

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,130
What's wrong with that?

142
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,840
Xu Chunli, you have long hair but short vision.

143
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,400
I'm just protecting my nephew's inheritance.

144
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,740
Think about it.

145
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,200
You're leaving now?

146
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,960
Well...

147
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,360
Um... uh...

148
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,000
No, they're playing tricks on me again.

149
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,440
All night long,

150
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,040
where have Wan Xinxin and that guy gone?

151
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,720
Have we reached the top of the mountain?

152
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,170
How is it?

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,180
Not as scary as yesterday, right?

154
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
It's really beautiful here.

155
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,080
So you see,

156
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,520
as long as you're willing to move forward and climb up,

157
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,720
what awaits you ahead

158
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,840
might be challenges or beautiful scenery.

159
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,559
Yes, maybe it's difficult.

160
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,640
Yes, maybe it's difficult,

161
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,300
but for this possibility,

162
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
for a different outcome,

163
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,900
it's worth our effort,

164
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,690
worth trying, don't you think?

165
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,040
Old bacon,

166
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,890
I know you're doing all this

167
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,400
just to make me stay.

168
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,360
I'm not doing all this

169
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,400
to make you stay.

170
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,400
I just want you to know

171
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,200
that as long as we strive to move forward and climb upward,

172
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
what awaits us ahead

173
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,320
might be beautiful scenery or something wonderful.

174
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,440
But I'm still afraid

175
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,040
they'll take my precious brother away from me.

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,450
Wan Xinxin, listen carefully.

177
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,240
If you hold your loved one in your arms,

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,480
hold them gently and keep them in your heart,

179
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,680
no one can take them away.

180
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,450
Have you noticed this tree?

181
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,320
What kind of tree is this?

182
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
This is a wishing tree.

183
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,040
It's very powerful around here.

184
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,900
Many people have left their beautiful wishes on it.

185
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,200
This yellow ribbon

186
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,380
represents a beautiful wish.

187
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,800
I have hope again.

188
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Back to business.

189
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,080
Your position has been arranged.

190
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,080
You can take up the role at our company

191
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,680
as Deputy Director of Sales.

192
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Deputy Director.

193
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,160
The main thing is to let you get familiar with the business first,

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,480
and we'll make other arrangements after you're comfortable.

195
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,760
As for the compensation,

196
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,220
it will be the same as the General Manager's.

197
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
That's good.

198
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,200
So...

199
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,960
Mr. Jiang.

200
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,600
About my mother looking after the child...

201
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,080
Mr. Qin, don't worry about that.

202
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,080
You see...

203
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
Wan Xinxin is too busy with work,

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,860
so my wife is the one mainly taking care of the child.

205
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,520
Look, if your mother wants to see the child,

206
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,720
she can do so anytime.

207
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes, but my mother doesn't know

208
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,380
about our divorce yet.

209
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,780
Don't worry. It's confidential.

210
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,640
But you can't keep a secret forever.

211
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,880
You see, my mother has high blood pressure.

212
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
I'm afraid if she gets upset,

213
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
it could trigger a serious episode.

214
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,200
She doesn't know

215
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,400
that the divorce was because of me.

216
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:11,920
No, no.

217
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,240
Mr. Qin, how can you say that?

218
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,500
This isn't your fault.

219
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,960
It's quite obvious.

220
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,520
I know Wan Xinxin quite well.

221
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,300
Her temperament is terrible.

222
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,840
Anyone who marries her would suffer.

223
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
I never expected, truly, Mr. Qin,

224
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,720
that your marriage with her could last this long.

225
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
What does that prove?

226
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,160
It proves you're generous and tolerant.

227
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,280
You...

228
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,320
Right?

229
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,760
Mr. Jiang, you're too good with words.

230
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,810
No, it's just the truth.

231
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,400
Well, Mr. Qin, rest assured,

232
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,080
leave this matter to me.

233
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,770
I'll definitely handle it.

234
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,120
I believe your mother

235
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,680
will trust what I say.

236
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,040
Good.

237
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,480
With your help, this will be much easier.

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,840
So, Mr. Qin, when should I start?

239
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,080
Anytime.

240
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,840
These are already printed.

241
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
I'll go prepare right away.

242
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,480
As soon as possible. Thanks.

243
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,440
Thank you.

244
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,680
What's wrong?

245
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,400
Should I really stay here?

246
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
If you have doubts...

247
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,360
Fine. I'll take you back to the campsite.

248
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,000
If you can find your way out of the forest by yourself,

249
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,360
I'll let you leave whenever you want.

250
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,280
What do you mean by 'you'll let me'?

251
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Whether I stay or go

252
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,680
isn't up to you to decide.

253
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,980
But you're right about one thing.

254
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,520
When facing difficulties, never look down,

255
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,120
because I have a double chin.

256
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,180
Now that's the girl I know,

257
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,880
the indestructible, unstoppable, unbreakable

258
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,210
demon queen Wan Xinxin.

259
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:14,880
What?

260
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,400
Sis.

261
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,480
Sis.

262
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,240
Xinxin.

263
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,840
Sis, where's Bao?

264
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,380
Keep it down. He just fell asleep.

265
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,880
You're finally back.

266
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,210
You had me worried sick.

267
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,080
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,520
Sis.

269
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,920
What?

270
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

271
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,300
You've been watching too many TV dramas.

272
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
I was just worried about you.

273
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,240
You didn't answer your phone all night.

274
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,570
I couldn't sleep at all.

275
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,850
Okay. Thanks for your concern.

276
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,080
I'll go check on the baby.

277
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,540
Go ahead. He's in the room.

278
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,720
Sis, how about this?

279
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,680
If you're tired, you can go home first.

280
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,880
I can watch the child.

281
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,160
I've always been taking care of the child.

282
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,490
I have experience. Nothing will go wrong.

283
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,290
That's fine.

284
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,400
I need to go home and cook for my husband.

285
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,960
Then tell Xinxin about it.

286
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,730
Okay. Take care.

287
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,730
Sis, be careful on your way.

288
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,800
Babe.

289
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,540
You're having quite a good time here.

290
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,640
No. Why did you come back?

291
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
Why can't I come back?

292
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,260
Wan Xinxin is back, why can't I be?

293
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,040
Didn't I tell you

294
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,960
that your most important task right now

295
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,360
is to help Wan Xinxin take care of the child?

296
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,760
And wait until Qin Gang's mother returns.

297
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,000
Why are you running back here for no reason?

298
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,130
It's a waste of time.

299
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,280
I think you've lost your mind.

300
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,480
The child has his mother and now a nanny too.

301
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,940
Why shouldn't I come back?

302
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,020
They hired a nanny?

303
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,840
A male nanny, actually.

304
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,700
In his forties.

305
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,840
He's Xinxin's neighbor.

306
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,020
He's helped her a lot before. He's a nice person.

307
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Xinxin went out with him yesterday.

308
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,050
This is going to cause trouble.

309
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,000
You're being such a clueless sister.

310
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,120
Go there quickly.

311
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,640
What's wrong? What happened?

312
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,520
What do you mean what's wrong?

313
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,920
A man and a single young widow

314
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,780
fooling around. How could that not lead to trouble?

315
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,440
They're both getting on in years. What could possibly happen?

316
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,700
Hurry up. In a few days,

317
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,319
Qin Gang's son will be calling him dad. You believe it or not?

318
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,440
Go quickly.

319
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,970
No, it's you.

320
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,040
What are you doing? Sneaking around in broad daylight.

321
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,770
I thought we were being robbed.

322
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,720
Hey, why are you coming in with a pot and yelling?

323
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,680
You're so jumpy.

324
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,250
I'm just helping you pack your things.

325
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
Wait, why are you moving my stuff here?

326
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,560
Didn't Xu Ke sell his house?

327
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,980
They need to clear out.

328
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,320
Yes.

329
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
My baby and I

330
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,860
will have to live as homeless wanderers from now on.

331
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,320
Someone as beautiful as me,

332
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,000
with public safety being so poor these days,

333
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,130
what if I run into someone who wants to rob and assault me?

334
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,080
Can you stop playing the victim?

335
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,680
I've raised Ruirui by myself, so I know

336
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,200
raising a child isn't easy.

337
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,130
It's not easy for you to raise your baby alone either.

338
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,160
So, you can stay in this home for now.

339
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,840
That doesn't seem appropriate.

340
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,660
A single man and woman living under the same roof...

341
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,450
What if you can't control yourself late at night?

342
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,280
Could you stop being so full of yourself?

343
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,940
I'm not staying here. I'll stay at Xu Ke's place.

344
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,560
You're not staying here?

345
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,000
Let me set some ground rules with you.

346
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,960
First, don't touch any of my things.

347
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:15,880
Second.

348
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,760
Don't touch my books.

349
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,000
Third.

350
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,890
Stay away from my books.

351
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,860
Mister.

352
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,640
I've noticed when you're being serious,

353
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,080
you're really charming.

354
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,170
Just like my dad.

355
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,640
Get lost.

356
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,960
If you were about ten years younger,

357
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,490
I might have fallen for you.

358
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,520
Can you stop fooling around and pack up?

359
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,170
Hello, the number you have dialed is powered off.

360
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,040
Is this St. Church?

361
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,850
I'd like to speak with Ms. Chen.

362
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,080
Yes, I'm her son.

363
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,240
What?

364
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,640
She's already left the hospital.

365
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,610
Okay, thank you.

366
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,440
What's wrong? Why are you so flustered?

367
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,260
Come with me to my place. My mom has been discharged.

368
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,760
She's probably on the plane right now.

369
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,920
If that's the case,

370
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,250
she'll probably arrive tomorrow.

371
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,200
That's so sudden.

372
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,400
Go to my place now

373
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
and pack up your things.

374
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,040
When do you plan to tell your mom?

375
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,080
Not yet.

376
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,200
Hey.

377
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,240
Hey there.

378
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,520
You know what?

379
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,840
Despite how you usually are

380
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,170
so slow and indecisive,

381
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
you're actually pretty good at packing when you put your mind to it.

382
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,320
Of course.

383
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,380
I cleaned up nicely, didn't I?

384
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,200
So, are you hungry?

385
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,800
Since we're moving into a new place,

386
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,360
let's get some late-night snacks to celebrate.

387
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,880
Yay!

388
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,520
Bye-bye.

389
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,450
Bye-bye.

390
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,320
They've left.

391
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,170
Bye-bye.

392
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,200
Okay, let's take a nap.

393
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,440
How about we try out your new bed?

394
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,320
Okay, let go.

395
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,360
So about this matter,

396
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,160
you must listen to me, okay?

397
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,120
Yes, I'll definitely listen to you.

398
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,640
You are...

399
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,160
There's absolutely no problem with that.

400
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,760
Sometimes you are...

401
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,040
you are right,

402
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,400
sis.

403
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,380
Why are you back again?

404
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,650
I... well...

405
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes, I'm back, I...

406
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Comrade Huaming.

407
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,600
Yes, I'm Huaming. This is...

408
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,660
This is my husband.

409
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,360
Hello.

410
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,020
You're here to see Xinxin, right?

411
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,970
Xinxin is upstairs, in my home.

412
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
In your home?

413
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,650
Why is she at your place?

414
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,440
She can't stay at Xu Ke's place anymore.

415
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,160
So Xinxin moved to my place.

416
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,960
Of course, I'm not living with her.

417
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,800
I'm just helping her look after the child.

418
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,560
You're taking care of the child?

419
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,080
This...

420
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,760
Yes.

421
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,520
Her child is too young to be left alone.

422
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,480
So I'm helping to watch over the child.

423
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,280
That doesn't seem appropriate.

424
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,640
This isn't right.

425
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
Comrade Huaming.

426
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,240
Look, we are Wan Xinxin's sister and brother-in-law.

427
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,640
Right.

428
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,360
Correct?

429
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,560
We're very grateful for your previous

430
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,160
care for Xinxin.

431
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,840
And for taking care of the child.

432
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,680
However, from today, we've decided

433
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,280
to take care of the child ourselves.

434
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,800
Yes.

435
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,280
Xinxin actually told me already.

436
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,760
She said your family conditions are quite good.

437
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,400
But you seem to lack time.

438
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,200
You don't have time to take care of the child.

439
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,000
No, that's...

440
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,040
What do you mean we don't have time?

441
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,880
No, the child is...

442
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,320
Does it make sense? Listen to me.

443
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,380
Even if we're busy,

444
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,040
we're still family after all.

445
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,640
Right.

446
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,120
How could we possibly let

447
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
strangers take care of our own family's child?

448
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:29,970
Exactly.

449
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,320
Right?

450
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,480
Yes, what I'm saying is...

451
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,040
The child is too young to be left alone.

452
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,720
So I...

453
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Comrade Xiao Hua.

454
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,840
I heard that last night you went out

455
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,640
all night. What were you doing?

456
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,040
Yes, what were you doing?

457
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,440
We just went for an outing. Nothing special.

458
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,120
Well, Comrade Xiao Hua,

459
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,650
let me be straightforward.

460
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,930
Please go ahead.

461
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,520
Look, it's like this.

462
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,000
Xinxin...

463
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,000
She just got divorced and has a child.

464
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,960
She is a woman.

465
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,000
Yes.

466
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,840
She's still young.

467
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,320
Yes.

468
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,560
She needs someone to rely on in the future.

469
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:08,880
Right.

470
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,120
Don't you agree? She needs to move forward with her life.

471
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,440
Looking at your age...

472
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,160
I...

473
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
No, no. I didn't mean anything by it.

474
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,880
Look at you two all the time,

475
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,160
coming and going like this.

476
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,420
If there's no outcome,

477
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,760
it will hold back her future.

478
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,600
Do you understand what I'm saying? Can you comprehend?

479
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,920
Right. We don't mean anything else.

480
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,320
We're just thinking about Xinxin's best interests.

481
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,840
I understand, sister, brother.

482
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,480
I completely understand what you're saying.

483
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,000
As you mentioned, I'm 40.

484
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm 10 years older than Xinxin.

485
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,840
I'm an adult.

486
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,280
I know my boundaries.

487
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm just helping Xinxin take care of her child,

488
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,440
nothing more.

489
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,280
Well then, you should go upstairs and check on Xinxin.

490
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,760
That's good.

491
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
So what you just said,

492
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,240
that was truly from your heart?

493
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,600
From my heart, absolutely.

494
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,260
That's good then. So we'll...

495
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
We'll head upstairs now.

496
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,280
We... Good.

497
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,280
Sixth floor.

498
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,040
Coming!

499
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,800
Sweetie!

500
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,560
Sis, brother-in-law, what brings you here?

501
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,360
Xinxin,

502
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,240
so you're living here now?

503
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,240
Yes.

504
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,520
Huaming let me stay here. He's really nice.

505
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,020
I'll introduce him when he gets back.

506
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Your brother-in-law and I came to tell you something.

507
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,080
In the past, we

508
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,640
have done many things that wronged you.

509
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
Your brother-in-law has been feeling very guilty.

510
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,170
We've discussed it.

511
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,040
From now on, I'll take care of little Bao

512
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,720
so we won't have to trouble others.

513
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,960
No, it's fine.

514
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,120
Isn't it?

515
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,080
I understand why you're here.

516
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,840
Little one.

517
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,000
Sweetie.

518
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,410
Why don't you stay for dinner then?

519
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,220
No need to trouble you.

520
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,280
Hey, Xinxin.

521
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,120
Hey there.

522
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,720
My sister and brother-in-law came over for dinner

523
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,760
to your place.

524
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,490
Could you buy some extra food on your way back?

525
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,610
I have something urgent. I can't make it back.

526
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,570
There's food in the fridge. Help yourselves.

527
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,000
Hello?

528
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,560
You suddenly have something to do?

529
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,610
What could be so important?

530
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,880
Look, Xinxin

531
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,840
is recently divorced with a child.

532
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,760
She's a woman.

533
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,000
You two are always going back and forth like this.

534
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,260
If there's no outcome,

535
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,680
it will waste her future.

536
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,120
Right.

537
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,780
Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you get it?

538

541
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,220
Finally back home.

542
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,480
Xinxin!

543
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,080
Xinxin! Mom's home!

544
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,520
Xinxin! Mommy's back!

545
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,240
And my grandson! Come down!

546
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,840
Mom, she's not here.

547
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,530
Where did she go?

548
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,570
Enjoy your meal.

549
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,600
Thank you.

550
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,680
Mom.

551
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,480
You must be tired from your trip.

552
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,140
Why don't you rest for a while?

553
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Wait.

554
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,800
Xiaogang.

555
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,760
You've been hesitant the whole drive here.

556
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,440
I have a feeling...

557
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,060
You're hiding something.

558
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,000
Tell me. What is it?

559
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,540
Mom, I'll go prepare your bath water.

560
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,760
Wait.

561
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,240
Since you were little, whenever something happens,

562
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,040
you always hesitate to speak up.

563
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,540
I know you too well.

564
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,890
Don't keep me in suspense. Just tell me

565
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,520
what's going on.

566
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,320
It's nothing.

567
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
Did you have a fight with Xinxin?

568
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:09,680
No.

569
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,020
It's a bit more serious than that.

570
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,440
How serious could it be?

571
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,920
At worst,

572
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,650
you'd get divorced.

573
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,380
We did divorce.

574
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
You got divorced?

575
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,680
Yes.

576
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,760
Mom, your medicine is in the bag, right?

577
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,240
It's fine.

578
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,560
I'll get it myself.

579
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,280
Here, drink some water.

580
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,960
Xiaogang.

581
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,560
Tell me quickly what happened.

582
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,600
What did you do to Xinxin?

583
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,560
I didn't do anything. It's not my fault.

584
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,820
Then whose fault is it?

585
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,520
Wan Xinxin cheated on me.

586
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,440
Baby.

587
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,200
You're awake.

588
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Mommy will get you something to eat.

589
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,660
Strange uncle.

590
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,520
You scared me to death.

591
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,680
Oh my goodness! Why is it you?

592
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,200
Why can't it be me?

593
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,280
Well, um...

594
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,620
The older guy didn't come.

595
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,480
I didn't have time before.

596
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920
So I asked someone else for help.

597
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,160
Now I've made time.

598
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,000
They've already lent you the house.

599
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,720
How can you still have the nerve to trouble them again?

600
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,850
But he promised me he would come today.

601
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,320
Mom!

602
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:42,920
Mom!

603
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
Mom, please stop.

604
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,440
Come with me.

605
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,680
Mom, we don't need to make a scene about this.

606
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,640
Let's go home and talk about it.

607
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,700
Listen carefully.

608
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,520
If Wan Xinxin is cheating on you,

609
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,980
I'll handle it for you.

610
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,560
But if you're lying to me,

611
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,480
you'll be in big trouble.

612
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,680
Call Wan Xinxin right now and tell her to come back to work.

613
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,010
You still want her back?

614
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,320
I will not.

615
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,000
Wan Xinxin.

616
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,580
Hello. Who would you like to speak to?

617
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,010
I'm looking for Wan Xinxin.

618
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,800
Where is she?

619
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,410
May I ask who's calling?

620
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,210
Why aren't you eating? What are you doing?

621
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,620
You look so distracted. Is my cooking poisonous or something?

622
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,360
No, it's just... that weird guy.

623
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,490
Why did he suddenly stop talking to me?

624
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,840
Hello, Mr. Shi.

625
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,450
You want me to come back to the company?

626
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,840
Okay.

627
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,580
Alright, I'll come back as soon as possible.

628
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,400
What are you doing? What's going on?

629
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,400
The she-devil called me.

630
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,680
She wants me to return to the office immediately.

631
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,560
She says there's something I must handle personally.

632
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,560
See? The company can't function without your sister.

633
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,400
Right.

634
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,600
The Earth would stop spinning without you.

635
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,000
Look at you being so important. Hurry up and eat.

636
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,730
Heaven always leaves a way out.

637
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,620
The universe wants me to rise from the ashes.

638
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,370
You're not eating anymore?

639
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,160
Sweetie, Daddy has to go work far away.

640
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,720
Daddy, please don't go.

641
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
I'll be good. Please don't leave.

642
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,560
I'll miss you.

643
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,400
Good morning.

644
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:22,929
Morning.

645
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,040
Xinxin.

646
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,719
Hello.

647
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,850
Why are you back?

648
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,639
Mr. Shi asked me to come back.

649
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,409
Where is Mr. Shi?

650
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,480
What's wrong?

651
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,540
What happened?

652
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,159
Mr. Shi, I'm back.

653
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,300
Wan Xinxin, you don't need to come to work today.

654
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,639
Mom?

655
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,199
No.

656
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,520
Mom, why are you here?

657
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,840
You shouldn't be calling me mom anymore, should you?

658
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,450
So you know everything.

659
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,740
Did you think you could hide something this big from me?

660
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,650
I wasn't trying to hide it from you.

661
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,890
I knew something was wrong.

662
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,240
Alright. Mr. Shi gave you time off.

663
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,940
Let's find a place to talk.

664
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,440
Please.

665
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,600
Thank you, Mr. Shi.

666
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,130
Goodbye.

667
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,610
I'm leaving.

668
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
You had an affair.

669
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,120
Ah.

670
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,940
If you hadn't cheated,

671
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,880
how could you have gotten divorced so quickly?

672
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,720
Did Qin Gang tell you that?

673
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,100
Since I'm sitting here today,

674
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,370
I know exactly what's going on.

675
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
I know my son well.

676
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,730
He didn't like studying in school,

677
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,120
and he doesn't like working as an adult.

678
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,410
These are his flaws.

679
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,650
But he also has two important virtues.

680
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,440
Filial piety and loyalty.

681
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,450
When he loves someone, he puts them on a pedestal.

682
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,320
He chose to marry you,

683
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,920
so he would never betray you.

684
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,800
I just want to hear one thing from you.

685
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,360
Auntie.

686
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,360
You've come all this way across the ocean to find me,

687
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,160
not just to criticize me, right?

688
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,120
As for why we got divorced,

689
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,760
you can ask your son.

690
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,640
You probably wouldn't believe me anyway,

691
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,040
and I'd just seem petty.

692
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
Qin Gang and I are already divorced.

693
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,360
It's all in the past.

694
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,960
Since you've come to see me today,

695
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,560
just say what you want to say.

696
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,240
Where is my grandson?

697
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,050
He's at home.

698
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,400
He's so young,

699
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,280
yet you leave him at home while you work.

700
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,500
How can you bear it?

701
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,040
I...

702
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,220
No need to explain.

703
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,530
Life is hard.

704
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,740
Of course you need to earn money for formula.

705
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,280
You don't need to say anything else.

706
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,720
The situation is clear.

707
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,520
You don't have the ability or the means

708
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,680
to give my grandson a happy life.

709
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,560
Therefore, you have to give him to me.

710
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,330
Name your terms.

711
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,400
Will you agree to any condition I set?

712
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,780
Whatever you want.

713
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,260
Then please don't come looking for me again.

714
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,480
From the moment my baby was born,

715
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,280
I told myself

716
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,860
that he belongs only to me,

717
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
and I won't let anyone take him away.

718
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,600
Auntie, you just got off the plane.

719
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,040
Please get some rest.

720
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,200
I have things to do. I'm leaving now.

721
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,260
Goodbye, Mrs. Qin.

722
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,880
Wait a moment.

723
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,700
You're quite impressive.

724
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,320
Fine, let's not talk about this matter today.

725
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,090
But I should have the right to see my grandson.

726
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:36,890
This way.

727
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,570
So you live in a place like this.

728
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,800
To be honest, yes.

729
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,090
And this apartment isn't even mine. It's rented.

730
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,930
Where did you find a postpartum nanny?

731
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I didn't hire one.

732
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,530
My family is taking care of him.

733
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,040
What are you doing here?

734
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,640
Hello.

735
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,540
This is my home.

736
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,040
Your sister had to go out.

737
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,800
She asked me to look after the baby.

738
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,930
He just fell asleep.

739
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,600
This is...

740
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,130
Seems I was right about you.

741
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,370
So this is what you meant by 'your family.'

742
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
No, ma'am.

743
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,160
Where is my grandson?

744
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
Who is this? She's so intimidating.

745
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,120
Qin Gang's mother. Mrs. Qin.

746
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,680
We're doomed.

747
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,480
No, why did you

748
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,160
choose this moment to show up?

749
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,420
The baby is right here.

750
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,640
I just came to bring some things for your baby.

751
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,840
Your sister said she had something to do and asked me to watch the child.

752
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,880
So here I am.

753
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,480
I really can't explain this situation now.

754
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:58,840
You.

755
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,210
The food is ready. Are you going to serve it or not?

756
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,880
This is my grandson.

757
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,490
Sweetheart.

758
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,120
I finally get to see you.

759
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,320
Grandma is here to take you.

760
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,560
We'll go live in a big house.

761
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,880
Ma'am.

762
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,090
What are you talking about?

763
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,580
Who is this?

764
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,160
He...

765
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,920
He's my uncle.

766
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,800
Ma'am, don't listen to her nonsense.

767
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
I'm not her uncle.

768
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,600
My name is Hua Ming.

769
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,280
You can call me Xiao Huazi.

770
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,440
Or you can call me Xiao Dengzi.

771
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,700
I'm just here to serve her and her mother.

772
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Xiao Dengzi.

773
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,000
Do you think living here is good enough?

774
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,140
Yes, it's quite nice here.

775
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,040
So it's just the two of you taking care of the baby?

776
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,770
No, he...

777
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,120
No, my sister usually takes care of him.

778
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Today she couldn't.

779
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,360
I don't know what happened.

780
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,090
He just came here temporarily.

781
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,520
I've been through it all. Nothing escapes me.

782
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,360
Temporarily?

783
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,560
How could he possibly be here temporarily?

784
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,360
If he were just visiting,

785
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,220
he wouldn't be so familiar with this home, would he?

786
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,400
Yes, I'm living in his apartment.

787
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,440
So you're living together with him after all.

788
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,600
No, please let me explain.

789
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,600
We are just...

790
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,520
Xinxin...

791
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,220
You don't need to explain anything to me.

792
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,200
I don't care about your personal affairs.

793
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,440
But there's one thing I must make clear.

794
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,200
My grandson absolutely cannot

795
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
live in this kind of environment.

796
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,890
The conditions here are inadequate in every way.

797
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,300
You are his mother.

798
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,520
You keep saying you love him.

799
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,660
If you love him, you should give him everything.

800
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,280
If you give him to me, he can have everything.

801
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,520
I... give him to you?

802
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,520
Wait, is he lacking food or clothes?

803
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,050
Can you feed him?

804
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,080
Won't I still be the one feeding him?

805
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,200
What he needs most right now

806
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,560
is me, his mother.

807
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,930
If you give him to me,

808
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,690
you'll still be his mother.

809
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,720
Yaping.

810
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,440
Jiang Qiaohua.
