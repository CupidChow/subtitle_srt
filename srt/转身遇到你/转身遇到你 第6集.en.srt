1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration.

2
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,600
Wait, you had the child examined?

3
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,479
What's wrong with you?

4
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,280
Who told you to have the child examined?

5
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,080
Look, if you're angry, take it out on me.

6
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,440
If anything happens to the child,

7
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,640
I won't let this go, Huaming.

8
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:50,920
Stop arguing.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,979
Get out of here now.

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,080
Hello.

11
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm the child's mother.

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,320
How is my child doing now?

13
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,530
The child has viral encephalitis.

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,840
Fortunately, his father brought him in time.

15
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,440
Otherwise, something terrible could have happened.

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,100
The child is fine now, so don't be upset anymore.

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,620
It's okay, baby. Everything's fine now.

18
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,370
I'm quite busy right now

19
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,079
with surgeries and stuff.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,440
Okay.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
You can go ahead then.

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,320
Huaming.

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,680
Senior Chen Weiming.

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,890
I work at this hospital.

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,720
It's been three or four years.

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,650
Which hospital are you working at?

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,740
Why are you here today?

29
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,840
Accompanying a friend to see a doctor.

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,600
Senior, our phone numbers haven't changed.

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,360
I need to take care of something, so I'll go first.

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,720
Sure.

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,930
Let's keep in touch.

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,970
Oh my goodness! Thank heavens!

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,160
The child has been brought back.

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,890
Take it easy.

37
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,520
That man today

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,520
rushed in and took the child away.

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,980
I tried everything to stop him but couldn't.

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,610
I know what happened. It's not your fault.

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,720
Why would that man take the child?

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,130
The baby was sick. He took the baby to see a doctor.

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,720
Xiaomei, keep a close eye on him these days.

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,320
If there's anything unusual,

45
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,520
call me immediately.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,560
If you're unsure about anything,

47
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
you can also ask the uncle next door.

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,570
From what you're saying, that man is actually a good person.

49
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,420
Alright, I understand. Don't worry.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,200
Put him to bed then.

51
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,840
Did you have the child complete the examination?

52
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
What's going on with you?

53
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,160
Who told you to examine the child?

54
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,920
Leave now. Go!

55
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,240
Mr. Shi, everyone is here now.

56
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,640
Can we start the meeting?

57
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,140
Why isn't Wan Xinxin here?

58
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
This Wan Xinxin,

59
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,960
she's always so unreliable.

60
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,320
Wan Xinxin is not our employee yet.

61
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,360
In a way, she's our partner.

62
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
We have no right to talk about her like that.

63
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,730
Come on, let's first look at the client's requirements.

64
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
Hey, Lu Beibei.

65
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,080
No.

66
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Oh no! Why didn't my alarm go off?

67
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,560
Is the dragon lady there yet?

68
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,409
Can you cover for me?

69
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,850
I'll be right there.

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,880
Please, please cover for me.

71
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,850
Don't let the dragon lady find out.

72
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,770
Hello, this is Hua Ming.

73
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,420
I wanted to discuss with you about

74
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,880
the medical consultation website.

75
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,520
I can add ten more slots to my quota.

76
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,520
Yes.

77
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,420
Ten more slots on the weekend.

78
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
They can still be free of charge.

79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,660
No problem. It's more convenient for them this way.

80
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,330
Goodbye. Thank you.

81
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,340
Xiaomei, please comfort him.

82
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,160
Did you hear the alarm just now?

83
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,880
Yes, I did.

84
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,220
Then why didn't you wake me up?

85
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,640
I'm not a rooster.

86
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,540
The house is such a mess. Couldn't you clean up a bit?

87
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,640
Listen.

88
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
We had an agreement before.

89
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,060
I'm a nanny, not a housekeeper for the whole family.

90
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,159
Besides, you promised yesterday

91
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,600
to advance me 1,500 yuan.

92
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,930
I haven't seen any of it.

93
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,240
Didn't I tell you already?

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,040
I'll pay you after three days.

95
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,370
Right now it's a probation period, right?

96
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,800
I came to your home

97
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,360
haven't seen a penny for taking care of your child,

98
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,290
and now you want me to serve you too?

99
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,480
If you do a good job,

100
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,540
you'll get every cent of your salary.

101
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Baby, mommy's leaving now.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,860
Driver, Future Building, hurry!

103
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,320
Oh no!

104
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,180
Driver, go back to where we just were!

105
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,160
Why are you back, sis?

106
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,580
No. What are you doing?

107
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,450
He's crying so much.

108
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,140
Why aren't you taking care of him?

109
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,800
His diaper is wet. Go get a new one.

110
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,720
Okay.

111
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,970
Mommy will change your diaper.

112
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,280
The clothes fit you well.

113
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,880
I feel like I'm the nanny now.

114
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,200
And you're acting like the employer.

115
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
I'm paying you to work here.

116
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,780
Are we playing role reversal?

117
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,520
Listen.

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,880
Why are you getting so angry?

119
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,240
Even if I am a nanny,

120
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,600
I still have my dignity.

121
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,640
I suggest you be more polite.

122
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,920
Don't be so rude.

123
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
I'm being rude?

124
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,360
Did you ask permission to wear my clothes?

125
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,560
Who's being rude now?

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you want this job or not?

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I do want the job.

128
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,160
But first, pay me what you owe.

129
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,890
And apologize, then I'll work.

130
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,540
What are you thinking?

131
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,080
Me, apologize to you?

132
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,440
You won't do it?

133
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,800
Fine. I quit.

134
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,120
You're quitting?

135
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,120
You signed a contract, you know.

136
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,920
I came here to earn money, not to be insulted.

137
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,240
There's a shortage of nannies now.

138
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,280
Demand exceeds supply.

139
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,000
It's very easy to find another job.

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
With your conditions and attitude,

141
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
who would want to work for you?

142
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,720
No. With your behavior,

143
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,360
would anyone dare to hire you?

144
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,600
You did, didn't you?

145
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,930
Hand it over.

146
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,280
What?

147
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,280
The money.

148
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,160
My wages for these two days

149
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,560
according to labor law, you laid me off,

150
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,760
it wasn't me who quit,

151
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
you need to pay me double.

152
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,770
You dare talk to me about labor law?

153
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,560
Let me tell you,

154
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,440
I'm being nice by not calling the police on you.

155
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,520
What did you say?

156
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,240
You're threatening to call the police?

157
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
I haven't even reported you for withholding migrant workers' wages.

158
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,360
You know what?

159
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,020
I'll post this on social media

160
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,720
and see who people condemn.

161
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,440
How can you be so unreasonable?

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey, what are you doing?

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,200
Put that down! Those are my clothes! Give them back!

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
Wait! What are you doing?

165
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,720
These two pieces of clothing will cover my wages.

166
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,250
Goodbye.

167
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,440
Come back here!

168
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,970
That's my limited edition!

169
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,520
Xiaomei, stop right there!

170
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,720
I mean you, not Xiaomei. You can't leave.

171
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,200
Fine, I'll give you my limited edition clothes.

172
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,800
Okay? Please go back and take care of the child.

173
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,760
No! What's wrong with you?

174
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,280
Let me tell you.

175
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,640
I've never begged anyone even when I was dating.

176
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm begging you, please.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,460
I'll pay you. I'll pay you.

178
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,160
Money isn't everything.

179
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,680
But having no one to take care of the child is absolutely impossible!

180
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,200
Yes, yes.

181
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,120
Definitely not acceptable.

182
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,640
Mister,

183
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,440
why aren't you at work today?

184
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,940
The pet hospital is closed for reorganization. I'm off for a few days.

185
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,440
So you're free now?

186
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,400
I was really wrong yesterday.

187
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
I was too impatient.

188
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,320
You need to understand me.

189
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,400
But as a mother, I'm telling you,

190
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,000
we're extremely sensitive.

191
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,040
I misunderstood you then. I'm sorry.

192
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,320
You don't need to say more.

193
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
I understand what you mean.

194
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,600
If you're not afraid I'll

195
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
sell your child to your ex-husband,

196
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,450
I can watch him for a day.

197
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Mister, you really are...

198
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,200
You can see right through me

199
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,680
and know exactly what I'm thinking.

200
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,520
You know what?

201
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,680
You're absolutely my hero right now.

202
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,520
Do you realize?

203
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Don't worry. I won't have you work for free.

204
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,480
I'll pay you.

205
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,880
Pay me? With what?

206
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,000
You haven't even earned any money yourself.

207
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,280
If I'm not mistaken, check your watch.

208
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,480
You're already late.

209
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,770
Well then, I'll trouble you with this.

210
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,840
Baby,

211
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,450
stay with him

212
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,680
at home.

213
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,240
His diapers and formula

214
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,960
are all on the sofa.

215
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,080
You're giving me your keys?

216
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,400
Take everything.

217
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,040
I've given you my son, why wouldn't I give you this?

218
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,400
Son, have a good day with this mister.

219
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,800
Thank you so much!

220
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,960
I'll definitely take better care of you than your mom did.

221
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,090
Well, I'm going now.

222
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,570
Bye-bye.

223
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,440
Thank you.

224
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,280
Wait, what are you doing?

225
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,570
Just saying thanks.

226
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,920
The biggest challenge for toy brands is the numerous categories.

227
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,380
The target audience isn't clearly defined.

228
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,600
According to the client's requirements...

229
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Our biggest challenge is the short timeframe.

230
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,320
This type of promotion requires planning, performances,

231
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,640
and coordination of venues and equipment.

232
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,170
With such a tight schedule,

233
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,820
won't it be difficult?

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The greater the challenge, the better we can showcase our capabilities.

235
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,400
If everything were easy,

236
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,160
what would they need us for?

237
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,920
Then we need to make the most of our time.

238
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,320
Let's get started early.

239
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,360
That's why I'm considering getting involved early.

240
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,240
But Mr. Shi,

241
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,680
we haven't finalized the contract yet.

242
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,140
Advancing funds like this

243
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,280
isn't the risk too high?

244
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,210
I've already done my research.

245
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,640
The client is a financially strong company

246
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,850
with a large annual promotion budget.

247
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,200
So time is both our problem

248
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,480
and their problem too.

249
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,320
I don't care how much money we make from this event.

250
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,720
I only care if we can use this promotion

251
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,210
to show them what we're capable of.

252
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,880
Mr. Shi, this client is Wan Xinxin.

253
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,080
She's responsible for communication

254
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,740
and is fully in charge of organizing this event.

255
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,200
Can we completely trust

256
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,800
her abilities?

257
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,480
Wan Xinxin.

258
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
Mr. Shi, you look beautiful today.

259
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Please continue.

260
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm late today.

261
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,320
No, let me explain. I wasn't supposed to

262
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,600
be late at all today.

263
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,640
Actually, I was supposed

264
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,040
to leave half an hour earlier.

265
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,000
But my child was acting up

266
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
and then the babysitter was unreliable.

267
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,560
I finally managed to find a neighbor

268
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,680
to watch my child.

269
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,120
But that's not the main issue.

270
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,640
The real problem was the terrible traffic today.

271
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
On the Third Ring Road, you have no idea,

272
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,840
it was all stop and go,

273
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,040
and finally my car rear-ended someone,

274
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,680
actually hit several cars.

275
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,960
The police came.

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,720
The driver had to give a statement.

277
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,400
I thought...

278
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,080
You see, I couldn't just leave him on the road, right?

279
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,880
I'm an employee of Lady,

280
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,280
and you've always taught us

281
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,720
to be kind people, haven't you?

282
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,640
So I stayed there.

283
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,880
I did a good deed.

284
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,000
Okay, I believe you.

285
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,460
Have a seat.

286
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,240
OK, let's continue.

287
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,800
Piggy, woof woof woof.

288
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Kitty, meow meow meow.

289
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,880
Little snake, hiss hiss hiss.

290
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,560
Chicken,

291
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,810
can you show some humanity?

292
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,520
I'm dying from a headache here,

293
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,000
and you two are giggling away.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Have you no shame?

295
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,680
I can't finish this proposal.

296
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,720
It's fine if you don't help.

297
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,840
But do you have to laugh so loudly?

298
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,680
My stinky baby brother.

299
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,680
Look at mommy. Mommy is angry.

300
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't bite off more than you can chew.

301
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,440
Listen, old man,

302
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,320
I really want to know how you manage

303
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,960
to be so cold-faced with such a venomous heart.

304
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,960
It's one thing not to help.

305
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,220
But you're also making snarky comments.

306
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,839
It's just a stupid toy fair.

307
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,520
Do you really need to stress yourself out like that?

308
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,640
What do you mean 'stupid toy fair'?

309
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,640
You've really been spending too much time with animals.

310
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,240
Do you know

311
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,599
whose money is the easiest to earn these days?

312
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,319
What?

313
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,079
Women and children.

314
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,440
So now

315
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
I need to use my brilliant mind to figure out

316
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,040
how I can make children

317
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,640
fall in love with these toys.

318
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,800
God, please give me strength

319
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,080
to understand how these children

320
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,960
can be made to like these toys.

321
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,660
Look, mommy's having an episode.

322
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,560
Fine.

323
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,640
You don't need to pray to heaven.

324
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,680
Who is heaven?

325
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,280
He is heaven.

326
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,960
Baby, do you like these toys?

327
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,560
I don't like these toys at all.

328
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,600
They're too ugly.

329
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,760
Oh, come on.

330
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,610
You don't like them, do you?

331
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,760
Let's help mommy.

332
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,120
Help mommy.

333
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Can I take up a bit of your precious time

334
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,810
to teach you something?

335
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,880
Whose precious time?

336
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,060
Take up your precious time to teach you a lesson.

337
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,560
Go on.

338
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
For example, if you want to sell this toy

339
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,680
to our little brother here.

340
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,480
Do you think he would

341
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,360
take money out of his pocket

342
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,160
to buy the toy from you? Would he?

343
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,520
What do you mean 'hmm'?

344
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,320
He's too young to pay for anything.

345
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,280
Who's paying?

346
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
Either you pay or I pay.

347
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,200
Right now I'm holding him,

348
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,360
so I give you the money, right?

349
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,700
What I want to tell you is this.

350
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,240
When you sell toys,

351
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,040
you can't just consider the children's feelings.

352
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,840
You need to consider their parents' feelings too.

353
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
But we have a conscience.

354
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,920
We can't just make toys for the sake of making toys.

355
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,380
We need to create culture.

356
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,040
You should make toys into a bridge,

357
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,240
a bridge between babies and parents,

358
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,560
for emotional connection. Understand?

359
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,640
Well, well, old timer.

360
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,810
You've got quite a spiel there.

361
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,580
Seems you're not just good with animals,

362
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,620
you also understand my industry.

363
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,280
The way you put it,

364
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,410
I think I'm getting some inspiration.

365
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,560
Go on.

366
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,160
Let me put it more simply.

367
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,160
When you're selling a product,

368
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,720
don't limit your focus to just that one item.

369
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,450
What I want to tell you is

370
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,760
a universal truth.

371
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,760
Slow down.

372
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,840
Master one thing, understand all things.

373
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,440
Don't just focus on the task,

374
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
focus on the heart behind it.

375
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,920
Be more understanding and accepting.

376
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,480
Only when you understand others,

377
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,320
will others truly accept you.

378
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,240
For example, if Qin Gang wants to see the child...

379
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,040
Stop.

380
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,060
That's enough.

381
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,410
I know what you're going to say.

382
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,280
Don't feed me this useless motivational nonsense.

383
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,120
My mind is completely focused on

384
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,320
my great business.

385
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,560
Got it?

386
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,880
Got it.

387
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,560
Who is it?

388
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,520
It's me.

389
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Wait, my alarm hasn't even gone off yet.

390
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,920
Why are you here so early?

391
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,520
Don't you have a key?

392
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,080
Just let yourself in.

393
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,720
If I come in by myself,

394
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,880
and see you without makeup,

395
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,960
I might get scared.

396
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,280
No, you can't come in.

397
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,800
Wait a moment. Don't come in.

398
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,200
Baby, just wait a second.

399
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,880
Coming!

400
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,120
Here you go.

401
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,960
I'll leave this to you.

402
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,140
I'm running out of time. I need to go pack.

403
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,010
Have you had breakfast?

404
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,680
No. As a social elite, my brain

405
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,160
is filled with million-dollar projects.

406
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,600
How could there be any room

407
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,480
left for a cup of milk?

408
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,480
Here.

409
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,560
What's this?

410
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,960
Milk.

411
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,960
I know you haven't had breakfast,

412
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,200
so I warmed up a cup for you,

413
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,930
the temperature is just right.

414
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,440
You really are

415
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,600
a thoughtful and incredibly good man.

416
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,760
As your employer, I'm very satisfied with you.

417
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,320
You misunderstood. I'm mainly afraid that if you starve to death,

418
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,720
no one will pay my salary.

419
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,240
You never say nice things properly. I'm leaving now.

420
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,120
Say goodbye to mommy.

421
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,760
Bye-bye.

422
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,600
Get us some lipstick.

423
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,360
Baby brother.

424
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,720
Mom will be back soon. Do you believe me?

425
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,240
Believe it even if you cry. One, two, three.

426
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,640
Where's my folder?

427
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,160
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

428
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,000
Take it easy.

429
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,040
Mom is always forgetting things.

430
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,680
In-depth analysis.

431
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,520
What are you doing? Look at the time.

432
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,400
You should be at work by now.

433
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,840
Xu Chunli.

434
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,720
Is Wan Xinxin's money still there?

435
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,960
Yes, it is. What do you want to do with it?

436
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,160
I want to use it for a while.

437
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Why do you need so much money?

438
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,320
It's not for myself.

439
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,640
If not for yourself, then which vixen are you giving it to?

440
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,600
Xu Chunli.

441
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,820
You don't understand at all. Let me tell you.

442
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,720
I got some inside information.

443
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,120
There's a stock that can make a huge profit.

444
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,920
I figured Xinxin's money is just sitting there.

445
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,250
So I'll buy some for her.

446
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,240
Well, is there really such a good opportunity?

447
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,500
But aren't all stocks falling right now?

448
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,480
I'm saying you don't have any-

449
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,960
financial sense at all.

450
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,680
What's the nature of stocks?

451
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,480
Stocks are about buying low and selling high.

452
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,000
If you don't want to, forget it.

453
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,240
Xinxin isn't my sister anyway.

454
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,200
That money-

455
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,730
you can just let it sit there collecting dust.

456
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,330
Doesn't your company forbid employees from buying stocks?

457
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,460
I'm not buying any.

458
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,240
Here's the thing.

459
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,120
I opened an account in Miss Shen's name.

460
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,020
Nobody knows about it.

461
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,160
Is that allowed?

462
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,250
That money belongs to Qin Gang.

463
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,800
Yes.

464
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,000
Yes, think about it.

465
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,800
Let me put it this way.

466
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,160
Let's just say-

467
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,120
we're lending the money to Miss Shen.

468
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,320
And then we earn interest.

469
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,360
Borrowing and repaying, it's that simple, right?

470
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,000
When you put it that way, it makes sense.

471
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,440
So, this isn't illegal, is it?

472
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,900
Trust me. My understanding of policies-

473
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
is very measured.

474
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,770
Don't worry.

475
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,760
Alright, good.

476
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,400
See?

477
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm recovering quite well, aren't I?

478
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
I can even get up and move around freely now.

479
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,520
Grandma is talking to you.

480
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,240
Mom, try talking to him.

481
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,040
Come on, talk.

482
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Hello, grandson.

483
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,800
What?

484
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,600
Grandma will be back soon.

485
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,640
Grandma is going to buy a plane ticket.

486
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,160
I'll fly back to see my grandson.

487
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,040
Good boy. Give me a kiss.

488
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,560
Kiss kiss. That's my good boy.

489
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,640
Mom, the baby needs to feed and sleep now.

490
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,840
I need to go.

491
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,280
Wait a minute.

492
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Xiaogang, why haven't I seen Xinxin at all?

493
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,840
Where is she?

494
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,520
I want to thank her.

495
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,720
She's not here.

496
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,120
You should thank her.

497
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,560
Otherwise, how would you have

498
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,880
such a big grandson?

499
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
You're right.

500
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,760
Xiaogang.

501
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,080
It's very hard for a woman to give birth.

502
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,440
You must take good care of Xinxin.

503
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,280
Make sure she has everything she needs, understand?

504
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,080
When I come back,

505
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,920
if Xinxin says anything bad about you,

506
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,000
you'll be in big trouble.

507
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,800
Mom, the baby is crying.

508
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
I need to go now.

509
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,120
I need to go now. We'll talk later.

510
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,920
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

511
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,360
Let's go to bed.

512
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Your aunt is doing well?

513
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
Too bad it wasn't inherited.

514
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,930
That's enough from you.

515
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,460
My mom told me to thank you.

516
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,760
I should also thank you for helping me with this.

517
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,480
Mr. Qin.

518
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,960
I see you've learned new tricks.

519
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,960
Writing, directing and acting all by yourself.

520
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,840
That performance just now was brilliant.

521
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,900
I should give you a round of applause.

522
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,080
The show is over.

523
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,560
Then let's all go our separate ways.

524
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,840
Wan Xinxin.

525
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,840
I have wronged you.

526
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,880
But feelings can't be forced.

527
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,800
For the sake of our child,

528
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,520
please understand and forgive me.

529
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,920
It's all in the past,

530
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,480
why bring it up again?

531
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,280
Wan Xinxin, you've grown more mature.

532
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:45,840
Qin Gang.

533
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,280
If your mother wants to visit the child in the future,

534
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,080
tell her she's welcome anytime.

535
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,640
She is the child's grandmother after all, right?

536
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,360
Thank you.

537
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,420
But you can't come.

538
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,760
I don't want to see you again.

539
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,240
That was quite good.

540
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,640
Xinxin.

541
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,680
You did well just now.

542
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,040
You showed generosity and respect for elders.

543
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,680
You understood how to put yourself in others' shoes.

544
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,080
You did try to see things from another perspective,

545
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,680
but you didn't go all the way.

546
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,920
Try harder next time.

547
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,880
You're really acting like a parent now, aren't you?

548
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,410
I just can't see it that way.

549
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,660
What's wrong? Are you going to hit me?

550
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,120
I see you're being unreasonable again.

551
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,980
Is this your first day knowing me?

552
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,440
Good boy.

553
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,240
Look at my new pajamas.

554
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,170
Do you like them?

555
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,520
What are you looking at?

556
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,560
Xiaobao's photos.

557
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,580
You went to see your son again?

558
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,010
Wan Xinxin didn't kick you out?

559
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,200
I realized she's not as unreasonable as I thought.

560
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,720
That's the first time I've heard you talk about her like that.

561
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,580
Your relationship is improving.

562
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,920
Today I was lucky she acted as my shield.

563
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,600
Should I thank her for you?

564
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,210
Don't overthink it.

565
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,320
It's all because of my mother.

566
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,360
I know.

567
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,660
Your mother treats her like a daughter-in-law.

568
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,860
Wan Xinxin is still more capable than me.

569
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,320
Weiwei.

570
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,100
I think you should put yourself in her shoes.

571
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,680
No matter what, Wan Xinxin

572
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,000
gave birth to my son.

573
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,040
And she raised the child all by herself.

574
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,680
You're a woman too.

575
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,360
If you were in her situation,

576
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,690
wouldn't you be emotional as well?

577
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,560
Your perspective has matured.

578
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,080
No, these aren't my words.

579
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,880
A friend told me this.

580
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,440
He said if a couple can't remain married,

581
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,370
they don't need to become enemies.

582
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,080
If both people are more open-minded

583
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,560
and resolve things properly,

584
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
everyone will be more comfortable.

585
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,560
I think that's good advice.

586
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,250
Xinxin has changed now.

587
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,880
By the way, I heard that she

588
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,760
is currently working on some

589
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,640
promotional campaign for YouBei toy brand.

590
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,970
She's doing quite well,

591
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,400
planning to invite Tong Tong and Ma Youyou as guests.

592
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,340
After enough time, it doesn't matter who you marry.

593
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,080
A red rose

594
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,640
will eventually look like a mosquito smear on the wall.

595
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,100
And a white rose becomes just like rice grains on your clothes.

596
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,840
That makes a lot of sense.

597
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,000
Weiwei.

598
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,040
I don't think you need to think that way.

599
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,840
I just want to share

600
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,970
what I know with you.

601
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,330
I don't want to hide anything from you,

602
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,690
much less lie to you.

603
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,720
That's good.

604
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,180
If you have any thoughts about me,

605
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,370
tell me early and don't keep it from me.

606
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,820
I don't want to be like Wan Xinxin,

607
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,600
being played for a fool.

608
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,000
Look at you, being so petty.

609
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,960
If I had known you'd be like this...

610
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,490
I won't talk to you anymore.

611
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,000
You're saying I'm petty.

612
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,600
You can't have forgotten what I've done for you.

613
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,880
Have you?

614
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,320
But now?

615
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,760
You spend more time with your son than with me.

616
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,960
Tell me, besides you,

617
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,720
your mother, your friends, your relatives,

618
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,280
who knows I even exist?

619
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,680
Enough.

620
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,600
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

621
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,180
I don't want to fight with you.

622
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,760
I just want to be with you.

623
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,600
Just you and me.

624
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,699
I just remembered.

625
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,000
I have two car show plans to work on.

626
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,000
You're tired, go to sleep first.

627
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,520
What's important this time isn't the product itself,

628
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,679
nor what we want our target audience to accept.

629
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,679
I think we need to learn to put ourselves

630
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,880
in our audience's shoes,

631
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,920
to understand

632
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,280
what they want to get from our products.

633
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,760
My product concept this time

634
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,719
is to bring adults back to a fairy tale world.

635
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,560
Let them become a child,

636
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,679
this way our product

637
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,600
is not just a commodity,

638
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,960
it becomes a bridge

639
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,639
for communication between adults and children.

640
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,000
So this time I want to create

641
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,580
a fairy tale world.

642
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,560
Using a fairy tale castle

643
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,520
to express our theme.

644
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,400
We can also incorporate their overall concept

645
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,320
and list all the details within it.

646
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,960
This solves the problem of having too many product types

647
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,840
and unclear targeting.

648
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,760
It showcases the strength of our brand.

649
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,440
But this is quite a big undertaking.

650
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,570
Just finding a venue is difficult.

651
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,480
Our main venue should be at an amusement park.

652
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,280
Because an amusement park is

653
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,000
a place for family fun.

654
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,560
On weekends,

655
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,480
children always beg to go to amusement parks.

656
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,740
Adults have no choice but to go with them.

657
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,240
So amusement parks have

658
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,200
the highest public exposure rate for children's products.

659
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,960
If our event is successful,

660
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,880
I believe it will also be

661
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,140
great publicity for the amusement park.

662
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,520
We don't rule out

663
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,760
the possibility of long-term cooperation in the future.

664
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,680
I understand you want to use their platform to our advantage,

665
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,360
but we need clear branding,

666
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,090
otherwise our target audience will be confused.

667
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,960
I've already thought it through, Director Shi.

668
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,760
I plan to invite the popular film star

669
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,520
Miss Tong Tong to endorse our products.

670
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,040
Miss Tong Tong currently has several hit shows

671
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,480
that are extremely popular.

672
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,680
All children love her now,

673
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,840
and parents really approve of her too.

674
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,640
So if we can get Miss Tong Tong,

675
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,000
I believe this will be

676
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,200
a focal point for their conversations.

677
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,320
Also, I want to invite

678
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,200
the very popular musician Mr. Yo-Yo Ma

679
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,040
and the Contemporary Ensemble

680
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,920
to perform live for us.

681
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,240
Their style is very suitable.

682
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,840
These two celebrities you mentioned

683
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,640
have very high appearance fees.

684
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,400
They all charge by the hour.

685
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,130
I've already thought about all these issues.

686
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,680
The selection of activities

687
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,600
and the dance Miss Tong Tong will perform

688
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,120
have all been designed by me.

689
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,120
And I already did a practical run-through yesterday.

690
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,240
Apart from the game session later,

691
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,880
Miss Tong Tong's time on stage

692
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,280
will only be 15 to 20 minutes.

693
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,400
So I think we should negotiate with her for

694
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,080
a 20-minute performance time.

695
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,680
This way, we'll get excellent value for money.

696
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,240
Director Shi, do you think my plan is feasible?

697
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,200
Beibei, can you estimate the cost?

698
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,200
I've made a rough estimate.

699
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,800
Venue rental, staff, props, lighting, and sound

700
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,210
will cost at least 500,000 to 800,000.

701
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,320
This doesn't include appearance fees.

702
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,200
Based on industry rates,

703
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,290
the budget for the entire event

704
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,240
would be at least 2 to 3 million.

705
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,980
I think this plan is too extravagant.

706
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,480
We'd have to advance too much money upfront.

707
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,160
I think results are what matter most.

708
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,480
Although we're spending more this time,

709
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,000
this approach will help us

710
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,480
achieve our goal of selling products quickly.

711
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,440
Besides, I've already discussed this with Manager Li.

712
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,400
He approves of our plan.

713
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,000
Wan Xinxin, you're not acting like yourself today.

714
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,440
You've even learned to consider others' perspectives.

715
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,400
Really?

716
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,060
Did you create this proposal on your own?

717
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,000
Well, I had a friend

718
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,730
who helped me think it through.

719
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,000
What kind of person is he?

720
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,480
He's our housekeeper.

721
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,560
No, well, this person...

722
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,520
He's quite strange usually.

723
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,520
But he's very attentive when it comes to children.

724
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,880
Must be a man, right?

725
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,120
Yes, he's a middle-aged man.

726
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,210
A strange uncle.

727
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,760
So do you like this man

728
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,760
and the proposal he shared with you?

729
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,530
Do you think it meets the client's requirements?

730
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,360
I'm not sure if the client will like it.

731
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,080
But when I was working on this proposal,

732
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,200
I was completely immersed in it.

733
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:41,920
I felt like

734
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,880
I was creating a fairy tale world.

735
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,280
Like the fairy tale I've always wanted to visit since childhood.

736
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,640
Alright, Wan Xinxin,

737
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,840
go ahead and create

738
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,170
this fairy tale for all of us to see.

739
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,040
You agree?

740
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,600
All departments, give Wan Xinxin your full support.

741
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,730
Meeting adjourned.

742
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,400
Mr. Shi

743
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,840
Mr. Shi

744
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,320
Mr. Shi

745
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,120
Excellent!

746
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,140
I'm afraid there will be trouble if we leave everything to Wan Xinxin.

747
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,080
Her mind is

748
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,010
already lost in a fairy tale world.

749
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,300
Nothing will go wrong.

750
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,880
Two tigers, two tigers.

751
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,840
How strange, indeed.

752
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,160
Do you speak English?

753
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,200
I don't speak English.

754
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,400
How strange.

755
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,040
How did it go?

756
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,480
I'm so angry!

757
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,840
I mean, a Chinese amusement park

758
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,400
why hire a foreigner as manager?

759
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,040
Listen to me.

760
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,560
I'd be fine if he were British or American.

761
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,040
But he's not even that.

762
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,240
Who knows if he's French or German.

763
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,920
He talks so much and I can't understand a word.

764
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,600
I have a CET-4 certificate.

765
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,460
Did you pass it?

766
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,140
I was six points short.

767
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,640
No, but I can

768
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,280
handle basic communication.

769
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,210
I can't even communicate with him.

770
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,000
No.

771
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,920
Shouldn't this foreign manager have a Chinese translator?

772
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,320
There is one, but they haven't arrived yet.

773
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,960
How long do we have to wait?

774
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,880
I can't communicate with him,

775
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,520
so how would I know how long?

776
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,360
What are you doing

777
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,800
holding your baby brother?

778
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,360
I have a ton of things to do this afternoon.

779
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,880
Okay, go with mom.

780
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,480
I need to discuss something this afternoon

781
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,880
about equipment for an entertainment agency.

782
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,280
Wait, where are you going?

783
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,600
What are you doing?

784
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,180
Lifting her up.

785
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,640
Two tigers, two tigers.

786
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,120
Running fast, running fast.

787
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,720
One has no eyes, one has no tail.

788
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,880
How strange!

789
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,080
You sing so well.

790
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Um, Xinxin.

791
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,880
He basically agreed.

792
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,200
Then you and his translator

793
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,130
can discuss the contract details.

794
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,560
Thank you.

795
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,840
Thanks.

796
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
Your wife is lovely and suits you well.

797
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,720
Your family of three looks very happy.

798
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,000
What did you tell him?

799
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,920
You misunderstood. She's my employer.

800
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,200
I don't have a wife yet.

801
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,800
Oh, I see.

802
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,800
Goodbye.

803
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,320
Thank you.

804
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,440
Goodbye.

805
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,320
Doesn't he speak Chinese?

806
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,840
What Chinese?

807
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,680
He's only been in China for a few days.

808
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,440
Wait, how did you talk to him?

809
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,400
In German.

810
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,120
Besides, for them,

811
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,890
having a celebrity visit is also beneficial.

812
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,920
German? You old fox, you speak German?

813
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,560
I stayed there for a few days.

814
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,960
Did you rescue dogs in Germany too?

815
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,760
What are you talking about? I just stayed there for a few days.

816
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,640
You sly dog, not bad!

817
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,880
You've been a huge help this time.

818
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,400
I must thank you properly.

819
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,280
You'll need to accompany me these days.

820
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,140
Don't worry, I'll treat you well.

821
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,160
I'll give you a raise later.

822
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,890
An extra 200.

823
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,600
Before talking about that 200 raise,

824
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,260
I paid for the tickets myself.

825
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,920
You bought them?

826
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
No, we're clients.

827
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,010
We should get that foreigner to reimburse us.

828
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,200
It's a 100,000 yuan contract.

829
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,760
Can't you be a little more generous?

830
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,160
We can't lose out either.

831
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,640
We brought our little star here.

832
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,760
We should have some fun

833
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,220
and win a doll to take back.

834
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,000
Can we please take care of business first, your highness?

835
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,480
Don't we still need to wait for

836
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,120
the translator to discuss contract details?

837
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,560
Let's go. Hurry up.

838
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,880
Come on, old man!

839
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,400
Tongchang

840
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:45,840
Li

841
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,440
Jiang Qiaohua
