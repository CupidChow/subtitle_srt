1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,000
National Radio and Television Administration

2
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,280
Didn't you say

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,410
you were going to the US to take the medical license exam?

4
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,759
Dad is tied up with some things right now.

5
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,280
If you're busy,

6
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,340
then I should stay with you even more.

7
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,560
Dad, please take Mom and me home.

8
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,420
We can cook for you together. Wouldn't that be nice?

9
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,360
Listen to your daughter.

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,810
I don't like staying in hotels either.

11
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,040
The thing is, there's nowhere to go back to right now.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,460
Where are you staying now?

13
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,360
An apartment.

14
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,140
Then we'll stay there.

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,320
Yes, Dad.

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,200
Don't you miss

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,000
the meals Mom and I cook for you?

18
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,560
And you reading me bedtime stories every night.

19
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,480
It's so wonderful and cozy.

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,480
Dad, please take me home.

21
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,160
Please, please.

22
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,720
Please, Dad.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,480
Please, Dad.

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,360
Please, please.

25
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,290
When my precious daughter begs me,

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,040
my heart just melts.

27
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,560
Okay.

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,320
Wan Xinxin

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,560
Dabai

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,079
Let me introduce you.

31
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,720
This is Xia Qing, my ex-wife.

32
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,680
Hi.

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,960
This little one is...

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,360
Let me introduce myself.

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
Dad.

36
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,320
This is my dad, and this is my mom.

37
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,760
My name is Ruirui.

38
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,840
Hello.

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,980
Hello, auntie. What's your name?

40
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,400
My name is Wan Xinxin.

41
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,700
You can call me sister from now on.

42
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,280
I see you have a baby stroller there.

43
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,920
You must have a baby.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
She's just a child and doesn't know better.

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,440
Please don't take offense.

47
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,840
How could I?

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,220
She's so adorable.

49
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,560
Huaming told me.

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,820
You're the tenant, right?

51
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,600
Yes.

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,880
Huaming, before renting out the house,

53
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,000
did you tell the tenant

54
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,650
about any requirements for the living environment?

55
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,890
Look how messy this living room is.

56
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,760
It's actually quite clean usually.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,800
That's true.

58
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
Do you remember

59
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,480
when we had that dog?

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,460
It was much messier than this.

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,730
I'm mainly worried others might mind.

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,240
Men, I tell you,

63
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,770
they just can't manage without a wife around.

64
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Ruirui,

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,159
let's help dad clean up later, okay?

66
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,560
Okay?

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,040
Sure.

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,880
Well, here's the plan.

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,960
You and the little one can go freshen up first,

70
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,720
and I'll take you out for dinner tonight.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
Why go out?

72
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,360
We can just eat at home, right?

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,800
Right.

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
I'll cook tonight.

75
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,480
By the way, Miss Tenant,

76
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,160
if you're not busy,

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,080
why don't you join us for dinner?

78
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,520
Yes, please join us.

79
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,060
Let's talk about it later.

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,680
Well then, let's hurry.

81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,640
Go inside and get settled first.

82
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,440
Okay.

83
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,560
Good.

84
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,800
Um...

85
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,200
This room is already rented by Miss Wan.

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,480
So please stay in that room

87
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,280
over there, okay?

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:40,940
No problem.

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,780
Let me help you.

90
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,600
What are all these things?

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,240
Don't touch that! Don't touch that!

92
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,120
Mom! Mom!

93
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't throw it away! Don't throw it away!

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,560
Mom!

95
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,280
These are the children's things.

96
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,480
What are all these things?

97
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,740
These are your little brother's things.

98
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
Hurry! Hurry!

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,720
Being naughty again, aren't you?

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,840
What's all this?

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,680
Mom is busy.

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,920
You should do your own things by yourself, right?

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,600
You little mischief-maker, help mom clean up.

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,460
Did you hear me?

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,520
Alright!

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,800
One, two, one, one, two, one!

107
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,880
Take the suitcase to the room.

108
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,160
Be good.

109
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,080
Stop pretending.

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,330
It really hurts.

111
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,960
Didn't we agree to stay at a hotel?

112
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,520
Why did you bring them home?

113
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
Yes, we did agree on a hotel.

114
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,640
I had it all arranged, but Ruirui...

115
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,600
Ruirui insisted on staying here.

116
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,240
Look, I haven't seen Ruirui for three years.

117
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,600
You're a mother too. You're a good mother.

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,840
Can you understand my situation?

119
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,600
It's not that. I can understand you.

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,120
But you should have given me a heads-up.

121
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,240
I sent you a WeChat message.

122
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,000
WeChat message?

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,560
I didn't receive anything.

124
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,000
You didn't?

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
You were probably busy and missed it.

126
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,560
For something this important, couldn't you have called?

127
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,400
I've been with them the whole time and couldn't make a call.

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Thank you.

129
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,610
How long will they stay?

130
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,720
Stay.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,880
At most two or three days. Just two or three days.

132
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,640
I'll do anything you ask.

133
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,200
Fine.

134
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,240
Your ex-wife is quite pretty.

135
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,420
Let me tell you.

136
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,340
Compared to you, she's really just average.

137
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:20,920
Really.

138
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,200
That's true.

139
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,720
Where will everyone sleep tonight?

140
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,280
Huh?

141
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
How are the sleeping arrangements?

142
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,720
I'll figure something out.

143
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
I have a plan.

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,659
Do whatever you think is best.

145
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,840
Huaming.

146
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,520
Huaming.

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,280
Here.

148
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,159
Get the ingredients from the fridge for me.

149
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,090
I'll do it later.

150
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,640
Okay. I'll prepare everything for you.

151
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,240
You just need to stir-fry it.

152
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,600
Hey, tenant.

153
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,370
Join us for dinner tonight.

154
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,880
It's so messy.

155
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,090
No need. I'll take care of it later.

156
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,090
How long have you been living here?

157
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
About six months.

158
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,760
Do you have children?

159
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,440
Yes, I do.

160
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,440
What about your husband?

161
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,400
I'm divorced.

162
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,570
Raising a child by yourself

163
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,680
must be quite difficult.

164
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,840
Yeah, it is tough.

165
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,920
But thankfully there's Huaming.

166
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,440
Huaming always helps us.

167
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,280
He's really thoughtful.

168
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,840
Yes.

169
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,640
Huaming is just such a kind-hearted person.

170
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,440
When I was with him,

171
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,770
that's exactly what I loved about him.

172
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,970
Oh, look at me being forgetful.

173
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,440
What was your name again?

174
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,680
Wan Xinxin.

175
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,560
Wan Xinxin, Miss Wan.

176
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,480
Miss Wan.

177
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,680
I'll be staying here for a while.

178
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,160
If you need anything, just let me know.

179
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,720
Don't be shy.

180
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,460
How long will you be staying here?

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,480
Didn't Huaming tell you?

182
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,840
We were supposed to stay at a hotel today.

183
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,760
But Huaming was worried that my daughter and I wouldn't feel comfortable there,

184
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,690
so he insisted on bringing us back to stay at his home.

185
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,360
I really don't mind, honestly.

186
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,320
I actually quite like the hotel environment,

187
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,920
with cleaning service and nice surroundings.

188
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,880
But Huaming is just sentimental,

189
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,440
he misses the child

190
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,120
and worries she won't adjust well.

191
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,280
So we came back.

192
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes, he really is

193
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,400
very thoughtful.

194
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,520
Mm-hmm.

195
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,880
Xiaqing.

196
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,880
I've prepared everything.

197
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
You just need to stir-fry it.

198
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
I'll taste your cooking skills later.

199
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,000
Sure.

200
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,080
I've got everything ready.

201
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,280
All ingredients are prepared. You just need to cook them.

202
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

203
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,520
You're such a liar, you know that?

204
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
Don't be angry.

205
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,920
You said she'd stay for two or three days, but now she's saying she'll stay much longer.

206
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,720
She said she'd stay for a while.

207
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
What she says doesn't count.

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,240
This is my home now.

209
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,400
Let me tell you, your ex-wife seems quite formidable.

210
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,640
She sits here acting like she owns the place.

211
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,440
Asking about everything.

212
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,960
I don't think she came back just for the child.

213
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Is she trying to get back together with you?

214
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
What reconciliation? No way.

215
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
I've never heard anything about getting back together.

216
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,440
She didn't mention it at the airport either.

217
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,280
She's never brought it up.

218
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,160
Absolutely not.

219
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,080
Listen, Xinxin.

220
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,360
You can be completely at ease.

221
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,920
This time it's not because of Huarui.

222
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,080
Xiaqing didn't necessarily come back to see me.

223
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,160
Really?

224
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,480
Absolutely certain.

225
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,720
It's all in the past.

226
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm like your child too. Why are you treating me this way?

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,480
There, there. You're such a good girl.

228
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,210
You're the least troublesome.

229
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,160
Then you're not allowed to eat the food they made.

230
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,000
Why not?

231
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,120
Why? We'll order takeout.

232
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,520
But you're not eating? You're being too unreasonable.

233
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,480
So you want to eat their food, huh?

234
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,680
Fine. I'll go tell her

235
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,400
about our relationship.

236
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,000
No, no, no. You're just...

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,960
Let me tell you,

238
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,440
even a cornered dog will leap over a wall.

239
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,880
Yes.

240
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,360
Even a rabbit will bite when cornered.

241
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,800
I'm sorry, okay?

242
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,480
Let go.

243
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,250
I'm begging you.

244
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,640
Please.

245
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,520
Huaming, come eat dinner.

246
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,160
Ruirui, go call your father for dinner.

247
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,520
Um, I'm not hungry. You go ahead.

248
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,280
Dad, come eat with me and mom.

249
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,240
Daddy, well...

250
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,160
Look, I just had takeout. I'm not hungry.

251
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,890
Why don't you and mom eat first?

252
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
Come on, please eat with us.

253
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
Do you hate us?

254
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
Huarui, what are you saying?

255
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,400
How could I dislike you?

256
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,520
I miss you so much.

257
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,920
It's just because I missed you so much

258
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,400
when I went to pick you up at the airport.

259
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,560
I haven't eaten anything

260
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,480
since this morning.

261
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,720
My stomach was growling

262
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,080
because I was starving.

263
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,640
While Mom was cooking,

264
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,120
this lady ordered some takeout.

265
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,160
I couldn't help myself and ate too much.

266
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,840
Why don't you and Mom eat first?

267
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,480
You're lying.

268
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,000
You said liars aren't good children.

269
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
As soon as we got off the plane,

270
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,900
you said you'd eat with us.

271
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,240
And I specially made

272
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,440
tomato and egg stir-fry for you.

273
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,760
Aren't you going to eat it?

274
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,160
Try it now.

275
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,040
Huaming, come have dinner.

276
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,040
Oh, by the way, miss tenant,

277
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,770
come join us for dinner.

278
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,300
You should try my cooking.

279
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,370
Huaming loves my cooking the most.

280
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,250
You can give me your rating too.

281
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
Dad.

282
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,300
Dad, if you don't eat, I won't eat either.

283
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm really full.

284
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,800
Come on.

285
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,320
Alright then, let's eat together.

286
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,360
Dinner's ready!

287
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,480
Let me tell you, even though I'm full,

288
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
I could still eat a whole cow.

289
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,320
Sweetie, did you make this?

290
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,760
Yes.

291
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Did you eat this every day when you were in America?

292
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,610
Did your mom make it for you?

293
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Please have a seat, miss.

294
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,360
Okay.

295
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,520
Did your mom make this for you when you were in America?

296
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:18,960
Yes.

297
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,640
Look at daddy's big appetite.

298
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,080
It's so delicious.

299
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,000
Have some too.

300
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
Daddy will eat this.

301
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,920
Won't you try a bite?

302
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,280
Okay.

303
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,260
How long are you planning to keep up this act?

304
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
You already figured it out, why ask?

305
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,180
Is the child yours?

306
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,560
No.

307
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,060
So what are you planning to do?

308
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,040
Since you've figured it out, do me a favor.

309
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,850
I don't want Ruirui to know. I'm afraid it would hurt her.

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,330
You can't keep hiding it from her forever.

311
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,400
I'll find the right moment.

312
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,260
Let me think about how to tell her.

313
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,380
Good night.

314
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,120
Good night.

315
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,160
Where should I start reading?

316
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,720
Here.

317
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,720
Okay.

318
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,920
The prince says he likes the little mermaid.

319
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,480
However, when he was shipwrecked at sea,

320
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,240
a girl saved him.

321
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,040
That girl is the only one he could ever love.

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,800
Yes.

323
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,160
The prince doesn't know that I saved his life.

324
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,080
The little mermaid sighs deeply.

325
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,200
But she couldn't speak a word.

326
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,400
To be with the prince,

327
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,760
she came ashore and her tail disappeared,

328
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,200
but she never regretted it.

329
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,690
What about the tail?

330
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,160
Forget about the tail!

331
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,560
No, look. The sea, the reef.

332
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,640
Do you think you're a mermaid?

333
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,560
You are a mermaid, girl.

334
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,120
Mermaid, yes, look.

335
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,360
See? Like a mermaid.

336
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,220
Look, your head facing me, your tail facing the sea.

337
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,720
Dad, was Mom a mermaid back then

338
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,000
who came ashore to be with you?

339
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,240
Silly Ruirui.

340
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,560
Mom is just Mom.

341
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,440
She's not a mermaid.

342
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,720
Ruirui.

343
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,200
Daddy's finished the story.

344
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,850
Time to sleep, okay?

345
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,960
Dad.

346
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,480
I really wish when I'm in America,

347
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
you could still tell me stories like this.

348
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,920
How nice it would be if things were like before.

349
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,400
Let Daddy think about it first.

350
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Go to sleep now.

351
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,680
I'll turn off the lights after you fall asleep.

352
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,300
Wait, where are they? Where is everyone?

353
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,400
Meow.

354
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,480
No, where are they?

355
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,280
Meow.

356
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,440
I just put Huarui to sleep.

357
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,820
Thank you for not saying anything when you saw earlier.

358
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,600
You're being so good these days, meow.

359
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,560
Give me a meow.

360
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,560
Meow.

361
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,120
What's with the meowing? I'm not a three-year-old.

362
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,850
You're treating me the same way you treat Huarui.

363
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,280
Let me tell you.

364
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,000
A man's greatest success

365
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,600
is treating his girlfriend like his daughter.

366
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,760
I think I've achieved that.

367
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,320
Come on, meow for me.

368
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,800
Meow.

369
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,880
Meow.

370
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,400
Come, let me read you a storybook

371
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
to help you fall asleep, okay?

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
Oh please, what story?

373
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
Same treatment, just the same.

374
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,280
The Little Mermaid.

375
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,680
Huaming

376
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,260
What are you chatting about with the tenant? You seem to be having fun.

377
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,520
Well, we were just talking about

378
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,250
children's education issues.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,480
Have some water. You must be tired from all that talking.

380
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,080
Thanks.

381
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,480
You're still up so late.

382
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
Staying up late is bad for your skin.

383
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,600
I know,

384
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,800
but if Huaming doesn't sleep,

385
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,580
I can't sleep well either.

386
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,680
Huaming, go to bed now.

387
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,320
Well,

388
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,880
it's too hot.

389
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,080
I want to stay out here for a while.

390
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
Actually, you've already

391
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,120
made up the sofa for me.

392
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,380
I'll just sleep here on the sofa instead of going to my room.

393
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,090
By the way, Miss Tenant,

394
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,360
you probably don't know yet,

395
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,480
Huaming has one particular flaw.

396
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,120
He can't sleep with even the slightest light on,

397
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,250
so please turn off the lights quickly.

398
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,600
No, I've already fixed that habit.

399
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,880
During these three years living alone,

400
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,000
I realized I'm afraid of the dark.

401
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,960
So I sleep with all the lights on,

402
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,560
even the bathroom light.

403
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,840
Besides, our tenant here

404
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,160
has work to finish.

405
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,480
Work can be done tomorrow,

406
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,810
right, Miss Tenant?

407
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,240
Sure.

408
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,570
Then turn off the lights and let him sleep.

409
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,800
Okay.

410
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,480
Good night.

411
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,700
Good night.

412
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,540
Good night.

413
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,840
Good night, good night, good night.

414
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,400
Turn off the lights.

415
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,840
Okay.

416
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,080
We'll talk more about the children's issues later.

417
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,480
Okay.

418
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,040
It's off.

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,660
Go to sleep.

420
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,560
Good night.

421
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,970
This is really too much!

422
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,810
He actually brought them home to stay.

423
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,780
Who knows when they'll leave.

424
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,040
I'm not the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains.

425
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,970
I can't move this mountain either.

426
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,920
You can't look at it that way.

427
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,120
That's his daughter.

428
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,080
Besides, it's his daughter's home too, right?

429
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,360
Whose side are you on?

430
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,520
I'm just stating facts.

431
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,480
Don't be upset.

432
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,250
The key is that just as we got together,

433
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,680
he brings his ex-wife and daughter back home.

434
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,400
Making me feel like the other woman,

435
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,930
sneaking around and playing pretend all day.

436
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,240
What did you just say?

437
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,120
You two are together now?

438
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,480
So it's official?

439
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,560
Yes.

440
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,290
Tell me the process. Give me some details.

441
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,890
The process?

442
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,640
Well, the process is...

443
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,160
I asked him what I am to him,

444
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,090
and he said girlfriend.

445
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,120
That's it?

446
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,340
What else did you want to hear?

447
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,280
Boring.

448
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,520
You two have been back and forth for so long,

449
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,360
calling you girlfriend is just a change of title.

450
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,960
So boring.

451
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,520
Don't change the subject.

452
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I'm telling you the important part.

453
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,700
No, the point is that his ex-wife coming back this time,

454
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,570
I don't think it's just to accompany their child.

455
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,560
She treats me like an enemy when she sees me.

456
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,920
On the surface she seems calm and collected,

457
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,520
but behind the scenes, it's all daggers drawn.

458
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Well, her ex-husband found himself

459
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,160
a gorgeous post-90s beauty.

460
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
What else would she see you as but an enemy, right?

461
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,400
That's true.

462
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,920
So does that mean I can win?

463
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,060
I need to give you a reality check.

464
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,600
You think relationships are won with youth and beauty?

465
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,880
In the end, relationships depend on time

466
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,600
and shared experiences between two people.

467
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,530
You understand?

468
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,320
I'm thinking his ex-wife came back this time

469
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
very likely wanting to remarry him.

470
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,320
I think so too.

471
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,720
If his daughter gives you trouble,

472
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,450
you're in even bigger trouble.

473
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,680
What should I do?

474
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,680
Xu Huahua,

475
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,480
aren't you supposed to be like Doraemon?

476
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,800
Hurry up and use your clever mind

477
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,800
to help me figure something out.

478
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,000
I really want to hear it.

479
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,720
Of course.

480
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,320
Beg me.

481
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,180
Are you going to tell me or not?

482
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,000
Stop it.

483
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,600
Hurry up.

484
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,730
Fine, I'll tell you.

485
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,330
It's simple.

486
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,880
First, take a look at yourself.

487
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,540
You're so careless every day.

488
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,800
You don't even know how to behave

489
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,290
in front of his ex-wife.

490
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,840
I don't need to see his ex-wife to know.

491
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,640
She must be someone who acts

492
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,560
properly, gracefully, elegantly,

493
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,960
and also possesses

494
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,800
all the traditional Chinese female virtues.

495
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,000
The key is

496
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,300
she knows how to take care of Ming.

497
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,720
Am I right?

498
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,880
How did you know?

499
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
No, the key is that she's also beautiful.

500
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,200
That's not the point.

501
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,680
No, you don't understand.

502
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,200
When she came back that day, she made a table full of dishes.

503
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,560
I was drooling just looking at them.

504
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,920
So,

505
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,640
you need to use his ex-wife's standards

506
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,040
to measure yourself

507
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,040
and find your shortcomings.

508
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,400
You must learn more from his ex-wife.

509
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,690
You need to let Ming know

510
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,380
that you're also a reliable stepmother.

511
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,360
That you can also take on

512
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,920
the responsibility of caring for him and his daughter

513
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,450
in the future. Understand?

514
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,280
I am already a stepmother.

515
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,410
I'm quite reliable.

516
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,840
Let me tell you, there's a second point.

517
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,080
What's the second?

518
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,040
Didn't Ming say

519
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,260
he really loves his daughter?

520
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,400
Yes.

521
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,240
So you need to start with his daughter.

522
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
Win over his daughter first.

523
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,800
Win over his daughter first.

524
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,760
So easy. It's that simple.

525
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
Come on, let Daddy have a bite.

526
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,850
Come on, give Daddy a taste.

527
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,280
Ruirui.

528
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
How could you not watch her for just a moment?

529
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,640
Didn't I tell you

530
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,760
not to let her eat ice cream?

531
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,880
A little bit won't hurt.

532
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,720
How can you say that?

533
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,560
She seems fine now, but she'll have a stomachache when we get home.

534
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,490
She never had this problem before.

535
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,420
Right. It's been three years and how much do you really know about her?

536
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,600
Ruirui.

537
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,560
Didn't I tell you

538
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,840
not to eat ice cream?

539
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,530
Your father might not know, but don't you?

540
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,320
Do you think I should

541
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,180
ruin this perfect family picture

542
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,890
by breaking them apart?

543
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,640
If not now, when?

544
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,880
Besides,

545
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
Ming is emotionally vulnerable right now.

546
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,010
You can't let your enemy take advantage of that, can you?

547
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,680
Then I'll be the bad guy this time.

548
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,010
What do you mean bad guy?

549
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,090
She's the real villain over there.

550
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,120
I'm the official girlfriend, right?

551
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,000
Absolutely.

552
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,360
Well, I'm running out of time.

553
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,320
I've been with you half the day already.

554
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,720
I need to get back to work.

555
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,480
I'm leaving.

556
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,560
I've said everything I needed to say. Remember it all.

557
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,240
Wait, Xu Ke.

558
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm not going. I've told you everything I needed to.

559
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,280
Throw it away. Quickly.

560
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,480
A little bit is fine.

561
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
How is it fine?

562
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,370
Throw it away right now. Hurry.

563
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,860
Listen to your mom.

564
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
What was supposed to be a happy time has turned to tears.

565
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,840
Ruirui.

566
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,800
What's wrong?

567
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,480
Xinxin.

568
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,540
Why are you crying?

569
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,000
What's wrong, Ruirui? Why are you crying?

570
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,600
It's nothing.

571
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,320
She was eating ice cream and her mom wouldn't let her.

572
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,520
She scolded her a bit.

573
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,640
Stop crying. Look at you, crying like a little kitten.

574
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,800
Too much crying will make you less pretty.

575
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
Tell me if anyone bullies you again.

576
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,000
Excuse me, Miss Wan.

577
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,810
I'm disciplining my child.

578
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,520
Please don't interfere.

579
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,480
You see, your mom really wants what's best for you.

580
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,280
She's worried cold food might upset your stomach.

581
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,200
If you're ever upset about anything in the future,

582
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,930
come find Sister Xinxin, okay?

583
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,680
Did you say hello to Sister Xinxin?

584
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,940
Hello, Sister Xinxin.

585
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,120
Look what I brought for you.

586
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,920
It's a teddy bear.

587
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,440
But it's not just any teddy bear.

588
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Can you see what's special about it?

589
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,880
There's a zipper. Can you open it?

590
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
Take a look.

591
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,840
It's chocolate! My favorite chocolate!

592
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,720
Really?

593
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,410
Ruirui, did I say you could eat chocolate?

594
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,960
You said I couldn't eat ice cream.

595
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,220
You never said I couldn't eat chocolate.

596
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,160
Right, Mom never said

597
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,400
you couldn't eat chocolate.

598
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,920
Just eat a little bit.

599
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,920
Chocolate makes children happy.

600
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,320
It contains phenylethylamine, as you know.

601
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,780
Thank you, Sister Xinxin.

602
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,000
If you want chocolate in the future,

603
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,400
just tell Sister Xinxin.

604
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,300
Thank you, Sister Xinxin.

605
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,320
Ruirui.

606
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,440
Do you know who Sister Xinxin is?

607
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,360
Xiaqing, you...

608
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,480
Who is she?

609
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,920
What are you doing, Xiaqing?

610
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,780
She's your father's girlfriend.

611
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,320
She's also the one who wants to take your father away.

612
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,250
That's too much!

613
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,880
Is that true, Dad?

614
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,840
Is she really your girlfriend?

615
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,760
Tell me quickly. Is it true?

616
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,840
Ruirui, well...

617
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,960
Dad will explain it to you later, okay?

618
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,400
Is it because of her

619
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,060
that you didn't go to America?

620
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,800
I just want you to be with Mom.

621
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,600
I hate her.

622
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,920
Ruirui.

623
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,200
No. Thank you, Sister Xinxin.

624
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,120
Thank you, Sister Xinxin.

625
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,480
Take it easy.

626
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,760
You're just as heartless as I am, Huaming.

627
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,600
Here, have some water.

628
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,360
The soup doesn't have any salt in it.

629
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,880
Okay.

630
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,440
Let me do it.

631
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,880
It's fine, thank you.

632
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,500
I'll set the bowls.

633
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,400
Are you hungry?

634
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,520
Are you upset?

635
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,720
Here.

636
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,400
Ruirui.

637
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,040
Why are you just standing there?

638
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,840
Go wash your hands for dinner. Hurry.

639
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,720
Yes, go wash your hands with your sister.

640
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,200
Wash your hands with your sister.

641
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,320
Thank you, Xinxin.

642
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,920
The soup has no salt in it.

643
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,480
Wash your hands.

644
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,280
Alright, I got it.

645
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,480
You're pouting like a soy sauce bottle.

646
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,320
Um, Xiaqing, Xiaqing.

647
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,520
Come on, put your hands in.

648
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,720
Go away.

649
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,440
Hurry up and wash your hands before dinner. Be good.

650
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,280
Go away.

651
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,400
Go away. I hate you.

652
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,660
Fine. You can wash them yourself.

653
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,400
Let me tell you something.

654
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,560
You are your father's daughter.

655
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,920
And I am your father's girlfriend.

656
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,720
These two things don't conflict. Understand?

657
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,400
I hate you.

658
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,520
You should break up with my dad.

659
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,480
Because my dad and mom

660
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,680
are getting back together soon.

661
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,920
How dare you talk like that?

662
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,340
Don't run away.

663
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,360
Come, let me see.

664
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,570
Does it hurt?

665
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Listen, it's nothing.

666
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,450
Just got caught in the door.

667
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,920
It's really bruised.

668
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,840
It's fine.

669
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,960
I'm a doctor. Trust me.

670
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,360
It's just a little pinch.

671
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,520
Xinxin, I know you're doing all this for me.

672
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,880
Using your beauty.

673
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,080
Using your kindness.

674
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,570
To get close to Ruirui and win her over.

675
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,120
So you do care about me.

676
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,400
Of course I care about you.

677
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,930
You're my second daughter.

678
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,860
Then tell me the truth.

679
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,000
Are you planning to remarry her?

680
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,680
No, I...

681
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,170
I just found out myself.

682
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,650
What are you planning to do?

683
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,880
No turning back.

684
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,890
What does that mean?

685
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,280
Marry Wan Xinxin, not remarry her.

686
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,360
Stop joking around.

687
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm not.

688
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,600
How long are they going to stay here?

689
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,080
Every day they're here, I can't eat or sleep.

690
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,120
I have no sense of security at all.

691
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,560
Xinxin.

692
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,100
You know, I haven't seen Ruirui for three years.

693
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,800
I feel like I've let her down.

694
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,120
She's here for summer vacation.

695
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,800
I want to spend more time with her.

696
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,360
Can you understand that?

697
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,080
I do understand that.

698
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,000
Ruirui is nice.

699
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,320
But your ex-wife...

700
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,040
Your ex-wife is too intimidating.

701
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,280
Look, every day.

702
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,530
She never gives me a pleasant look.

703
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,040
But she's your ex-wife.

704
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm your current girlfriend, right?

705
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,680
Yes, yes.

706
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,840
Because you're the official one.

707
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,000
So you need to be more generous, okay?

708
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,680
Am I not generous enough?

709
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,520
What about everything I've done these days?

710
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,800
I've been trying to win Ruirui's approval.

711
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,720
What more do you want from me?

712
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,840
Yes, you've been very generous and kind.

713
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,160
You really don't plan to remarry her?

714
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,840
No, I don't.

715
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,720
Then go tell her.

716
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,360
I'll find another time.

717
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,480
Why can't you tell her now?

718
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,920
Every time I bring this up, you dodge the issue.

719
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,080
Making excuses.

720
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,560
I think you have other ideas in mind.

721
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,320
No, it's for Ruirui.

722
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,720
I don't want to upset her.

723
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,560
Fine, if you won't talk to her.

724
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,100
Then I'll find a chance to talk to her myself.

725
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,120
Mom.

726
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,080
It's okay.

727
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,400
Mom.

728
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,800
Mom,

729
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,000
Ruirui,

730
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,720
do you really want me to be with your dad?

731
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,720
Alright.

732
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,160
Every time I cry in your arms,

733
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,880
I tell you why.

734
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,650
I really don't want to go on like this anymore.

735
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,800
Okay, I understand.

736
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,639
Mom.

737
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,080
It's okay.

738
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,760
It's okay. Please stop crying.

739
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,920
You little devil,

740
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,800
you pinched my hand.

741
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,040
I'm not even crying, why are you?

742
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,139
Alright, stop crying.

743
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,440
I forgive you.

744
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,360
Go upstairs and play. I need to talk with your mom.

745
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,520
You think just because you forgive me,

746
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,880
I'll forgive you?

747
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,199
Your method is so outdated,

748
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
not cool at all.

749
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,080
Not cool, huh?

750
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,290
I was cool before you even existed.

751
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,760
Go upstairs and play.

752
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,360
I need to talk to your mom.

753
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,219
Go upstairs. Go find your dad.

754
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,480
I hate you.

755
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,940
You're really treating her like a child.

756
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
Then let's talk about adult matters.

757
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,600
Okay,

758
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,170
what do you want to talk about? Have a seat.

759
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,620
You came back this time

760
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,450
because you're hoping to remarry him, right?

761
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,440
You're quite impetuous for your age.

762
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,200
I think we don't need to beat around the bush.

763
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,080
I believe you've already noticed.

764
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,810
Huaming and I are together now.

765
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
But why do you keep playing

766
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,160
the role of someone trying to break us up?

767
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,120
You're a mature woman,

768
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,200
why do such things, right?

769
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,120
First, you two aren't married yet.

770
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,970
How is he yours already?

771
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,920
Second, as his ex-wife,

772
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,160
I have both the right and obligation

773
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,090
to come back and see how he's doing.

774
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,040
Third, and most importantly,

775
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,800
I'm here for Ruirui.

776
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,810
As for you, being a potential stepmother candidate for Ruirui,

777
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,960
I need to come back and see

778
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,840
if you're good to Ruirui.

779
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,800
To evaluate. I'm doing the right thing, aren't I?

780
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,060
Yes, you're right,

781
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,040
but I just feel

782
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,840
you're like the police of the Pacific,

783
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,640
overstepping your boundaries.

784
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,000
Candidate?

785
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,800
I am now Huaming's legitimate

786
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,560
and only girlfriend.

787
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,880
And you?

788
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,400
You're not even in the lineup of candidates.

789
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,920
Second, you're already Huaming's ex-wife,

790
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,560
that's in the past.

791
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,080
While I am the present.

792
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,600
You, being in the past,

793
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,240
insist on interfering with the present,

794
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,120
insist on moving back here.

795
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,800
Isn't that time travel?

796
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,040
You insisted on moving back here,

797
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
so let me tell you:

798
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,360
There's only one outcome of time travel,

799
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,240
you'll have to go back where you came from.

800
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,040
Third, I just asked Huaming,

801
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,210
and he said he's not considering remarrying you.

802
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,520
Huaming is the kind of person

803
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,050
who always says one thing but thinks another.

804
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,560
Are you sure you know him?

805
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,440
So you're saying you know him better than I do?

806
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,240
Then why did you get divorced?

807
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,760
Is it because you knew each other too well?

808
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,000
We were college classmates.

809
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,440
After he returned from studying in the US,

810
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,820
I was the anesthesiologist for every one of his surgeries.

811
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,400
We dated for 4 years and were married for 8,

812
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,240
12 years in total.

813
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,240
Do you think I don't know him?

814
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,720
But you've forgotten

815
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,400
that you're divorced now.

816
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,040
Divorced for three years.

817
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,120
Yes, I admit it.

818
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,920
I admit the way I left him

819
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,240
was indeed cruel.

820
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,720
But he was once mine.

821
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,520
If I really wanted to compete with you,

822
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,160
you wouldn't stand a chance.

823
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,610
Because we have a child.

824
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Having a child

825
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,520
doesn't equal having love.

826
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,040
Fine, since you put it that way,

827
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,560
let's put it to the test.

828
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,320
I'll call him right now

829
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,650
and ask him out. Let's see what he says.

830
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,600
Whatever.

831
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,360
Hello?

832
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,080
Are you free the day after tomorrow evening?

833
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,480
I'd like to meet and talk.

834
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,240
I don't think that's necessary.

835
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,480
I mainly want to talk about Ruirui.

836
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,920
Well,

837
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,040
okay. Where?

838
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
At our home.

839
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,080
Wherever you are

840
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,380
will always be home for Ruirui and me.

841
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,520
Alright.

842
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,600
By the way, Huaming,

843
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,680
I hope this matter

844
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,720
stays between us.

845
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,400
Okay, see you the day after tomorrow.

846
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Love you.

847
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,080
You...

848
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,320
you're absolutely vicious!

849
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,800
Just you wait,

850
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,860
I won't let you get away with this.

851
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,520
Mr. Shi.

852
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,880
Have some water.

853
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,810
I'll put it here.

854
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,080
I just made this tea.

855
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,530
It detoxifies and beautifies.

856
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,800
This water is a bit hot.

857
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,040
When you drink it, you must

858
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,660
look, blow on it like this.

859
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,240
You understand?

860
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,280
Tell them to come to the meeting room later.

861
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,680
Go out and close the door.

862
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,720
Wait, what time is the meeting?

863
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,320
In 10 minutes.

864
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,280
In 10 minutes.

865
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,600
Can you look at me when you speak?

866
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,420
Employees should also

867
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,120
get out.

868
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,360
Fine. Drink your water.

869
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

870
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,440
What are you doing? You're so clumsy.

871
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,920
These are documents for the upcoming meeting.

872
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,640
I know. I know.

873
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,120
Go, go, go. Go print the documents.

874
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,400
Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry.

875
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,760
What's for dinner tonight?

876
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,040
Get out.

877
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,880
Okay.

878
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,400
This final show is crucial.

879
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,320
If we can achieve the expected results,

880
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,250
we'll be able to meet the client's requirements.

881
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,440
That's the general plan.

882
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,130
Do you have anything to add?

883
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,040
If not, let's proceed.

884
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,440
I disagree.

885
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,120
What's your opinion?

886
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,520
I think there's an issue with this project.

887
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,040
What issue?

888
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,400
I don't know,

889
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,850
but I just feel something's wrong.

890
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,720
Xu Ke, as a shareholder, opposes this project.

891
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,490
Does anyone have any opinions?

892
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,240
Let's put it to a vote.

893
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,880
Hey, you changed your hairstyle.

894
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,140
Yes! Does it look good? Do I look younger?

895
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
Come, let's eat.

896
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,920
Ruirui, eat more.

897
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,520
Good girl, have some braised pork.

898
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,520
He doesn't eat fatty meat. Don't you know that?

899
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,720
Here, have some ribs.

900
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,120
Come on.

901
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,580
The ribs are too tough.

902
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,080
Don't you know his teeth have been bothering him lately?

903
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,740
Ruirui, eat your vegetables.

904
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,520
Do we always have to

905
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,920
eat this, uncle?

906
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,680
Li.

907
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,960
Tao.
