1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,946
Sorry to be abrupt, but this is it for me.

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,618
Please forgive me for leaving you so soon.

3
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,255
Goodbye.

4
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,192
And thank you.

5
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:42,142
I wanted to end things beautifully, but…

6
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:46,713
the deep regret and attachment to life
pulled me back to reality.

7
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,185
Five years have since passed…

8
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,656
and embarrassingly, I'm still alive.

9
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,727
Nothing scares me anymore,

10
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,328
or so I thought.

11
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,197
That's against the school rules.

12
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,332
It needs to be much smaller.

13
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,834
Smaller than my palm.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,735
Okay…

15
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,604
"After writing the word 'big'
about a hundred times in the sand

16
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,673
I gave up dying and came back home."

17
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,043
Powerful poem, right?

18
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,179
Do you understand the meaning?

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,485
After writing the word "big"
about a hundred times,

20
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,888
he felt ridiculous
about wanting to die, and went home.

21
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,324
Does it make more sense now?

22
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:37,530
So then, what does the word "big"
indicate in this poem?

23
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,401
Ms. Morimura, what do you think?

24
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,972
Ms. Ichikawa, tell me what you think.

25
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,443
How about you… Ms. Tamura?

26
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,353
This isn't the time to study English.

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,588
Thank you.

28
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,424
Stop.

29
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,160
Give it back.

30
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,829
I said give it back!

31
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,998
What's going on?

32
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,300
Woah!

33
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,468
Ow…

34
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:27,280
Don’t get too emotional
if you can’t manage the class well.

35
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,650
Otherwise, students will become
more distant.

36
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,851
I will be careful.

37
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,986
Okay.

38
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,896
Are you okay?

39
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,265
I should've checked in earlier.

40
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:46,966
Gosh.

41
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,235
-I failed as your supporting teacher.
-No.

42
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,638
I'm the one who failed as a teacher.

43
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,873
I know you look down on me.

44
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,444
I guess that's why
you're being kind to me.

45
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,513
In any case…

46
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,051
The fact is, my days as a homeroom
teacher may be over soon.

47
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,653
See you tomorrow.

48
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,770
Sorry for making you wait.

49
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,405
-It's no problem.
-Trouble at work.

50
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:29,342
Being a teacher must be such hard work…

51
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,679
Working at the bank
must have its moments too, Mr. Kawahara.

52
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,380
Please, have a seat.

53
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:39,485
I wanted to thank you again
for saying "yes."

54
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,054
Not at all.

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,055
But…

56
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,991
Are you sure?

57
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,726
Of course I am!

58
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:51,431
It's a miracle
someone like you is still single.

59
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,368
It's like finding a bargain stock
that was unlisted.

60
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,873
I'd like to suggest one thing.

61
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,412
Let's not tell people
that we met each other

62
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,184
because our dads introduced us.

63
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,885
How come?

64
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,421
It seems old-fashioned,

65
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,293
and I don't want people to think
that I asked for my dad's help

66
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,664
because I couldn't find anyone
before my mid-thirties.

67
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,571
Maybe we can say
we met while we were on a trip?

68
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,539
I haven't been on a trip in years.

69
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,641
Oh, I see.

70
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,878
A dating app… Maybe not…

71
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,247
How about at an English school?

72
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,915
I can't speak any English.

73
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,387
Well then… Through a friend?

74
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,422
I don't have many friends.

75
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,859
Have I offended you somehow?

76
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,261
I don't want a relationship
founded on lies.

77
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,597
It's not that big of a deal…

78
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,233
Well then, may I ask you something?

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,668
Go ahead.

80
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,237
Why haven't you asked me about this?

81
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,438
What?

82
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,273
A woman you're thinking of marrying

83
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,475
has a cut on her face
but you're ignoring it

84
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,478
which is kind of cold or indifferent--

85
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,013
Apologies.

86
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,683
I thought you had a zit or something.

87
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,551
Not a zit, huh?

88
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,486
I had a physical fight with a student.

89
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,221
I'm actually quite hot-tempered.

90
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,392
I told a student off for messing about,
it got physical, and I got knocked down.

91
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,830
-I was bleeding!
-B-Bleed… What? Are you okay?

92
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,732
Excuse me.

93
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,502
We have an emergency.

94
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,839
It was the beginning of the worst evening.

95
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,508
KABUKICHO

96
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,346
A student used her parents' credit card

97
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,183
to frequent a host club.
The amount used came to…

98
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,284
A million yen?!

99
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,319
It's a host club called JOKER.

100
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:56,389
Ms. Ogawa!

101
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,207
Kaoru!

102
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,742
Hey, Kaoru!

103
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:16,776
Later, okay?

104
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,177
Come over soon!

105
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,382
Princess!

106
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,117
Is that a frown I see?

107
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,352
Kaoru! I missed you!

108
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,354
Been a while! Like 18 hours?

109
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,156
No, come sit next to me!

110
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,058
-You're mean!
-Not yet!

111
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:32,959
Come on!

112
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,094
But I like to face you when we talk!

113
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,363
"Get her out, now!"

114
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,265
What the hell?

115
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,401
This is part of my job as well?

116
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,568
"THE JOKER"!

117
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,904
Do you not care what happens to Natsuki?

118
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,640
I can't be bothered to be honest.

119
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:53,780
Because of an unlikable student
who doesn't even listen to me…

120
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:57,550
Why do I have to run around
Kabukicho at night?

121
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,598
-I have such annoying customers today!
-They're unbelievable!

122
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,467
Can you cooperate with Kira?

123
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,702
Okay. Let me know
when Ms. Takahashi gets here.

124
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,804
Noted!

125
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,407
Welcome!

126
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,576
I'm Ogawa from Pietas Girls' High School.

127
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,212
Can I check if my student is inside?

128
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,414
I can only allow customers to go in.

129
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,784
Are you okay if I call the police then?

130
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,053
Boss…

131
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,330
There must be a misunderstanding.

132
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:48,201
We don't allow high schoolers in here.

133
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,338
I need to check for myself.

134
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,173
THE JOKER

135
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,115
Open sesame.

136
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,088
Excuse me.

137
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,962
Thank you!

138
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,663
Go on!

139
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,398
Go on!

140
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,766
Fever Prince!

141
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,168
Fever Prince!

142
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,569
-Ta-da!
-Yeah!

143
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,871
-Ta-da!
-Yeah!

144
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,272
Fever Prince!

145
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,573
Fever Prince!

146
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,908
-Ta-da!
-Yeah!

147
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,176
-Ta-da!
-Yeah!

148
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,677
I want to buy a tower too!

149
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,112
-What?
-You want a tower?

150
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,080
Yes!

151
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,282
You can't drink, you'll get arrested!

152
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,450
He's right.

153
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,987
Ms. Sawaguchi?

154
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,624
I have money.

155
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,126
Don't be an idiot.

156
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,261
Natsuki…

157
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,397
We have to keep this slow and steady.

158
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,368
I want our relationship to last.

159
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,337
Ms. Ogawa!

160
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,340
Kaoru is crazy about you, you know.

161
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,709
Ms. Sawaguchi!

162
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,644
-Gosh!
-What?

163
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,878
No way…

164
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,180
I'm taking you home! Come on!

165
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,382
Who are you? Her mother?

166
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,950
Your mom's so worried!

167
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,053
Are you her housekeeper?

168
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,254
Her homeroom teacher!

169
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,256
-Teacher?
-I'm the supporting teacher!

170
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,626
-The supporting teacher?
-Here we go!

171
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,695
Here we go…

172
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,697
Hi, everyone.

173
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,401
I thank you all for coming
to my birthday party.

174
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,737
However, Kaoru…

175
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,273
What on earth is going on?

176
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,374
What's going on?

177
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:39,178
-Wait!
-Stop! Don't touch me!

178
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,413
This is weird!

179
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:51,924
Here.

180
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,093
Excuse me.

181
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,230
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TSUBASA

182
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,568
Don't worry, Tsubasa.

183
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,238
Sorry guys.
This is part of the entertainment.

184
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,741
This party's only just getting started!

185
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,644
-Go on!
-Go on!

186
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,512
Go on!

187
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,681
Go on!

188
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,583
Ms. Sawaguchi! Wait--

189
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,386
-Miss, join in!
-Move!

190
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,521
-Let's go!
-Hey!

191
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:25,658
Excuse me, let me through!

192
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,428
Ms. Sawaguchi!

193
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,299
Excuse me, Miss…

194
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,468
Do you think this is hell or something?

195
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,836
It's the opposite.

196
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,137
This is heaven.

197
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,741
A place that squeezes money
out of a high school student is heaven?

198
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,509
Call a taxi, please!

199
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,543
Okay.

200
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,547
I told them I wasn't in high school.

201
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,016
And I wasn't forced to pay!

202
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,517
Was it your own money?

203
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,287
Let's go home.

204
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,490
I won't go home!

205
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,658
Ms. Sawaguchi!

206
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,133
Ms. Sawaguchi, how would you
survive on your own?

207
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,069
It's thanks to your mom and dad

208
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,838
that you can eat every day,
and go to school, right?

209
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,541
You call yourself a teacher?

210
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,842
Excuse me?

211
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,513
"You'd easily be able to live
without your parents."

212
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,281
Aren't you supposed to encourage her?

213
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,517
Don't be irresponsible!

214
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,352
Wow, no sense of humor.

215
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,121
Poor you, Natsuki.

216
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,125
No one listens to her class.

217
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,994
Oh, really?

218
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,229
-So that's why she seems desperate.
-Yeah.

219
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,731
I feel bad for her.

220
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,866
You know nothing about me!

221
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,736
We've only met less than 30 minutes ago!

222
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,138
You feel bad for me?
I don't even know your name!

223
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,541
I see. She gets pedantic when she's angry.

224
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,376
Like a yappy puppy.

225
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,412
I know! Like a chihuahua!

226
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,381
You just yap away.

227
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,751
You can't be with a man
who sees women as cash cows!

228
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,153
Natsuki is my precious princess.

229
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,757
I got a taxi!

230
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,460
Let's go, Ms. Sawaguchi!

231
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,261
-Let go!
-Ms. Sawaguchi, stop it!

232
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:11,664
What?

233
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,234
Hey, that's enough! You're going home!

234
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,936
-Let go of me!
-Stop that!

235
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,239
The school will be in touch
with you regarding how you…

236
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,312
served a minor.

237
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,421
-Kaoru!
-Stop fighting!

238
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,790
-It's dangerous! Open the door, please!
-Stop!

239
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,992
-Open the door!
-I'm not going home!

240
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,193
Yes, you are!

241
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
-Stop it!
-Just talk to us!

242
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,464
-Get off of me!
-Hurry up and get in!

243
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,234
Driver, please start the car!
Ms. Ogawa, we're good--

244
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,435
Hey!

245
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,104
Hey, what are you doing?

246
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,346
Go home for now.

247
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,447
Okay?

248
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,876
I'm home.

249
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,045
Welcome back.

250
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,446
You're home late.

251
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,550
Are you hungry?

252
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:38,551
Yeah.

253
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,620
You were on a date
with Mr. Kawahara, right?

254
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,088
How was it?

255
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,089
Well…

256
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:46,959
Normal, I guess.

257
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,596
Normal?

258
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,631
You should talk to her.

259
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,367
You're right.

260
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,405
-Oh, damn it!
-Sorry.

261
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,512
I'll go check on Manami.

262
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,913
No, it's better if I go.

263
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,157
Sorry about that.

264
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:23,729
Yes?

265
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,232
What is it?

266
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,468
You said yes to the proposal, right?

267
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,836
Yes, for now.

268
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:31,971
Manami.

269
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,108
You shouldn't use words
like "for now" about such things.

270
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,712
Sorry.

271
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,915
If you've said yes, don't procrastinate.

272
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,785
If something like last time happens,
it's always the woman who gets hurt.

273
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,588
You can't say stuff like that,
it's sexist.

274
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,857
Aren't you a compliance officer?

275
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,293
I'm just worried, that's all.

276
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,430
He's my ex-classmate's son.

277
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,532
I'm sure about him.

278
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,301
Okay.

279
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,336
Thank you. I'll talk to him.

280
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,107
We had to cut the date short today.

281
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,409
Work stuff, huh?

282
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,546
I was at a host club.

283
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,053
That's an interesting joke.

284
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,022
Good night.

285
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,190
Good night.

286
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:34,199
MAIN TITLE

287
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,668
Chug it! Yeah!

288
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:36,869
Chug it!

289
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,771
Chug it! Yeah!

290
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,677
Five, six, seven, eight!

291
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,856
Use as much paper as you want.

292
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:09,401
Natsuki received seven days
of special disciplinary action.

293
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:15,774
Natsuki's grades have been stable,
and she's been a well-behaved student.

294
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,643
For her to do this…

295
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,246
Makes me think she was feeling lost
or was facing some issues.

296
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,482
As in, there were issues in our household?

297
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,852
No, that's not what she meant,
Mrs. Sawaguchi!

298
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,520
Right, Ms. Ogawa?

299
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,057
But maybe we can ask her
how she's feeling and hear her out.

300
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,525
Her feelings?

301
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,961
You're being too lenient.

302
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,231
Tell the host to send me a letter.

303
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:40,766
A letter?

304
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,370
A signed promise
that he will never contact Natsuki again.

305
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,074
Taiga?

306
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,676
You're home, right?

307
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,044
Open the door!

308
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,317
-Open the door!
-Isn't that your real name?

309
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,692
Is Kaoru here?

310
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,993
This is JOKER's…

311
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,628
A host club's dorm, right?

312
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,096
-No, it's not.
-What?

313
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,298
Can you go? You're creeping me out.

314
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,867
I'll call the police.

315
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,605
-What the hell are you doing?
-Taiga!

316
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,739
I will report you!

317
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,007
You're scaring me!

318
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,276
What an intense hag!

319
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,277
Is she our customer?

320
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,779
No, she isn't.

321
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,181
She tracked you down
and found out your real name?

322
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,416
That's terrifying.

323
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,552
You should be more careful.

324
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,990
A host recently got stabbed, you know.

325
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,694
See?

326
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,564
"A host in Kabukicho dies
after being stabbed!"

327
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,899
Oh, that.

328
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,774
Kaoru, you don't post much
on social media, do you?

329
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,577
With you're looks,
you'd be reeling them in if you did.

330
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,381
I don't like doing
the same things others do.

331
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,584
That's so cool.

332
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:08,720
What?

333
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,957
Okay, ready?

334
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,096
I don't like doing
the same things others do.

335
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,398
Oh, that was great. Do it again!

336
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,800
Shorten it by 20 seconds to fit this in.

337
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,269
-Okay.
-So, what news is gaining attention?

338
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,939
"Naked man breaks into
a congressman's dorm"

339
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:27,840
is at number one.

340
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,875
"A host gets stabbed" is second.

341
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,343
A host, huh?

342
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,113
Their stuff's always about money.
It's not interesting.

343
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,049
Housewives watching the evening news
might be interested.

344
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,951
-Stop that.
-Sorry.

345
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,487
A world you think you know but don't, huh?

346
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,289
If the company's paying,
I'll go and interview hosts!

347
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,058
We can't justify that.

348
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,259
-Tsukumo!
-Yes!

349
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,228
Call my police friend for some info.

350
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,295
Cool, thank you.

351
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,563
-Yomoda.
-Yes.

352
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,232
Contact the city news reporters.

353
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,133
Okay.

354
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,834
Hurry or it'll be evening soon!

355
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,704
That's a difficult topic to write on.

356
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,907
HOW I FEEL AFTER TURNING 18

357
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,877
Try writing how you truly feel.

358
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,845
HOW I FEEL AFTER TURNING 18
NATSUKI SAWAGUCHI

359
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,185
In the Takuboku Ishikawa poem
we did in class,

360
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,890
I think the word "big"
indicated that he wanted

361
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,559
to do something big
or become someone important.

362
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,463
As he wrote that word about a 100 times,
he was able to let that go

363
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,265
and lost the desire to die…

364
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,569
Ms. Sawaguchi.

365
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:36,141
If you listen to your heart like he did,
maybe you'll learn to love yourself more.

366
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,647
What does listening
to your heart even mean?

367
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,320
Everyone always says,
"You have to love yourself."

368
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,525
But I want to be rid
of my old self to change.

369
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,994
Rid of?

370
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,670
I…

371
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,739
slept with Kaoru.

372
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,511
I have no regrets.

373
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,481
The school…

374
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,951
and my parents…

375
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,354
They don't truly care.

376
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,358
They all think they can
control me through praise.

377
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,629
"You tried your best! Clap, clap!"

378
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,099
"You've done nothing wrong. There, there."

379
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,805
But not Kaoru.

380
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,276
Kaoru called me an idiot.

381
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,112
He said I was an idiot…

382
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,116
and then held me.

383
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,134
THE JOKER, Shinjuku branch's
June ranking! In third place is…

384
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,369
Yeah!

385
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,171
With a profit of over 8.5 million yen.

386
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,140
Crashing Love Island!

387
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,642
Yes!

388
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,844
-Congratulations!
-Yes!

389
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,079
-Nice one!
-Amazing!

390
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,948
Well done.

391
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,783
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

392
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,184
-Congratulations!
-Yes!

393
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,420
-Yeah! Those biceps!
-Nice!

394
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:33,792
In second place,
with a profit of over 9.3 million.

395
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,862
It's Manager Hiroto Sumeragi!
Congratulations!

396
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,463
Yes!

397
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,399
Thank you!

398
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,702
Nice one, Hiroto!

399
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,704
Keep this up next month!

400
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:46,838
-I will!
-Congrats.

401
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,040
Thank you!

402
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,076
-He's so hard on you!
-And in first place…

403
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,745
With a profit of over 11 million yen.

404
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,247
-What?
-11 million?

405
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,016
Tsubasa Super Player!

406
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,853
This is his fifth consecutive victory!

407
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,657
Well done, juggling work and studies,
I'm impressed.

408
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,459
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

409
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,162
I want to get up there too.

410
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,830
You'll be up there in no time!

411
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,032
-You think?
-Kaoru! There's a call for you.

412
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:14,933
Thank you.

413
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,134
-Me?
-Yes.

414
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,236
I feel bad about winning as a part-timer.

415
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,174
But it's thanks to all of you.

416
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,042
A signed promise?

417
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:28,413
Written proof that you promise
to never contact Natsuki again.

418
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,649
Hello?

419
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:33,952
Does 6:30 p.m. work for you?
The club opens at 7:00 p.m., right?

420
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,122
-Miss, you don't have a boyfriend, do you?
-Excuse me?

421
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,859
You think I would do this for free?

422
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,728
If so, you're very naive.

423
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,630
You need more experience
in the real world.

424
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,998
I appreciate your concern,

425
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,769
but I had a corporate job
before I became a teacher.

426
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,071
So what? That means nothing.

427
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:57,142
Just once, come to our club
as a paying customer.

428
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,146
Spending some money on a host
will be a great experience for you.

429
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,316
Do that for me, and you'll get the letter.

430
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,784
See you soon, I hope!

431
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,586
Hey. What? Wait…

432
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:21,967
Is this all you packed?

433
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,803
I left everything apart from work stuff.

434
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,905
I see.

435
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,641
I guess it's easier
to get over it that way.

436
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,844
Are you happy I got divorced?

437
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,446
Momoko!

438
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,815
Of course not!
I wouldn't be here helping if I were.

439
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,487
So, how's it going for you
with the banker your dad introduced you?

440
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,624
Where do you want your cactus?

441
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,626
You need to grow up and face reality.

442
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,194
Actually, I'm just too mature.

443
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,296
Yeah, in years.

444
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,566
I want coffee.

445
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:55,734
Pour me some too.

446
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,102
Okay.

447
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,873
-Hey
-Yes?

448
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,676
Have you ever been to a host club?

449
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,111
A host club?

450
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,781
I'm doing a piece on them now, but… Why?

451
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,050
Oh! Are you into hosts now?

452
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,118
No way!

453
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,354
I'm just curious because I had trouble
with a host recently.

454
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,522
I see.

455
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,625
-One of your students, right?
-What? How did you…

456
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:21,927
It's a big social issue.

457
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,962
I heard that the host who got stabbed

458
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,965
was using pushy sales tactics
on young girls too.

459
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:31,436
Hosts are all scummy, evil,
awful people, right?

460
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:35,507
Well, they make girls spend a lot of money
for them through sweet talk.

461
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,843
I do think it's a world full of lies.

462
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,513
I have to get a signed promise
from a host.

463
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,616
Just ask him to meet you
at a café or somewhere!

464
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,851
He rejected that.

465
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,887
He said he'll do it if I go
to the club as a customer.

466
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,655
That's malicious!

467
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,791
Making such a request
to an earnest teacher!

468
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,594
How interesting!

469
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,329
What?

470
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,699
-It's quite expensive…
-Really?

471
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,336
Welcome to JOKER!

472
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,507
Ms. Momotaro on the left, and…

473
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,376
Ms. Chihuahua?

474
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,580
Nice to meet you, I'm Kaoru.

475
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,682
I'll take it.

476
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,984
Kaoru, huh?

477
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,753
Wow, good looking as expected!

478
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,954
What?

479
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,925
Ms. Momotaro, you want to see
my underwear, don't you?

480
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,159
What?

481
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,962
Oh, yes, I do!

482
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,497
I can't show you that!

483
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,332
I can show you this though.

484
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,134
Wow!

485
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,036
You're good! Very good!

486
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,571
-Right?
-Excuse me!

487
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,674
The reason I came here today

488
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:46,177
is for the signed promise
you said you'd write if I came here

489
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,479
as a customer.

490
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,115
-Yes, I know.
-I'm here as her guardian.

491
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,149
Oh, I see.

492
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,687
I don't drink alcohol.
I'll only pay the minimum fee.

493
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,188
That's okay, right?

494
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,724
I'll treat you both to a drink.

495
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,893
Feel free to leave after that.

496
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,864
Are you sure?

497
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,533
In that case, can I have a beer?

498
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,435
-A non-alcoholic beer for her.
-No.

499
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,003
Oolong tea, please.

500
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,939
-Sure.
-Put it on my tab.

501
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,473
Okay.

502
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:17,008
Hey.

503
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,778
He doesn't seem scummy or evil so far.

504
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:20,679
Hey!

505
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,781
It's fine, I'm used to it.

506
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,551
People tend to think
that hosts are the scum of the earth.

507
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:30,922
Are they not?

508
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,363
Oh, my, stop gazing
into each other's eyes!

509
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,465
Takechiyo, Takechiyo!
Nyokkikki! One gnocchi!

510
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,801
-Hello, I'm Takechiyo!
-Was that a new joke?

511
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,369
-You're so loud!
-Welcome!

512
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,037
As a teacher,

513
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,741
I cannot forgive how you played
with a high schooler's heart and…

514
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,843
Played with her heart and?

515
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,379
What?

516
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,714
What did I do?

517
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,050
I slept with Kaoru.

518
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,390
I love Natsuki, you know.

519
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,327
Oh, really.

520
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,297
All the more reason
to write a signed promise then.

521
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,434
Support her so she can concentrate
on her studies for university.

522
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:19,204
If you really love her.

523
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,311
Miss, I don't want to do this
while drinking.

524
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:27,512
It's too important.

525
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,450
I'll write it at home
and send it to you tomorrow.

526
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,053
Really?

527
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:36,588
Really.

528
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,958
Promise?

529
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:42,961
I promise, Ms. Chihuahua.

530
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,236
Why didn't you message me back?

531
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,006
I was so childish the last time I saw you.

532
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,074
I felt ashamed.

533
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,575
You shouldn't be.

534
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:00,412
Once we get married,
fighting will be normal… Oh, no!

535
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,981
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

536
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,984
We'll work it out together, okay?

537
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:10,789
DRINK BAR

538
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,958
I have to say I was kind of glad…

539
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,563
to find out that you don't like lying.

540
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:22,233
If you had said,
"Yeah, fine, let's say we met on a trip."

541
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,704
and were nonchalant about it,
it would've put me off.

542
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:31,643
I want to marry someone who's honest.

543
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,180
I'm not honest though.

544
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,283
-What?
-I…

545
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,886
There's something I've been hiding.

546
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,955
It's why I didn't want to lie anymore.

547
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,357
What is it?

548
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,625
Up to now,

549
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,730
I pretended as if I had never had
a serious relationship, but…

550
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,633
I used to date someone
at my former workplace and--

551
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,669
Don't worry about it.

552
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,839
We're both over thirty,
so it's nothing surprising.

553
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,440
He was my senior at work.

554
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,410
I mean, it's weirder
if you've never dated before.

555
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,512
We were engaged.

556
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,061
I'm sorry.

557
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,802
I really am.

558
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,874
He fell for someone else,
and I got dumped.

559
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:43,748
But I struggled to let him go, and…

560
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,751
Seems the data's submitted
so I'll go check.

561
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,119
It's fine! You can go home.

562
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,855
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

563
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,528
-I stalked him.
-Bye.

564
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,636
Sent him loads of presents…

565
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,072
Did I not put enough effort
into my clothes or makeup?

566
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:14,012
Or was I too sloppy when I stayed over?

567
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:20,051
I bet I overwhelmed you
because I got jealous easily too.

568
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,053
I kept checking where you were, and…

569
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,122
I called him many times crying.

570
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,191
Tell me, what did I do wrong?

571
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,625
I can change, I promise!

572
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,994
Exceeded recording time.

573
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,030
If you are happy with your…

574
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,270
Excuse me!

575
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,072
Ms. Manami Ogawa?

576
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,240
In the end,

577
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,376
he reported me to the police.

578
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,813
It wasn't made public,

579
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,383
but the company forced me
into a voluntary resignation.

580
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,254
Everyone, thank you for--

581
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,757
Mr. Honma! Sorry to bother you,
about the campaign in January…

582
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,897
I liked the poster!
That mochi looked like a book!

583
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,465
That wasn't the intention!

584
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,433
No?

585
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,410
I tried so hard to get a job

586
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,281
with that company
so I can publish books, but…

587
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,085
that dream was taken from me.

588
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:39,998
After that…

589
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,048
After that…

590
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,020
I didn't leave home for a year.

591
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,559
My dad was worried and pushed me
to become a teacher at my alma mater,

592
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,162
but I had no motivation.

593
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:18,469
The students saw right through me,
which is why they don't respect me.

594
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:25,109
I told myself to never fall in love again.

595
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,449
I agreed to date you
because you're not exactly my type,

596
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,085
and I thought I wouldn't be
obsessed with you.

597
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,822
I'm sorry.

598
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,161
That's such a selfish reason.

599
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:57,542
Please tell your parents
we're calling off the engagement.

600
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,611
-Oh, it's fizzling out!
-It's still going!

601
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,914
-No! Wait!
-It can do it!

602
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,215
Gosh, it's gone out!

603
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,616
I've ended it.

604
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:06,884
CAFE RESTAURANT GUSTO

605
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,053
I hurt him.

606
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,292
Why can't I make a relationship work?

607
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,095
-Bye!
-See you!

608
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,262
See you!

609
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,141
Ms. Ogawa.

610
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,812
It's been a week already.

611
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:38,883
I don't think the host
ever had the intention to write

612
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,486
a signed promise, don't you think so?

613
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,921
They're pros at conning women.

614
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,603
Thank you for calling THE JOKER.

615
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:03,241
This heaven won't be open until 7:00 p.m.!

616
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,147
Ms. Ogawa!

617
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,785
Let's just apologize
to Ms. Sawaguchi's parents.

618
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,587
I can't tell them I failed now.

619
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:20,324
There are many clubs in Kabukicho
that use pushy sales tactics.

620
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,494
You have no chance against these people!

621
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,196
Give me one more day.

622
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,966
Why are you being stubborn
all of a sudden?

623
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:36,207
Stubbornness is my only weapon.

624
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,514
KAORU

625
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,157
HIHI TTEOKBOKKI

626
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,358
Hot day again today!

627
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,994
I can't change that, unfortunately!

628
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:36,734
THE JOKER

629
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,436
Open sesame.

630
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,152
"A small, small…"

631
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,286
THE RABBITS' WEDDING

632
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,254
"…rabbit."

633
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,156
Well done!

634
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,258
Can you read more?

635
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,760
Hang on, I need to talk to your brother.

636
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,861
Okay.

637
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,732
"A white rabbit and a black rabbit…"

638
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,171
I thought he was cured.

639
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,042
Apparently, he needs
to continue the treatment.

640
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,145
It's going to cost a lot.

641
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,918
I'm not asking you for money by the way.

642
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,123
You only contact me when you need money.

643
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,563
I want Yuki to get better.

644
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,532
He's my treasure.

645
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,337
I'm also your son…

646
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,840
but I must be your trash.

647
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,159
No, I can't take it.

648
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,796
Yuki!

649
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,364
It's ready!

650
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,835
Don't run!

651
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,204
Hey, hey! There we go!

652
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:23,040
Taiga, can you read me this book?

653
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,077
He doesn't have the time.

654
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,578
He's the number one host!

655
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,984
That's amazing! You're the number one?

656
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,056
See you soon.

657
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,697
Right, let's go!

658
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:52,136
-What about the hospital?
-Why? Are you in pain?

659
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,943
Are you waiting for Kaoru?

660
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,711
No…

661
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,450
You're a teacher, right?

662
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,555
I like the intellectual look.

663
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,590
What?

664
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,227
There are many hosts with degrees now.

665
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,566
I don't want to bitch about Kaoru,
but he lacks intelligence.

666
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,539
I have no intention
of becoming a customer here.

667
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:35,346
You and Kaoru are basically
the same person to me.

668
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,382
Miss!

669
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,483
-How harsh!
-Hello.

670
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,519
Hi. Hot today, huh?

671
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,056
I wanted to tell you something, Tsubasa.

672
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:46,657
Yes?

673
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,527
You don't need a degree to be a host.

674
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:55,766
I just meant that intelligence matters
in the hospitality industry nowadays.

675
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,270
You can't be a good host
being that small-minded.

676
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,572
A good host dedicates his life to the job.

677
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:07,111
What's the point of dedicating your life
to such an underclass job like this.

678
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,113
Then why do you seem so desperate?

679
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:14,852
I'm just trying to make money
to start a business in the future.

680
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,757
Unlike you, I'm not an idiot
who can't think ahead!

681
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,359
Hey! Stop it!

682
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,661
You're being very rude!

683
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:24,795
And you!

684
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,332
-Violence can get you sacked.
-Oh, really?

685
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,968
Miss.

686
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,203
Thank you.

687
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,506
He's cool, isn't he?

688
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,845
Why did I have to step in?

689
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,347
You never disappoint, Ms. Chihuahua.

690
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,483
I'm not your teacher.

691
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,985
Anyway, where's your signed promise?

692
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,620
You said you'll send it to me.

693
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,888
Oh, I guess I did.

694
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,456
You guess?

695
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,859
Write it now.

696
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,228
-Now?
-Here you go.

697
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,462
-All right…
-Good morning!

698
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,498
-Morning!
-You're here early.

699
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,834
Miss, not here please.

700
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,836
You, try eating this!

701
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,037
This is our tteokbokki.

702
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,340
Why do you only have soy sauce flavor?

703
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,975
People prefer it this way!

704
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,710
Don't be ridiculous!

705
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,845
Miss, do you want some tteokbokki?

706
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,847
Hey, don't startle her.

707
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,115
Hey, I'm talking to you!

708
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,016
Go home already!

709
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,252
How could you say that!

710
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,120
I hope your store shuts down!

711
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,990
Honestly, I hate Kabukicho!

712
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:32,096
THAI MASSAGE
MEN'S PARADISE BEAUTY SALON

713
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,330
Come in.

714
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,678
Is this where you live?

715
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:48,679
Yes, why?

716
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,749
I can't set foot in the room
of a man I don't know!

717
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:52,716
You know me!

718
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,418
I won't come in.

719
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,755
You'll be fine.

720
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,124
I'm not desperate for a woman.

721
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,298
Miss,

722
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,968
I guess Natsuki said
something happened between us.

723
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,536
But that's a lie.

724
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,604
What?

725
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,775
Girls that age like to pretend
they are adults.

726
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,045
Even so, I don't feel comfortable!

727
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,280
What a yappy chihuahua…

728
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,385
Fine. Let's go upstairs.

729
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,932
KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT

730
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,467
Is this better?

731
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,970
Good view, right?

732
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,776
So, what should I write?

733
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,445
Let's keep it simple.

734
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:32,416
"I will never contact
Ms. Natsuki Sawaguchi again."

735
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,919
Then the date and your name.

736
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,527
The kanji for Natsuki
are "summer" and "hope."

737
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,031
Oh, please sign with your real name,
not your host name.

738
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,534
What?

739
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:48,192
-There you go.
-Thank you very much.

740
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:54,898
Is this a joke?

741
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:59,003
-Nope.
-But this is like a child's doodle.

742
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,170
I WILL NOT CONTACT NATSUKI

743
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:02,539
I can't write many kanji.

744
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,042
I barely went to school.

745
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,143
Barely?

746
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,380
Until I was in third grade,
I went half of the time, and…

747
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,215
three days in junior high.

748
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,086
Why are you so surprised?

749
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,690
There are many people
who didn't go to school.

750
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,293
Excuse me, but…

751
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,230
Can I ask why?

752
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,099
"Why"?

753
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:31,835
Hey.

754
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:34,938
Is your dad rich?

755
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,340
What?

756
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,110
You look like you grew up
in a nice environment.

757
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,514
I've met 300 women in the year

758
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,417
since I became a host
so I can tell these things.

759
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,888
You’re basically
from an upper-class family.

760
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,956
Not really.

761
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,591
My dad is an office worker.

762
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,827
Is he a manager?

763
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,497
Perhaps a board member of a big company?

764
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,166
Well…

765
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,670
I don't have a dad.

766
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,706
My mom's like a tick?

767
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,107
A parasite.

768
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,845
Anyway, that's the reason.

769
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,480
So that'll have to do.

770
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,249
Wait. Mr. Takamori!

771
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:25,656
Can you at least try
and write your name in kanji?

772
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,991
I told you, I can't write kanji!

773
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,293
I don't even want to!

774
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,395
Writing your name right is important.

775
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,131
For your future.

776
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,333
My future?

777
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,607
I'll help you.

778
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,340
Not that "taka".

779
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,509
"Taka" as in hawk.

780
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,277
I hate that kanji.

781
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,147
That is a difficult one.

782
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:25,215
I wouldn't like writing it either…

783
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,924
Are the kanji for Taiga,
"big" and "river"?

784
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,026
No. It's "big" and…

785
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,530
The right side is like messy.

786
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,331
Do you know it?

787
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,134
Is it "elegance"?

788
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:45,335
Is it?

789
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,472
TAIGA TAKAMORI

790
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,873
Yeah, that's it.

791
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,680
I PROMISE TO NEVER CONTACT
MS. NATSUKI SAWAGUCHI

792
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:02,352
That's not a bad name.

793
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,033
Wait, hang on.

794
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:18,669
Here.

795
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,304
I…

796
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,207
The kanji is…

797
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,876
It's the katakana for "mu."

798
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,644
-Mu?
-Yes.

799
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,047
Mu. There.

800
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,249
Dot, dot, dot.

801
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,283
-Dot…
-That's it.

802
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,385
Like that and a square?

803
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:37,588
-Yes.
-Like this?

804
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:40,123
-"Mouth" here, right?
-Yes, that's right!

805
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,260
-Under that is a diagonal…
-Diagonal.

806
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,695
Yes, like that!

807
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:45,996
Like this? And…

808
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,297
-Wait, hang on.
-What?

809
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,467
The kanji for "summer" has two lines.

810
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,737
-Oh no.
-No, it's okay!

811
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,205
We can just add a line.

812
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,974
-Oh, I can?
-Sure!

813
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,975
I see.

814
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,843
-A straight line…
-Yes.

815
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,813
Great! Wow, you're doing so well!

816
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,181
-Go slowly.
-Okay.

817
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,750
-Next part's in hiragana.
-This one.

818
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:07,818
Oh no, that's wrong!

819
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:10,020
That’s a shame.

820
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,122
Can't I just leave it like this?

821
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,258
No, we can't.
I'm sorry, let's start again.

822
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,160
This sucks!

823
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,729
Fine.

824
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,632
Here, we have…

825
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:23,066
-Two lines?
-Yes, good!

826
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,736
-"Mouth", and then diagonal lines…
-Diagonal.

827
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:26,870
Like that!

828
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:28,538
-And then…
-Oh!

829
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,174
-What?
-The kanji for "Sai" is wrong…

830
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,109
What?

831
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,044
It should be the other way round.

832
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,214
What? Why didn't you say so earlier?

833
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,181
My bad.

834
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:40,817
Sorry.

835
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,421
The kanji for "summer" is…

836
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:45,789
-Two lines?
-Yes!

837
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,224
-Okay.
-It looks better.

838
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,693
-And after this, there's a "one", and…
-Yes.

839
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,629
-And the line doesn't go over. Perfect!
-Okay.

840
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:54,264
Write the kanji for "car."

841
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,399
-Car?
-Yes.

842
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,968
-The same one you see in "train"?
-Yes.

843
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,039
Car…

844
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,241
Nice! On the first try!

845
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,843
-And then, a wiggly line…
-A wiggly line.

846
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,112
Exactly!

847
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,882
-Okay next, the numbers.
-I can write numbers!

848
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,918
I love numbers and money!

849
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,621
I see. Okay. Your name, please.

850
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,856
I hate the kanji for my surname.

851
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,625
One more line? Or two?

852
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,993
-Two more.
-Two?

853
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,028
This line comes out, and…

854
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,830
-That's it.
-And then the dots.

855
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,834
It's supposed to be only four dots.

856
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,836
Does it matter?

857
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,772
-But it's your name.
-Jeez!

858
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,341
I'm done!

859
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,009
Hey! Wait!

860
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,377
-What?
-Just once more!

861
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,379
I'll help you until you get it.

862
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,815
Yes, that's it!

863
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,817
The part you're good at… Yes!

864
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,119
-Good! Period.
-And then period.

865
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,854
Next are the numbers.

866
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,089
I'm fine with numbers!

867
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,156
Oh, that's right.

868
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:56,226
Two lines and then… Okay.

869
00:49:57,227 --> 00:50:00,297
Exactly! And the dots under it.

870
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:01,732
-Four, right?
-Yes!

871
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:02,733
In good balance…

872
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:06,636
One, two, three, four.

873
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,572
-Yes! Good!
-Okay.

874
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,474
-Two horizontal lines, right?
-Yes.

875
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,310
-Like this?
-Yes, that's correct!

876
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,978
Is this the same as this one?

877
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:17,214
Oh? Yeah, you're right! It's the same.

878
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,148
Then it's easy!

879
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,150
-Woah, slow down!
-Slowly…

880
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,719
-Yes! I did it!
-Wow!

881
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,323
You did it! Well done!

882
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:27,991
I'm proud of you.

883
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,460
Truly! Well done!

884
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,263
Thank you!

885
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,832
I'll take it back safely.

886
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,001
I can go now, right?

887
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:39,870
Wait!

888
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,304
What for?

889
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,710
I don't want to be disrespectful,
but why don't you take this?

890
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,645
I PROMISE TO NEVER CONTACT
MS. NATSUKI SAWAGCHI

891
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,782
You want me to practice?

892
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,151
Taiga Takamori.

893
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,620
It's a very cool name.

894
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,524
Thank you.

895
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,196
Hey.

896
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,132
Can you write your name here?

897
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,668
-My name?
-Yeah, I don't know it.

898
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,304
It's only fair now that you know mine.

899
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:16,907
That's true.

900
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,584
My name is Manami Ogawa.

901
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,855
That's a nice surname.

902
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,091
It's a very common surname.

903
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:37,127
I mean, it looks so easy to write!

904
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,395
-What?
-Look!

905
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,363
Three lines, and another three lines!

906
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:42,199
That's what you meant!

907
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,502
Just six lines? That's too easy!

908
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,037
I never realized it!

909
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,572
You're so lucky!

910
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:49,773
I guess so!

911
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,748
It healed, huh?

912
00:51:58,815 --> 00:51:59,783
What?

913
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:04,154
The first time I saw you,
you had a plaster on.

914
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,757
Being a teacher can't be easy.

915
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:30,013
Goodbye.

916
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,182
Ms. Manami Ogawa.

917
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,246
So, what's your plan?

918
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:06,816
You're not going to marry the teacher?

919
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,085
Yeah…

920
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:15,125
Isn't her dad a board member
of your client?

921
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,260
You said it'll be good for your career.

922
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,495
Yeah…

923
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,834
I mean, I want to marry her.

924
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,405
Her specifically?

925
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,908
You don't care
who you get married to, do you?

926
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,444
Well, yes.

927
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:37,214
Because…

928
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:43,853
married men tend to be
perceived better in the financial world.

929
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,392
What? What are you?

930
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,864
I would feel more at ease

931
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,501
if you got married too to be honest.

932
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,708
I was able to get the signed promise!

933
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:09,879
Do you really think this will stop them
from getting in touch?

934
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,314
My goodness!

935
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,884
What terrible handwriting!

936
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,920
How can we trust someone
with such handwriting?

937
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,656
But he took it seriously!

938
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,891
I would like to trust him.

939
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:36,172
Why did I say that I will trust
a host who conned one of my students?

940
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:42,279
Maybe because it was the first time
I felt the joy of teaching.

941
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,850
And maybe…

942
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,388
because I now know his real name.

943
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,455
TAIGA TAKAMORI

944
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,144
Stand up!

945
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,086
Bow! Good afternoon!

946
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,188
Good afternoon.

947
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,225
Good afternoon.

948
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,126
Sit down.

949
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:39,869
Good evening.

950
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:40,770
Good evening.

951
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:41,838
TAIGA TAKAMORI
MANAMI OGAWA

952
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,907
Good evening!

953
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,009
You seem motivated today.

954
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:48,878
Excuse me!

955
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,451
You know the high school teacher
who was here recently?

956
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,552
Yeah.

957
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,655
I think I can get her.

958
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,192
Her dad's a board member,

959
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,661
she had a privileged upbringing,
and has serious money.

960
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:05,995
She's craving love?

961
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,104
She's pretty lonely.

962
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,207
That's the most important factor.

963
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,076
Make her dreams come true.

964
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,980
I'll make you proud.

965
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,449
I'll nurture the relationship…

966
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:30,954
just as you taught me.

967
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,226
I think he's the best kind
of man to marry. But…

968
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:37,994
He looks promising.

969
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,396
Up high…

970
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,531
I'll teach you something too.

971
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:47,937
THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS
