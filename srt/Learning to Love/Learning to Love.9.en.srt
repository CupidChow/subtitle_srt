1
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,979
(Manami) I left home at night when the summer vacation is nearing the end

2
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:17,083
A door that an ordinary person would have opened long ago

3
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,354
Finally, I opened my head

4
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,628
 (Momoko) Hmm... Come in

5
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,731
 (Aimi) Ah... I've arrived

6
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,341
You managed to escape well

7
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,880
 (two laughter)

8
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,817
-(Aimi) Water... Please (Momoko) Yes Yes

9
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,429
 (Hiroto) Sosole Pour (Matsuura) Tonight is "THE JOKER" Please come to the last night (hosts)!

10
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,963
 (Matsuura) Tonight is "THE JOKER" Please come to the last night (Hiroto) and bring it to the sooth

11
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,532
Thank you very much (hosts) Give it!

12
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,966
 (Hiroto) Soore, pour it

13
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:07,967
 (hosts) Pour it!

14
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:10,437
 (Matsuura) Let's get excited until the end

15
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,539
(Hosts' Calls)

16
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,307
(Sasaki) My name is Sasaki from Nishishinjuku Police Station

17
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,377
Is there anyone in charge?

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,554
(Siren for police cars)

19
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:37,730
(Water washing sound)

20
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:41,201
(Door opening and closing sound)

21
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,536
(Takechiyo) Ugh...

22
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,271
(Kaworu) Is it okay?

23
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,110
(Takechiyo) Kaworu and others won't get caught, right?

24
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,780
(Kaworu) Ah... I wonder what it would be, I'll go for now

25
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,582
(Takechiyo) Please come back for sure

26
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,017
- (Takechiyo) Absolutely- (Kaworu) It might be a permanent farewell

27
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,686
- (Takechiyo) What!? - (Kaworu) That's it

28
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,154
Kaworu-san!

29
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,525
(Aimi) Good morning

30
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,794
-(Momoko) Sorry, did you wake up? - (Aimi) Ugh

31
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,131
It was a huge snoring and grinding teeth

32
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,398
What!

33
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,968
(Momoko) Woooo ha ha ha

34
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,671
School today? What about the room?

35
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,040
Well, you can stay there until you find it

36
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,209
(Aimi) I've already decided on the room

37
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,880
I'll take care of you until the screening is passed

38
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,350
Finally, I'm living alone, the long-awaited dream.

39
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,752
It's too late

40
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,722
Well, it might be lonely at first

41
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,324
That person really knows what you want to do, right?

42
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,094
Kawahara: Marriage to Nanigashi

43
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,096
Kaworu's too

44
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,333
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,202
(Momoko) Ah, sorry, eat something else

46
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,170
- (Aimi) Yes - (Momoko) Drinking refrigerator

47
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,438
(Aimi) Thank you

48
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,174
(Momoko) No

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,542
there were…

50
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,678
Yes Good morning

51
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,783
yes

52
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,853
What? What is the charge?

53
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,125
Understood... I'll go right now

54
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,862
Momoko? Are you okay?

55
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,997
(Momoko) Yes

56
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,802
Yesterday, Joker was raided.

57
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,103
Raid investigation?

58
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,306
Apparently he is suspected of violating the Entertainment Business Act

59
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,076
So, today the cast members are questioned.

60
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,511
What...

61
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,114
Kaworu seems to be one of them

62
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,553
If I'm serious about you

63
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,989
I didn't intend to oppose it

64
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,425
But things have changed

65
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:51,698
Once it's been a police incident, you should never get involved.

66
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,200
If you receive a strange misunderstanding

67
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,270
Work and your new life will be messed up

68
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,241
Protect yourself

69
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,111
nice?

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,352
(Aimi) Yes (vibration sound from my cell phone) Sorry I'm going

71
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,956
Yes, yes...

72
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,693
(Aimi) I have a friend who is serious about worrying me.

73
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:26,666
Is there anyone to protect him?

74
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,621
Wow!

75
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,590
(Kaworu)

76
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,769
that

77
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,906
The detective told me to come at 9am

78
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,842
(Akai) What's your name?

79
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,844
- (Kaworu) Kaworu- (Akai) Ah, my real name

80
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,715
Takamori Taiga

81
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:52,452
Ah, hawks are bird hawks, forest

82
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,153
And it's big

83
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,789
Miyabi said this... The right side was messy...

84
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,191
(Akai) What is your occupation?

85
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,261
It's the host

86
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,500
Kabukicho "THE JOKER"

87
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,939
(Kawahara) Joker suspects of violating the Raid Investigation Entertainment Business Act...

88
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,945
- (Kawahara) What!? - (Male) What!?

89
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,047
(Shop clerk) Sorry for keeping you waiting for your replacement

90
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,448
(Men's English)

91
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,622
(Sanae) That shop...

92
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,726
Apparently the police are being investigated

93
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,965
(Seiji) Enforcement after the amendment of the Entertainment Business Act

94
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,035
To show that you are putting effort into it

95
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,139
It's a good look

96
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,210
Show me...

97
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,413
That's what society is like

98
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,120
Even the host who misled Aimi

99
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,523
The bat will hit

100
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,361
(Sanae) Hi!

101
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:13,065
(Akai) I heard that the competition between hosts was fierce.

102
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:17,970
Ah, you know that the Entertainment Business Act was revised in June, right?

103
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,408
I thought it was my job to aim for the top

104
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,478
That's cool

105
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:30,883
I guess he gave me a gift in the love business

106
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,788
Didn't you make a girl fall in love with you and come to the store?

107
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,792
Hey

108
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,297
Why did you become a host?

109
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,266
You could get as many days as you want

110
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:56,342
I wouldn't have survived without my night work

111
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,079
(Ueno) I saw the news

112
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:05,685
(Ueno) You haven't met that host anymore, have you?

113
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,819
yes

114
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,392
I believed

115
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,896
(Emiko) I also believed

116
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:17,930
(Sakura) Good evening

117
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,132
Oh goodness

118
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,172
(Sakura) Ogawa Sensei

119
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:30,643
(Students' talk)

120
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,846
(Sakura) Something I'm curious about about Takamori-san

121
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,853
(Akai) You can leave today

122
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,656
Ah, I got mad

123
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,291
(Akai) Ah, a bit

124
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,793
It says what you said

125
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,830
If there are no issues, sign here

126
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,778
It may be used later as evidence

127
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,648
If there is a mistake, it's not just for you

128
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,784
It will affect other employees and customers too.

129
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,520
Please read carefully

130
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,897
(Sakura) People with dyslexia have written a report issued by the police.

131
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,465
It may not be readable

132
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,101
Sign as you say

133
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,370
I hear there are cases where there are disadvantages

134
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,707
But I can't meet Takamori anymore

135
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:40,012
For Takamori, who has been unable to go to school until now

136
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,382
Professor Ogawa is like his first teacher.

137
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,019
Is there anything you can do?

138
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,823
Ah... sorry

139
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,596
I've been saying the pretext up until now

140
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,734
I want to support Ogawa-sensei and Takamori-san.

141
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:09,642
I myself have never had a love blessed by others...

142
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,414
Are you happy without being blessed?

143
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,652
I wonder...

144
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,826
It's not that you fall in love with people to be happy

145
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,215
(Kaworu) It's no use telling me it's not good.

146
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,251
I've been told that it's difficult to remember the letters by birth

147
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,527
(Akai) You're very careful

148
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,063
Is it something inconvenient?

149
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,909
(Kaworu) Everyone looks like that

150
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,712
After all, it's impossible to tell me

151
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,714
How much more?

152
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,929
(Akai) What's wrong?

153
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,799
I don't write anything that difficult

154
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,379
Ah! sorry!

155
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,981
Sorry it's okay

156
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,785
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

157
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,389
Sorry, could you please connect to the Criminal Division?

158
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,659
(Akai) Takamori-san

159
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,397
Is there any reason why you can't sign it?

160
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,099
(Kaworu) Ah, no...

161
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,168
The kanji here...

162
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,904
(Akai) What about it? knock)

163
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,906
- (Akai) Please- (Detective A) Excuse me

164
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,642
(Detective A) Is it a little better to be a section chief?

165
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,590
I'm from the Criminal Affairs Division, what do you need?

166
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:40,159
(Aimi) Umm... here

167
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,029
I heard that Takamori Taimasa was being questioned

168
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,000
I have a request

169
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:52,471
Takamori has difficulty reading and writing

170
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,608
There is no problem with verbal communication

171
00:12:56,375 --> 00:13:00,412
I can't read long sentences easily

172
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,916
Please read text or write a signature

173
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,652
Please take enough time

174
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,957
Requests have been accepted

175
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,128
So, what are you talking about with Takamori?

176
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:23,302
Are you a family member? Or is it a Joker customer?

177
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,671
It's not

178
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,042
I'm just a friend

179
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,678
Your friend...

180
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,247
What's your name?

181
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,716
(Momoko) If you receive a strange misunderstanding

182
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,020
Work and your new life will be messed up

183
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,823
My name is Ogawa Aimi

184
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,226
Eh... Manami?

185
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,695
Ah, I love it, I'm fruitful

186
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,168
Please look forward to working with us

187
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,439
So, excuse me

188
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,450
(Nao) Stop being a little gross

189
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,087
That child has no choice but to live on that

190
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,591
Just helping just now doesn't change anything

191
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,793
Or you

192
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,530
Can't you take on that kid as a whole?

193
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,001
Pity is cruel

194
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,304
It's not sympathy

195
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:37,710
I don't want Takamori to lose confidence.

196
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,989
I first noticed that

197
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,993
I wanted to teach him the letters

198
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,163
Because I wanted my heart to live with confidence

199
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,502
(Matsuura) Hello

200
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,710
The cast members who were investigated, including myself

201
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,812
Everyone seems to be careful

202
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,181
Haa

203
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,520
Well, it's probably because they're going to close the store.

204
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,255
The store?

205
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,790
Yeah

206
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,492
The law has been amended

207
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,395
The host club must also change

208
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,263
But that's already

209
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,732
It's different from the host club I'm aiming for.

210
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,237
Hawk now... What about Kaworu?

211
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,141
Kaworu took longer than the other cast members though.

212
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,643
Apparently the research was finished earlier

213
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,681
It seems suspicious that he could not read the report.

214
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,454
Well... your pride must have been hurt

215
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,493
Why are you talking to me?

216
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,531
The teacher taught him how to read and write, right?

217
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,333
I heard it from Takechiyo

218
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,969
I couldn't do anything big but...

219
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,103
home

220
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,238
I think Kaworu was happy

221
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,109
Well, the act of being taught

222
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,678
Well, I wonder when I accepted it

223
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,813
I was surprised

224
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,117
I guess I trusted you so much

225
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,358
I gave the stage name Kaworu.

226
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,228
I would like to thank you as a parent

227
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:41,633
Um... why is Kaworu-san?

228
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,436
Wow... there's no big meaning

229
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,540
Thank you so much for so far

230
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:00,152
(Nao) Is it okay? It's a bit pale but

231
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,022
Well, that was good

232
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,459
If he was returned, it means he's not a scoundrel, right?

233
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,799
Apparently the Joker will close

234
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,567
What are you going to do now?

235
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,978
Hey

236
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:31,116
Did you go out of your way to bring a seal just because your son wouldn't sign?

237
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:37,056
I have not decided anything from now on

238
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,124
(Nao) Yes...

239
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,961
Why not eat something for now? I'll treat you today

240
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,199
(Kaworu) Are you saying you should give me 3 million yen instead?

241
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,837
Well... it would be helpful if you did that

242
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,942
Ha... you really won't waver

243
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,811
Amazing seriously

244
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,813
Don't hit me

245
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:07,352
I'm going to get caught up in this way because I'll become a host

246
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,660
Well, don't lose confidence, do your best

247
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:15,961
What is that

248
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,730
Your mediocre teacher said that

249
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,501
I'll come and see the detective

250
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,205
Takamori-san isn't good at reading and writing

251
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,476
He bowed his head and asked if he could take the time to do it.

252
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,879
I don't want you to lose confidence

253
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:54,700
(Vacuum cleaner sound) (Takechiyo's humming)

254
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,805
(Takechiyo) Thank you for your hard work, Kaworu!

255
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,074
(Kaworu) You're a yakuza movie?

256
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,476
(Takechiyo) I was worried because I was late back

257
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,577
I'm glad you're safe

258
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,412
It's decided that it's safe

259
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,551
I'm leaving the dorm already

260
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,153
(Takechiyo) Ah...

261
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,089
I'm going home and I'm going to help out a store that's about to go out of business.

262
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,391
Honestly, I'm not a great place to make money as a host.

263
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,492
Certainly

264
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,527
No, hidee

265
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,995
That's what you mean!

266
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,296
It's it! You are...

267
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,664
Pain, stop...

268
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:29,535
Ah, hey, shall we have a farewell party?

269
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,435
Huh?

270
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,214
- (Takechiyo) Another one! - (Kaworu) Another one? OK

271
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,484
Yes, it's so good! (Shutter sound)

272
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,319
- (Takechiyo) What to do What to do What to do - (Kaworu) The best

273
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,722
- (Takechiyo) Oh- (Kaworu) That's good

274
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,057
Let's take a picture together

275
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,692
- (Kaworu) Are you okay? - (Takechiyo) What?

276
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,893
If I enter, I'll wipe it off, right?

277
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,461
Ah!

278
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,730
(Takechiyo) I won't lose! (Kaworu's laughter)

279
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,399
- (Takechiyo) I'm going- (Kaworu) I'm going yes

280
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,466
Yeeee

281
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,084
(Intercom)

282
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,801
(Kaworu) If you come, be sure to be punctual, yes

283
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:39,037
Yes OK Yes Yes

284
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,040
- (Kaworu) Tsubasa is coming too- (Takechiyo) Are you serious?

285
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,376
Okay, let's go shopping, don't!

286
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,411
Uh, wait a minute...

287
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,682
(Aimi) He leaves without saying anything to me

288
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,951
If it were me

289
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,920
I hope you leave it alone

290
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,062
Just one more time! I'll be there until I can

291
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,865
Yes, it fits well It fits well!

292
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,507
- (Kaworu) "Chon" is first - (Aimi) Yes

293
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,876
Fight Fight!

294
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:56,114
(Aimi) Let's pray that he will find his place

295
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,755
(Champagne call from the hosts)

296
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,523
Yes, here... here

297
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,860
Uh... Then, cute and cute Takechiyo-kun

298
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,229
Pray for the future!

299
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,965
So please take the economy off!

300
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,800
- (Hosts) Likes - (Takechiyo) Tsubasa!

301
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,001
Sleep!

302
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,404
- (Tsubasa) Takechiyo-san- (Tatsuchiyo) Yes

303
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:55,707
Thank you for your hard work on Kaworu's amulet so far

304
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,843
(Hosts' laughter) (Takechiyo) I'm really tired

305
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,678
- (Takechiyo) Ariyasu- (Tsubasa) And

306
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:04,082
I'll take this opportunity to host too

307
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,784
(Hosts) What?

308
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,085
everyone…

309
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,155
Sorry for all the trouble

310
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,160
(Hiroto) I don't think it's a nuisance

311
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:20,065
Yes yes yes yes yes yes

312
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,468
That lead role is me

313
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,936
(Hosts' laughter)

314
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,905
(Takechiyo) Have you forgotten? Have you forgotten?

315
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:27,973
(Host) Sorry

316
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,041
Really sorry

317
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:35,113
The real reason I decided to go home...

318
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,250
That's because I was dumped by my girlfriend!

319
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,417
(Kaworu) What? Seriously?

320
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,386
Ah, that's it?

321
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,655
That's insane

322
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,692
There's no way you'll seriously fall in love with the host.

323
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,664
I was pretty serious but...

324
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,133
cry)

325
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,002
Don't cry

326
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,471
That's what a host is like

327
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,072
Oh, then switch

328
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:04,810
Um... Then Takechiyo and then Tsubasa

329
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:08,380
I wish everyone success in the next stage

330
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:12,584
- (Kaworu) Kang-pure! - (Hosts) Kanpai!

331
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,852
Let's drink it!

332
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,388
(Hiroto) Let's Go Takechiyo

333
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,223
(Hosts) Oh?

334
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,058
(Hiroto) Let's Go Takechiyo

335
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,660
(Hosts) Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!

336
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,562
(Hiroto) Let's Go Tsubasa too

337
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,096
(Hosts) Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!

338
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,731
(Hiroto) Let's Go We

339
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,934
(Hosts) Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh!

340
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,044
Sorry I've kept you waiting

341
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,479
(Real estate employee) No, it's hot again today

342
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:41,746
(Aimi) That's right

343
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,356
(Real estate employee) If the furniture or appliances provided are broken

344
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,791
Please contact us here

345
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,193
Excuse me then

346
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,329
(Aimi) Thank you very much

347
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,302
Haa

348
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,740
(Intercom)

349
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:10,742
(Aimi) Yes

350
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,646
(Kawahara) Sorry, I pushed you in forcibly

351
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,581
It's just decided

352
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,816
no

353
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,719
This is a souvenir

354
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,926
I didn't want to talk in front of people

355
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,230
There's nothing yet

356
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,199
- (Aimi) Please- (Kawahara) Thank you

357
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,306
It looks like that host club has closed

358
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,507
Yeah

359
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,645
What's Kaworu? What are you doing?

360
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,079
here we go

361
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,485
Ah... um...

362
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:58,757
Sorry

363
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,995
Can you leave the marriage blank?

364
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,966
When I told my parents that my father-in-law was down

365
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,068
I guess it wasn't a match

366
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:14,839
I myself thought about my feelings for you

367
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,511
I think it was more obsession than love

368
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:24,115
is that so…

369
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:29,421
after that…

370
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:38,964
If I'll be honest

371
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,567
Kaworu was injured

372
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,972
Because I hit

373
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,545
That day, I went to Miura Beach to search for you

374
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,248
I saw him with

375
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:03,955
He looks like he's never seen before...

376
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:10,028
I get mad at the thought of why I'm losing out like a host...

377
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,932
It would normally be an injury case

378
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:20,939
But he didn't tell the police or you

379
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:26,044
So... I understand

380
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:30,982
He thinks about you

381
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,889
My selfish push

382
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,958
Don't think that way

383
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,027
I was swinging Kawahara around

384
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,261
no…

385
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,767
I too... I'll be honest

386
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,839
He was captivated by my heart

387
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:59,444
And yet, Kawahara-san

388
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:06,718
I used the school and my parents to run away as an excuse.

389
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,867
The most confined to him was the difference

390
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,636
It could be me

391
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,307
(Kawahara) Huh? yeah?

392
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,510
No, no, isn't it too early to go into the past tense?

393
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:38,349
Since you've broken off your engagement, you can do whatever you want

394
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,354
(Aimi) He doesn't want that

395
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,259
Why? He's in love with you

396
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,299
That's messy!

397
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:58,803
Mmm... You were stalked a long time ago, didn't you? Get that much momentum!

398
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,105
You remembered it

399
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,907
No, I'll never forget that

400
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:03,975
Hehe...

401
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,518
ah…

402
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,090
No, it's the first time you've spoken properly.

403
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,164
Even though Kawahara's feelings are obsessed

404
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:29,634
I was happy

405
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:31,736
Say it again

406
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,909
I'm totally

407
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,915
This guy didn't love you either either.

408
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,680
Welcome home

409
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,918
Sorry I'm worried now

410
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,921
What about Dad?

411
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,459
(Sanae) That tone forever

412
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:50,081
I'll go as soon as I get my luggage

413
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,252
This is the address of the new room

414
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,490
Haha... It's fine to be close to school

415
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,359
Hehe

416
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:29,187
(Kawahara) He's thinking about you

417
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,376
I'll have the rest of the cardboard box come and pick it up tomorrow.

418
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,327
Dad

419
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,741
Hey dad

420
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,345
I met Kawahara today

421
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:35,720
I was asked to leave a blank story about marriage

422
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,223
Is it because of Dad?

423
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,393
Ugh, it doesn't matter about my dad's job.

424
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:47,165
Kawahara-san and my problems

425
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,299
that's why…

426
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,503
Don't worry

427
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,980
Me already...

428
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,684
I don't think I can live the way my dad wants

429
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,221
But that

430
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,393
It's not like not respecting your dad

431
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,733
I just want to decide for myself

432
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,708
About my dad who has worked so hard up until now

433
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,910
I respect you

434
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:35,780
surely

435
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,585
Things I can't even tell my family

436
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,222
There were a lot

437
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:53,731
Thank you so much so far

438
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:03,608
I'll come back to eat again

439
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:17,622
(Kaworu's sleep)

440
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,663
Kaworu-san, I'm going

441
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,735
I…

442
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:35,840
I wish Kaworu had been dating Chihuahua-sensei.

443
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:49,487
cry)

444
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,667
Hehe...

445
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,170
Good

446
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,642
I'll enjoy having this

447
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,644
knock)

448
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,848
knock)

449
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,656
Wow! Wow Wow... I was surprised!

450
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:26,757
-(Kawahara) Oh hey -(Kaworu) What are you doing?

451
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,093
-(Kawahara) Oh, excuse-(Kaworu) No, that's too rude!

452
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,462
Why do you know this? Ah, did you come to light it?

453
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,831
No no, I heard from the store... he told me...

454
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,600
That naughty naughty... If you say naughty, come on

455
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:36,734
You're not a naughty!

456
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,536
Wow... he's like a friend, right?

457
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,570
Where?

458
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,472
No... this

459
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:42,507
I don't need it

460
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:43,741
Hey, ah...

461
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,776
Hey, squeal... this

462
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:46,677
(Kaworu) Huh?

463
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,346
Aimi's new room

464
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,821
I think I'm here because I'm off today

465
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:58,789
By the way

466
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,129
Me and Aimi have broken off their engagement in harmony

467
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,334
Eh... I don't understand what it means

468
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,537
Well, ask her

469
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,741
Wait a minute

470
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,679
I won't meet the teacher anymore

471
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,080
(Kawahara) Why?

472
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:30,254
The teacher and I are in a completely different world after all.

473
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:34,025
Well, you don't know until you die

474
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,962
You're still a host, you're a mess

475
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,263
No, it's not about the host.

476
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,599
No, it's probably because he's a host

477
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:46,070
Anyway, I'll never meet the teacher

478
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,838
- (Kawahara) A joke... - (Kaworu) Huh?

479
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:48,839
And so...

480
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,977
I don't even know what other people think! (Intercom) What are you doing? You are?

481
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,012
Is that so? I'm strong! (Intercom)

482
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,614
Is that so...

483
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,182
(Female) Sawasdee Car

484
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,551
-(Kaworu) Ah... sorry... -(Kawahara) Sorry...

485
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,392
Go see Aimi

486
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:12,663
That's good

487
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,901
What's that...

488
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,535
(Kaworu) That guy...

489
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,479
What is it?

490
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,382
Huh?

491
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,904
- (Female) Hello - (Aimi) Hello

492
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:38,315
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

493
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:39,950
hello

494
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,153
(Momoko) What about you?

495
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,254
(Aimi) Yes

496
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,157
I think I can somehow do it alone

497
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:47,725
Shall I go and help now?

498
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,393
What? Really?

499
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,594
Huh?

500
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,631
Ah, sorry, I got an interview

501
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,000
So enjoy loneliness

502
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,402
(Aimi) What... (The sound of a call breaking)

503
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,278
(Momoko) It seems Kaworu-chan hasn't arrived yet, though?

504
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,546
Huh?

505
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:13,084
Ah... No, I'm sure I'll go

506
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,555
Only at the end showed a great manly feeling

507
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,557
No, "just" is probably extra

508
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:25,162
"I didn't love this at all."

509
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,899
You're not a bad person

510
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:35,005
No, I'm not bragging, but I'm selfish

511
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,274
I only think about everything with my own feelings

512
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,043
I guess

513
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,414
But this time I thought about Aimi's feelings.

514
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,317
I'm already surprised by that

515
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,253
I was serious

516
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:59,964
No, he's so serious that he's almost going to break, and always so busy

517
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,169
I wish I could be loved by a woman like that...

518
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:08,939
Just thinking like that makes me grow

519
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,510
Momoko is also kind

520
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,611
I'm not good at talking though

521
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,845
It's extraordinary to have a bad mouth

522
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,114
Hahaha, sorry

523
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,649
(Momoko) What? What...

524
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,117
(Kawahara) What? no…

525
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,757
(Kaworu) Twitch... It's hard to understand

526
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,059
Is this?

527
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,632
Ah, this is it

528
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,640
(Aimi) Oh, detergent too...

529
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,476
You have to buy it

530
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,563
(Intercom)

531
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,501
(Intercom)

532
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,472
(Electronic audio) Go to the bottom

533
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,043
a…?

534
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:26,150
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

535
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,226
Tw... it's not coming out

536
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:14,798
(Train mouth manager)

537
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,047
Haa...

538
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:37,154
(Train mouth manager)

539
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,764
(Aimi) While humans are alive

540
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,701
He is said to have contact with an average of 30,000 people.

541
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,406
Many of them are misunderstanding...

542
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:05,382
Sometimes I feel sad when I can't meet the people I want to meet

543
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,020
There are some encounters you don't even realize you've passed each other
