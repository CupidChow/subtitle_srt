1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,642
Excuse me!

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,612
KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,385
My name is Taiga Takamori.

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,953
Please sit down.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,221
Thank you!

6
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,325
Why do you want to attend this school?

7
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:29,763
I used to dream
of being a train conductor.

8
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,364
SHIBUYA GENERAL BEAUTY COLLEGE

9
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,499
Excuse me?

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,234
But railway companies

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,803
don't hire people
without a high school diploma.

12
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:41,274
So, you know, how can I put it…

13
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,045
I guess you could say I hit a brick wall.
So, I've decided to become a hairstylist--

14
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,446
"You could say"?

15
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:47,647
Yeah.

16
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:52,519
One of the reasons is that I can earn
a high school diploma from this school.

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:57,357
But have you ever been interested
in the beauty industry? I doubt it…

18
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,992
This industry is very demanding.

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,693
I'm aware.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,664
My mom was a hairdresser once,
but she was too weak-willed to continue.

21
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,669
Which is why I had decided
I'd never be a hairdresser, but…

22
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,805
I don't care now that we've cut ties.

23
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,073
Hang on a minute.

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,141
You cut ties with her?

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,577
Wait, did I not tell you?

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,782
I told her I'll never see her again.

27
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,986
I am worried about Yuki, but…

28
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,925
I've had enough of her bleeding me dry.

29
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,663
I guess it was my fault
for giving her money.

30
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,666
I see…

31
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,137
Show me.

32
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:51,478
I do think that helping people
to become beautiful is exciting.

33
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,215
I'm also great at knowing what women want.

34
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,184
Not women, customers!
Be careful during the interview.

35
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,285
Yes!

36
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,186
Good.

37
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,722
And the entrance exam consists of…

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,660
An interview, an essay,
and an academic achievement test.

39
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:11,297
Academic achievement test… Nice, okay.

40
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,167
But it's a multiple-choice test,

41
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,836
so even if there's a question
you don't understand,

42
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,138
you can make a guess.

43
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,241
Wait. So you mean it's like a bet?

44
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,575
A bet?

45
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:26,212
I guess that is one way of looking at it.

46
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,415
That's great! Alright then!

47
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,719
I will bet everything I have!

48
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,956
If I don't pass…

49
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,294
that's it for us.

50
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,130
What an awful joke!

51
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,669
I do have good intuition!

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,939
- Rock, paper, scissors, go!
- Go!

53
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,741
- See? Try again.
- Oh, wow.

54
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,609
- Rock, paper, scissors, go!
- Yay!

55
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,845
- That's amazing!
- Right?

56
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,648
- I have a sixth sense.
- Wait, let's try again.

57
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,417
Rock, paper, scissors, go!

58
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,353
- See?
- Again! Rock, paper, scissors--

59
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,721
Good morning.

60
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,890
Good morning.

61
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,660
Good morning.

62
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:20,099
HOLLYHOCK CLASS

63
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,537
I have something to tell you.

64
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:30,109
Regarding Ms. Ogawa,
she has resigned due to family reasons.

65
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,277
- What?
- She resigned?

66
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,880
I will be your homeroom teacher
from this term.

67
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,281
It's so sudden…

68
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,653
Quiet! I will be supporting
Mr. Sakura as Head of Grade.

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,222
So no need to worry.

70
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,893
Ms. Ogawa left this student file here.

71
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,897
I will be taking over while honoring
how Ms. Ogawa felt for you all--

72
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:51,998
She ran away.

73
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,101
Family reasons?

74
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,238
I think that's a lie.

75
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,306
It's totally a lie.

76
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,508
- This is ridiculous!
- Be quiet!

77
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,377
- Let's go.
- Sit back down!

78
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,913
- We're going home.
- What are you talking about?

79
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,081
Sit down!

80
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,486
Is it possible for Ms. Ogawa
to speak to her students one last time?

81
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,023
I cannot invite someone
who has resigned into our classrooms.

82
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,225
Half of the students are 18 years old.

83
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,061
They should be treated as adults.

84
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,864
I think lying will have
a negative impact on them.

85
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,899
Mr. Sakura.

86
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:32,305
Do you think Ms. Ogawa can set
a good example for the students?

87
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,842
Are teachers only allowed
to set good examples?

88
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,281
I think teachers should show students

89
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:46,853
that even teachers can make mistakes
and be unsure about things.

90
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:54,027
There's a limit to what we can teach
by pretending to be completely righteous.

91
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,730
Um… Never mind.

92
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,069
Wait…

93
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,208
Can't they meet
as long as it's not in a classroom?

94
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,546
Start!

95
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,185
Okay, 21… So 21 times 105 is…

96
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,120
105 is… Oh, I know!

97
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:25,325
A champagne tower
and a tequila Ferris Wheel…

98
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:26,859
That's 150!

99
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:30,163
PIETAS GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

100
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,464
Ms. Ogawa!

101
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,138
The students are waiting.

102
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,542
Okay.

103
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,421
Hey, girls! What are you doing?

104
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,223
You need to gather around!

105
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,293
There she is. The coward's here!

106
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,828
Why did you resign?

107
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,765
I mean, I don't really care
but tell us the truth!

108
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,368
You got fired because of Kaoru, right?

109
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,103
Calm down, everyone!

110
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,238
- Listen to her--
- You're wrong.

111
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,776
I did something irresponsible
as a homeroom teacher,

112
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,579
so I decided to resign by my own will.

113
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,584
I feel awful for putting you through this.

114
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,287
I am truly sorry.

115
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,556
Apologizing won't do anything.

116
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,859
That means nothing to us.

117
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,129
It was so fun to mess with you.

118
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:42,268
We can all study on our own,
but we needed someone to vent to!

119
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,606
In that case, how about
you vent it all out now?

120
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,641
Go ahead!

121
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,977
I'm not your teacher anymore.

122
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,547
- Say whatever you want!
- You're always so annoying!

123
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,116
A pushover who just says yes
to everything!

124
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,420
She said we can say
whatever we want, let's do it!

125
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,256
Miss, your classes were incredibly boring!

126
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,491
Your small talk was even more boring!

127
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,961
You only ever stated the obvious.

128
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,464
You can't take jokes.

129
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,734
It was so obvious you wanted to be liked!

130
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,335
You're so lame!

131
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,071
So lame!

132
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,907
- Sorry…
- Your fashion is also lame.

133
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,811
- So lame!
- Your hairstyle and makeup too!

134
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,179
I'm sorry…

135
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,448
I wanted to keep ignoring you.

136
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,750
And make you cry…

137
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,187
You're the worst!

138
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,424
You're the worst person I've ever met!

139
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,561
- The worst!
- Yeah, the worst!

140
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,329
How dare you quit like this!

141
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,899
- Thank you.
- You're being irresponsible!

142
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,302
- Irresponsible!
- You're a coward!

143
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,903
- So uncoordinated!
- Thank you…

144
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,673
- Don't quit!
- I hate you!

145
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,174
You taught us nothing!

146
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,777
Thank you.

147
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,378
Miss…

148
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,849
This isn't fair.

149
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,657
It looks so messy!

150
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,166
MY GOAL
I WANT TO BE A HAIRDRESSER WHO MAKES…

151
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,507
What is this kanji?

152
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,509
"Happy"…

153
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,111
Period! Yes! I did it!

154
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,987
Miss…

155
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,989
Miss, this is so tough!

156
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,697
Miss!

157
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,667
I don't think I can do this!

158
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,273
Like this…

159
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,279
Huh? It's so warm.

160
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,281
I THINK THIS JOB SUITS ME

161
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,349
There! Another sentence done!

162
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,152
Wait, what?

163
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,958
It's been eight hours,
and I've only done this much?

164
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,929
I'm so hungry!

165
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:27,533
Four hundred characters is so long!
It'll take a lifetime to finish it!

166
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,003
I think there's no need
to use difficult words.

167
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,172
Just write from your heart.

168
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,208
But I did quite well
on the achievement test!

169
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,944
Wow, you do have good instincts!

170
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,214
My issue is I don't have enough time
to read the questions.

171
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,983
Yes, about that…

172
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,752
You can request reasonable accommodation.

173
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:50,089
- Reasonable… what?
- Reasonable accommodation.

174
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,325
People who have difficulty reading

175
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,461
can ask for a time extension
or to have readings on the kanji!

176
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,532
No, thanks.

177
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,638
I want to pass this
without special treatment.

178
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,746
Oh, wow…

179
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,314
How beautiful!

180
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,316
Wow! This is great!

181
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,724
Oh, I almost forgot!

182
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,561
I found this article the other day.

183
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,829
What?

184
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,665
The Miura Beach Fireworks
Festival is back!

185
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,866
It's back!

186
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,069
Shall we go retrieve that sun umbrella?

187
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,006
The one I left at the restaurant?

188
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,610
They've probably thrown it away!
It was a cheap umbrella!

189
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,680
I bet they're keeping it safe for us.

190
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,749
I bet that you're wrong!

191
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,852
Fine! We can go check who's right, then!

192
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,888
All right! The one who loses
the bet buys dinner!

193
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,523
Fine, we can do that!

194
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,525
Your face is dirty.

195
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:03,929
Applicants, this way! Good morning!

196
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,298
Applicants, this way please!

197
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,434
All right! Whoa!

198
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,302
- Good morning!
- Sorry.

199
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,272
Good morning!

200
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,841
Good morning!

201
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,179
Please start.

202
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,180
TAIGA TAKAMORI

203
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:26,352
2025 ENTRANCE EXAM

204
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,134
Quiet.

205
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,550
It's started.

206
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,186
God, I feel nervous too.

207
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,988
I feel like a mother
with a kid going through exams.

208
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:09,995
I never would've thought a day would come
that I'd be worried about Kaoru's exam.

209
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,131
- I'm not worried at all.
- Really?

210
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,667
He studied so hard for this.

211
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,437
I'm getting sick of you
bragging about him.

212
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,409
Oh, it's Mr. Kawahara.

213
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,010
Kawahara what's-his-name?

214
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,979
- Is he stalking us?
- No way!

215
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,682
- I'm going to pick up.
- Okay.

216
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,185
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sorry to call you out of the blue!

217
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,687
Are you doing well?

218
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,056
I am, thank you.

219
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,257
And you?

220
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:41,594
I'm getting transferred to another branch.

221
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:48,200
I wasn't sure if I should call you,
but I just wanted to tell you myself.

222
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,137
I'm going to the New York branch.

223
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,772
New York branch?

224
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,908
That's so far.

225
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,945
It will put me on a good career track,
so I'll do my best.

226
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:06,085
I know it's quite a boring life,

227
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,189
but I do want to climb
the corporate ladder as high as possible.

228
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,057
It's not boring at all!

229
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,759
<i>Do you really think so?</i>

230
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,463
However, if you ever feel like
you're losing yourself,

231
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,532
please don't push yourself too much.

232
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,568
That's very compelling, coming from you.

233
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,573
Okay. I'll bear it in mind.

234
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,743
Take care, okay?

235
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,878
You too, Mr. Kawahara.

236
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,281
See you.

You can do it, Yoji!

242
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,639
You can do it, Kawahara!

243
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,542
You can do it, Yoji!

00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,476
Click!

245
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,781
I did it!

246
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,483
You seem very happy.

247
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,519
It's kind of annoying.

248
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,759
Manami, you finally found your true love.

249
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,331
Jeez! I'm so envious!

250
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,136
Out of all the people,
I did not want to lose against you.

251
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,938
What do you mean?

252
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,408
You're so ditsy and awkward.

253
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:42,214
Watching you boosted my confidence.

254
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,284
I knew it.

255
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:49,855
But I think I've supported you enough
through many frustrating events in return.

256
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,061
You worry so much about others' opinions
and self-destruct,

257
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,733
and it's all because
you're overly protective of yourself.

258
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,134
You seem cool and collected,

259
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,637
but you're just really scared
of getting hurt.

260
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,908
I'm not the same anymore.

261
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,110
I love him and that's enough.

262
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,245
I have to live in the moment.

263
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,448
Acting all high-and-mighty now, are we?

264
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,517
You're teaching me how to love, huh?

265
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,518
Yeah.

266
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,787
Fine then!

267
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,791
I will not act like your mom anymore.

268
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,826
We're done.

269
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,130
I'll pay for everything.

270
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,400
Thank you, but you can just pay
for yourself and go.

271
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,970
You leave first, then.

272
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,505
Why me? You leave!

273
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,015
Hey. A bite?

274
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:50,916
Right…

275
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,817
I BELIEVE

276
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,086
Is that okay?

279
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,233
What a stupid mistake!

280
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,670
Oh, no. I don't have much time!

281
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,139
- Jeez!
- Quiet, old man!

282
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,009
Old… man? Huh?

283
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,023
Yuki!

284
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,658
Miss.

285
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,362
Were you reading?

286
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,432
- Yeah.
- What will we do with Yuki if we split up?

287
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:44,003
- I'll bring him up! It's better than you--
- You selfish woman!

288
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,978
There, we'll have lunch soon, okay?

289
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,213
- Okay.
- Good.

290
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,748
Wait upstairs.

291
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,086
What can I do for you?
My son has cut ties with me, you know?

292
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,491
He's taking an entrance exam
for a beauty school right now.

293
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,827
Really?

294
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:13,532
Can I ask him to let you know
if he passes the exam?

295
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,202
There's no way he'll be accepted!

296
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,741
I believe in him.

297
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,880
You need to be realistic.

298
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,752
When he was young,

299
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:39,191
I watched him struggle with schoolwork
and I felt like it was my fault.

300
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,130
As if God was saying it was my fault
that he's dumb because I'm dumb.

301
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,733
It made me not want to see his face.

302
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,903
I'm an awful mother.

303
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:56,108
But I'm sure you'll feel the same someday.

304
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,977
That's the reality.

305
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,948
One day, you'll want to run away
from everything.

306
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,686
If that happens, we'll run away together.

307
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,664
Don't leave him.

308
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,974
Please take care of my son.

309
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:31,944
Mom?

310
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,683
Don't worry, I'm okay.
These are happy tears.

311
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,352
Thank you.

312
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,591
Such a good boy.
Thank you for comforting me.

313
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,825
Time's up!

314
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,530
Please pass the answer sheets
to the person in front of you.

315
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,370
- Hurry… Sorry, one second!
- You there, in the middle!

316
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,272
- The time is up!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,508
Oh, no. I'm done for…

318
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,578
As long as you do well in the interview,
you'll be fine!

319
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,482
You're right.

320
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,885
Thank you!

321
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,186
- Quiet!
- Huh?

322
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:18,223
It says here you're 23 years old now.
What were you doing up until now?

323
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,559
I was in nighttime hospitality.

324
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,999
And what made you want
to become a hairdresser instead?

325
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,867
It's a very demanding job.

326
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,637
I understand.

327
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:35,507
Being a hairdresser is all about
satisfying the customers.

328
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:40,212
I've dealt with hundreds of customers
in my previous job.

329
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,714
- So I know how to make them happy--
- Hundreds?

330
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,950
Yes, at least.

331
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,786
<i>How did it go?</i>

332
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:49,821
Well…

333
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,859
I could only write half of the essay.

334
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,428
Don't worry too much.

335
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,463
- I'm coming now!
- I'm not worried.

336
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,632
Also, you don't need to come here!

337
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,601
But…

338
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,771
I'm here already.

339
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:13,445
I think I was able to cover
my shortcomings with the interview.

340
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,814
I'm so glad.

341
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,416
So you did perform well!

342
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,918
Well, I wouldn't say that but…

343
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,922
- I gave it my all!
- What?

344
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,757
All right!

345
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:30,395
It's all thanks to you! Thank you so much!

346
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,031

352
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,014
<i>- Did he pass?</i>
- Sorry, I'll call you back later.

353
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,922
I don't think he passed the exam.

354
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:36,762
Gosh, the passing rate
is supposed to be over 85 percent.

355
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:48,106
He did try hard to show us
his sincerity, though.

356
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,442
I see.

Now you're on his side too?
He's a skilled host, I guess.

358
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,287
He's someone Manami cares about dearly.

359
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,526
She can do much better than him.

360
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:12,431
I can't be with you anymore
if you can't support

361
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,899
our daughter's choices.

362
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,136
What on earth are you saying?

363
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:23,675
- You know well how much I've done for her.
- All you did…

364
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,580
You only took advantage of Manami.

365
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,423
I admit it's partially my fault.

366
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,793
I really tried.

367
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,038
I want a divorce.

368
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,974
Don't be ridiculous!

369
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,744
You can't survive without me.

370
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,012
I guess I'll just die then.

371
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,461
Enough!

372
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,648
I know you're there.

373
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,017
Please open the door.

374
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:46,691
Even if you didn't pass this time,
there will be next time!

375
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,130
You did your best!

376
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:55,367
I think what you did was amazing!

377
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,474
Can you hear me?

378
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,576
I'm not going to leave until--

379
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,746
Miss.

380
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,883
Could you please not embarrass me
in front of my neighbors?

381
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,988
Sorry to bother you.

382
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,361
I'm not depressed, you know.

383
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,098
But…

384
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,735
it was your first ever exam.

385
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,106
It must be quite a shock.

386
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:35,841
REJECTED

387
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:42,113
They said they sense my enthusiasm
and that I should try again in the spring.

388
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,149
Please sit.

389
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,422
I won't have to do another interview.

390
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,491
That's great!

391
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,060
We can ask them to put
readings on the kanji next time!

392
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,128
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

393
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:01,766
I've given up.

394
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,802
What?

395
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,037
It's not that I'm discouraged.

396
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,573
I just think…

397
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:11,843
this is the reality.

398
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,216
I…

399
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,520
want to end this.

400
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:25,924
End this?

401
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,692
Yeah.

402
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:33,832
No more exams and no more us.

403
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:35,967
I'm done.

404
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,605
I told you.

405
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,275
I will bet everything I have!

406
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,676
If I don't pass…

407
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:47,746
that's it for us.

408
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,981
What an awful joke!

409
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,118
You thought I was joking, but…

410
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,154
I was very serious about it.

411
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:01,026
I had to put myself in a desperate
situation to take that exam.

412
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,100
- I'm sorry.
- What?

413
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:15,006
But it wasn't due to a lack of effort,
you just haven't learned enough yet.

414
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,710
- So you will pass if you keep--
- What if I fail again?

415
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,179
What will we do?

416
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,682
What will happen then?

417
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:31,189
You will probably be so disappointed.

418
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,998
I've always disappointed people.

419
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,234
Not just my mom.

420
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:50,375
Since I was little,
I stood out because I was tall.

421
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,480
And so I got a lot of attention
in the beginning,

422
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,017
but then they'd realize
I'm just another dumb kid.

423
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:05,123
Once I got older, as you can see
I became unnecessarily good-looking,

424
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:09,160
so I started getting a lot
of attention from girls, but…

425
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:14,532
they'd soon tell me
''Oh, you're not how I thought you'd be."

426
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,501
"What a let down!," they would say.

427
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,879
Which is why I don't want you…

428
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,651
I don't care about others, but you…

429
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,422
I don't want to disappoint you.

430
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,303
I won't be disappointed.

431
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:01,713
Yes, I taught you how to write,
but you taught me a lot, too.

432
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:09,921
If I'd never met you,
I would've been a coward all my life.

433
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,626
If that's the case…

434
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,128
I'm relieved!

435
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,431
Let's have a drink!

436
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,399
You know…

437
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,536
One last toast.

438
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,406
Here.

439
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,243
What's wrong?

440
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,557
My name is Kaoru! Let's drink! Cheers!

441
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,896
Do you want to be a host again?

442
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,235
What's your problem?

443
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:00,171
Don't look at me like that.

444
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,041
Well, guess what!

445
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,046
I've worked hard
to be successful as a host

446
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,850
so that I can take care of myself
without ever relying on others!

447
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,854
It might be a trashy industry,

448
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:22,327
but there are so many people
who look down on others

449
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,065
and make fun of people
in your elitist world!

450
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,671
I've always suspected that you secretly…

451
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,243
look down on me too!

452
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:39,511
That's not true!

453
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:44,215
You've toyed with my feelings
and made me look like a fool.

454
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:45,717
Just leave!

455
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,851
I'm not leaving.

456
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,620
- Leave! Now!
- No!

457
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,322
- Just go!
- I am not leaving!

458
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,091
- Leave me alone!
- No!

459
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,494
Stop it! No!

460
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,497
Get off of me!

461
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,765
Taiga!

462
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,268
- Stop it!
- Taiga!

463
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,923
- No way, is that Kaoru?
- It is!

464
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,425
- I'm back!
- Congratulations! You're so hot!

465
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,459
Bang bang!

466
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,101
Good evening.

467
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,338
Oh, Boss. Sorry for the trouble.

468
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,006
It's okay. What's wrong?

469
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,442
You're going back to being a host?

470
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,849
Well, I figured that
I still have ten to fifteen years

471
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,817
before I have to retire.

472
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,855
So I wanted to keep going
until I can't do it anymore.

473
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,926
Well, that is totally up to you.

474
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:08,166
I've pulled out of the host club business,
and I'm no longer your employer.

475
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:21,045
In that case, can I ask you something?

476
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,349
What is it?

477
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:30,488
Are you…

478
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:39,597
my… dad?

479
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,003
What did you just say?

480
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,439
Come on.

481
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,776
Are you okay? Feeling drunk already?

482
00:31:58,516 --> 00:31:59,617
But I guess,

483
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:04,689
I am the one who named you Kaoru,
so I'm like your godparent.

484
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:11,396
There was a character called Kaoru
in a book I read when I was in prison.

485
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,835
He was described as someone
with beautiful eyes who always smiles.

486
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,575
You reminded me of that character
when you joined our club.

487
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,444
That's all.

488
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,351
What a great name! Thanks!

489
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:38,790
I guess I'll continue working in Kabukicho
as Kaoru with a silly smile on my face,

490
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,595
so I can live up to the name
you've given me and make you proud.

491
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,950
Kaoru!

492
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,286
You guys should join us!

493
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,489
Oh look, melon! I love melon!

494
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,559
I'm going to use all my savings today!

495
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,704
Did you come to tell me, "I told you so"?

496
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,675
Can I talk to you?

497
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,561
He failed the exam.

498
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,135
So he wants to break up with me.

499
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:03,107
But this isn't your fault.

500
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:09,714
If we do break up, it just means
we didn't love each other enough.

501
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,985
It has nothing to do with you.

502
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,254
It's not your fault at all!

503
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,192
I didn't know.

504
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,635
Manami.

505
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,678
What happened to it?

506
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,814
I did it.

507
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:50,822
That's awful!

508
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:57,795
Your mom wants a divorce.

509
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,432
However…

510
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,170
I'm still not convinced that I was wrong.

511
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:12,877
All I know is that you…

512
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,583
are not mine anymore.

513
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,488
I'm so sorry.

514
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,366
Make sure you lock the door.

515
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,803
Cheers to Kabukicho!

516
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,139
Let's go!

517
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,214
Come on, have a drink!

518
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,817
Wait, you look like you're cold!

519
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,886
Do you want to wear this?

520
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,088
You're warm now.

521
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,360
This is great!

522
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,298
I'm having so much fun!

523
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,203
So much fun!

524
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,907
So much fun…

525
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,213
This is the best!

526
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,615
The best night!

527
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,423
It's the best…

528
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,136
If that's all, could you please sign here?

529
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,375
TAIGA TAKAMORI

530
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,676
Thank you.

531
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,415
We'll take care of the rest.

532
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,384
We'll take care of the rest.

533
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:49,967
I'd like to share my favorite tanka poem
as my self-introduction.

534
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,839
It's from Takuboku Ishikawa's
poem collection, <i>A Handful of Sand</i>.

535
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,909
What do you think
the word "big" symbolizes?

536
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,680
It can be interpreted in many ways,
but I think…

537
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,518
"big" means "the burden
of a dream that is too big."

538
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:40,384
- Welcome!
- Welcome.

539
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,387
I left a sun umbrella
last time I was here.

540
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,523
Oh, yes! We kept it for you!

541
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,558
Sit anywhere you like!

542
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,530
- Can I have a hot coffee?
- Sure!

543
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,099
Are you here for the fireworks?

544
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,033
Kind of…

545
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,507
MIURA BEACH FIREWORKS FESTIVAL IS BACK!

546
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:07,244
It's been six years since it was canceled
due to COVID, so I'm excited!

547
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:11,882
Here's your sun umbrella,
and I was also told to give you this.

548
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,255
MS. MANAMI OGAWA

549
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,791
TAIGA TAKAMORI

550
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,874
<i>Ms. Chihuahua, how are you?</i>

551
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,844
<i>I'm doing well.</i>

552
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,448
<i>Thank you for teaching me so many things.</i>

553
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:50,054
<i>The reason I felt so comfortable</i>
<i>in the host club world</i>

554
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,989
<i>was because it was built on lies.</i>

555
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:57,628
<i>I was always scared</i>
<i>that if I told people how I really felt,</i>

556
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,296
<i>they would leave me.</i>

557
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:04,402
<i>But with you, I was able to be honest.</i>

558
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,971
<i>You were the first!</i>

559
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,542
<i>Meeting you, I realized</i>

560
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:16,113
<i>that maybe I've lived my life</i>
<i>wanting to tell people how I really felt,</i>

561
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,982
<i>which is so out of my character.</i>

562
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,421
<i>Which is why</i>
<i>I'm glad I couldn't write kanji.</i>

563
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:30,127
<i>Because if I were able to write kanji,</i>
<i>we wouldn't have ended up together, right?</i>

564
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,397
<i>So, I…</i>

565
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,809
Sorry, is this the only thing he left?

566
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,110
Yes, it is.

567
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,482
Why don't you ask him yourself?

568
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,452
Right?

569
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,921
Yeah.

570
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,871
What is wrong with you?

571
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,342
Taiga Takamori!

572
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,212
You called, Miss?

573
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,550
What were you going to do
if I didn't come?

574
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,819
I knew you'd come!

575
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,388
You can't forget about me!

576
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,725
You narcissist!

577
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,035
The letter wasn't finished.

578
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:46,871
Yeah.

579
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,674
I couldn't end it.

580
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:58,215
That's why I didn't use
a period at the end.

581
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,353
I used a comma instead.

582
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:04,255
It was on purpose.

583
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,456
<i>A comma.</i>

584
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,525
<i>It means the sentence will continue.</i>

585
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:11,328
<i>This is a period.</i>
<i>It marks the end of a sentence.</i>

586
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:18,469
Using a period also indicates
that you're starting a new sentence.

587
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,337
Does it?

588
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,973
You should've told me that!

589
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,313
I'm…

590
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:35,119
planning to apply
to that beauty school again.

591
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,325
Are you moved?

592
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,828
Kind of.

593
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,499
I thought you'd be happier than that!

594
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,834
Well, you didn't write my name correctly.

595
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,703
What? Really?

596
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,207
- The kanji for "Love" is missing a dot.
- The kanji for "Love"?

597
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,978
No way! Damn it!

598
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:08,719
Not this one.

599
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:09,753
This one!

600
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,326
A line…

601
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,733
- And then one, two, three dots.
- Three dots. Yes.

602
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,335
The kanji for "Heart."

603
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,669
Oh, hang on.

604
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,671
Was I missing a dot for "Heart"?

605
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,940
- Exactly.
- Oh, no!

606
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:32,209
<i>The kanji for "Love"</i>
<i>is difficult to write.</i>

607
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,544
- That's it!
- Looks good!

608
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,679
<i>The "Heart" in the middle can neither be</i>

609
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,282
<i>too small or too big</i>
<i>to write it beautifully.</i>

610
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,619
<i>- But right now…</i>
- Looks good, no?

611
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,787
<i>I just want to love him with all my heart.</i>

612
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:44,722
You're too harsh!

613
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:50,194
<i>The memory of being loved is enough</i>
<i>to give people the courage to keep going.</i>

614
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:55,666
<i>Even if someday we go our separate ways.</i>

615
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,968
<i>Still, the memory of being loved</i>

616
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,405
<i>should help him move forward in life.</i>

617
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,307
Straight to the end…

618
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,509
Done! How is it?

619
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,544
Very good! Passed with flying colors!

620
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:14,351
LOVE

621
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,880
I'm going to work!

622
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,750
- I'll eat when I get home!
- Okay!

623
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,690
Let me know when you're heading home!

624
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:08,372
Right, some udon noodles.

625
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:13,877
Tomatoes and kimchi.

626
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:18,215
Tofu, and egg. Okay!

627
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,684
That should be good.

628
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:25,889
Three packs of udon. Is that too much?

629
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:31,929
