1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:08,575
<i>Do you know how much I've spent</i>
<i>to make you number one?</i>

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:13,380
I am a host after all.

3
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,281
<i>I know.</i>

4
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,885
Yes, you are a host.

5
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,088
I'm just happy to hear that you're well.

6
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,225
Don't call me anymore, okay?

7
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:27,260
Bye.

8
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:31,164
<i>He put on an act for me.</i>

9
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>Now, I need to move forward too.</i>

10
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:37,971
I'm going to move out.

11
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,840
Manami!

12
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,510
You need to calm down.

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:47,847
There's no need to move out
in such a hurry!

14
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,449
My heart is set.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,384
You poor thing.

16
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,554
- That host drove you mad.
- No.

17
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,724
This is how you act
when you're blinded by something!

18
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,392
Remember?

19
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,729
Hey, don't remind her of that incident!

20
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm not being reckless this time.

21
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,371
And, I'm just going to go see
an apartment today.

22
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,606
I'm not running away from home.

23
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,841
Can I trust you?

24
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,213
See you later.

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,470
EITA SAKURA
ARE KAORU AND TAKECHIYO ALL RIGHT?

26
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:44,938
I SAW THIS ONLINE ARTICLE

27
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,410
AN ASSAULT IN A HOST CLUB IN KABUKICHO

28
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,812
A HOST FROM "THE JOKER" INJURED

29
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,318
TAIGA TAKAMORI

30
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,123
How's the scene looking?

31
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,258
He got cut here.

32
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,829
- Apparently, a host got stabbed.
- Is he dead?

33
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,030
I heard a woman did it.

34
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,932
- Here!
- The police took her away.

35
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,734
- Any info on who's injured?
- Uh…

36
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,636
- Call the local news desk.
- Yes!

37
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,138
- And check social media.
- Noted!

38
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,774
- Shoot it this way.
- He's still inside?

39
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,776
I want to see Tsubasa!

40
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,545
- Excuse me.
- Get back, please!

41
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,347
Manami?

42
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,283
Hey, Manami! What are you doing here?

43
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,318
Momoko, what happened?

44
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:34,821
TEMPORARY CLOSURE

45
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:35,722
Tsubasa!

46
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:41,261
I don't know if it's true yet, but…

47
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:46,599
I heard Tsubasa was the target,
someone got hurt protecting him.

48
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,636
Just go home for now.

49
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,039
Coming to the crime scene is so stupid!

50
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,440
But…

51
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:58,912
Even if it is Kaoru,
there's nothing you can do!

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,283
What happened to not seeing him again?

53
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,020
Ms. Chihuahua!

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,428
Ms. Chihuahua!

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,076
What are you doing here?

56
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,614
Were you worried about me?

57
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,416
Don't flatter yourself!

58
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,718
Hey, Manami!

59
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,954
You're overreacting.

60
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,823
Hey, what's wrong?

61
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,724
Miss?

62
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,659
- Miss?
- Manami!

63
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,462
Why did you want to stab Tsubasa?

64
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,103
Were you trying to kill him?

65
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,107
There you go…

66
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,177
Let's see.

67
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:14,420
I remember you used to often get a fever
before school trips and stuff.

68
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,859
Stay here tonight.

69
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,497
Your dad would be furious
if you went home in this state.

70
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,334
Right then, Miss…

71
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,036
Take care.

72
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,641
Wait a minute!

73
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,344
Can I ask you who got stabbed?

74
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:43,883
It's Takechiyo.

75
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,753
Apparently, he protected Tsubasa.

76
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,222
Hard to picture, right?

77
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,957
How bad is the injury?

78
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,762
He got a few stitches in his arm, I think.

79
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,096
Who did it?

80
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,499
I heard it was a customer.

81
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:04,304
I see.

82
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,973
Well, I need to go back to work.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,940
Take care of her.

84
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,108
What?

85
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,177
We can't leave her on her own.

86
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,047
And the club's closed, right?

87
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,415
Me?

88
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,218
Here. Use this to make an ice pack.

89
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,287
You're used to working with ice, right?

90
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,588
Yes, I am.

91
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,190
Thank you!

92
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,592
I'll leave the rest with you.

93
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,953
What should I do?

94
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,758
<i>How do you use it then?</i>

95
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,394
SEIJI OGAWA

96
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,498
Hello, this is Kawahara.

97
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,600
<i>When is the wedding?</i>

98
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,136
Huh? Why are you calling so late?

99
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,671
<i>I asked you, didn't I?</i>

100
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:15,208
To take her hand and lead her
because she's indecisive!

101
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:19,312
I'm sorry, but I'm still not sure yet, so…

102
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,980
That is unacceptable!

103
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,917
You can't become an executive
if you can't even handle this!

104
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,424
Should you be doing this as the executive
of the harassment response department?

105
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,261
People are too afraid of harassment
to say what they want to say,

106
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,663
and it's damaging this society!

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,965
Don't you get it?

108
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,669
He hung up.

109
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,306
Why do I have to get scolded at? Why?

110
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,374
Ow!

111
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,411
Where is Manami? What is she doing?

112
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,014
She betrayed my trust again.

113
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,785
We have to act now or it'll be too late.

114
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,391
- Um…
- Hm?

115
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,761
Can I ask something?

116
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:16,269
Are you really off work because of Manami?

117
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,039
It's been a week, right?

118
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,442
Is that not a problem?

119
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,044
Not in my position!

120
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,051
All good.

121
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,130
Did you sleep?

122
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,468
Ms. Momotaro's gone back to work.

123
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,973
Ready for the ice pack? Here goes.

124
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,844
Whoa, that's cold…

125
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,113
Are you okay?

126
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,353
What about you?

127
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,223
Your injury…

128
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,492
is it healed now?

129
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,760
You knew?

130
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,263
Should've told me!

131
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,666
You too. You should've told me!

132
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,013
Can I ask you…

133
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,351
how it happened?

134
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,253
Right.

135
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,222
I fell down. I was drinking
with a customer and got too drunk.

136
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,959
I thought hosts were good at lying.

137
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,594
I'm telling the truth!

138
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,396
I'm clumsy.

139
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,471
You need to learn more
to become a top-tier host.

140
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,041
You're so harsh!

141
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,110
I am your teacher.

142
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,616
Oh, man…

143
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:19,725
We went all the way to Miura Beach
to say goodbye, yet here we are again.

144
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,595
We're both pathetic, huh?

145
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,532
Yes. Pretty pathetic.

146
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,204
This is why I hate it…

147
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:40,279
when you care about someone,

148
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,849
you become lame.

149
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,757
Were you always cool until now?

150
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,960
Yeah. Of course, I was!

151
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,796
I've always been cool, all my life.

152
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,731
I see.

153
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,334
Opposite to my life then.

154
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:07,373
You do look like you've pursued
lameness your whole life.

155
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,275
That's awful!

156
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:16,916
But I finally told my parents
that I'm moving out.

157
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,685
They're against it,

158
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,290
but I'm 35 and I need to see this through.

159
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,994
Well done, Ms. 35!

160
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,097
This 23-year-old supports you!

161
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:35,234
Hey, don't mention our age gap!

162
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:46,479
Maybe I'll leave my dormitory
and move in with you.

163
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,115
What?

164
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:56,088
You probably can't cook
or clean well, right?

165
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,324
Ouch.

166
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,828
I've lived on my own for a while,
so I'm quite good.

167
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,732
What do you think?

168
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,070
No.

169
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,244
What if I said I'll quit my job?

170
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,451
If I weren't a host,

171
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,823
could we meet up
and chat and stuff like normal people?

172
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,728
I thought being a host was your calling?

173
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,732
My boss told me I should quit.

174
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,968
Maybe you should retire as a host.

175
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,538
Undisciplined people
will never become number one.

176
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,177
Maybe I'm not cut out for it.

177
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,048
I've talked too much.

178
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,718
Why aren't you asleep yet?

179
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,435
I'm back!

180
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:17,937
- Hi.
- Welcome back!

181
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,038
- Ichinose.
- Yes?

182
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:21,507
- Is the narration script ready?
- Yes!

183
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,677
A bizarre crime in Shinjuku
committed by a woman in her 50s.

184
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,079
Was the target a host
she was obsessed with?

185
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,147
What do you think?

186
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,181
Make it shorter.

187
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,783
- Okay.
- Yomoda!

188
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,952
Any info on Tsubasa?
The one who was targeted?

189
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,588
No injury, but he's seeing
the police again tomorrow.

190
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,522
Why?

191
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,125
We know him,
so we have to get an interview.

192
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,826
- I'll ask him myself.
- Thank you.

193
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,461
You're so reliable.

194
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,297
- Can you just start fixing the script?
- Yes!

195
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,734
MS. CHIHUAHUA
YOU'RE PRETTIER WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP

00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,939
Pretty?

00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,674

MS. CHIHUAHUA
YOU'RE PRETTIER WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP

201
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,457
What?

202
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,728
Like this, and then another line,
and then straight…

203
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,899
Miss…

204
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,437
On the left.

205
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,207
That's not right!

206
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,310
Sorry.

207
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,448
It doesn't fit.

208
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,793
Perfect.

209
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,631
MS. CHIHUAHUA YOU LOOK

210
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,532
You're…

211
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,801
Pretty…

212
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,636
PRETTIER

213
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,537
Prettier.

214
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,741
Is that right?

215
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,944
There and then…

216
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,681
<i>He had learnt some new kanji.</i>

217
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,052
<i>Writing this letter</i>
<i>must have been more difficult for him</i>

218
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,955
<i>than making me breakfast.</i>

219
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,761
There, done!

220
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,097
TAKE CARE
TAIGA TAKAMORI

221
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,779
OBON FESTIVAL

222
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,189
She's moving out?

223
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:28,594
It makes no sense to move out
before getting married!

224
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,964
So I need you to decide
the wedding date right away.

225
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,233
But I can't decide that on my own…

226
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,068
Yes, you can!

227
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,436
No, but…

228
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,373
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

229
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,975
You're back!

230
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,444
Yoji and I were just talking
about the wedding!

231
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,579
You're indecisiveness is a huge issue.

232
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,715
So I asked him to hurry up and marry you.

233
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,384
- Sir…
- What?

234
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,920
Can I talk to Manami alone?

235
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,389
Okay.

236
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,429
I'm so sorry that my dad kept calling you.

237
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,231
No, I asked if I could come over today.

238
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,335
I had a question for your dad.

239
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,971
But I couldn't ask him.

240
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,340
What is it?

241
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,675
Well…

242
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,146
I thought your dad was acting strange.

243
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:25,617
He's being beyond
overprotective of you, right?

244
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:33,058
So, I didn't want to intrude,

245
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,662
but I did some research
on your dad's company.

246
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:41,800
His company is a client of my bank,
so it wasn't difficult to do research.

247
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,840
And?

248
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,880
Your dad's subordinate filed
a complaint of power harassment.

249
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:03,789
Your dad got isolated at work
as many agreed with the claim.

250
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:10,262
He's been told to stay at home for now,
but he'll probably be forced to resign.

251
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:22,741
I think he's been rushing us
to get married because…

252
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:28,514
he wanted us to seal the deal
before he had to resign from work.

253
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:34,353
I do understand how he feels,
being a company employee myself.

254
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:40,426
Because the more you succeed,
the worse it is when you fail.

255
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:48,267
Why don't you talk to him properly?

256
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,940
I will.

257
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,786
Hey, Kaoru! Why are you here?

258
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,356
I felt restless.

259
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,569
I spoke to the police.

260
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:28,040
An officer I know told me indirectly

261
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:35,280
that Ms. Akina is also the prime suspect
in the murder of the number one host.

262
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,718
You must be joking.

263
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,490
I don't know what happened,
but I think it's also connected

264
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,793
to this incident.

265
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,162
No way.

266
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,434
So, we drove her into madness?

267
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,939
I'm sure the police will suspect
there was an issue with our sales methods.

268
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,112
I'll need to think carefully
about the future of this club

269
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,114
and notify everyone.

270
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,084
Boss!

271
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:22,661
Did you tell me I should retire
because you knew this might happen?

272
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,568
You won't close the club, will you?

273
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,406
I…

274
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:40,746
I will always be grateful
that we met that day.

275
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,561
Hey!

276
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,565
- You guys are just full of energy.
- Come on.

277
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,600
Let's go.

278
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,535
Go!

279
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,012
Slow down and chew properly.

280
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,385
<i>You made me realize that…</i>

281
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,456
even a dumb jerk like me deserves to live.

282
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,731
Kaoru.

283
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,035
I actually have…

284
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,973
a criminal record.

285
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,281
I tried to quit my host club
because I fell for a girl,

286
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,417
but the owner forbade me to quit
so we got into a fight and…

287
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,787
I killed a staff member
who tried to stop us.

288
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:01,927
It's been 23 years already,
but I'll never forget it.

289
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,071
One thing I promised myself
when I opened this club

290
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:18,644
was to step away from this business
if anything happens

291
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,746
that threatens a person's life.

292
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,652
If there's anything I can do,
please tell me.

293
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,091
Okay.

294
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,294
Let's see.

295
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,031
In that case…

296
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,068
Start by cleaning this place up.

297
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,525
Right, let's start.

298
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:13,498
How do you feel about the fact
that Ms. Akina tried to stab you?

299
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,302
I wasn't surprised.

300
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:23,075
I had a feeling she was the one
who murdered that number one, Jin.

301
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,111
Why was that?

302
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,414
I was friends with Jin.

303
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,752
He told me he had some issues
with Ms. Akina.

304
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,758
You knew about it
yet you kept her as a customer?

305
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:46,198
I leeched off her as much as I could
before passing her on to Kaoru.

306
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,371
I'm an awful person.

307
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:59,044
Do you want to apologize to Ms. Akina?

308
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,182
Not really.

309
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,219
She spent her money to have a good time.

310
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,421
It's her own fault.

311
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,857
Her own fault?

312
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,864
Do you not realize
that you ruined that woman's life?

313
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,905
- You can talk.
- Huh?

314
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,708
You were attracted to me, too.

315
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,978
You used your work as an excuse to see me.

316
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,246
Don't be so sly.

317
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,384
Independent-looking women like you
are the most persistent ones!

318
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,420
- Stop it!
- You want to sleep with me?

319
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,256
Hey, stop! Let go of me!

320
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:51,229
For a short period of time,
I did think about becoming your customer.

321
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,736
But unfortunately, I didn't get hooked.

322
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,139
I get it.

323
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,144
Any woman can get into…

324
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,649
Ms. Akina's situation.

325
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,752
In total?

326
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,922
At least 100 million yen, I think.

327
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,725
According to our research,

328
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:25,430
you even helped Jin cover
the deposits for his car and apartment.

329
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,201
How could you afford that?

330
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,572
You know it all already, right?

331
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:41,446
In the beginning,
I paid for Jin with my own money,

332
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,749
but I soon ran out.

333
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,886
<i>As soon as I ran out of money,</i>

334
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,390
<i>he changed his attitude and became cold.</i>

335
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,292
Then I will kill myself!

336
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,129
- Stop that! Stop it!
- No!

337
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,604
So are you saying
you didn't mean to kill him?

338
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:08,673
I don't care if you believe me.

339
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,809
<i>Pour it!</i>

340
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,077
<i>Pour it!</i>

341
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,279
<i>I was scared of getting caught.</i>

342
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,681
<i>To try to forget reality,</i>

343
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,986
<i>I went to JOKER</i>
<i>and got addicted to Tsubasa.</i>

344
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,356
<i>I wanted to make him number one.</i>

345
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,027
<i>So I started using my company's funds.</i>

346
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,062
But the company found out,

347
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,300
and a board meeting
was scheduled to question you.

348
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:44,609
I just wanted to see Tsubasa
one last time and say…

349
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,880
"Whatever happens,

350
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:55,987
I will always be rooting for you."

351
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,392
But…

352
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:07,198
<i>He looked at me</i>
<i>like he was looking at something filthy.</i>

353
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,735
<i>I thought, "I see.</i>

354
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:16,308
<i>He knew that I killed Jin</i>
<i>and was milking money out of me!"</i>

355
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:21,446
So you decided to kill Tsubasa instead?

356
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,582
Not just him.

357
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,820
All men who exploit women.

358
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,589
All of them!

359
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,958
I wanted to kill all of them!

360
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:42,801
I've worked so hard by myself.

361
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,206
I wanted to be someone's number one.

362
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,910
I wanted…

363
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,081
to be genuinely thanked by someone.

364
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,086
I wanted someone in my life

365
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,957
who can't live without me!

366
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,963
<i>On the 18th of this month, Ms. Utsunomiya,</i>

367
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,468
tried to stab hosts with a kitchen knife
at the club "THE JOKER" in Kabukicho.

368
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,270
Ms. Machida, Ms. Akina's case
was sent to the prosecutor.

369
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,775
- Okay. I see. Thanks.
- She also confessed to murdering a host…

370
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,880
Thank you for lending me this book.

371
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:32,350
Are you okay?

372
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,755
You tend to struggle to let things go.

373
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:42,227
Even with students, you try too hard
and get disliked by them.

374
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,999
To be honest,
I was worried about you teaching Kaoru.

375
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,935
Is that why you helped me?

376
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:54,439
It's my duty as your assistant teacher.

377
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,209
But I do feel relieved now.

378
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:03,281
Nothing good can happen from a teacher
being associated with a host.

379
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,717
It's the right choice.

380
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:08,687
<i>The right choice.</i>

381
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,422
<i>That's it.</i>

382
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,425
<i>I've always chosen the right path.</i>

383
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,062
<i>I didn't know how else to live.</i>

384
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,165
- I'm back!
- Welcome back!

385
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,334
I also washed yours.

386
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,336
Sorry! Thank you!

387
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,742
By the way, why did you protect Tsubasa?

388
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,280
Well, I don't really know,

389
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,883
in the moment I saw him as a friend.

390
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,985
It's weird 'cos I hated him.

391
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,389
I'm not surprised.

392
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,658
- Ow.
- Give it here.

393
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,826
Sorry.

394
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,196
- There you go.
- Thank you.

395
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,301
I'm worried about the club.

396
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:01,406
Will there be fewer customers
because of the incident?

397
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,641
I don't know.

398
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,049
Oh!

399
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,218
- It's from the club.
- What?

400
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,854
Hello.

401
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:17,989
Yes.

402
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,193
Okay.

403
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,130
Yes. See you later.

404
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,367
They're reopening today!

405
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,035
- Really?
- Yeah!

406
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,738
- I'm so happy! Ouch!
- Hey, take it slow.

407
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,273
I'll get ready and head out.

408
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,475
Okay! I'll head there a bit later.

409
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,211
Let's do this!

410
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,346
All right!

411
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:54,993
REOPENING TODAY AT 7:00 P.M.!

412
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,461
All right.

413
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,362
Excuse me!

414
00:29:58,696 --> 00:29:59,898
Whoa, you scared me!

415
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:01,900
Hi.

416
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,904
Hi? That's all? After what you did?

417
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,574
Wait, I…

418
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,745
Whoa, what is it?

419
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,281
- I really…
- You scare me.

420
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,415
I really am…

421
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:19,918
sorry!

422
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,988
It's fine.

423
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,558
- I'm busy with the reopening, so…
- Wait.

424
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:29,861
- It's not open yet, right? Can I come in?
- What?

425
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,331
I want to know more about you.

426
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,335
Hey, wait.

427
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,537
Please! Is this okay?

428
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,906
- It was written down!
- Morning!

429
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,508
- Morning!
- Hey, good morning!

430
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,843
You're fit to work now?

431
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,711
I'm good! Very good!

432
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,148
- I'm glad.
- Sorry, I worried you.

433
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,917
Right, this guy…

434
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,752
He's my friend.

435
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,487
He wants to become a host.

436
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,022
- What?
- Right?

437
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,892
Yes. I'm his friend
and I want to be a host.

438
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,027
- Nice to meet you!
- You too.

439
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,600
Walk properly
if you want to become a host!

440
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,500
Yeah.

441
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,203
It's a completely different world.

442
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,838
Nice, right?

443
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,473
So? How can I help?

444
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,808
Yeah. You…

445
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:21,946
You didn't tell Manami
or the police that I was the one

446
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:24,716
who injured you.

447
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:25,717
No.

448
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,622
W-Why didn't you?

449
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,259
I didn't want to trouble her.

450
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,463
If you get arrested
by the police for assault,

451
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,998
you'll lose your job.

452
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,868
And I bet you work for a good company.

453
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:50,408
I thought that'll derail
the marriage plan.

454
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,945
By "marriage," you mean…

455
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,114
mine and Manami's marriage?

456
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,615
Who else?

457
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,918
Sorry.

458
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:04,756
It's okay.

459
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:14,399
I never hit anyone before.

460
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,669
When you hit someone,
you get injured too, huh?

461
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,804
That's obvious.

462
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,906
Are you okay?

463
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,909
Can you really make her happy?

464
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,781
- I think so.
- You think so?

465
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,053
You need to say, "Definitely".

466
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,423
Hey, Kaoru! Long time no see!

467
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:39,824
Hey, long time no see!

468
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,159
Let me know who's coming.

469
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:43,294
Yeah, okay! Will do!

470
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:47,265
Right, that's the end of your trial!
Get home safe.

471
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,335
It's been a while!

472
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:54,472
- It has!
- Hi, guys! Yeah!

473
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:55,974
Take it slow, okay?

474
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,609
- I'm totally fine!
- It must be nice to be young!

475
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,018
Kaoru!

476
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,220
There you go.

477
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:10,989
Oh gosh, shit!

478
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:17,895
See? What an outrageous incident!
I'm glad you weren't part of it!

479
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:22,333
Now get a move on
and get the wedding plans going

480
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,136
while he's still obsessed with you!

481
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:33,511
Mr. Kawahara said I should talk to you

482
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,280
before we start planning the wedding.

483
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,716
Talk about what?

484
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:43,755
About your company.

485
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,893
I heard about what's happened.

486
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,996
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

487
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,900
Nothing for you to worry about.

488
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:01,272
Once you're in a higher position,
you become a target!

489
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,341
I will not lose!

490
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,511
They can't get rid of me this easily!

491
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,313
Is your life over if you lose your job?

492
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,350
No, right?

493
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:27,532
Tell us everything.

494
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,302
That's unnecessary.

495
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:41,079
It's my fault for being unreliable
and making you worry all the time.

496
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:45,283
You always had to act tough, even at home.

497
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,956
I'll move out now.

498
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:54,826
The marriage…

499
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,161
My work…

500
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:00,231
I need time to think on my own.

501
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,535
So dad, you can stop…

502
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,072
pressuring yourself.

503
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,611
I'll find a place during the holidays
and let you know.

504
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,903
HOST MURDER INCIDENT IN KABUKICHO

505
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,807
MANAMI OGAWA

506
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,342
<i>Can I stay over for a while?</i>

507
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:47,478
- Ms. Machida, could you check this?
- Okay.

508
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,415
<i>Did you finally convince your dad?</i>

509
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,652
<i>I need to get out for now.</i>

510
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,689
<i>Okay. I support whatever you decide.</i>

511
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,192
<i>Thank you.</i>

512
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,294
<i>I think it's my only chance.</i>

513
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:07,498
<i>Perfect. I wanted someone</i>
<i>to talk to tonight.</i>

514
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,434
- Bye.
<i>- I'll try to get home early.</i>

515
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,871
JOKER's reopening today!

516
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,039
What? Really?

517
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,808
- Ouch! That's not it!
- What? This hurts? Sorry…

518
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,678
- I'll do it slowly. There!
- Ouch!

519
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,147
- You did that on purpose.
- No… Ouch!

520
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,183
- It hurts.
- We're so fragile.

521
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,120
I'm sorry about what happened.

522
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,256
How's your arm?

523
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,192
It's better.

524
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,962
If anything happens to me, help me then!

525
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,431
In that case, me too!

526
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,800
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

527
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,368
Meeting's about to start!

528
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,836
- Gather around!
- Yes!

529
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,243
Welcome back.

530
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,678
Thank you!

531
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:54,812
Is everyone here?

532
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,147
Yes!

533
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,483
I'm sure you've been anxious,

534
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:04,055
but as of today, THE JOKER will reopen!

535
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:06,023
- Yeah!
- Wow!

536
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,760
However, it's just for tonight.

537
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,662
- What? Why?
- Just tonight?

538
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,065
For the last ten years,

539
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,468
THE JOKER has been a place filled
with dreams for so many people.

540
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,738
But sadly, one of our customers
has committed a crime.

541
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:26,043
Not saying it was our fault,
but this club did play a role in it.

542
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,546
We can't justify staying open.

543
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,880
Hang on a minute!

544
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,683
Is there nothing we can do?

545
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,219
I'll work hard! I'll do anything!

546
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,788
I want to keep working here.

547
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,925
I've built relationships
with many princesses!

548
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,994
I want to keep working, too!

549
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,695
- Boss!
- Let's not give up yet!

550
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,330
- Please!
- We can do this!

551
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,598
Boss!

552
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,570
The best solution
is for me to quit, right?

553
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,141
No. I'm taking all of the responsibility.

554
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:02,413
A day consists of daytime and nighttime.

555
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,385
Humans also need some time
out of the sunlight

556
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,621
where they can show their vulgar desires.

557
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,292
The outside world is tough,

558
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,261
so I wanted to provide a safe space
for men to compete.

559
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,529
That was my dream.

560
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,601
It's also why I riled you up.

561
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:31,375
However, the incident made me realize
that my ideas were wrong.

562
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:37,648
Stop crying!

563
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,550
I'm sorry.

564
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,919
Kaoru, well said.

565
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,956
It's already been decided!

566
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,793
We still have tonight!
Let's go out with a bang!

567
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,961
- Yes!
- Yes!

568
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,665
Everyone, start getting ready and smile!

569
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:55,700
Yes.

570
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,602
Smile, everyone. We need to smile! Okay?

571
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,506
What is it?

572
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,675
I…

573
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,519
I'll give it my all today
and make it a hell of a night.

574
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,355
No.

575
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:21,192
All you need to do is enjoy it.

576
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,869
- I was wrong. Sorry.
- Really?

577
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,637
- I'll go, let them know.
- Thanks.

578
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,475
We have no customers coming in!

579
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,276
That's so weird.

580
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,446
I've let my girls know we're open today.

581
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,348
I also called my girls.

582
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,183
I think we all have.

583
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,686
Do you think it's because of the incident?

584
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,954
Is that why?

585
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,624
We have a customer! Welcome!

586
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,593
Welcome!

587
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,795
Watch your step.

588
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,600
Yukari!

589
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,602
I missed you.

590
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,472
I felt hesitant, but I still came!

591
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:09,740
Thank you.

592
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,609
Welcome!

593
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,711
Welcome!

594
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,779
This way.

595
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,481
We have a customer! Welcome!

596
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,016
Welcome!

597
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,384
- Kaoru!
- What?

598
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,819
- Finally!
- Sorry, I'm late!

599
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,424
Let's make it a great night.

600
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,393
Welcome!

601
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:35,900
OBON FESTIVAL

602
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,581
MS. MANAMI OGAWA

603
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,584
TAIGA TAKAMORI

604
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:05,563
MS. CHIHUAHUA
YOU'RE PRETTIER WHEN YOU ARE ASLEEP

605
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,572
Let's play the King's Game!

606
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,273
- The King's Game?
- Yes!

607
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,309
Can I join you?

608
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,210
- What?
- The King?

609
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,277
- Really?
- You too?

610
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,413
I'll be your assistant today, Kaoru.

611
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,550
Drinking with the top two hosts?
Are you kidding me?

612
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:30,788
We're rivals, but I guess
I'll make an exception!

613
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:34,592
In that case,
as a gift for the both of you,

614
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,894
I want to order the most expensive drink!

615
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,163
Really? Are you sure?

616
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,019
You scared me!

617
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:07,691
Dad?

618
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,127
Open the door!

619
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:15,933
What are you doing? Open it!

620
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,070
JOKER's last champagne
is a whopping five million yen a bottle!

621
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,806
Thank you very much!

622
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:26,043
Thanks!

623
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:31,215
On top of that, to celebrate today,

624
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:36,186
here's a special champagne tower
as a gift to everyone from THE JOKER!

625
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,123
Gather around, please!

626
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,591
- Let's go.
- Okay!

627
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,428
This is amazing!

628
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,397
You took too long!

629
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,633
Open the door! Please!

630
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,637
Hey, this is insane!

631
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,009
You're not capable of anything!
I can't let you go!

632
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,946
Why would you say that?

633
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,416
Do you think you got into
that publisher all by yourself?

634
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,521
I asked the CEO to hire you!

635
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:16,160
You got to work in that department
not because your exam score was good,

636
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,429
but because I asked!

637
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,065
After you fell
for that stupid guy and quit,

638
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,934
I asked your school principal
to hire you as a teacher!

639
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:28,539
You can't do anything without my help!

640
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,440
Don't you get it?

641
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:31,642
I know that!

642
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,745
That's why I told you I'm moving out!

643
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,780
Enough already!

644
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,854
Manami! Go!

645
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,089
- Hurry!
- Move!

646
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,991
Hurry up and go!

647
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,926
- I'll be fine!
- Manami!

648
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,561
Manami!

649
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,509
<i>Looking back was not an option.</i>

650
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,645
<i>I ran.</i>

651
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:13,017
<i>The streets I knew well</i>
<i>didn't feel familiar.</i>

652
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:20,224
Thank you all for coming
on THE JOKER's final night!

653
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:26,230
"That night THE JOKER
was the place to be in Kabukicho."

654
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:29,266
I want people to remember us that way.

655
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,138
So I want all of us here tonight
to party until we drop!

656
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,406
Let's go!

657
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,274
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

658
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,842
Let's go!

659
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,177
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

660
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:41,645
Let's go!

661
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,213
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

662
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,582
- Kaoru! Please take over!
- Sure!

663
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,217
- Well then!
- Yeah!

664
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,919
- JOKER's last night!
- Yeah!

665
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,155
- The special champagne!
- Yeah!

666
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,890
- Let's open it!
- Yeah!

667
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,393
<i>Pour it!</i>

668
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,028
<i>Pour it!</i>

669
00:44:58,095 --> 00:44:59,663
<i>Pour it!</i>

670
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,864
<i>Pour it!</i>

671
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,700
<i>Pour it!</i>

672
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,001
<i>Pour it!</i>

673
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,903
<i>Pour it!</i>

674
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,304
<i>Pour it!</i>

675
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,073
<i>Fever JOKER!</i>

676
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,574
<i>Fever JOKER!</i>

677
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,271
<i>He cares about you more than I do.</i>

678
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:43,774
I was hoping you and Ms. Chihuahua
would get together.

679
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:46,110
I can't live the life you want me to live.

680
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:47,377
Ms. Chihuahua!

681
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:53,951
THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS
