1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,338
TAKE CARE, MISS.

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:09,776
<i>So we're putting a period</i>
<i>on our relationship after today?</i>

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,850
<i>We received a call from a parent asking</i>
<i>about your relationship with the host.</i>

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,852
<i>It's called seductive marketing, right?</i>

5
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,054
<i>I am a host through and through.</i>

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,390
I'll do anything
to make my princesses happy.

7
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,290
Hey!

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,358
Here!

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,674
- Lowering the stretcher!
- Okay!

10
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,379
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

11
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,214
Can you hear me?

12
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,316
I'm going to touch you, okay?

13
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,989
- Ouch!
- You fell from up there?

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,958
We'll take you to the hospital now!

15
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,261
No, thank you!

16
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,629
That doesn't work for me…

17
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,863
- Don't move!
- Ow!

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,466
Do you have any family members
we can contact?

19
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,101
No, I don't.

20
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,570
- I'm fine, really!
- Be careful!

21
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,014
Please stay conscious!

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,450
PIETAS GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

23
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:30,356
They've been waiting a long time.

24
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,195
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting!

25
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm very sorry to have caused you worry!

26
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,169
We were not worried about you!

27
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,942
Is it true that you're dating
a host from Kabukicho?

28
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:54,280
My daughter saw you talking to him
intimately at the school gate.

29
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,825
It's true that I was meeting up with him.

30
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:11,097
He never went to school properly,
so I was teaching him literacy skills.

31
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,737
Sorry to interrupt,
but she is telling the truth.

32
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,206
She asked me for some advice.

33
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:24,477
Shouldn't you be focused
on teaching your homeroom students?

34
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:28,615
Letting your guard down around someone
who tricks women for profit…

35
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,751
You should be ashamed of yourself!
It's unacceptable!

36
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,786
- We're very sorry!
- Wait a minute.

37
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,189
- Mr. Takamori is…
- Ms. Ogawa.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,162
I understand why you're upset,

39
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,798
but I have already told him
that I cannot see him again

40
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,234
to avoid misunderstandings like this.

41
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,140
However, I do apologize
for my thoughtless behavior.

42
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,077
So it's a misunderstanding?

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,117
If so, Ms. Ogawa,
can you write a signed promise?

44
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,952
A signed promise?

45
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,556
Although you might think
seeing a host isn't breaking any laws,

46
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:14,194
the entertainment business act law
was revised with stricter sanctions

47
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,030
due to the large number of victims
created by the industry.

48
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,600
The promise should say,

49
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:26,172
"As a teacher and a mentor to minors,
I will never again be involved

50
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,978
with people who work at host clubs
which are deemed evil under social norms."

51
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,183
Understood.

52
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,452
Let's go.

53
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,823
I'm so sorry about this.

54
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,258
My apologies.

55
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,473
NISHI-SHINJUKU GENERAL HOSPITAL

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,309
Lucky you didn't need surgery.

57
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,479
I'm fine! Everyone is overreacting.

58
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,382
I'll be out of here in no time… Ouch!

59
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:14,554
You have a fractured rib
and some bleeding in your brain.

60
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,289
You have to rest for a few days.

61
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,124
Okay.

62
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:23,997
Whatever you tell me to do,
Ms. Kawaguchi, I will listen.

63
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,366
- Do you promise?
- Yes.

64
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,068
- Sorry to intrude.
- Excuse me.

65
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,376
Are you Mr. Taiga Takamori,
also known as Kaoru from JOKER?

66
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,878
I'm Kurosaki, Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

67
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,982
A hospital visit from the police?

68
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,984
What an honor.

69
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,623
I heard you asked to be transferred from
a hospital in Miura City to one in Tokyo?

70
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,892
Seems like you're injured pretty badly.

71
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,096
Did you get into a fight
with someone in Miura City?

72
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,599
No, I fell. It was my fault.

73
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,601
Is that so?

74
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,171
- Who did you go there with?
- By myself!

75
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,472
To see the ocean.

76
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,543
Hosts need breaks too, you know.

77
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,247
If you got caught up in trouble,
we'd like for you to report it.

78
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,616
As I said, it wasn't like that!

79
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,284
Are you done?

80
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:22,221
You cops always assume it's a crime
the moment you hear a host was injured.

81
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,492
Contact us anytime
if you remember anything.

82
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,096
- Thank you for your time.
- Excuse me.

83
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,904
So condescending!

84
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,940
Hosts aren't liked too much by society.

85
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,608
- Ouch!
- Are you okay?

86
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,509
Yeah, I'm fine.

87
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,679
- I brought you some stuff you might need.
- Thank you!

88
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,782
What are these?

89
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,551
They're so cool!

90
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,387
Something suitable
for the number one host-to-be!

91
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,155
These are amazing!

92
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,224
All the nurses will fall for me!

93
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,860
- Great! They can come and nominate you!
- Oh, wow!

94
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,528
This is the best gift ever!

95
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,497
So, tell me the truth.

96
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,733
Huh?

97
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:11,170
It's me after all!

98
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,707
Who were you with?
You even took a day off work.

99
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,381
- Ms. Chihuahua.
- I knew it!

100
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,816
How did you get injured?

101
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,286
After we said goodbye,

102
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,423
I missed a step on the pedestrian bridge.

103
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,394
You do often fall over
even when you're dancing!

104
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,597
Stop! Don't make fun of me.

105
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,533
Seriously…

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,669
So, why didn't you come back
together if it was a date?

107
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,605
Why all the questions?

108
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,243
We decided not to meet again.

109
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,979
Last date at the beach?

110
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,348
You guys are like high schoolers!

111
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,916
Anyway…

112
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,384
I fell, okay?

113
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:05,258
Don't tell anyone,
especially her, that I got injured.

114
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,427
Noted!

115
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,530
- They don't suit you.
- What! Why?

116
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:14,000
- Could you check the materials I made?
- Sure.

117
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,836
This looks good.

118
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:20,473
- It's well made. Perfect!
- Really? Thank you.

00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,717
I'M SORRY I MADE YOU WORRY

123
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,619
I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY! GET SOME REST

124
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,722
ARE YOU AT SCHOOL TODAY?

125
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,832
HOST CLUBS WHICH ARE DEEMED EVIL

126
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,546
ARE YOU AT SCHOOL TODAY?
HOW ABOUT DINNER AFTER WORK?

127
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:42,288
I'M SORRY

128
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,691
I HAD SOME ISSUES AT WORK
SO I DON'T THINK I CAN

129
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,326
Issues?

130
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,032
Good morning!

131
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,773
The first half of the fiscal year
will be ending in a month.

132
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,743
Our fund wrap target
will not be met at this rate.

133
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,148
Please report the status of your projects
in the pipeline list, so we can discuss

134
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,952
how to meet the targets
in our full-year financial results.

135
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,488
Could you start us off, Mr. Takei?

136
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,823
I REALLY WANT TO SEE YOU TODAY!
HOW ABOUT TEA?

137
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,727
I got all-you-can-drink.

138
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,731
What issues did you have?

139
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,135
Just with some parents.

140
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,905
I see. Your student's parents?

141
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,711
Must be tough dealing
with that during summer break.

142
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:42,415
Not at all. I have a long way
to go to earn my students' trust.

143
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,916
I admire your efforts!

144
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,652
I only care about my own results.

145
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,022
It's hard for me to think
about my customers.

146
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,593
As a bankman
I should think about them more.

147
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,761
They entrust me with their lives.

148
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,430
What happened to your hand?

149
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,902
Oh, I fell down and landed
on my hand, and it fractured.

150
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,538
Your right hand… How inconvenient!

151
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,640
It's a first for me.

152
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,475
But don't worry, I'm fine!

153
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,243
By the way…

154
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,647
How is it going
with that host called Kaoru?

155
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,284
I'm never seeing him again.

156
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,186
I told him so.

157
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,355
When?

158
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,389
What?

159
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,625
Yesterday.

160
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,726
Yesterday.

161
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,427
I see.

162
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:33,566
And did he agree?

163
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:40,640
As in, he's a host after all,
so you know, he might get pushy.

164
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,241
I doubt that.

165
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,677
Yes, he is a host.

166
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,749
But he wasn't the type
to ruin someone's life.

167
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,085
Don't defend him! That's super annoying!

168
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,323
I'm joking!

169
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,492
I'm glad he wasn't a weird guy!

170
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:04,330
I'm actually quite timid, so…

171
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,235
I tend to worry too much
especially about you.

172
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,773
I'm sorry for causing you
unnecessary stress and worries.

173
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:19,211
But I mean it!
I'm not going to see him again.

174
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,581
Really?

175
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,218
- Yes.
- Okay, cool.

176
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,321
I'll get you a drink. Hot coffee?

177
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,259
- I can get it myself! You're injured!
- No, I'm fine!

178
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,764
<i>I want to love him properly.</i>

179
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:43,402
<i>I want to cherish him.</i>
<i>He waited patiently for my selfish self.</i>

180
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,640
I guess that's solved.

181
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,476
Oh, hot water!

182
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,011
Ouch, that's hot!

183
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,015
Taiga!

184
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,316
Yuki!

185
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,452
Wow, you have so much energy!

186
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:03,222
It was quite a shock
getting a call from the hospital.

187
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:06,225
I was told I need someone
to prove my identity.

188
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,060
Sorry for being a nuisance.

189
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,363
I never said that. Don't be so cynical.

190
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,433
- Are you okay?
- What? Yeah, totally!

191
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,603
It's just an injury,
so I'll be out of here soon.

192
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,673
- Taiga, I really like this book.
- What?

193
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,574
THE LION AND THE MOUSE

194
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,477
"The lion accidentally stepped into a trap

195
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,079
set up by humans!"

196
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,648
Are you curious
about what will happen too?

197
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,285
I'm glad.

198
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,824
If you open the fridge there,
you should find your favorite juice.

199
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,026
- Lots of them!
- Cool!

200
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,335
You got injured at Miura Beach, I heard?

201
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,906
You remembered going there with me?

202
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,176
You were so cute back then!

203
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,578
Yet I had to go there
so you can see a guy.

204
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,647
I treated you to ice cream, didn't I?

205
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,817
Treated?

206
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:13,125
You seem to think
that I'm a terrible mother,

207
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,761
but I was hurt too, you know.

208
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:21,200
I didn't get to graduate from high school,
so I wanted my kids to go to university.

209
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:27,673
But as soon as you entered
elementary school, you were quite a…

210
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,044
I was shocked.
I felt like my dream was crushed.

211
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,381
I didn't know what to do.

212
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,119
- I bet my dad was dumb too.
- No, not at all.

213
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,688
He was very clever, actually.

214
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,592
Well, sorry I disappointed you.

215
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,263
By the way,
that lady you brought with you,

216
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,098
is she really your teacher?

217
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,003
Being a host isn't easy, huh?

218
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:02,575
Having to butter up such boring girls
so that they pay your salary.

219
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,010
Who's the one who can't live
without my salary?

220
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,246
Taiga.

221
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:15,654
The three million yen he asked you for
it can wait until you're better.

222
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,929
So get better soon
and become number one, okay?

223
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,401
Taiga! What's this?

224
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,741
That's something very important to me.

225
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,577
I'm back!

226
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,846
Welcome back.

227
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,818
You haven't eaten yet, have you?
I'm just about to start cooking.

228
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,189
Sorry.

229
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,558
I've eaten already, actually.

230
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,228
Was there an issue at school?

231
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,632
Tell me. I can be of help.

232
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,569
It's okay, I can resolve it on my own.

233
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,437
Can you?

234
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,908
Of course, she can!

235
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,209
Trust your daughter.

236
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:14,280
How can I trust her? She's been infatuated
with a host while being engaged!

237
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,220
I heard you weren't
at Miura Beach with Yoji.

238
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,724
You teach at a girls' school.

239
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:30,329
Not only would you get fired,
it could become news!

240
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,100
I've been debating whether
or not to go to the police first,

241
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,636
and haven't been to work
the last few days.

242
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,508
Is what I did really that bad?

243
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,243
Manami.

244
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:50,649
You are a kind person
but you lack self-awareness.

245
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,285
It's your fatal flaw.

246
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,521
Don't just assume that!

247
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:58,424
I know you more than you know yourself!

248
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,592
I've known you since you were in diapers--

249
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,329
Stop it! Don't talk about diapers to me!

250
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,766
Manami.

251
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,036
TAIGA TAKAMORI

252
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,094
<i>Hello? It's me, Ogawa!</i>

253
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:13,932
I…

254
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,570
I know I shouldn't call you, but…

255
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,074
my family and the school know about us,

256
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,476
and it became an issue.

257
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,212
So someone might contact
your workplace too.

258
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,483
Okay.

259
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,885
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,953
I just wanted to let you know!

261
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,423
Thank you.

262
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,025
MS. CHIHUAHUA

263
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,380
Why were you waiting outside, you dummy?

264
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,116
I wish you had called me!

265
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,351
I didn't want to disturb your work.

266
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,787
You've always been this way.

267
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:46,358
- You keep waiting silently and creepily.
- Creepily?

268
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,193
That's mean.

269
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,865
What were you going to do
if I came back with a guy?

270
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,100
You don't have a guy.

271
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,835
Now that's mean!

272
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,007
What is it? Something serious?

273
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,546
I went to Miura Beach
with Mr. Takamori yesterday.

274
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,382
With Kaoru?

275
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,584
Like a date?

276
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,420
Our first and last date.

277
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,890
What if people find out?

278
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,525
Yeah.

279
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,628
My family and the school found out.

280
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,900
"Don't get involved with those
deemed evil under social norms."

281
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,075
So you had to write
a signed promise this time?

282
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,547
Well, this is how society
views your relationship.

283
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,450
I was so frustrated.

284
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,257
I…

285
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,528
I think I had actually fallen for him.

286
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,796
You had?

287
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,067
Yeah. I’m not going to see him again.

288
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,571
I just wanted
to talk to someone, that's all.

289
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,106
He's over me already, anyway.

290
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:09,408
Over you?

291
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,245
It's probably no big deal
for Kaoru, you know.

292
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,814
Make-believe romances
are part of their job.

293
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,151
Hey, do you still not get it?

294
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,520
You're addicted to a host.

295
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,488
You're seconds away from going crazy!

296
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,757
Nine, eight, seven, six…

297
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,327
All women who get addicted to them say,

298
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:33,465
"No, he's one of the good ones!
He really loves me, and only me!"

299
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,500
And watch their life fall apart.

300
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:43,141
Manami, I'm not kidding when I say
you will lose everything.

301
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,277
Is that okay?

302
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:53,051
If you say you don't mind that,
then I will support you!

303
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,591
As I said,
I'm never going to see him again!

304
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,759
Calm down.

305
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:10,335
I'll be right back.

306
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:17,209
Kaoru told me
that he just missed a step and fell.

307
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,414
He told us so too, but…

308
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,452
What do you think has happened,
Mr. Kurosaki?

309
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,492
We think he possibly got pushed
down the stairs by a certain person.

310
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,693
A certain person?

311
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,364
The investigation
into the murdered host is going well.

312
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,666
No.

313
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,970
I doubt that Kaoru's done anything
to put his life in danger.

314
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,107
I've known you for a long time,
so let me give you a warning.

315
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:54,012
If this person turns up here,
be on the alert.

316
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,449
And please report to us immediately.

317
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,024
- Okay then. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

318
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,201
I WILL NEVER BE INVOLVED WITH PEOPLE
WHO WORK AT HOST CLUBS

319
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,003
WHICH ARE DEEMED EVIL UNDER SOCIAL NORMS

320
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,505
Ms. Ogawa.

321
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,878
Did you do it out of compassion
for the unprivileged boy?

322
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:32,050
Or was it to fulfill your own desire?

323
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,919
I just wanted him to--

324
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,921
You don't have to answer right now.

325
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,027
I'm also a woman.

326
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:45,964
I have many occasions
when I have to overcome desires.

327
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:52,237
When that happens, I ask myself
the question I just asked you.

328
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,609
And when I do so, I know what to do.

329
00:22:58,810 --> 00:22:59,845
I see.

330
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:02,214
Ms. Ogawa.

331
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,050
I believe in you.

332
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,652
Thank you.

333
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,865
Ms. Sawaguchi is in the library studying.

334
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,301
Thank you.

335
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,842
- Ms. Sawaguchi.
- Don't come near me.

336
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,617
I'm sorry for acting
carelessly the other day.

337
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,753
I don't want your apology.

338
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,691
"I'm addicted to a host
I used to criticize."

339
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:51,163
"I've spent so much money
and I'm up to my eyeballs in debt."

340
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:55,467
If you came crying, admitting to that,
it would be easier to forgive.

341
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,388
Oh, hi. Sorry to disturb you.

342
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,256
Is this about Manami again?

343
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,726
- Don't you have to work?
- I do work hard!

344
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,596
I even got told
I will definitely get promoted soon!

345
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,164
The executives said so, too!

346
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:30,502
It is prime time for me
to take care of my fiancé's matter.

347
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,003
So, what is it this time?

348
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,475
Manami went to Miura Beach with Kaoru.

349
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:41,480
How do you know that?

350
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,918
Manami's mom called
because the school was looking for Manami.

351
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,558
And? Did you get angry
and punch a door or something?

352
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,427
No, nothing like that!

353
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,131
Tell her you want to call it off!

354
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,166
What?

355
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,368
She might start to want you more.

356
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,770
That's so irresponsible!

357
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,206
Sometimes you need to play hard to get.

358
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,376
- Don't you think?
- But I'm not good at that.

359
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,613
I just hope Kaoru never comes back.

360
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,215
That's dark.

361
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,952
Also, you're opening up too much to me.

362
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,120
Sorry.

363
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,756
I just feel like
I could tell you anything.

364
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,658
You've got to be kidding!

365
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,827
In any case, I can't help you!

366
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,996
- This is about you and Manami.
- But…

367
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,565
- Bye! Oh, and by the way--
- Oh, wait!

368
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,867
Don't come back here, okay? I'm busy.

369
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,340
"Never comes back"?

370
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,213
What does that mean?

371
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:52,317
Oh wow, I did not expect you to visit me.

372
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,820
- Are you bothered?
- Well, a bit.

373
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,924
- What's that?
- Shine Muscat grapes.

374
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,594
They're in high demand now, just like us.

375
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:10,201
I hope you're not making
too much profit while I'm not there!

376
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,938
It'll be hard to catch up.

377
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,639
These look good.

378
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,207
I can't help it.

379
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,811
People keep nominating me,
keeping me busy.

380
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:26,184
I need you back.
It's boring without a good competitor.

381
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,687
You don't have to tell me that!

382
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,424
Police officers came to the club.

383
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,195
They think this is related
to the murdered host's case.

384
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,464
It's not related.

385
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:45,236
If you don't give them the details,
they'll keep bothering the club.

386
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,743
Hey.

387
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:57,983
You're a jerk,
but you're good at keeping secrets.

388
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,152
I've never told anyone
my customers' secrets.

389
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,860
Actually, I got pushed.

390
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,000
But it was by someone
unrelated to the club.

391
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:19,804
I kind of feel bad for them,
so I don't want to report it.

392
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:28,213
You really are an idiot.

393
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,781
Shut up.

394
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,917
Again, don't tell anyone! Okay?

395
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:37,589
In exchange,
should I tell you one of my secrets?

396
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,557
Yeah? Sounds good to me!

397
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,827
I think…

398
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,930
I'm being targeted.

399
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,867
What? Really?

400
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:51,469
By who?

401
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,374
A woman who can't seem to let go of me.

402
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,077
I almost took you seriously!

403
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,916
Take care.

404
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:22,801
Ms. Momoko.

405
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,203
- You can go.
- Thanks for the drink.

406
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,772
Thank you for the nomination.

407
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,541
Here for an interview?

408
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,409
Thanks for the other day.

409
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,511
I have more questions.

410
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,916
Why do so many women
get addicted to host clubs

411
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,819
although they're considered problematic?

412
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,822
I want to delve into their mindset.

413
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,891
Sounds interesting.

414
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,128
Maybe you should get addicted to find out?

415
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,430
I can help you.

416
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,167
You're such a smooth talker.

417
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,504
Show me what you got.

418
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,313
Let me be frank.

419
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,853
I really like you.

420
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,692
Nope, no butterflies!

421
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,363
Tell the truth.
You're just worried about your friend.

422
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,534
Wow, I guess the number one host
really does have good intuition!

423
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,105
Kaoru's in a hospital right now.

424
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:35,740
Hospital?

425
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,779
He fell and got injured quite badly.

426
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,414
He might not be able to come back.

427
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,250
How did he fall?

428
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,252
I don't know.

429
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,420
I heard he went to a beach.

430
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,489
A beach.

431
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,460
Is it possible…

432
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,469
I feel drunk.

433
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,673
- You rarely drink this much.
- Yeah.

434
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,978
Do you think…

435
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,850
we should get married?

436
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:20,685
What?

437
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,923
I just feel like we're forcing ourselves
into marriage.

438
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,592
That's not true! It's just me…

439
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,360
I'm being indecisive.

440
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,262
Tell her you want to call it off!

441
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,901
I honestly do like you.

442
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,873
You're the first person
I've wanted to marry.

443
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,543
But when I took a step back…

444
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:53,451
I started thinking maybe I should
let you go if I'm causing you distress.

445
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,587
She might start to want you more.

446
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,892
I get it.

447
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,995
I'll also take a step back
and have a think.

448
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,700
What's with that reaction?
I saw you looking at him longingly!

449
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:11,002
- What are you talking about?
- At the station!

450
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,272
I saw you and Kaoru looking
at each other sadly before you parted!

451
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:30,154
No, I went to look for you
because your mom told me.

452
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,357
I was worried
you might not be safe with him.

453
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,560
Did I do something wrong?
I don't think I did.

454
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,161
No, you didn't! But…

455
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,564
I just wish you had told me sooner!

456
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,032
How could I?

457
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,134
You think I followed you out of jealousy!

458
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:46,738
I would never get jealous of a host!

459
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,977
I know. You're not that kind of person.

460
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,883
<i>I felt like our last</i>
<i>memory together got tainted.</i>

461
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,287
<i>But I couldn't say that.</i>

462
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,190
<i>Because I'm to blame</i>
<i>for going to the beach with him.</i>

463
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,898
I wasn't sure if I should tell you, but…

464
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:19,771
Kaoru got injured, and he's hospitalized
at Nishi-Shinjuku General Hospital.

465
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,272
What? Hospitalized?

466
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,977
<i>He went to a beach</i>
<i>and fell from a height, apparently.</i>

467
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,348
You didn't know?

468
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:34,018
What kind of injury? How did he fall?

469
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,421
Was it really just an accident…

470
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:38,690
What do you mean?

471
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,066
I saw you and Kaoru looking
at each other sadly before you parted!

472
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,152
HEALTHY LIVING

473
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,331
MS. CHIHUAHUA

474
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,599
MISSED CALL

475
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:19,757
Hello?

476
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,326
<i>Sorry, did you call me? What's up?</i>

477
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,730
- Well, I'm at…
- I'm at the club right now.

478
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,098
Can you make it quick?

479
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,733
At the club?

480
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,170
I have so many customers
nominating me one after another.

481
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,838
I'm doing really well right now.

482
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,876
Well, that's great.

483
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:39,911
Yeah.

484
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,848
I might actually
become number one this month.

485
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:48,019
Don't drink too much, okay?

486
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,191
So, why did you call me?
Was it to tell me not to drink too much?

487
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:59,530
Oh, I know. You wanted to hear my voice
despite saying you'll never see me again.

488
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,567
You're number one
at being full of yourself!

489
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,803
Miss.

490
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,340
If you want to see me,
come to the club now.

491
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,309
<i>Now?</i>

492
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,510
Yeah.

493
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,980
If you order me a tower,
I can spend some time with you.

494
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,950
- A tower?
<i>- Wait.</i>

495
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,587
Really? You've been around me long enough!

496
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,956
A tower is a champagne tower!

497
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:29,694
<i>I think a million yen one</i>
<i>would be appropriate! Yeah!</i>

498
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,396
A teacher at a private school
must be well-paid.

499
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,400
And I hope you know,
I can't return it this time.

500
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,672
I am a host after all.

501
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,975
Don't forget that.

502
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,880
<i>I know.</i>

503
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,050
Yes, you are a host.

504
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,487
<i>Always surrounded by beautiful women.</i>

505
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,993
Yes, exactly.

506
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:06,497
<i>It's a completely different world</i>
<i>from your very serious world.</i>

507
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,301
You should forget about me already.

508
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,206
I'm sorry for being persistent.

509
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,309
But…

510
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,813
I'm just happy to hear that you're well.

511
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,221
I need to go do a champagne call.

512
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,724
Don't call me anymore, okay?

513
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,626
Bye.

514
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,278
<i>He put on an act for me.</i>

515
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,015
<i>Now I need to move forward too.</i>

516
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,503
Ouch!

517
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,095
Hey.

518
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,566
Are you not going to work again today?

519
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:33,411
Are you sure…

520
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,747
this is about Manami?

521
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,350
- Because you're worried about her?
- Yes!

522
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:46,190
If the school decides to fire her,
I'll need to go talk to the principal.

523
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,362
Maybe it's better
if you don't get involved.

524
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,097
Good morning!

525
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:56,033
Good morning!

526
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,138
Dad.

527
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:06,043
I want to apologize for getting
too emotional the other day.

528
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,278
I'm sorry.

529
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,715
I'm glad to hear that.

530
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,352
I'm going to move out.

531
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,258
I got too comfortable here.

532
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,993
I need to be more independent.

533
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,595
Why are you moving out?

534
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,032
Once you marry Yoji,
you'll have to move out anyway.

535
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,534
- Just wait--
- It has nothing to do with that.

536
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,169
I just want to move out!

537
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:37,608
I'll clean my room today
and start apartment hunting.

538
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,783
Apartment hunting?

539
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,056
NISHI-SHINJUKU GENERAL HOSPITAL

540
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,767
- I heard you're getting released today.
- Oh, Boss! Hello.

541
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,139
Thank you for referring me
to this hospital.

542
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:12,042
I'll work hard to make up for the loss.

543
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,244
Before that.

544
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,380
Anything you want to tell me
about your injury?

545
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,450
No, nothing.

546
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:24,488
I feel embarrassed about how clumsy I am.

547
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,791
Kaoru.

548
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,561
Maybe you should retire as a host.

549
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:32,196
What?

550
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,032
Undisciplined people
will never become number one.

551
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,567
Wait, what?

552
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,569
Retiring from this industry is hard.

553
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,704
Especially for hosts.

554
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,508
I also had a hard time.

555
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,946
Sooner the better, okay?

556
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,016
But I want to get to the top as a host!

557
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,819
Being a host is all I have.

558
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,556
I can change and be more disciplined.

559
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,125
Get better at conversing.

560
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:06,530
And I'll also work on my appearance
so I can bring in some huge spenders!

561
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,393
- Ms. Akina! We're not open yet!
- Tsubasa.

562
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:37,928
What?

563
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,965
There you are.

564
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,299
How can I help you, Miss?

565
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,768
Kaoru is off work today.

566
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,705
I'm still Tsubasa's biggest customer.

567
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,341
Move!

568
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,577
I need to talk to you.

569
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,617
I don't want to talk to you.

570
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,038
- Whoa!
- Hey! Ms. Akina!

571
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,406
Ms. Akina.

572
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,109
She's gone mad…

573
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,344
He's in danger.

574
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,217
Sorry to call you.

575
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,457
Why did you cut me off?

576
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:46,130
Do you know how much I've spent
to make you number one?

577
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,401
Ms. Akina!

578
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,138
Let's put that away.

579
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:58,609
You seem quite drunk.

580
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,446
You're too beautiful to act this way.

581
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,417
Please?

582
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,470
Calm down!

583
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,379
Let go of me! Stop it!

584
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,680
Let go!

585
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,724
- What should we do?
- Oh, no.

586
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,597
Thanks.

587
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,500
Kaoru!

588
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,833
Can I come and have a look
at the one in Nakano?

589
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:31,535
Yes!

590
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,003
Yes, please!

591
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,406
My name is Manami Ogawa.

592
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,076
Yes, I'll head there right now!

593
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:49,286
KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT

594
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,558
<i>I decided to move out.</i>

595
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,929
<i>I knew my sudden independence</i>
<i>wouldn't be easy for them.</i>

596
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,898
<i>But the memory</i>

597
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:40,104
<i>of being in love with someone</i>
<i>felt enough to be able to live on my own.</i>

598
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,173
<i>So, we drove her into madness?</i>

599
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,142
<i>We can't justify staying open.</i>

600
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,110
<i>Ms. Chihuahua!</i>

601
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,345
You can't do anything without my help!

602
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,948
That's why I told you I'm moving out!

603
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:55,953
THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS
