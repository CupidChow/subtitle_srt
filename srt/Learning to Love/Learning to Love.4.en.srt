1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,106
Thank you so much!

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:10,010
Stupid ones need
to show sincerity if they want to win.

3
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,712
Kaoru is not stupid.

4
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,457
Miss.

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,695
What are you doing?

6
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,430
You can't hug me like this!

7
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,743
I'm thankful even if you lied.

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,581
I've been told I'm stupid
about a million times in my life.

9
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,383
You're not stupid!

10
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,553
You can have a fun
conversation with anyone.

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,658
You're very fashionable
and you're always trying your best.

12
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,227
If you were really stupid,
you couldn't do these things.

13
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,865
Thank you, Miss.

14
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,369
You're welcome.

15
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,674
Well then, let's go.

16
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,708
What?

17
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,746
I don't mind.

18
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,816
Go where?

19
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,685
You know…

20
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,487
A hotel.

21
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,960
We can spend some quality time together.

22
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,731
What?

23
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,404
Right.

24
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:50,543
I know it's hard to believe,
but I don't sleep with my customers.

25
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,545
But I'll bend the rules.

26
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,481
I don't know what you're talking about!

27
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,382
I don't know how else to say it.

28
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,817
What?

29
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,352
Do you think I'm a slut?

30
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:03,623
Let me take this opportunity to say,
I have no such desire!

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,592
There's no need to act tough.

32
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,162
Act tough?
You really are full of yourself!

33
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,597
I'm not like those women!

34
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,136
-Then what kind of woman are you?
-God knows!

35
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,477
Ms. Chihuahua!

36
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,317
Am I expelled?

37
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,391
I'll do my assignment next time!

38
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,264
Do you mean it?

39
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,467
Please!

40
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,944
Okay, fine.

41
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,783
See you.

42
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,591
It's a normal thing for him to be
intimate with women almost daily.

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,329
Maybe I look no different
to the women who want him.

44
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:32,745
All right.

45
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,351
I'm home!

46
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,786
You're back late.

47
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,021
I was with my university friend.

48
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,557
It's been a while since
I last drank and did karaoke.

49
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,959
Sounds fun.

50
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,994
Was it Momoko?

51
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,029
How did you know?

52
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,399
She's the only person
you would have a drink with.

53
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,567
You're right!

54
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,536
But be careful.

55
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,540
People who work in TV
often have the wrong idea of freedom.

56
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,076
You're engaged now.

57
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,812
Best not to see her too often.

58
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,614
Okay.

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,382
-You're home!
-You made me jump.

60
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,483
Yeah, I'm home.

61
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,187
-Are you okay?
-What?

62
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,256
You seem strangely upbeat.

63
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,458
I was wondering if something happened.

64
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,095
Nothing. I'm okay.

65
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,269
My mom looks absent-minded,
but she notices things.

66
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,005
I probably did seem weirdly excited.

67
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,514
YOJI KAWAHARA
CAN YOU CALL ME ONCE YOU'RE HOME?

68
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,289
Are you home from Momoko's? How was it?

69
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,857
What? How…

70
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,526
Did I tell you I was going to Momoko's?

71
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,497
You said you often go for a drink at hers.
Did you have fun?

72
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:58,564
Yes.

73
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,634
We ordered too much food, so I'm stuffed.

74
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,469
That's nice.

75
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:07,273
Oh, let's invite our friends
to ours once we're married.

76
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,443
Sure.

77
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,513
When shall we look at venues?

78
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,415
I think…

79
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:21,187
I'm busy preparing for school orientation,
so can it wait a little?

80
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,356
Okay. No problem.

81
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,493
Rest well. You must be tired
after all the fun you had.

82
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,363
Thank you. Good night.

83
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,831
Good night.

84
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,011
Kaoru, what were you thinking?

85
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,648
You should be ashamed,
leaving Ms. Akina here like that!

86
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,350
I apologize.

87
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,586
-You need to be more responsible…
-Enough. Sho, gather everyone.

88
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,620
Yes.

89
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,790
End-of-the-day meeting time!
Gather around!

90
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,125
-Yes!
-Yes!

91
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,395
Hurry up!

92
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,931
Kaoru.

93
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,836
Before you act, think hard
about what's most important for a host.

94
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:11,738
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,539
Goes for all of you. Okay?

96
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,907
-Yes!
-Yes!

97
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,510
This weekend's the last leg of the race.

98
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,014
As it's our anniversary month, first place
will receive three million yen.

99
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,216
Wow!

100
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,418
-Focus on results!
-Yeah!

101
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,653
-Take it from here.
-Okay.

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,688
Thank you.

103
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,289
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

104
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,958
-The meeting's over!
-Okay!

105
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,926
-It better be busy tomorrow!
-Yes!

106
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,228
-And clean properly!
-Hey!

107
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,264
It's finally happening!
You need to get serious now!

108
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,567
-I've always been serious!
-Oh, sorry!

109
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,069
I believe in you!

110
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,170
What's with you?

111
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,372
-Hey.
-What?

112
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,542
-It's nice to be on a roll, isn't it?
-What?

113
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,579
It's all thanks to Tsubasa
for introducing me to Ms. Akina.

114
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,581
-Thank you!
-There's no way I'll lose.

115
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:56,616
I think so too!

116
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,519
That's amazing, Kaoru!

117
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,956
Can you believe it?
He's actually aiming for number one.

118
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,492
-What?
-It's fine!

119
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,694
All hosts should aim for number one!

120
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:13,466
Only the chosen ones
are allowed to aim for the top.

121
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,437
You think you're one
of the chosen ones, huh?

122
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,307
That confidence is admirable.

123
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,909
I'm rooting for you.

124
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,545
Thanks.

125
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:31,250
Bet you'd all be more motivated
if someone else was at the top.

126
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:32,852
-Right?
-Yeah!

127
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,288
He'll make it!

128
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,490
So please, have high hopes for me.

129
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,994
We will! We sure will!

130
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,308
I've received all
your career path surveys!

131
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,778
Thank you for taking this seriously!

132
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,651
This summer vacation will be different
from previous years…

133
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,121
Here you go.

134
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,558
Not just because you have to study.

135
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,327
But because you'll wonder

136
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,563
if you're making
the right choices in life.

137
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,299
If there's anything
you'd like my advice on,

138
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,235
whatever it is, please ask me!

139
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,369
Miss!

140
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,739
Oh wow, this is unprecedented.

141
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,741
No one asked any questions before!

142
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,211
-Please.
-Who are you getting married to?

143
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,715
-What?
-Marry?

144
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,983
You're getting married?

145
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,285
-What does he do?
-Where did he study?

146
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,054
Quiet! Now's not the time
to talk about such things!

147
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,856
You don't have to hide it.

148
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,759
She's right!

149
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,794
That's enough!

150
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,164
Let's decide what activity to do
after the end-of-term ceremony!

151
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,134
-Mr. Sakura. If you please?
-Sure.

152
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,574
The students who used to ignore me
are showing interest in me.

153
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:08,180
It's a bit pathetic that my engagement
was the reason, but I still felt happy.

154
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,118
Five, six, seven, eight!

155
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,521
-Spread out so we can play catch!
-Yes!

156
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,125
Here we go! Start!

157
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,533
Ms. Ogawa.

158
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,771
They are starting to open up to you.

159
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,310
I do feel closer to them
but I can't get too comfortable!

160
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,246
You're overcautious.

161
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,883
Believe in yourself more.

162
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,753
Even Ms. Sawaguchi
seems calmer these days.

163
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,524
Deciding to study overseas
helped her get over it.

164
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,694
She said she didn't care
about the host anymore.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,864
Despite making a huge fuss,
she got over him quickly.

166
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,803
Women are scary, regardless of their age.
Even high schoolers.

167
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,107
By the way,
would you be interested in reading this?

168
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,609
A HISTORY OF LD ASSESSMENT AND EDUCATION

169
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,847
What do you think?

170
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,048
Looks good.

171
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,085
Compliment me more!
Like you do with your princesses!

172
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,021
-Come on!
-Like I tell my princesses?

173
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,556
Um…

174
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,926
You're too cute!

175
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,027
There you go.

176
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,630
Yes! I'm full of energy now!
I have a date with Azami.

177
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,999
What? Is she your girlfriend?

178
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,203
-Be careful not to get caught.
-You should start dating too.

179
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,040
The longer you're a host,
the more you struggle to find love.

180
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,542
I told you I never would.

181
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,079
It's better for work that way.

182
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,214
Sure.

183
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,749
All right!

184
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,451
-See you later!
-Okay.

185
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,587
-Have fun!
-Thanks!

186
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:05,031
HAG

187
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,836
He didn't pick up.

188
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,106
Why are you relieved?

189
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,509
I'll call again later, okay?

190
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,713
I'm done for!

191
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,316
If I can't pay the tenant fee this month,
I have to close down!

192
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,352
Why don't you close it?

193
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,654
You're good enough
to get a job somewhere else.

194
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,090
What do you know?

195
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,359
How can I go back
to working under someone again?

196
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,194
I'll look so lame!

197
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,963
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

198
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,167
What are you doing?

199
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:46,038
-Thank you for coming all the way.
-No problem.

200
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,541
I always wanted to visit a TV station.

201
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,776
I'm surprised to know you're a student.

202
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,146
I became a host
to pay back my student loan.

203
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,716
I'm actually quite a grafter.

204
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,517
You shouldn't say so yourself.

205
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,755
I feel like I can tell you anything.

206
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,789
Thank you.

207
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,892
So, I want to ask you about this incident.

208
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,462
Anything you can tell me about it?

209
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,465
The murdered host
was ranked first, like you are.

210
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,136
As we were the number ones
at our clubs, we had met.

211
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,606
He cut off customers in a cruel way
when they struggled to pay.

212
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,042
And you don't?

213
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,912
There is no common sense in this industry.

214
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:32,418
JOKER runs a decent business, but I bet
stuff happens behind closed doors.

215
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,686
What do you mean?

216
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,321
I can't tell you…

217
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,459
unless we go on a date.

218
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,996
Don't disrespect me.

219
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,734
Hello?

220
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,938
-Sorry, I had to cut it short.
-No worries.

221
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,176
-Well then, thanks again.
-See you.

222
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,317
Sorry for the wait.

223
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,019
I'm sorry for the sudden visit.

224
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,723
No, it's fine, but how can I help you?
I am busy with work.

225
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,460
Oh, sorry. Well, it's about Manami.
There's something I want to ask you.

226
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,195
-Okay.
-Shall we?

227
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,767
Well…

228
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,672
I was walking through Shinjuku
and coincidentally…

229
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,209
saw her walk into a host club.

230
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,144
Is that so?

231
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,815
Is she into host clubs?

232
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,716
As her fiancé, I'm a little worried.

233
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,886
I don't blame you.

234
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,021
Yeah.

235
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,624
Do you remember the name of the club?

236
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,092
THE JOKER.

237
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,162
Okay, I see.

238
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,201
In that case,
you have nothing to worry about.

239
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,505
She said one of her students
had some issues there

240
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,373
which is why she was there, I think.

241
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,443
Her student? I see.

242
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,113
I didn't think about that possibility.
I feel stupid for worrying!

243
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,381
Thank you so much.

244
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,652
Why didn't you ask her directly?

245
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,587
Well…

246
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,557
I didn't want her to think
I was passing judgment on her for it…

247
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,660
Anyway, thank you. Goodbye.

248
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,696
What a lie!

249
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,730
What?

250
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,466
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?

251
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,669
You followed her.
It's why you can't ask her.

252
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:31,570
Am I wrong?

253
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,575
I guess you can easily see
through my lies.

254
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,477
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,181
-Please don't tell her I came to see you.
-No.

256
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,217
Please, I don't want any trouble with her.

257
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,889
-This is for you. Please!
-No, thank you.

258
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:54,493
Writing takes time for them due
to forgetting what they wanted to write.

259
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,862
Turn to the next page.

260
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,034
That's the writing of a child
with developmental dyslexia.

261
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,639
The symptoms manifest
differently for each person.

262
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,710
Without any issues
in intellectual development speed,

263
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,346
they would still struggle with literacy

264
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,583
which leads to poor academic performance.

265
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,187
In Japan, at least two to three
out of 40 students in a classroom

266
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,189
have this, so it's not rare.

267
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,560
Yet still they've been told
they need to try harder,

268
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:33,165
and to stop being lazy, which can
lead to difficulties adapting at school.

269
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:35,768
Ms. Ogawa.

270
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,671
Is it difficult to teach an adult male

271
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,440
who rarely went to school
how to read and write?

272
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,042
Good question.

273
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,378
If it's with a specialist,
there's a 95 percent chance

274
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,915
of perfecting the hiragana
and katakana alphabets.

275
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,284
What about kanji?

276
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,520
They can learn gradually.

277
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,558
Some find it easier to recognize
the letters if you colorize the parts.

278
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,562
For example, the kanji in "assignment."

279
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,733
Under a "roof," you were doing…

280
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,702
your assignment…

281
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,674
and a "hundred dogs" came to the house!

282
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,113
Verbalizing the parts of the kanji
like this can be effective.

283
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,050
However, please be aware
that it will take time.

284
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,457
So, it was an adult male, huh?

285
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,630
-Yes.
-Is that who you're marrying?

286
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,734
-My guess is it's not.
-What?

287
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,771
Do I have to answer that?

288
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,573
No, you don't.

289
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,710
I just got curious about you, that's all.

290
00:16:56,548 --> 00:17:02,688
"Ride the Keikyu line
and experience summer…

291
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,592
at Miura Beach!"

292
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,497
How do you read this?

293
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:16,802
Impossible.

294
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,937
TRAIN TRAVELS

295
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,717
Which one?

296
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,318
Oh, this one.

297
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,199
You went to the club to see Kaoru, huh?

298
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,739
Why do you know?

299
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,575
Really? Are you hooked on him?

300
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,845
No, that's not it! There is a reason, but…

301
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,447
A reason?

302
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,483
Wasn't the student issue resolved?

303
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,720
You're being a bit nosy even for a friend.

304
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,223
Hey.

305
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:16,028
I've always been there
to listen to your worries and rants!

306
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,867
Hey. Are you okay?

307
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,470
Meeting up with a mere host
when you're engaged…

308
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,472
A "mere host"?

309
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,210
That's very condescending.

310
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,985
I was asked not to tell you this, but…

311
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,923
Kawahara what's-his-name saw you.

312
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:51,497
He followed you and saw you go into JOKER.

313
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:58,937
Then, he came to ask me
if you have a thing for hosts.

314
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,375
Yeah.

315
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:10,382
But the main issue is not the fact
that he was following you,

316
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,286
but the reason why he was following you.

317
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:22,261
I think you must've done
something to make him worry.

318
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:29,401
You said you have a reason,
but he is a mere host.

319
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,871
And I mean it when I say "mere."

320
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,408
You shouldn't see him anymore.

321
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,146
There was that murder incident and…

322
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,250
I'm sure JOKER has its dark secrets
despite how it looks.

323
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:51,423
You know, I just don't want
to see you cry anymore.

324
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,091
You're not my mother.

325
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,395
You've always been this way.

326
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,598
Whenever I start something new,
you pull me away from it like,

327
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,133
"Not that way! This way!"

328
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,001
But do you do it

329
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:07,272
so that you can belittle me
and feel good about yourself?

330
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,708
Wow, that's hurtful.

331
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,277
I don't tell you everything, you know?

332
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,446
I can live without you!

333
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,716
Is that so?

334
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,620
I'm so sorry.

335
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,827
I can take care of myself!

336
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,099
All right!

337
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,236
Kaoru! The two first-timers
at table E nominated you.

338
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,739
Wow, nice! How am I doing?

339
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,909
At least 1.2 million in sales
over the last two days for sure.

340
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,078
Wow, that's crazy! Yeah!

341
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,513
How about him?

342
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,716
You know I can't tell you that.

343
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,184
-Sorry!
-Apologies!

344
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,252
Let's go!

345
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,622
Judging from his look, you're on top!
You got this!

346
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,156
It is close, so stay on your toes!

347
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:00,659
-Hello!
-Oh?

348
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,028
I was born from bamboo.
No, my name is not Kaguya--

349
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,863
How cute are you two!

350
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,232
-I'm Kaoru.
-Nice to meet you!

351
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,434
-So, do you like me?
-I do!

352
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,970
-What shall we drink then?
-I'll get us champagne!

353
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,938
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

354
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,910
Here it is! Yes!

355
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,347
Can't remember the last time
I had one of these.

356
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,283
Here it goes.

357
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,819
I heard you followed me.

358
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,759
-D-Did Momoko?
-Yes.

359
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,895
It wasn't really…

360
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:42,000
I was in the area,
and I saw you by chance,

361
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,003
so I went after you to say hi.

362
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,573
You were in
the red-light district by chance?

363
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,474
No…

364
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,144
Oh, I get it.
Does your favorite hostess work there?

365
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,314
Why so brazen when you're the one
who went to a host club?

366
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,716
Wait, no…

367
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,488
You are my fiancé, so of course,

368
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:06,725
I'd be worried if I saw you
go into such a sketchy place.

369
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,134
-What?
-I need some time to think.

370
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,102
What?

371
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,037
What are you…

372
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,440
What do you mean?

373
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,309
I feel hurt that you don't trust me.

374
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,511
Can I trust you?

375
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,648
Or do you like that host, Kaoru?

376
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,086
I heard the host ask you
if you were there to see Kaoru.

377
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,789
It's not at all what you think.

378
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,791
Yeah, but…

379
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,096
Hey, Manami. Wait.

380
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,764
Hey…

381
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:52,104
CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA

382
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,944
TAKA

383
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,258
Is there a better way to explain it
than a horizontal line?

384
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,165
Purple…

385
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,301
KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT

386
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,444
Look here.

387
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,581
The curved line in "Taka" is colored pink.

388
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,818
"Curved line" might confuse him more.

389
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,643
-Ouch!
-Are you okay?

390
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:08,113
The person you called
can't come to the phone right now.

391
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,514
Please leave a message…

392
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:23,395
It's me Ogawa.
Are you not coming to class today?

393
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,098
Skipping will not be tolerated.
Please contact me.

394
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,868
No more messages.

395
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,172
Do you need to call back?

396
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,340
No, it's okay.

397
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,076
She's one of my troublesome customers.

398
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,253
TAKA

399
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,273
MOMOKO MACHIDA

400
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:12,844
Hello?

401
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,581
I wasn't going to call you ever again.

402
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,818
I wasn't going to answer
your calls ever again.

403
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:24,322
Because of work
I did some research on JOKER and…

404
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:30,595
turns out the CEO
has somewhat of a problematic past.

405
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,198
What do you mean?

406
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,233
Please come again.

407
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,568
He went to prison.

408
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,906
I don't want to sound prejudiced, but…

409
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,543
he may have connections
with the underworld.

410
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,046
See? It is a world full of danger.

411
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:52,684
Customers and even the workers there
can become a victim anytime.

412
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:57,489
I won't say anymore, but be careful.

413
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,760
Momoko.

414
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,396
What? Am I being overprotective?

415
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,131
No.

416
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,733
Thank you.

417
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,171
Don't thank me.

418
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,874
We'll end up reconciling again.

419
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,878
I was so ready to cut ties with you.

420
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,847
I guess we'll have to wait
until our next fight.

421
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,882
Bye!

422
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,203
The person you called
can't come to the phone right now.

423
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,285
-Cheers!
-Watch your step.

424
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,720
Welcome!

425
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,555
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

426
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,923
What's this?

427
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,592
-Really? Thank you so much!
-Thank you!

428
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:08,760
I'm so happy!

429
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,730
-Here. Please enjoy.
-Have a seat!

430
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:14,833
Here.

431
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,401
-Excuse me.
-Yes!

432
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,169
Takechiyo, Table C wants you.

433
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,305
Me? Oh my god!

434
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,675
-She wants a weak oolong tea.
-Sure!

435
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:26,544
Miss, sorry to leave you! Enjoy!

436
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,717
I'll sit with you until Kaoru comes.

437
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,487
Good evening, Miss.

438
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,295
He was ignoring your calls, huh?

439
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,098
You came to check if he's okay?

440
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,503
It's his usual tactic.

441
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,339
He stands people up

442
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,142
and won't call them back,
so they'll come see him.

443
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:00,879
Kaoru…

444
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,549
He said he'll make you his
from the beginning.

445
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,017
Make me his?

446
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,753
A big spender.

447
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:14,192
Basically, to take advantage of you.

448
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,997
Your dad's a company board member, right?

449
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,267
Please spend your money on him.

450
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,841
You came here to rat on him?

451
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,109
What?

452
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,212
Revealing his tricks
to his customer is pretty nasty.

453
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,315
Is it because you fear him
as a competitor?

454
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,019
I knew what his plan was
from the beginning!

455
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,522
I only played along
to see what kind of method he uses!

456
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,928
You're an interesting woman.

457
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,697
I never have princesses like you.

458
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,266
I don't find this interesting at all!

459
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,401
You're upset?

460
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,137
Because Kaoru tricked you?

461
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,540
-Stop it…
-Yes?

462
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,908
Stop right there.

463
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,311
You can't lose control…

464
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,451
Tell Kaoru that I will order
whatever he likes.

465
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,455
Certainly.

466
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,791
Was that a good idea?

467
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,528
-Excuse me. Kaoru!
-Get closer… What?

468
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:29,400
The lady sitting at Table D2
said she'll order anything you want.

469
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:34,172
500,000 yen more
and you could be number one.

470
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,174
Thanks.

471
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:37,976
Excuse me.

472
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,815
Heave ho! Yeah!

473
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,650
Yeah!

474
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:51,289
Well then! This champagne
is from this beautiful princess!

475
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,958
-Thank you! You guys look great!
-Yeah!

476
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:57,462
-You guys are great!
-Great!

477
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,099
From all the employees here… Ready?

478
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,535
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

479
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,537
Thank you! Thanks!

480
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,874
Hey, Ms. Chihuahua! Cheers!

481
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,015
Wow! Thank you so much!

482
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:22,153
Are you sure it was okay
to order anything I wanted?

483
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:26,357
I wanted to see what it's like
to let loose once.

484
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,359
I knew you had it in you, Ms. Chihuahua!

485
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,928
I got so excited!

486
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,297
So you ditched my class today, huh?

487
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:33,865
What?

488
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,634
Sorry, I totally forgot about it!

489
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,169
Was it today?

490
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,572
I thought you were
a better liar than that.

491
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,244
Standing me up on purpose
and not returning my calls…

492
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,913
I heard that's how you control women.

493
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,317
Bit vulgar, don't you think?

494
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,254
To be number one, I'll do anything.

495
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,091
Everyone!

496
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,194
It is time to announce
our top three hosts of this month,

497
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,597
THE JOKER's tenth anniversary month!

498
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,298
-Here we go!
-Yeah!

499
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:10,335
Third goes to…

500
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,236
All right!

501
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,340
…with over 12 million yen in sales!

502
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,574
-Wow!
-Who?

503
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,810
It's Manager Hiroto Sumeragi!

504
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,546
Really?

505
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,082
Oh, my god!

506
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,084
I didn't think I'd go down in rank.

507
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,986
-If he's third…
-I'm disappointed.

508
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,890
-You could be first!
-I will take my spot back next month!

509
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:35,360
My princesses,
please carry on supporting me! Thanks!

510
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,995
-Well done!
-Nice one!

511
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,934
Now, our number two…

512
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,002
-Oh?
-Please…

513
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,872
With over 15.5 million yen in sales…

514
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,676
Well done to our
Executive Assistant, Kaoru!

515
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,044
Oh, no.

516
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,746
Yeah!

517
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,759
Thank you!

518
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,895
Yes! Well done!

519
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:16,567
And finally, the one
who will be crowned number one!

520
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:20,772
With over 16 million yen in sales!

521
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,240
Wow!

522
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,243
Tsubasa Super Player!

523
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,513
A six-month winning streak!

524
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,915
-Congratulations!
-Player!

525
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,352
-Truly well done. Congratulations.
-Thank you.

526
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:42,493
I'd like to thank
my princesses who support me,

527
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,830
and the players I get to compete with.

528
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:46,764
Yeah!

529
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,866
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

530
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:55,740
Once again, our number one
for JOKER's tenth anniversary month

531
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,742
is Tsubasa Super Player!

532
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,444
-Wow!
-Congratulations!

533
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,382
I don't know what to say.

534
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,219
-What a shame.
-No, it's fine!

535
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:12,690
Sorry to let you down
after all your support.

536
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,660
I should get going.

537
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,597
-Hori.
-Yes, sir.

538
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,242
Here's your bill.

539
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,150
It's 50,000 yen…

540
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,822
Here you go.

541
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,658
-Is it under your credit limit?
-What?

542
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,931
TOTAL AMOUNT: 515,900 YEN

543
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,133
Thank you.

544
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,439
What's wrong, Miss?
You said I could order whatever I wanted.

545
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:05,943
You…

546
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,914
really are a host to your core.

547
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,450
Thank you.

548
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,918
To the core?

549
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,655
MANAMI OGAWA

550
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,526
Thank you very much.

551
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:36,274
Here.

552
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,644
I was going to use this in class today.

553
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,352
ASSIGNMENT

554
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:57,795
Three! Four! Five!

555
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:58,996
Got it!

556
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,731
Oh, no!

557
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,202
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.

558
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:08,573
I'm very glad we were able to have fun
together before we ended this term.

559
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,175
Please be mindful of your actions

560
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:15,246
especially with social media
or when downtown.

561
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:22,220
Make good choices to avoid the possibility
of being in dangerous situations, okay?

562
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,489
Yes!

563
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,524
Do I have the right to say this?

564
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,029
Okay! Last homeroom
of this term dismissed!

565
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:32,930
Stand up!

566
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,437
Bow… Goodbye.

567
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,506
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

568
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,207
Goodbye.

569
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,548
Woah!

570
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,717
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,053
Ms. Ogawa.

572
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,357
About what I said the other day…

573
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:04,162
I just got curious about you, that's all.

574
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,497
Oh, don't worry about it!

575
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,167
I think you misunderstood!

576
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,134
I…

577
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,137
I just want to be good friends with you.

578
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,209
I don't feel the need to hide that…

579
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,045
I'm not interested in women.

580
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,351
Oh, I see.

581
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,786
Are you weirded out?

582
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,455
In the past, I would have been.

583
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:36,827
But now, I understand
that love exists in many forms.

584
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,298
You're so honest.

585
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,602
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

586
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:49,907
It's getting hotter and hotter.
It's exhausting!

587
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,009
HIHI TTEOKBOKKI

588
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:59,083
You're so thoughtful! Thank you.

589
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,188
-Hey, sorry for the sudden visit.
-It's fine.

590
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,158
I thought I'd inspect the dorms
since I haven't done it in a while.

591
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,393
I see. Takechiyo's not here.

592
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,495
My god, this room's hot!

593
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,563
Yeah.

594
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,999
Thanks.

595
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,535
Kaoru.

596
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,438
You made it to the top three.

597
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,274
You should get your own room.

598
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:27,878
Well, I want to be number one first.

599
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:32,383
In that case, don't do a sloppy job.

600
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,386
Sloppy?

601
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:39,957
That teacher, you finally got her
to come to the club.

602
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:43,628
Making her pay 500,000 yen
in one go will scare her away.

603
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,863
I'm sorry.

604
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:50,034
Have you thought about what
the most important thing for a host is?

605
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,869
I think…

606
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,439
To give customers a good time.

607
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,042
Don't let them regret their expenses.

608
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,580
You are not ready
to be our number one yet.

609
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,615
Sorry for the intrusion!

610
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:09,220
HAG

611
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:25,169
ASSIGNMENT

612
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,041
TAIGA TAKAMORI
TAKA / GA

613
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,415
LET'S START WITH YOUR NAME!

614
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,129
Huh? What? Woah!

615
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,743
That's amazing.
I could never do what you do!

616
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,511
I should hope so!

617
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,979
It's not easy!

618
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,481
I admire it so much!

619
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,615
I'm home.

620
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:15,152
Welcome back!
Mr. Kawahara's been waiting for you.

621
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:18,923
I was around for work,
so I came to drop off a souvenir.

622
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,424
Have some with us!

623
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,594
I'm okay.

624
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,996
I see.

625
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,601
Look at the time!
I need to go back to work!

626
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,938
I'm glad I got to see you.

627
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,708
Yoji, I thought you wanted
to talk to Manami?

628
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,544
Oh, it's fine! It's nothing important!

629
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,913
She's your wife-to-be.
No need to hold back.

630
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,983
No, it's okay. I'll come see her again
when I have more time.

631
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:49,687
I'm not calling off our marriage.

632
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,190
-That's…
-I'm sure about us.

633
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,362
I hope you feel the same.

634
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,683
Let's go check out venues soon, okay?

635
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:29,627
It's me.

636
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,328
What's up?

637
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,332
My husband will be back in Tokyo today,
so I can't see you.

638
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,034
Let's break up.

639
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:39,303
Break up?

640
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,441
I didn't think we were together.

641
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:45,876
I don't have time for games.

642
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,512
Thanks for everything.

643
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,818
Are you guys fighting?

644
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,022
They just got engaged!
They couldn't possibly--

645
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,356
I didn't ask you!

646
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,259
We're not fighting.

647
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,762
Okay, I'm glad.

648
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,964
But I have doubts about the marriage.

649
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:09,300
I've already told him.

650
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,237
It's not uncommon before marriage.

651
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,874
It's such a blessing
to feel such a dilemma.

652
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,846
You are so lucky.

653
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,990
I can never argue with my dad.

654
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,593
I always listen to what he says.

655
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,129
When do I get to stop putting on an act?

656
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,178
Welcome!

657
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,647
-Taiga!
-Big brother!

658
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:59,817
-Yuki! You been good?
-Thank you for coming.

659
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:05,222
Do you think he knows
how I lied to him to borrow money?

660
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:06,924
Leave it to me.

661
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,262
Yuki, I'm working, so you need to leave.

662
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,163
-But…
-Come on.

663
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,465
Let's have tea.

664
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,534
-Okay.
-Go on.

665
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:28,178
Oh, you're going to let me cut your hair?
I'll do any hairstyle!

666
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:33,183
I had a shop on Omote-sando
when I met your mother, you know.

667
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,553
So I had customers from Kabukicho too.

668
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,955
But you're struggling now, huh?

669
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,459
Can you stop making her ask me for money?

670
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,731
She's such a bad liar, it's pitiable.

671
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,269
You are so cool! Number one, true to form.

672
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,305
I dare you to say that again.

673
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,740
Apologies.

674
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,248
One last time.
Can you please lend me just three million?

675
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:05,749
I promise I won't ask again!

676
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,486
What a casual promise.

677
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,990
I hear there are many women
who'd pay huge sums of money for you.

678
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,493
I would've become
a host too if I were younger.

679
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,997
You couldn't be one.

680
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:24,101
They're dumb women
who feel happiness from paying for things.

681
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,502
Bet you can make it work.

682
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,189
I'm sorry.

683
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,275
TAIGA TAKAMORI

684
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,022
-Ms. Chihuahua!
-That's dangerous!

685
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:22,893
You actually came?

686
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,729
After I made you pay that much?

687
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,134
I wasn't forced.
I told you to order anything.

688
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,104
Okay, let's begin!
Did you practice as I asked?

689
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,247
Here's your 520,000 yen.
I'm giving it back to you.

690
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,716
Let's end this.

691
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,591
I want to end this.

692
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:01,632
Spending time with you
is starting to feel exhausting.

693
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,039
I don't deserve your kindness.

694
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,949
I can't do this anymore.

695
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,019
Bye.

696
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:37,601
Wait!

697
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,537
Why are you here?

698
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,539
I don't want to be your student anymore.

699
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,076
I think I'm starting to…

700
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,946
FINALLY, THE BEGINNING OF A FORBIDDEN LOVE

701
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:53,951
THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS
