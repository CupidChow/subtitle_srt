1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,441
Is it difficult to teach an adult male
who rarely went to school?

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,444
If it's with a specialist…
They can gradually learn.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,381
Thanks. You said I could order
whatever I wanted.

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,017
What is the most
important thing for a host?

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,386
Don't let them regret their expenses.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,523
Spending time with you
is starting to feel exhausting.

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,359
I can't do this anymore.

8
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,462
Bye.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,968
Wait!

10
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:44,811
I haven't been able
to teach you anything yet.

11
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,215
But why? It doesn't make any sense!

12
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:54,120
You don't gain anything
from teaching me how to write.

13
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,058
I'm just happy to help
expand your possibilities.

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,726
Don't lie.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,694
Lie?

16
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,866
You're in love with me…

17
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:12,205
I can tell!

18
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,575
Since I feel the same way.

19
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,347
What are you saying?

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,885
It doesn't make sense.

21
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,889
I was adamant not to fall for anyone.

22
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,464
I'm just an oddity.

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,998
You'll get bored with me soon.

24
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:45,939
But we can continue our relationship
as student and teacher.

25
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,714
I thought you were starting
to enjoy writing

26
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,184
but was it just my ego?

27
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,490
No.

28
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,764
I used to absolutely hate writing
but now I just hate it.

29
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,133
I guess.

30
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,945
Miss!

31
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:32,051
Then let's change that hate
to "I don't like it much!"

32
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,689
But never bring up
what you said earlier again.

33
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,294
Earlier? What did I say?

34
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,428
You know…

35
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,496
Huh? What?

36
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,332
You know what I'm talking about!
I prohibit it!

37
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,837
Like a school rule?

38
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,140
Can you keep it?

39
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,311
If you can't…

40
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,347
I will have to expel you.

41
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,052
Fine.

42
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,526
Okay!

43
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,230
First things first,
let's check your assignment.

44
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:19,799
Give me one second.

45
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,001
-I'll get it.
-Okay.

46
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,875
I tried acting like I was a mature woman.

47
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:34,080
But I was just doing my best
to evade having a heart-to-heart with him.

48
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,950
How sly of me.

49
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,595
-Hey, you haven't done any of it!
-What?

50
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,698
Really? I thought I did.

51
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,168
-I didn't?
-Okay. We'll do it together today.

52
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,570
Okay.

53
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:58,972
The first one is…

54
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,707
-The vertical line. So…
-Yes.

55
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,475
-Straight.
-Good.

56
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,977
And then the second line.

57
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,946
-Horizontal line. Straight…
-The horizontal line…

58
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,881
-Straight…
-Stop!

59
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,083
Are you messing around?

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,584
Sorry.

61
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,721
-And then a vertical one.
-Yes.

62
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,256
Like this, right?

63
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,425
-That's right. It's slightly diagonal.
-Slightly diagonal?

64
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,194
-There!
-Good! It looks beautiful!

65
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,963
-This is the last part.
-Okay. One, two, three, four.

66
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,100
Well done!

67
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,168
-That's the best one yet!
-Huh?

68
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,237
You may be right.

69
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,773
Do I write it again?

70
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,408
Yes. Repetition is the key.

71
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,709
-Repetition?
-Yes.

72
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,480
-So, go straight like this?
-Okay.

73
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,749
-And then this and this?
-Yes!

74
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,586
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

75
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,589
You going to work during summer break?

76
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,025
Tough being a teacher nowadays.

77
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,395
Junior students have remedial classes
and career guidance.

78
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,598
Remember to prioritize Yoji
over work, okay?

79
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:02,902
Oh, dear.

80
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,107
Dear, you forgot your diary.

81
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,476
I hope you know

82
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,713
if the engagement gets called off again,
it'll be your fault.

83
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,729
Hey. Are you having doubts?

84
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,369
I think it's normal to have doubts
before getting married.

85
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,175
Why did you marry Dad?

86
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,479
Why?

87
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,449
He's not fun to be around, right?

88
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,920
Yeah, well…

89
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,657
I thought he would take good care of me.

90
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,527
I guess he let you down completely.

91
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:09,769
Manami, is there someone else?

92
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,037
What?

93
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:18,111
I thought maybe you still had feelings
for your previous fiancé.

94
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,212
Not at all.

95
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,682
I had someone.

96
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,285
Someone I still can't forget.

97
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,490
Can I ask about him?

98
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,493
It's Richard Gere.

99
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,996
What? That's not funny at all!

100
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:44,237
Anyway, I think everyone
has experienced unrequited love.

101
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,806
But marriage is marriage.

102
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,576
If you think you can cherish
Yoji as a partner,

103
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,645
I think that's enough to get married.

104
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,280
You're right.

105
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,385
I have to go.

106
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,625
"To"…

107
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,530
"Today," done!

108
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,366
What are you doing?

109
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,700
Is it work stuff?

110
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,569
I'm studying.

111
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,805
What? Again?

112
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,245
I hope asking this won't upset you, but…

113
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,081
Do you not have good literacy skills?

114
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,917
Yeah…

115
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,853
Not good is an understatement.

116
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,756
I can't write properly at all.

117
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,094
Oh! Is that why you don't post
anything on social media?

118
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,430
That makes so much sense!

119
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,632
I didn't really go to school.

120
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,669
I don't see a problem with that.

121
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,637
Girls still dig you!

122
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,307
Which one?

123
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,011
You are genuinely so nice!

124
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,181
-This one.
-That's my only virtue.

125
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,616
Thanks!

126
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,821
By the way,
I've never asked you this, but…

127
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,324
How did someone like you become a host?

128
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,894
My dad's factory went bankrupt.

129
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,197
He has a lot of debt,
so I wanted to help him out.

130
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,670
I had heard that hosts
can make over 100 million yen.

131
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,908
But I now know
that's only a handful of them.

132
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,377
Tough world, huh?

133
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,749
How long do you plan on staying a host?

134
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,185
For how long?

135
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,155
We can't keep this job
once we're middle-aged.

136
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,626
We still have a lot of time to think.

137
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,662
I believe in you, number one host-to-be!

138
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,864
-I love you!
-Ouch! What are you doing?

139
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,899
Let's work hard!

140
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,541
I'M AIMING TO BE NUMBER ONE

141
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,145
IT'S SUNNY TODAY

142
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,881
What do you want today?

143
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,683
You told her, didn't you?

144
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,486
Yes, I told her you followed her.

145
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,254
But I asked you not to!

146
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:16,889
I never promised that.

147
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,191
I wanted to be honest with her.

148
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,862
She's having doubts about the marriage.

149
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,196
I'm not surprised.

150
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,366
She can never half-ass things.
That's who she is.

151
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,935
Do you think this is funny?

152
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:33,673
Did you think everything
would be fine if she didn't know?

153
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,476
You followed her out of distrust.
It wouldn't have worked out!

154
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,112
Not out of distrust!
I was trying to trust her!

155
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,847
Sounds like a lame excuse.

156
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,915
How can you say that?

157
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,951
Hey, stop!

158
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,254
My colleagues will think
we're in the middle of a breakup!

159
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,257
Can you help us reconnect?

160
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,794
You're the only one she'll listen to.

161
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,900
If so, can I ask you something?

162
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,537
Do you have nothing to hide?

163
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605
What?

164
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,941
Those who are unfaithful tend
to question their partners' fidelity.

165
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:12,845
Never mind.

166
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,113
Uh, wait.

167
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,781
Will you help me if I tell you?

168
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,116
It depends.

169
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,387
I was with someone else.

170
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,421
-What?
-I mean…

171
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,491
But I parted ways with her
to marry Manami.

172
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,425
Wait…

173
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,761
Um… What?

174
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,430
Parted ways? What exactly do you mean?

175
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,934
-Were you two-timing her?
-I'm sorry. I really am.

176
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,203
Seriously… Wait!

177
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,705
Was this other woman
fine with breaking up?

178
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,973
Well, yes.

179
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,509
There are no issues. Truly.

180
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,480
In that case, you should tell Manami.

181
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,017
Huh? But…

182
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,758
FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES

183
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,461
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE US

184
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,432
-Is it going well?
-What?

185
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,635
What is?

186
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,438
Teaching the man how to write.

187
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,108
Yeah! It's going slowly.

188
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:21,714
Since we're in summer break,
if you want, I can help with the teaching.

189
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,585
Are you sure?
I had been feeling like I was at my limit.

190
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:29,522
I don't know how much help I can be, but…

191
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,490
I really appreciate it!

192
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,858
Can we decide on a date?

193
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:33,893
Of course.

194
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,096
Mr. Sakura, Ms. Hashimoto wants you.

195
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,465
Excuse me.

196
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,677
I want to have another talk with you.

197
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,747
We can't go on like this, right?

198
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,558
Sorry about this.

199
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,926
Not at all.

200
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,863
Um… I wanted to apologize to you properly.

201
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,436
I'm really sorry for following you.

202
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,939
I'm ashamed I didn't trust you.

203
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,408
Oh, it's fine.

204
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,645
The reason I doubted you was…

205
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,780
Excuse me.

206
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:36,655
I had been lying to you.

207
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,125
Lying to me?

208
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:45,464
I told you I had never been
in a relationship before.

209
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,666
But…

210
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,073
there was a woman I kept seeing
even after we got engaged.

211
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,412
She didn't have the slightest intention
of marrying me, and we broke up.

212
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,718
But, I should've told you.

213
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,788
Why tell me now?

214
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:15,628
I thought it was the only way
to show you my sincerity.

215
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,667
I see.

216
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,938
Was I too optimistic?

217
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,411
I should be honest too, right?

218
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:33,979
Huh?

219
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,881
Yeah.

220
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,083
The reason I was at the host club

221
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,553
was to see a host
I met through my student.

222
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,756
Yeah. The guy called Kaoru, right?

223
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,693
He never went to school properly
and has no literacy skills.

224
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,628
Oh. Huh? What?

225
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,399
So I teach him
how to read and write now and then.

226
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,168
Wait, I don't get it.

227
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,837
Why do you have to teach him?

228
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:02,141
He seems to have a learning disability
and struggles with literacy.

229
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,110
If he had received proper education,
he could've had a normal life.

230
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,114
He had a hard time because the adults
around him never helped him.

231
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:14,186
I think I can learn from him
as a teacher if I can help him.

232
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,022
I see.

233
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:23,128
But he is a host, right?

234
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:28,500
Shady host clubs
have even become a social issue recently.

235
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,938
As a teacher, you don't want people
to get the wrong idea.

236
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,574
I have nothing to hide.

237
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,945
I sound like a role model for teachers.

238
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,149
It felt like the only way to stop myself
from doing anything stupid.

239
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,184
Yes?

240
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,620
Just how sly a person am I?

241
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,982
Ms. Chihuahua!

242
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,787
Sorry, I didn't tell you in advance.

243
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,423
Mr. Sakura and I teach the same class.

244
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,961
Hi. Ms. Ogawa told me about you.

245
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,865
I specialized in special education
at graduate school.

246
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,301
So, I might be able to help.

247
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:37,870
Hi.

248
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,942
Please sit.

249
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,246
This is a nice location.

250
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,382
You can be as loud as you want
unlike the library.

251
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,352
I like the spaciousness!

252
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:54,987
It's refreshing.

253
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,825
Refreshing? It's quite humid today.

254
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,262
Let's begin!

255
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,731
According to Mr. Sakura,

256
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,933
"If you can't read it,
you can't write it."

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,235
So he brought a book for you!

258
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,538
-Okay.
-Can I ask you to read this?

259
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,106
A SUNLIT AFTERNOON UNDER THE TREES

260
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,476
Is this a test? There's no point!

261
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,579
I'm so dumb, I've always scored a zero.

262
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,616
From what I heard,
you might have developmental dyslexia and…

263
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,684
What?

264
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,586
Is he dissing me?

265
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,123
No, I'm not saying
that you're inferior to other people.

266
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,125
Hello!

267
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,895
Take a break,
and let's do something summery!

268
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,531
-Wow!
-Nice! I like this idea!

269
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,202
He's Takamori's friend, who's also a host.

270
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,470
I'm Takechiyo.

271
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,475
I'm Sakura. I'm 30 years old.

272
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,843
I'm from Tokyo.

273
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,746
No need to introduce yourself to me! Here!

274
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,482
Wait. We need to finish something first.

275
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,783
Yeah.

276
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,753
Could you please?

277
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,527
If you can read a little,
I can get the general idea.

278
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,765
-Can you hold this?
-Okay.

279
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,535
Why don't we eat this while it's cold?

280
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,569
-But…
-Right?

281
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,438
-Come with me, Miss!
-What?

282
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,673
-What? Now?
-Yeah! To a bookstore!

283
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,442
I want to buy a book. Now.

284
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,676
But…

285
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,078
Take care of him, Takechiyo!

286
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,279
-Okay!
-Ms. Ogawa!

287
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,681
See you!

288
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,421
Did I say something that upset him?

289
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,390
Let's just eat for now. We can't waste it.

290
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:43,095
Let's watermelon!

291
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,396
-Come on!
-Okay!

292
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,002
Let go of me, please.

293
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,175
Are you upset
because I brought Mr. Sakura?

294
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,479
He can get the general idea
if I read a little? So patronizing!

295
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:06,718
Come on!

296
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:24,403
This is such a weird situation,
but in any case, it's so tasty!

297
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,038
-I agree!
-Right?

298
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:30,442
This is valuable. I rarely hang out
with people from other sectors.

299
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,713
A host and a teacher.
Completely opposite industries.

300
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,719
Where do you think they went?

301
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,156
I have no idea. I doubt they'll come back.

302
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,426
That's not good.

303
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,496
It's fine!

304
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:54,166
We don't try to take money
from every woman we meet.

305
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,703
Sorry.

306
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,871
Don't be.

307
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,375
Here.

308
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:13,185
-Cheers! Yeah!
-Cheers!

309
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,458
Summer's here!

310
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,160
This is so good.

311
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,196
Is being a teacher fun?

312
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:25,864
What?

313
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:33,005
It doesn't feel fun yet.
It's very demanding.

314
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,239
I get it.

315
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:38,844
My sales are low, so all I do
is butter up customers and other hosts.

316
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,280
Makes me wonder when it'll change.

317
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,848
I get that!

318
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,785
I think we might get along.

319
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,856
I think I love you.

320
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,427
That's a daring joke!
I didn't expect that from you!

321
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,031
-Right! Let's see who can eat faster!
-What?

322
00:19:59,097 --> 00:19:59,932
-Here.
-Okay.

323
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,033
-Ready?
-Yes.

324
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,634
Steady, go!

325
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:04,970
You're so fast!

326
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,844
Welcome.

327
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,615
Maybe we look like a couple?

328
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,786
We're only here to buy you a book.

329
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,421
Yeah.

330
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,991
We have a book about trains,
so let's try a story this time.

331
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,494
Nothing too long.

332
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,297
Oh, wow…

333
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,271
I never come to bookstores.

334
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,875
Don't push yourself.
I can find you a book.

335
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,821
How about this one?

336
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,758
It's a comforting story
you can read repeatedly.

337
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,429
Is there anything more erotic?

338
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,131
What?

339
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,970
MANGA / POPULAR SERIES

340
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,305
RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN

341
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,173
Miss, what about this one?

342
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,377
How is that erotic?

343
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,278
What?

344
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,713
I think that one's too childish.

345
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,315
But it's perverted.

346
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,118
This one is undisputedly interesting!

347
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,453
You can't stop turning the pages!

348
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,554
Really?

349
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,691
Wow!

350
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,295
I can't read this.

351
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,731
Okay, maybe not now
but you should read it someday.

352
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,873
Whoa!

353
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,811
I want this one.

354
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:53,945
What?

355
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,414
I'M IN LOVE WITH MY TEACHER

356
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,118
-Hey.
-I didn't say it!

357
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,888
What are you…

358
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,289
It's a series.

359
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:06,591
Woah!

360
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,627
Stop it! Hey!

361
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,661
There!

362
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,663
Stop teasing me!

363
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,931
Excuse me.

364
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,733
What are you doing?

365
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,702
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

366
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,738
We came to buy my brother a present.

367
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,972
What?

368
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,307
Right?

369
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,376
Yeah.

370
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,953
Go away.

371
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,224
Just go and don't tell Manami about this.

372
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,693
Okay.

373
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,798
Sorry, I didn't mean to rat her out.

374
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,866
No.

375
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,802
You must be shocked.

376
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,940
Teaching a host how to read and write.

377
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,110
What is she thinking?

378
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,513
Of course, I believe her
but he is a host after all and…

379
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,981
-I don't blame you.
-Okay.

380
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,751
Can you leave this to me?

381
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,719
What?

382
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,791
Don't worry.
I won't tell her that you told me.

383
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:18,797
You also don't want her to know
I ask you to tell me what's been going on.

384
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,101
What are you going to do?

385
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,038
I'll have to think about it.
There must be a good solution.

386
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,240
Please…

387
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,210
Please don't hurt her feelings.

388
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,346
She's just so pure, but…

389
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,615
I doubt she’s blinded
by the host's technique.

390
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,451
You don't have to tell me that!
That's obvious!

391
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,220
She's not like other women, you know!

392
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,022
My apologies, Dad.

393
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,692
Isn't it too soon for you
to be calling me that?

394
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,428
Yes…

395
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,972
I hope your brother will like it.

396
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,543
He's actually my half-brother.

397
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:09,481
My mom's husband owns this shop.

398
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:10,982
Your mother?

399
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,952
My mom's like a tick?

400
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:15,420
A parasite.

401
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:21,359
Mother? She can't really be called that.

402
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,031
Taiga!

403
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,732
Where is he?

404
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,237
Uh, today, he's gone
to a seminar in Omote-sando

405
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,806
to learn about the newest
hair coloring technique!

406
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,477
You're rambling on
which means you're lying.

407
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,712
I bet he's getting drunk somewhere.

408
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,914
You have such a sharp tongue!

409
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,616
Come inside.

410
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:48,487
-What?
-This is my "mother."

411
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,589
Nice to meet you, I'm Ogawa.

412
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,124
Hello, I'm Taiga's mother.

413
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,060
Your girlfriend?

414
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:56,962
I guess not.

415
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,331
-His customer?
-Ms. Chihuahua.

416
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:00,632
What's that?

417
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,868
Have you started going to a night school?

418
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:03,902
Nope.

419
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,471
She helped me pick out a book for Yuki.

420
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,906
A book?

421
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:11,710
Yeah.

422
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,179
-Yuki! Taiga's here!
-Oh, it's fixed.

423
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:15,313
You can't call me that!

424
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,382
-What?
-Don't call me Ms. Chihuahua!

425
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:18,283
Why not?

426
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:19,918
Big brother!

427
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,054
Hey, Yuki! How have you been? Good?

428
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:23,955
Yeah!

429
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,591
I have a present for you today.

430
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,193
What? Really?

431
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,564
"No! Please forgive me!

432
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,868
If you can forgive me,
I will give you something back in return!"

433
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,970
"The lion laughed."

434
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:43,008
"You'll give me something in return?
That's exciting!

435
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:47,479
But what can someone so small
like you give me?"

436
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,948
Keep reading!

437
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,950
What do you think will happen?

438
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:57,188
He gets eaten by the lion! Right?

439
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:01,026
"The lion decided to let the mouse go."

440
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,328
He was saved!

441
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:10,335
"Days went by, and one day
the lion accidentally stepped into a trap

442
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,904
set up by humans!"

443
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,707
What will happen now?

444
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,976
I have to guess again?

445
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,644
Stop teasing and keep reading!

446
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,047
Are you curious
about what will happen too?

447
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,115
No. I'm not a kid.

448
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:30,855
"The mouse ate through the rope
that was tying the lion down!"

449
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:35,293
"Let's run!"
"Thank you so much for helping me!"

450
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,964
That's amazing! The mouse helped him!

451
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,268
Yes, the tiny mouse
was able to help the big lion!

452
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,071
Wow. That's a good story.

453
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,574
I want you to read it for me!

454
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,711
-Me?
-Yes.

455
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:06,491
THE LION AND THE MOUSE

456
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,327
"Some…

457
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,529
Somewhere…

458
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,166
humans…

459
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,570
cannot…

460
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:22,173
get… get to…

461
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,743
a…

462
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,278
a safe…

463
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,080
place…"

464
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,050
What's wrong?

465
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,554
Never mind!

466
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,958
I'm hungry!

467
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,626
Up you go.

468
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,827
Let's go eat something!

469
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,196
Okay! I'm hungry too!

470
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,731
-Right?
-Yeah!

471
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,501
Let's play together again sometime, Miss!

472
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,803
-See you!
-See you!

473
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:57,909
Oh, yeah!

474
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,012
I need to go to work now.

475
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,113
What?

476
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,117
I have to go make women
fall in love with me!

477
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,056
It was so sudden.

478
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:14,059
He shut off as if he were
closing a door in my face.

479
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,430
Did I embarrass him?

480
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,965
Did I hurt him?

481
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,373
We need to talk.

482
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,844
What? With me?

483
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,548
How many years has it been?

484
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,490
-Oh, Kaoru! You're late.
-Sorry.

485
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,193
-Thanks.
-No worries.

486
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,999
Hey! I cleaned up the rooftop!

487
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,134
Thanks.

488
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,470
Did anything happen with her?

489
00:28:59,003 --> 00:28:59,904
Nope!

490
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,873
Really? How disappointing!

491
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,844
I was excited that this was the start
of your forbidden love story!

492
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,113
Don't be ridiculous!

493
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,248
She's too old.

494
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,352
I thought so too.
I guess she's just a tutor.

495
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,021
Hello! Kaoru, Tsubasa asked for you.

496
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:17,922
Why?

497
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,024
I don't know, sorry. Please?

498
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,326
He should come to him!

499
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,594
Thank you.

500
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,098
I was hoping you would come to see me.

501
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,867
Yes.

502
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,103
Thank you for the interview.

503
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,572
What? Don't act so distant!

504
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,641
Ms. Momotaro. Welcome.

505
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,842
Hey.

506
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,344
How can I help you?

507
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,615
She wants to chat.
Please sit. I'll be back later.

508
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,516
Okay.

509
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,853
What could it be?

510
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,990
I need to ask you something.

511
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:56,060
Wow, this is exciting.
Thank you for this, by the way.

512
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,396
I heard you see Manami
outside of work hours.

513
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,733
Did Ms. Chihuahua tell you?

514
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,070
No, she's been hiding it from me
which is unusual.

515
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,073
Her fiancé told me.

516
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,475
Wow!

517
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,743
I didn't expect that!

518
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,045
Ms. Momoko! You came to see me again?

519
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,113
Excuse me.

520
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,749
She told him there's nothing weird
between you two.

521
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,351
And she's just your teacher.

522
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,721
I bet he was mad at her

523
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,025
for hanging out with a host.

524
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,160
I want to know your true intentions.

525
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,096
Is it really just to study
or to take advantage of her?

526
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,498
Let's have a drink first.

527
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,599
Which is it?

528
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,068
I know I'm being nosey.

529
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,773
But she's one of my oldest friends,
and I'm worried.

530
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,441
This is so dumb.

531
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,077
Ms. Momotaro.

532
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:50,281
You're not worried, you're just bored
and trying to pass the time.

533
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,551
Excuse me, Kaoru.
A first-timer at Table Q nominated you.

534
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,888
Okay! Well then, thanks for the drink.

535
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,390
Let's greet our customer together!
Welcome!

536
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,092
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

537
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,160
Kaoru.

538
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,732
Please have a seat here.

539
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,567
Excuse me.

540
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,202
I'm back!

541
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:12,904
Welcome back!

542
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,906
What? Where's Mom?

543
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,709
I think she's at the hospital
to see Ms. Machida.

544
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,078
Is she still unwell?

545
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:24,048
If she gets discharged,
we should invite her to the wedding.

546
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:28,419
You're going to look so beautiful
in a wedding dress.

547
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,387
Stop it.

548
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:35,260
Just one thing though,
please don't wear anything too revealing.

549
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,831
The other day at my colleague's wedding,

550
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,201
every time the bride bowed
I felt nervous for her!

551
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:47,472
I thought, I can't entrust
important tasks to someone

552
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,008
who'd let his wife wear
something like that!

553
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:52,510
Manami.

554
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:58,483
You're not capable
of paving your own way in life.

555
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,587
You're better off relying on someone
than pushing yourself.

556
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:06,257
I've known you since you were born,
so I should know.

557
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,928
You are very lucky, you know?

558
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:18,870
Hello?

559
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,471
Where are you now?

560
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,573
I'm so sorry about today!

561
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,142
-I…
-This isn't about that.

562
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,979
Ms. Sawaguchi and her mom
want to come to the school tonight

563
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,814
to discuss something.

564
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,117
I'll head out now. Bye.

565
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,920
I have to go to the school.

566
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,794
Do you want a full glass of ice?

567
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,728
I'm back.

568
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,163
Hey.

569
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,299
Who is that?

570
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,135
-Someone you know?
-Yeah.

571
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,341
Oh no! Did she see me?
She did, didn't she?

572
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,413
Thank you for being considerate.

573
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,250
Thank you for the nomination.

574
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,054
I'm Kaoru, lady-killer of Kabukicho.

575
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,091
Nice to meet you.

576
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,792
So you're…

577
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,296
I'm flattered to be nominated
by such a lovely lady like you!

578
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,132
Did you hear about me from someone?

579
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,602
I'm…

580
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,572
My name is Ogawa.

581
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,642
Ms. Ogawa. What a great surname.

582
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,780
I think you know my daughter, Manami.

583
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,187
You're her mother? I see.

584
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,424
She's been a big help.

585
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:51,996
I wish I didn't have to say this,
but please stop seeing my daughter.

586
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,035
You went straight to the point.

587
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:00,471
Let's have a drink first!

588
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,041
There.

589
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:07,779
Cheers! Thank you for the drink!

590
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,420
Do you want a soft drink instead?

591
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,368
I would like to order some tequila.

592
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,838
Are you sure? You want hard liquor?

593
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,407
And a chaser, please.

594
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,011
You can hold your drink, huh?

595
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,346
Yes!

596
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,248
Tequila.

597
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,616
Who is she?

598
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:50,021
-Is she your teacher friend's mom?
-Huh?

599
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,891
To be number one,
you have to be able to tell these things.

600
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,495
You're very good.
I'd hire you as my team member.

601
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,965
Please do. I'm more competent
than Kaoru for sure.

602
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,368
Should the number one host
talk trash about other hosts?

603
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,140
He's the only one I don't like.

604
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:14,745
It's because we both come
from humble beginnings.

605
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,250
I really pushed myself
so I could enter college.

606
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:25,289
He doesn't even try that hard
yet his sales are improving.

607
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,024
And the owner here loves him.

608
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,361
He keeps telling everyone
that he'll become number one.

609
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,966
And it just irritates me.

610
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,036
Is that weird?

611
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,773
Is this heart-to-heart talk
one of your tactics?

612
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:48,079
I can't win against you!
You see through me.

613
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,450
I must admit, I think I told you too much.

614
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:53,885
I'm sorry.

615
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,388
Not at all. I liked it.

616
00:35:58,289 --> 00:35:59,857
You're human after all.

617
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:26,751
Here you go.

618
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,891
Cheers.

619
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,365
Your tolerance is amazing!

620
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,635
-I used to drink a lot.
-I see.

621
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:49,207
Because of that,
I know what kind of people you are.

622
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,409
I know more than my daughter.

623
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,010
Is that so?

624
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,389
Please accept this.

625
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,692
What is this?

626
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:09,927
You're paying me off?

627
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,863
You can think of it that way.

628
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:18,769
What if I refused?

629
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,441
All employees!
Please gather around Table F!

630
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,875
Gather round!

631
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:30,014
What do you want from my daughter?

632
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,682
-Thank you for coming.
-Yeah! Yeah!

633
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,918
You're just fooling around
with her, right?

634
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:37,355
She's so serious.

635
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,390
I bet you love teasing her!

636
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,959
-Let's express our gratitude!
-Yeah! Yeah!

637
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:46,697
While you're here
getting drunk in Kabukicho,

638
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,937
my daughter is at her school

639
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,807
doing career counselling for a student!

640
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,179
So what?

641
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,585
Tell him she said he's annoying her,
and give him this.

642
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:09,687
Got it?

643
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,358
She told us
you've actually been annoying her.

644
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,799
We need to find our match in this world.

645
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,835
I'm not saying you're bad and she's good.

646
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,804
However,

647
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,942
being with someone who's not a match
will only end in unhappiness.

648
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,214
I beg you!

649
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,785
Please stop tempting her!
She's almost married!

650
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,924
Ma'am.

651
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:51,696
It's not like we want donations
from our customers.

652
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,000
If you're paying…

653
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,772
at least enjoy some drinks here.

654
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,022
What is this red suit? You're not Santa!

655
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,331
Apologies for keeping you waiting.

656
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,133
Sorry to call you in so late.

657
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:34,238
I'm against her studying overseas.

658
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,307
What about what I want?

659
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,276
All countries
are politically unstable now.

660
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,445
I know it too well.

661
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,881
I understand how you feel.

662
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:47,385
But she feels very strongly about this,

663
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,054
so I would like to support her
in her choices.

664
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,722
Support?

665
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,991
You're being irresponsible.

666
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,562
There was a time
that I wanted to study overseas.

667
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,733
But I was scared
my parents would be against it,

668
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,435
so I didn't even ask them.

669
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,874
I think it's amazing
that she can express her true desires.

670
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:15,846
Your knowledge and experience
from being a government official

671
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,282
can't even be compared to mine.

672
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,652
But I want to help as much as I can.

673
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,288
So, I listed up schools in safe areas
that meet her wishes.

674
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,259
I hope you can make use of it.

675
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,375
Did they make you drink?

676
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:51,415
Gosh! I couldn't have told him
without getting drunk!

677
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,017
Have you no shame?

678
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,218
Shame?

679
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,354
You're so old-fashioned!

680
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,657
So old-fashioned!

681
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:03,894
What on earth are you saying?
You're so ridiculous!

682
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,630
Goodbye.

683
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,635
Thank you very much.

684
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,737
Take care.

685
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,478
Let's look at them when we get home.

686
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:21,479
Okay.

687
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,794
-It's so late.
-Sorry to keep you.

688
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,797
I feel like we got through to her, though.

689
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:42,833
Ms. Ogawa?

690
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:49,073
Please go ahead.
I want to enjoy the night breeze.

691
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,208
Okay. Good night.

692
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,676
Good night.

693
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,130
Ms. Chihuahua!

694
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,506
Ms. Ogawa has grown a lot as a teacher.

695
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,510
I heard that she got engaged.

696
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:27,878
I see.

697
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:32,616
Maybe she took it as a chance
to reflect on her actions.

698
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,486
That's condescending!

699
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,022
Oh no, I forgot my phone!

700
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:39,990
I'll go get it!

701
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,261
Why are you here?

702
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:48,265
I'm sorry about today,
for being distant suddenly.

703
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,200
You didn't have to come here!

704
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,939
I don't think I can do it.

705
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:58,442
Don't say that!
You'll be able to read in time!

706
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,979
I'm not talking about reading books.

707
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,549
I might be able to read someday.

708
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,384
But, you see…

709
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:13,390
There will always be
a huge wall between us.

710
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:22,199
I knew it, but being told by someone
made me want to deny it.

711
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:24,902
Did someone say something to you?

712
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,605
Does it matter?

713
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,994
Sorry, but can you please leave?

714
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,864
You can't be seen talking to me?

715
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,432
No, that's not it!

716
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,368
Hey.

717
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,972
Can I climb up this gate
and go to your side?

718
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,040
What?

719
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,512
I want to join you over there and talk.

720
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,648
This is absurd!

721
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:15,185
I don't want to be your student anymore.

722
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:37,708
I…

723
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,779
Don't say it.
It's against the school rules.

724
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:44,682
I…

725
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,488
I think I'm starting to…

726
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,824
dislike you.

727
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,364
I hate you!

728
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:30,027
Love can be merciless.

729
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:36,066
Should I still seek love even then?

730
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,070
Want to run away with me?

731
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,005
That sounds like a terrible escape!

732
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,140
But it'll be fun!

733
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,943
That terrible would be fun.

734
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:52,950
THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS
