1
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,023
Here.

2
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,425
Find a page that tickles your fancy.

3
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,693
We're using this?

4
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:31,197
I thought you'd bring me
a textbook for kids.

5
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,367
It's best to learn
with what you're interested in.

6
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,302
You're sounding like a teacher.

7
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,405
I am a certified teacher.

8
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,973
That's true.

9
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,644
Wow. This is great.

10
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,082
Wow!

11
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,483
This one!

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,584
The Keikyu train.

13
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,019
Yeah, that's the one.

14
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:57,057
When I was younger,
I often rode this train to Miura Beach.

15
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,266
How have you been?

16
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,803
<i>My mom used to take me</i>
<i>so she could see a guy.</i>

17
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:17,010
<i>I didn't like the reason,</i>
<i>but the sea was beautiful.</i>

18
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,048
I went there on a school trip
in elementary school.

19
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,050
- Really?
- Yes.

20
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,219
Maybe we crossed paths then.

21
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,822
I don't think you were born then.

22
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,356
I guess not…

23
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,959
Sorry.

24
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,028
Okay, let's begin.

25
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,964
Please feel free to use this.

26
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,900
Let's try writing what it says there.

27
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,802
May I?

28
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,671
Look here,

29
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,808
"Ride the Keikyu line
and experience summer at Miura Beach!"

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,778
What was it again? The Keikyu…

31
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,113
"Ride the Keikyu line."

32
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:00,120
Keikyu…

33
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,888
By the way…

34
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,958
What is the point
of learning how to write?

35
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,660
If you learn how to read and write,

36
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,196
you can read books, write letters, and…

37
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,165
it'll broaden your horizons.

38
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,700
You think so?

39
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,637
Not being a good student
made me a smooth talker,

40
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,441
which proved helpful
in the service industry.

41
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,545
RIDE THE KEIKYU

42
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,715
How's this?

43
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,858
They all make that face.

44
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,495
I told you it was impossible to teach me.

45
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,431
I don't think it's impossible!

46
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,534
Let's start with the simple stuff.

47
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,235
So listen…

48
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,705
The vertical lines are written
from top to bottom

49
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,975
and horizontal lines
are from left to right.

50
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,111
This is the same for any kanji.

51
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,445
Try it.

52
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,281
- Me? Now?
- Yes.

53
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,619
Top to bottom and left to right.

54
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,821
Exactly!

55
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,827
With this kanji for "Kei" in Keikyu.

56
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,597
- There's a square box.
- Yes.

57
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,500
The left side is just
a straight vertical line

58
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,270
but the horizontal line goes left to right

59
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,873
and then straight
into the next vertical line.

60
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,907
Straight in. Okay.

61
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,711
And then write the line
from left to right to close the box.

62
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:32,879
Try it!

63
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,781
Ready?

64
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,684
- Top to bottom…
- Top to bottom…

65
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,519
- Straight.
- Yes.

66
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,989
- And then left to right.
- Yes!

67
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,090
Then…

68
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,892
- Straight down like this!
- Straight.

69
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,527
To finish it off?

70
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:48,428
Left to right.

71
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,630
There you go! Very good!

72
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,466
- Yeah, right.
- I mean it! You're a natural!

73
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,002
You're good at flattery.

74
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,537
Oh, I know!

75
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,306
You should work at a hostess bar!

76
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,574
I have some connections.

77
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,309
No, thank you.

78
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,479
I get awkward talking
to people I don't know.

79
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,680
I was only joking.

80
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,219
We're complete opposites.

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,322
Everything's a joke to me.

82
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,592
TRAIN TRAVELS

83
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,569
I envy you.

84
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,439
I take everything seriously…

85
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,809
I have false hopes and get shocked.

86
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,779
And then you get mad and bite people?

87
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,816
Exactly! I'm a chihuahua, after all!

88
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,164
A customer requested me, so I need to go.

89
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,332
Okay.

90
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,367
I need to prepare for my classes.

91
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,708
How about this Saturday at this time?

92
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,645
I'll give you an assignment then!

93
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,913
An assignment?

94
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,893
Please practice writing this sentence.

95
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,795
ASSIGNMENT

96
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,163
Okay…

97
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,998
Understood.

98
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,142
Thank you.

99
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,877
See you.

100
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:53,019
<i>No student of mine</i>
<i>had ever thanked me before.</i>

101
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,059
<i>It made me happy that I was able to help</i>
<i>someone even though I'm a bad teacher.</i>

102
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,933
- Hey! How's it going?
- Hey!

103
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,103
- Don't be too eager.
- Okay.

104
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,644
- Hey!
- Hi.

105
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,233
My parents said our families
should meet as soon as possible.

106
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,300
What do you think?

107
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,335
Yeah.

108
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,904
My dad said to invite your family to ours.

109
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,407
He was rolling his shoulder, but…

110
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,041
But?

111
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,911
I'm worried because he can be rude.

112
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,012
Is he?

113
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,849
He seems a little strict,
but he's a very good dad.

114
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,118
You haven't seen it all yet.

115
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,889
He's got such high expectations
for who I marry.

116
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:08,861
Then, I'll think of it
as a job interview with an executive.

117
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,501
It feels a bit sudden,
but how about this Saturday?

118
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,371
Yes, that would…

119
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:24,510
Sorry, I have plans this Saturday evening.

120
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,179
How about Sunday?

121
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,481
Yeah, I think that works.

122
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,018
Can I ask what you're doing?

123
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,252
What?

124
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,754
This Saturday evening.

125
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,991
I have a student
who's falling behind in class,

126
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,693
so I'm helping with their assignments.

127
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,361
Oh, private tutoring!

128
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,232
- You're so devoted!
- No! Not really!

129
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,274
<i>Hey. Were you working late?</i>

130
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,910
No, I was having dinner with Mr. Kawahara.

131
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,745
Really? Any progress?

132
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,949
We're arranging for our families to meet.

133
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,283
Wow.

134
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,688
Okay, let me tell you as a divorcee,
how not to screw it up.

135
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,857
Whatever you do, don't put on an act.

136
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,725
- It'll make your life easier.
- Here.

137
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,127
Thank you. You're my rock.

138
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,231
By the way, how did it go with the host?

139
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,566
<i>What was his name… Kaoru?</i>

140
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,169
Why?

141
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,373
Our show's doing a special feature
on the host murder.

142
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,309
And I want to interview him.

143
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,780
You don't have to run it by me, you know.

144
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:39,252
I'm not running it by you.
I just wanted to ask what he's like.

145
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,988
<i>You called him about your student, right?</i>

146
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,626
Yeah, but it was a quick interaction.

147
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,297
Never mind then. Let's meet up next week.

148
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,698
See you.

149
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,106
<i>I hadn't lied to Momoko in a long time.</i>

150
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:04,277
<i>I don't have the desire</i>
<i>to tell my friend everything, but…</i>

151
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,013
<i>it was an unnecessary lie.</i>

152
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,617
The submission
of the career path survey is due soon.

153
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,453
Have you decided on your path?

154
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,660
If you're struggling to decide,
please come talk to me!

155
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,729
I felt lost too when I had to decide.

156
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,666
Why did you feel lost?

157
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,535
I…

158
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,205
I wanted to work in publishing.

159
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:37,643
So I wanted to study literature at
a university not attached to this school.

160
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:39,545
However…

161
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,314
My parents…

162
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,783
Well, mainly my dad said,

163
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,853
"Girls shouldn't go through hardships.
No need to take an exam for university."

164
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,155
That's unbelievable.

165
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:50,790
Isn't that sexism?

166
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,493
What he said is unthinkable now, right?

167
00:09:55,728 --> 00:10:01,801
I knew he was just worried about me,
and my grades weren't great.

168
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,137
So, I chose the university
affiliated with this school.

169
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,940
You gave in.

170
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,510
I felt frustrated.

171
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:16,115
But because of that,
I tried very hard while job hunting

172
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,651
and got a job at my dream company.

173
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,392
Sorry for going on a tangent.

174
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,494
Anyway, as I just mentioned,

175
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:32,365
after many different experiences,
I finally decided to be a teacher.

176
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,435
What I want to say is,
it's okay to make wrong decisions.

177
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:40,006
It's never too late for a second chance.

178
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,579
Class dismissed!

179
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,347
Stand up.

180
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,055
Bow. Goodbye.

181
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,491
Goodbye.

182
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,759
Goodbye.

183
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,764
Your family is kind of similar to mine.

184
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,765
You think so?

185
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,467
Parents who want to control
their daughters,

186
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,671
and daughters who give in to them.

187
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,107
That's why you're rebelling?

188
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,243
A bit childish, huh?

189
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:22,682
I thought you were much more mature
than me when I was in high school.

190
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,185
Are you seeing someone recently?

191
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,186
What?

192
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,058
Everyone's saying
that you've been different lately.

193
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,530
I do have someone I'm engaged to.

194
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,699
Don't tell anyone, okay?

195
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,468
Miss.

196
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,504
I…

197
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,940
I'll go to a university in the US.

198
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:51,744
If I want to change, I need to leave home.

199
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,115
So I need information on scholarships.

200
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,751
Okay.

201
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,257
And about Kaoru…

202
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,993
I'm over him.

203
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,862
What?

204
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,798
I…

205
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,969
I guess I wanted to escape
from my parents and my studies.

206
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,973
But I know we live in different worlds.

207
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,875
Different worlds?

208
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,280
No matter how good-looking or kind he is…

209
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,116
He is a host.

210
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,486
There's no future for us.

211
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:38,724
I'm going to study hard,
go to a good university,

212
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:43,362
date someone who's a catch,
and have an amazing campus life.

213
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,432
See you.

214
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:50,970
<i>She's right.</i>

215
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,372
<i>But…</i>

216
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,277
<i>My heart ached a little</i>
<i>by how an 18-year-old girl</i>

217
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,813
<i>talked about different worlds.</i>

218
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,584
This is Kaoru. Do you remember me?

219
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,988
I guess you can't forget,
I'm too handsome!

220
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,824
Hey, can we meet soon? I miss you!

221
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:15,661
I've made it into the top ten
so come see me to celebrate!

222
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,796
Hey, stop!

223
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,764
Really? Thank you!

224
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,601
Ms. Ogawa.

225
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,704
I heard today's homeroom went well.

226
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,007
- Oh, I think so.
- Nice.

227
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,775
Wait, Mr. Sakura!

228
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,411
You did your master's
on learning disabilities, right?

229
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,180
Yes, I did.

230
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,815
How come?

231
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,984
I want to learn how I should interact
with such students.

232
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,586
What?

233
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,190
There are different kinds
of learning disabilities.

234
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,160
Also, I doubt any
of our students have any.

235
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,062
Just in general terms is fine.

236
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,332
What if they struggle with literacy?

237
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,969
Can they understand sentences
if they hear them?

238
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,205
Their communication skills
when conversing is…

239
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,373
possibly better than an average person.

240
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,176
But they can hardly write any kanji.

241
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:05,077
I see…

242
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,849
Some people have difficulties
connecting the sounds to letters.

243
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,352
They tend to struggle in school.

244
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,925
How do you teach someone who grew up
that way and is already an adult?

245
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:24,830
You should avoid forcing them
as you could end up hurting them.

246
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,366
But there must be a way!

247
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,436
Why are you so eager
if we're speaking in general?

248
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,372
I guess it doesn't matter.

249
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,843
Anyway, it's important
to get used to reading and writing first.

250
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,179
Also good stationery.

251
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:41,680
Stationery?

252
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,483
Ballpoint pens can make
them nervous as it's unerasable

253
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,418
so I heard pencils are better.

254
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,820
- Pencils.
- Yes.

255
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,264
FOR A BEAUTIFUL WRITING FORM

256
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,343
TAIGA TAKAMORI

257
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,345
They didn't have it…

258
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,581
- Oh! This is the one!
- This one?

259
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,883
This is what I wanted!

260
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,586
- How about this one?
- No, definitely this one!

261
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,121
For sure!

262
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,822
- Looks nice to write with.
- Right?

263
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,801
<i>He didn't come.</i>

264
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,804
<i>I felt a little relieved.</i>

265
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,214
Ms. Chihuahua!

266
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,185
Sorry. Did you wait long?

267
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,889
You're 18 minutes late.

268
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,392
I was making these. Here you go.

269
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,697
That's considerate.

270
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:05,831
I am a host.

271
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,967
Okay. Cheers!

272
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,234
Let's begin.

273
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,103
Yes, Miss!

274
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,105
I like the enthusiasm.

275
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,606
TRAIN TRAVELS

276
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:15,708
Very well.

277
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,611
I shall gift you some learning materials!

278
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:20,946
Ta-da!

279
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,648
Ta-da? That's kind of lame.

280
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,383
And this is for me?

281
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,884
Open it.

282
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,431
It's inexpensive, but it writes nicely,
use it to practice.

283
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,502
The lead comes out if you press here,
and there's an eraser in there too.

284
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,406
It's so cool.

285
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,809
I was lost for words for a second.

286
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,910
Yeah, right.

287
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,614
No, I mean it!
No one's ever given me a pen before!

288
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,918
Okay, let's check your assignment.

289
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,256
I see, this is how it works.
And if I press here, it goes back…

290
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,091
Show me your notebook!

291
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,327
The color's great.

292
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,995
And this is the eraser I see.

293
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,698
Mr. Takamori! Your assignment?

294
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,940
I was going to do it
but work was busy and…

295
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,376
As a host, you should come up
with a better excuse.

296
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,477
It's true!

297
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,481
Right now,
the battle for first place is intense.

298
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,283
First place?

299
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,585
A spot all hosts aspire to.

300
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,289
Especially this month,
as it's the tenth anniversary of the club.

301
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,091
Everyone's trying but…

302
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,895
I'm so close to winning.

303
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,364
I can't go to the club!

304
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,266
Teachers can't go to host clubs!

305
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,600
Many do actually.

306
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,539
I'm not trying to force you to come.

307
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,611
Are you relieved?

308
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,448
Or are you sad?

309
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,949
Sad?

310
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,785
If I force you to come,
you'll have an excuse.

311
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:12,191
Even teachers must have some desire
to go to a host club.

312
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,325
Not at all.

313
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:18,664
I'm sure any woman would have
the desire to be pampered by young men.

314
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,699
At least I know I don't!

315
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,437
- So boring.
- What?

316
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:27,706
You're so boring.

317
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,975
You're a really boring woman.

318
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,444
So self-conscious and nervous.

319
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,313
What?

320
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,380
Miss.

321
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,851
You might be academic,
but I don't think you're smart.

322
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,619
What do you mean?

323
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,222
You can't enjoy life
being scared of everything!

324
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,290
You know, like…

325
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,327
Go crazy and just have fun!

326
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,396
It's not that easy!

327
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,732
Is it not? I think it is!

328
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,201
For example, try this right here.

329
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:00,706
Just by dancing around a bit
things look a little brighter!

330
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,609
I trained as a dancer at a cabaret once.

331
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,776
Pretty good, right?

332
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,677
Spin…

333
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,745
Stop it.

334
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,281
I'll leave if we're not studying.

335
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,484
Fine by me. Goodbye.

336
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,555
You're not obliged to teach me.

337
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,558
And to be honest,
I wasn't really feeling it.

338
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,794
Taking lessons
to learn writing at this age?

339
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,029
Who does that?

340
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,099
It's okay for an idiot to stay an idiot.

341
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,269
Oh really?

342
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,406
Why didn't you tell me sooner, then?

343
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:39,178
If you're so popular and busy,
why did you take the time to come?

344
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,846
Oh my…

345
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,050
It's because I wanted to see you.

346
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,585
Don't mock me!

347
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,653
It's true.

348
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,322
I will not fall for a host's sales talk!

349
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,725
Miss, you're so cute.

350
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:54,860
Lesson over!

351
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,729
Oh, you're actually leaving. What?

352
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,670
<i>So I was forcing him to learn.</i>

353
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:09,341
<i>I wanted to feel good</i>
<i>by doing something teacherly.</i>

354
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:14,379
<i>I guess I also thought</i>
<i>we lived in different worlds.</i>

355
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,649
<i>No more. That's it.</i>

356
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,094
"There"… No, that's not right…

357
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,329
15 YEARS AGO

358
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,232
"Went there and

359
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:38,503
I found a cat"…

360
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,715
and a poop suddenly attacked!

361
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,018
Everyone got covered in poop!

362
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,921
- Gross!
- What are you saying?

363
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,022
Takamori!

364
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,658
<i>Read it properly!</i>

365
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,461
Show us your notebook!

366
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:07,366
You've nothing written!

367
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,502
- You're so dumb!
- Dumb!

368
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,305
Dumb! Come on, let's go!

369
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,282
KANJI TEST

370
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,518
EAST

371
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,254
Stop breaking it.

372
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,456
Why can't you write normally?

373
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,459
Only one horizontal line here.

374
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,965
How are you so stupid?

375
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,853
How's it going with the teacher?

376
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,921
What?

377
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:06,591
You said she'll become your customer.

378
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,662
Yeah, soon, I think.

379
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,833
- It's taking quite a long time.
- Our boss always says not to rush it.

380
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,969
The longer it takes for her
to let her guard down,

381
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,205
the better the outcome.

382
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,274
And how do you do that?

383
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,244
I make her angry.

384
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,446
Very angry.

385
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,750
Really?

386
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,620
Women tend to make excuses
after getting mad at someone

387
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,890
because they don't want to be disliked.

388
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,994
So you just need to take
that opportunity to be nice to them.

389
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,763
Impressive!

390
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,299
As expected of our future number one!

391
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,900
Thank you for teaching me!

392
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,104
Future? Don't you mean
the next number one?

393
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,772
Oh, sorry.

394
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:59,778
But knowing that much about women
must make dating quite boring?

395
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,113
I don't date.

396
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,416
Really? But you must've fallen
for someone before?

397
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,317
No, I haven't.

398
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,219
- You must have!
- I haven't!

399
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,021
- Tell me! Please!
- Stop. Oh, someone's calling.

400
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,224
HAG

401
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:15,861
What?

402
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,029
Hey, Taiga.

403
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,965
<i>Something wrong with Yuki?</i>

404
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,767
No, he's fine.

405
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,002
Thanks for the other day.

406
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:31,510
<i>Don't be so wary.</i>
<i>I just called to say thank you.</i>

407
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,513
Can you wait a minute?

408
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,055
Yuki, your brother.

409
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,426
Taiga! Thank you for helping us!

410
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,795
Are you better?

411
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:52,197
I've been fine all along!

412
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,234
Hey, Taiga. When will you read me a book?

413
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,637
Next time.

414
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,405
<i>Okay!</i>

415
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,576
So yeah…

416
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,613
I will return the money when I can.

417
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,750
<i>It's fine. I'm just glad Yuki's okay.</i>

418
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,218
Thank you.

419
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,354
You take care of yourself, too.

420
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,859
<i>A host got stabbed, right? I'm worried.</i>

421
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,360
See you.

422
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,033
How was that?

423
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,471
He is a host.
Deceiving people is part of his job.

424
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,739
It's a necessary preparation.

425
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,214
Regarding your question…

426
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,584
The answer's no.

427
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:52,123
I've never truly fallen for a woman,
and I'm sure I never will.

428
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,260
RIDE THE KEIKYU LINE
AND EXPERIENCE SUMMER AT MIURA BEACH

429
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,929
PIETAS GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

430
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,731
Good morning.

431
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,066
Good morning.

432
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,601
- Good morning!
- Morning!

433
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,969
Good morning.

434
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,618
What's that about?

435
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,586
It looks like a ransom note.

436
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,288
It's nothing.

437
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,575
MS. MANAMI OGAWA

438
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:45,977
TAIGA TAKAMORI

439
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,221
You're so boring.

440
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,364
Cheers to our families'
bright future together!

441
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,366
Cheers!

442
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,445
I bet people
at the Japan Business Federation

443
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,414
will be amazed to know
that we'll be related soon!

444
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,949
I still can't believe it!

445
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,984
What a surprise!

446
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,353
Stop it already!

447
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,055
You're stealing the spotlight!

448
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,191
Sorry! I got carried away!

449
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:38,930
I heard you teach
at Pietas Girls' High School, Manami?

450
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,600
I do. I teach Japanese.

451
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,567
I see.

452
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,403
Please teach our son some Japanese.

453
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,739
It was his weakest subject in school.

454
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,942
Although he was often
at the top in math class.

455
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,778
Don't brag like that.

456
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:59,451
Manami wasn't good at math,
so I think they'll be a good match.

457
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,721
- They can help each other.
- So… Hey.

458
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,624
What kind of family do you want to have?

459
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,192
Well…

460
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:12,230
It might sound boring,
but I want to build a happy home.

461
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,233
Everyone wants that.

462
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,105
What I mean is that whatever issues
we have, I want to face them with a smile.

463
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,907
Shouldn't you face your issues
in a serious manner?

464
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,745
Well, yes. I think it depends
on what the issue is, and I meant it as…

465
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,814
Bankers work in such
a demanding environment

466
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,751
so you said you want
to take it easy at home, right?

467
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,254
I did. In order to devote myself to work,

468
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:41,226
I think a good
work-life balance is needed.

469
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,663
That's a good mindset to have, but…

470
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,265
it mustn't be your priority
if you want to succeed.

471
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,236
I recommend working
until you sweat blood at least once.

472
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:54,305
Yes. Sweat blood?

473
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,209
Sorry, my husband's
not very good at making jokes.

474
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,211
It wasn't a joke.

475
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,481
You know nothing about
the outside world, so zip it.

476
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,351
- How about it?
- Please start.

477
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,952
Thank you.

478
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,454
- I'll get more tea.
- Sorry!

479
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,789
Thank you!

480
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,527
Please don't worry too much.

481
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,829
My son is ambitious.

482
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,666
With Manami's support, he can do anything.

483
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:27,372
Manami is humble but also very determined.

484
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,109
That's why I became
even more attracted to her.

485
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,578
Oh, aren't you smitten!

486
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,915
I wish I could be young again!

487
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,118
I'm envious! It's lovely to see this.

488
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,421
- Please eat!
- Yes.

489
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,026
Kaoru. You have a customer at Table K.

490
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:53,164
- Thank you for choosing me!
- Kaoru!

491
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,332
By yourself today?

492
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,433
Is that bad?

493
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,602
Not at all! I'm happy to see you!

494
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:58,570
Yay.

495
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,773
Has Ms. Chihuahua been here lately?

496
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,043
I can't tell you
about other customers, sorry!

497
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,611
But we're friends.

498
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,448
Does that mean
you're a school teacher too?

499
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:13,118
- Thank you for the drink.
- Sure.

500
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,587
I hate sneaking around,
so let me get straight to it.

501
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,692
JBC TV PROGRAM DIRECTOR

502
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,328
I'm interviewing hosts
about the host murder.

503
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,362
Oh, that?

504
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,399
Have you or any other hosts
you know been in danger before?

505
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,435
No need for names.

506
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,670
Well, Ms. Momotaro…

507
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,273
This is where you come to have fun!

508
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,675
If you're not here for fun, please go.

509
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,312
I'm trying so hard to become number one.

510
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,950
Even if I could be killed,
I need to take first place once.

511
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,952
That's my assignment.

512
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,922
Assignment? That word does not suit you!

513
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,926
- Ms. Chihuahua wouldn't mock me like that.
- Hey!

514
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,362
I can take his place.

515
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,365
An interview sounds interesting.

516
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,668
Great. Please have a seat.

517
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,069
Thank you.

518
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:11,743
I'm Machida.

519
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,944
I'm Tsubasa.

520
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,012
Ms. Momotaro?

521
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,448
Gosh! That went well!

522
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,750
Well done!

523
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,886
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh!

524
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:24,289
- Oh! Yay!
- Yay!

525
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,924
- Sorry.
- It's fine!

526
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,160
- I'm embarrassed about my dad.
- What?

527
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,862
Forcing his opinion on promotion…

528
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,132
Oh no, I respect your dad a lot!

529
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:38,336
I mean, I would like to be promoted.

530
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,637
Oh really?

531
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,872
Why?

532
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:43,041
You said you want to prioritize
your private life.

533
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:47,612
Oh, that wasn't a lie!
I do think that way sometimes.

534
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,649
It's not a problem! I sometimes
change my mind about things too!

535
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:07,632
Friday next week, I finish work early,
so let's check out venues.

536
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,934
Okay.

537
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:16,140
On the way back,
why don't we stay a night in Yokohama?

538
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,177
I want to redeem myself from last time.

539
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,181
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not free that Saturday.

540
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:24,849
- Oh…
- I have plans.

541
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,651
Private tutoring again?

542
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:30,154
What? Oh no, not that!
I have plans with Momoko.

543
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:34,125
I see. That's a shame.

544
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,667
I'll compromise.

545
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,681
Oh, no, the horn.

546
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,855
I guess this isn't a good place for that.

547
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:16,935
And I ended up drinking quite a lot.

548
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,038
Hey stop! Why would you do that?

549
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,606
The interview flopped.

550
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:22,840
- Any overcharging?
- Yes!

551
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,409
I paid 50,000 yen!

552
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,446
Kaoru didn't want anything to do with me.

553
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,514
Really?

554
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,851
He didn't even tell me
if you've visited lately.

555
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,789
Why would I?

556
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:41,025
Well, he seems to be interested in you.

557
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:45,063
Even if I could be killed,
I need to take first place once.

558
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,198
That's my assignment.

559
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,600
Assignment…

560
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,636
It is dangerous, though.

561
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,840
It means they'd do anything for money.

562
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,378
I'm not surprised that incidents
happen in such an environment.

563
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,984
- How did the family meeting go?
- Yeah.

564
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,552
It went well.

565
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,253
My dad made me anxious, though.

566
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,956
How did Kawahara what's-his-name do?

567
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,795
On the way back,
he suggested an overnight trip.

568
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,164
- Oh, so it's going well!
- Yeah.

569
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,667
- Very well.
- Good!

570
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,742
Oh there… there she is!

571
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,543
How do I close this window?

572
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,012
I can't close it!

573
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,113
She's struggling…

574
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,181
You can do it!

575
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:44,555
Are you relieved she wasn't lying?

576
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:45,757
Yeah.

577
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,759
You thought she was cheating?

578
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:49,627
Uh…

579
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,064
I didn't doubt her.

580
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,067
Oh, yes, you did!

581
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:56,968
What?

582
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,205
Liars tend to think
that others are lying to them too.

583
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,474
We're getting married!

584
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,344
Of course, I worry about who she meets!

585
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:10,481
If she has an affair,
my reputation at work can be ruined!

586
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,283
I see.

587
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,185
Oh, there she is!

588
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,159
Oh? Why is she…

589
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,628
What? She's coming this way!

590
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,596
Get down!

591
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,665
- The seat's not reclining.
- What?

592
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,640
Isn't the station the other way?

593
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:36,707
What?

594
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,110
- Where did she go?
- That way.

595
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,011
What?

596
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,280
Hey! Are you going to follow her?

597
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,854
He's already obsessed…

598
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:03,234
PIETAS GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

599
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,803
Her workplace…

600
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,173
What am I doing?

601
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:32,997
COMBUSTIBLE TRASH

602
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:14,405
RIDE THE KEIKYU LINE
AND EXPERIENCE SUMMER AT MIURA BEACH

603
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:37,962
Thanks! See you soon!

604
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,766
- Get home safe! Thank you! Bye!
- Bye!

605
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,537
Oh, Miss! Are you here to see Kaoru?

606
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,705
No, I…

607
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,640
Come in.

608
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,211
Come on! It's so cute,
how you're squeezing my hand!

609
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,280
Tsubaki! Ijuin! The teacher's here!

610
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:58,516
- I can go in by myself.
- Come on! It's okay!

611
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,784
Escort her in!

612
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,118
Good evening!

613
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,553
- Excuse me.
- Come in!

614
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,632
- One by one, okay?
- One by one!

615
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,567
I'll take your bag.

616
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,136
We have an anniversary event today.

617
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:20,972
Welcome!

618
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,340
How's Ms. Momoko?

619
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,342
- She's good…
- She never contacts me.

620
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,377
- Watch your step!
- Okay.

621
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,412
- Here's your seat. Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

622
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,883
- I never get a reply from her.
- She's bad at texting.

623
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,085
Oh, is she?

624
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,387
Here is your wet towel.

625
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:40,024
Ms. Chihuahua! Welcome.

626
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,561
Oh? What's with that look?

627
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,800
I received your assignment.

628
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,569
Oh, yes.

629
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,105
It was very well written. You did so well!

630
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,506
I'm not in kindergarten.

631
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,708
I'm sure a lot of effort went into it.

632
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,848
- Next time we can try a longer sentence…
- Quiet!

633
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,284
Let's not talk about it here.

634
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,753
You should have fun.

635
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:14,725
Help your student.
Your nomination is already a great help.

636
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,698
Fine. But I can't stay too long.

637
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,633
That's okay! Thank you!

638
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,701
First drink, please.

639
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:24,769
Okay!

640
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,570
What would you like, Miss?

641
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:30,174
- I…
- Don't force yourself to drink alcohol.

642
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,312
Teachers tend to worry
what others might think.

643
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,247
Oh, true.

644
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,620
So?

645
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,957
- Huh? You want to go home?
- No!

646
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,860
I would have some champagne!

647
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,363
- What?
- Wow. Champagne?

648
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,333
I'm capable of having fun.

649
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,101
"Capable"? You're such a square…

650
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:58,669
Are you sure?

651
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,472
It depends on the price.

652
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,240
Here's the price list.

653
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,277
- Right here.
- Have you decided?

654
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,712
Quite a few choices.

655
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,483
This one, please.

656
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,384
Sure!

657
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,786
50,000 yen?

658
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:16,754
50,000 yen!

659
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:17,955
Oh my, Miss!

660
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,057
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

661
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,728
- I'll get it ready.
- Thanks!

662
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:26,330
President Akina is here!

663
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,800
Welcome!

664
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,369
Welcome!

665
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,372
Welcome!

666
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,140
Welcome!

667
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,377
Welcome, Ms. Akina.

668
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,312
I'll be back.

669
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,181
Hi! It's me, Kaoru!

670
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,383
Oh, you're wearing it!

671
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,784
Of course, I am!

672
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,323
I'm so happy!

673
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,557
I'm glad!

674
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,327
- It's my first time trying it on.
- Really?

675
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,563
- You must have known I would come.
- Also, look at this…

676
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:03,100
TSUBASA / HIROTO

677
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,504
KAORU

678
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,972
Kaoru…

679
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,079
Can I have some too?

680
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,081
Thank you.

681
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,984
Oh, and the steak!

682
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,719
It's good, right?

683
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,053
Excuse me.

684
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,823
Ms. Akina. Thank you, as always.

685
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,225
- Happy tenth anniversary.
- Thank you.

686
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,528
I knew you'd do well
as a legendary ex-host.

687
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,429
It's nothing.

688
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:33,564
I heard that you've been successful

689
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,866
in the real estate
and cabaret club businesses too.

690
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:36,934
Fortunately, yes.

691
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,904
I'm sorry I changed my nominated host.

692
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,106
I thought I'd get banned as a penalty.

693
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,340
No way!

694
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,643
JOKER couldn't have succeeded without you.

695
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:48,946
Excuse me.

696
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,281
Staff members!

697
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,983
Please gather around Ms. Akina's table!

698
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,652
- Gather around!
- What's happening?

699
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:55,986
What's going on?

700
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,321
What is this?

701
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,325
What's going on?

702
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,060
- Guess what?
- What?

703
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,230
The wonderful and lovely President Akina

704
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,166
and our charismatic Prince Kaoru's table

705
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:14,538
has ordered ten bottles of champagne
worth three million yen!

706
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,441
- No way!
- Thank you very much!!

707
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,443
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

708
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:24,114
Let's ask a few words from Ms. Akina!
Three, two, one, go!

709
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,449
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

710
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,920
Are you all ready to aim
for first place at JOKER's

711
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,155
Kabukicho branch?

712
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,157
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

713
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,260
I promise here and now
to make my newly nominated host,

714
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,464
Kaoru, number one!

715
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,833
- Wow!
- Yeah!

716
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:49,006
Thank you, Ms. Akina!

717
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,408
- Yeah!
- Yes!

718
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:55,679
That's all? That's not enough!

719
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:02,486
- Thank you, Ms. Akina!
- Yeah!

720
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,757
That's not enough!
I can't order more for that!

721
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:07,491
Do more!

722
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:12,363
More? Wait, hang on. I know!

723
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,233
Thank you so much!

724
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,102
Be careful!

725
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,104
Not even close.

726
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,974
Stupid ones need
to show sincerity if they want to win.

727
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,381
You're so dumb!

728
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,615
Dumb!

729
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,118
How are you so stupid?

730
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,221
Yes, you're right!

731
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,291
Everyone got covered in poop!

732
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,126
What should I do?

733
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,127
Hang on…

734
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,095
- Hold this, will you?
- What?

735
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,097
Let me think.

736
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,533
- Ms. Akina.
- That's risky!

737
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,235
- Ms. Akina.
- Be careful!

738
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,304
Thank you so much!

739
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,538
Woah!

740
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,973
Are you okay?

741
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,311
Ms. Akina, I love you.

742
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,850
Gosh! Miss, are you okay?

743
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,054
Hey, you.

744
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:14,258
You're leaving?
But it's this club's special day!

745
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,332
We meet again, huh?

746
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,302
Anything you'd like to say?

747
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,543
Kaoru is not stupid.

748
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,288
She said you weren't stupid.

749
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:52,596
Right! Let's have some champagne!

750
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,165
- Let's have an amazing time! Yeah!
- Yeah!

751
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,701
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

752
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,872
I'm very sorry about that.

753
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,143
Please come again.

754
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,981
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

755
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,950
- No, it's fine.
- However…

756
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,587
That shouldn't be allowed
even if she's a paying customer!

757
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,590
A host club is a place

758
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,761
that allows all customers
to have fun in their own ways.

759
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,708
<i>To people who come to these places,</i>

760
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:41,478
<i>I guess I'm the one who's out of place,</i>
<i>clueless, and immature.</i>

761
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:47,384
<i>What assignments are needed</i>
<i>for me to become a proper adult?</i>

762
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:58,729
BEWARE OF SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUALS

763
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,159
Miss.

764
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,267
<i>The biggest idiot</i>

765
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,069
<i>is me.</i>

766
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,475
<i>He followed you and saw you go into JOKER.</i>

767
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:47,578
Before you act, think hard
about what's most important for a host.

768
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:50,948
You really are a host to your core.

769
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:55,953
THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS
