1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,242
<i>The express train at platform one</i>
<i>is bound for Misakiguchi.</i>

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,779
<i>After Shinagawa, the train will stop</i>
<i>at Keikyu Kamata station.</i>

3
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,525
- Wow, he's creepy!
- What is he doing?

4
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,293
What a creep!

5
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:31,998
Hey! Here.

6
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,367
And this way!

7
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,872
Quick, get on!

8
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,709
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

9
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,516
Morning.

10
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,086
Good morning.

11
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,561
<i>Thank you for taking the Keikyu line.</i>

12
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,896
What are you doing?

13
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,498
What?

14
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:07,867
You look good.

15
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,540
You didn't skip today.

16
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,442
Why would I?

17
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:16,976
It's our goodbye trip.

18
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,680
I asked for my first day off, ever.

19
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,948
Did you take a day off?

20
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,250
It's not a workday for me today.

21
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,054
Aomono-Yokocho station!

22
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,958
I used to go to the shopping street here!

23
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,259
Can we see it?

24
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,031
This is my first school trip.

25
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,572
- First time ever?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,441
Not even a camping trip.

27
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:54,747
I actually didn't like
going on school trips.

28
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,818
I was a slow eater, and we had to write
a short essay afterwards.

29
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,020
Really? That sounds awful.

30
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:01,921
It was!

31
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,756
But you will need to write one today.

32
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,258
- What?
- A short essay.

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,365
I didn't like writing it
because I felt pressured to say I had fun.

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,300
You can write whatever.

35
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,002
Miss, did you know

36
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:21,307
that whenever
the Keikyu line train turns, it creaks!

37
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,677
Kind of like a squeaking sound!

38
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,980
Squeak and boom!

39
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,948
Squeak! Do you get it?

40
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,550
Have a listen!

41
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,519
Listen, it's coming.

42
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,854
See? Listen.

43
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,057
I think I'm starting to…

44
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,793
hate you!

45
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,481
Me too.

46
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,751
I hate you too.

47
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,629
This is it for us, right?

48
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,670
You have a perfect fiancé
who's well-suited for you.

49
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,674
I'll keep having fake relationships
based on money.

50
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,276
It fits me perfectly.

51
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,112
See? It fits perfectly!

52
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,049
Hey!

53
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,118
I want a day with you.

54
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,122
A day?

55
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,891
Let's go somewhere together.

56
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,394
Like a school trip.

57
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,631
After that, we can end this.

58
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,600
A school trip?

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,301
Yeah.

60
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,137
I know where we can go.

61
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,726
EXPRESS TRAIN TO MISAKIGUCHI

62
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,398
Hey, what on earth?

63
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,003
Sorry. I was out drinking
until 3:00 a.m. with a customer.

64
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,306
You were having fun
with one of your princesses, huh?

65
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,041
It's part of my job.

66
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,026
Ouch!

67
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:53,926
How ridiculous!

68
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,428
Act your age!

69
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,263
- Honestly!
- Weirdos!

70
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,965
- Unbelievable!
- So embarrassing!

71
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,401
- I can't even look!
- You're in a public space!

72
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,469
Stop flirting in public!

73
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,439
- She's copying him!
- Too good!

74
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,540
That's the face!

75
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,942
<i>We are soon stopping at Miura Beach.</i>

76
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,079
<i>This is Miura Beach.</i>
<i>Please exit from the left-hand side.</i>

77
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
Hurry, hurry!

78
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,155
- The weird couple got off too!
- Bye!

79
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,124
This feels amazing!

80
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,759
The air's different here!

81
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,694
Wow!

82
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,030
- I can see the beach! Let's go!
- Well, we are at Miura Beach…

83
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:31,931
Wait!

84
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,100
By the way, where shall we go?

85
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,135
There's a shrine and a marina!

86
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,639
A shrine sounds good!
It'll feel like a real school trip.

87
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,841
We can get information at the bus stop.

88
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,243
Wow! What's going on?

89
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,746
<i>- Please ask the staff for help.</i>
- Take the ticket!

90
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,314
Huh? I thought I could make it.

91
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,382
- What?
- Huh?

92
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,583
- This way!
- No!

93
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,052
- Get back.
- I'd never bought a ticket before!

94
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,588
- Look, it's open!
- No, you can't go through!

95
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,291
You're too slow! Come on!

96
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,494
I won't last all day
if I use too much energy now.

97
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,162
Go on! You got this!

98
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,164
Do you want to hold my hand?

99
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,901
It was your fault
that we missed that bus, you know!

100
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,303
That's nice!

101
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,207
It was my fault!

102
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,676
Wow!

103
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,946
Here you go.

104
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,348
Thank you.

105
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,183
You're so thoughtful.

106
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,819
Well, having nice skin
is important for being a host.

107
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,621
- So it's for you?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,458
Wait, hang on.

109
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,063
SLIDE TO TURN OFF

110
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,568
SLIDE TO TURN OFF

111
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,276
<i>The last day has started.</i>

112
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,013
<i>Couples usually share an umbrella</i>
<i>on a rainy day,</i>

113
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,184
<i>but blocking the sun made</i>
<i>more sense for our relationship.</i>

114
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,593
It says Kainan Shrine.

115
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,861
I see…

116
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,463
- Hey, wait a minute!
- What?

117
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,831
Get back.

118
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,333
You have to bow first.

119
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,704
- You need to face that way.
- Oh, this way.

120
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,442
Yeah! This feels so good!

121
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,843
- No! Stop!
- What?

122
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,611
You can't do that!

123
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,613
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,856
Hang on.

125
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,358
It's two bows, two claps,
and then another bow.

126
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,293
What do you mean?

127
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:46,065
Put them together properly
and then make a wish.

128
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,869
Another bow at the end.

129
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,374
Well done.

130
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,877
Why so bossy?

131
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,981
Let's take this opportunity
to write down our wishes!

132
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,951
Wishes? I don't have any!

133
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,122
This is cute.

134
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,093
What did you write?

135
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,931
Third year…

136
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,566
What's this kanji?

137
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,635
- Hollyhock Class.
- Okay.

138
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,803
It's my homeroom class.

139
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:29,008
Under that, it says,
"I hope everyone passes the exam."

140
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,011
Okay. Me too, then.

141
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,047
Yes.

142
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,082
Good.

143
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,650
Like this.

144
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,653
No.

145
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,922
Think about the stroke order.

146
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,291
I forgot about the stroke order.

147
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,659
The "tree" part…

148
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,728
A diagonal line…

149
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,530
- And then, "mouth"…
- Straight.

150
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,265
Slow and steady.

151
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,834
There!

152
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,435
Well done, it looks good.

153
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,037
- And my name.
- Yes.

154
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,207
It's so narrow.

155
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,843
Dot.

156
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,045
- Write slowly.
- I'll be fine!

157
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,080
- Slowly.
- Line here, and then here.

158
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,749
TAIGA TAKAMORI

159
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,684
Yes! All done!

160
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,953
It looks great!

161
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,691
A pass in what?

162
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,794
Everything.

163
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,199
You're good at writing your name.

164
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,969
Especially the dots in this kanji.

165
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,604
They're perfectly balanced.

166
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,339
Yeah, right!

167
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,941
Right, let's hang them!

168
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,750
"For everyone to pass," huh?

169
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,153
You're a good teacher.

170
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,755
No, I'm not.

171
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,791
My students don't like me.

172
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,093
So, I wanted to write it
without them knowing.

173
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,562
They don't like you? Why?

174
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,699
I know. You hit them too often?

175
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,302
It's a girls' school!
I barely even get angry at them.

176
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,440
I make an effort to make
the classes interesting and…

177
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:10,876
I try to treat them all equally,
but they still don't like me.

178
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,414
- I WANT TO PASS TOO
- I HOPE EVERYONE PASSES

179
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,354
Wow! Okay, please come forward.

180
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,390
I'll pick you next.
We have many more to go!

181
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,325
- Geez! Look!
- Be patient, okay?

182
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,960
Wow, how stunning!

183
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,229
It's gorgeous!

184
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,932
I'm so thirsty!

185
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,767
Yeah, me too.

186
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,603
- Ta-da!
- Wow! What is it?

187
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,513
Here you go.

188
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,914
Thanks.

189
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,885
This is great! It's so cold!

190
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,720
I put it in the freezer.

191
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,491
As I was leaving, I was asked
where I was going because of it.

192
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,226
You said "on a date with a host"?

193
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,661
I could never!

194
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,004
You'll spill it.

195
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,610
- Here.
- Thank you.

196
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,184
You got it wrong.

197
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,020
What happened?

198
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,355
- This side?
- What?

199
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,223
No!

200
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,892
- Not that!
- What?

201
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,327
What you said about your students.

202
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,097
I think…

203
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,435
Maybe they don't like you
because you treat everyone fairly.

204
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,572
When I had just become a host,

205
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,376
I thought I needed to treat
all customers fairly.

206
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:56,816
Then, no one gets upset with you,
but you also don't get nominated much.

207
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,354
So my boss told me,
"You need some contrast!"

208
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,825
And I wasn't quite sure what he meant.

209
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,730
But I decided to just be aggressive
with those who seemed to like me,

210
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,966
and didn't give much attention
to the others.

211
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,669
And I suddenly became popular.

212
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:18,971
How come?

213
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,842
The ones who get
special treatment love it.

214
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,313
The ones who don't
start to want special treatment.

215
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,216
I see.

216
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,953
I don't exactly know why,

217
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,592
but I think people who are nice
to everyone seem fake.

218
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,496
I think you're right.

219
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,066
I was trying so hard not to be disliked.

220
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:53,506
But who am I to say?
I never went to school, so what do I know?

221
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,041
Did you want to go?

222
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,879
Sorry, did I upset you?

223
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,080
No, it's just…

224
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:07,419
You're the first person to ask me
if I wanted to go to school.

225
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,558
I always got told,

226
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,361
"Go to school!"

227
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,496
"You'll fall behind!"

228
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,633
"You won't make friends!",
"You won't go to high school!"

229
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,535
Nothing but threats.

230
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,503
I see…

231
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:26,705
But…

232
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,375
I actually really wanted to go.

233
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,579
That's why I couldn't go.

234
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,149
Doesn't make sense, does it?

235
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,451
I think I get it.

236
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,858
You wanted to have fun at school,

237
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:51,030
but you couldn't go
because you knew it was impossible?

238
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,201
Miss.

239
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,038
Why do you understand me so well?

240
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,775
Let's all go together!

241
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,276
Okay!

242
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,146
Take your water with you!

243
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,482
What are you doing?

244
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,388
Me! I know! Pick me!

245
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,656
Go ahead, Takamori.

246
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,860
Exactly!
This is what I wanted to do in school!

247
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:25,030
Raise my hand faster than anyone,
answer correctly, and look cool!

248
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,000
My classmates would say,
"Wow, you're awesome!"

249
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,103
And the teacher would praise me, too!

250
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,371
And all the girls

251
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,975
would look at me with hearts in their eyes
and tell me how amazing I am!

252
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,246
Who am I kidding?

253
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,349
It's so lame.

254
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,684
Not attractive at all.

255
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,186
Takamori!

256
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,555
You shouldn't sit on desks.

257
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,157
LET'S LEARN ABOUT THE OCEAN AND FOREST

258
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,195
It's not lame at all.

259
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,969
Okay. In that case,
tell me something lame about you.

260
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,006
Me? Everything about me is lame.

261
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,741
Yeah, I know, but…

262
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:14,780
Tell me the lamest thing you've ever done!
The worst of the worst!

263
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,651
Well…

264
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,089
I guess it has to be about my dating life.

265
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,558
Here we go.

266
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:33,032
I got so possessive of someone once
that I basically became a detective.

267
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,035
I wanted to know what he was doing 24/7.

268
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,971
So I checked his phone
and even stalked him.

269
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,141
He got annoyed, and he began to hate me.

270
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,678
He told me to kill myself.

271
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,380
What?

272
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,684
That's awful!

273
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,520
I mean, it's so childish!

274
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,456
There are countless better ways
to break up with women.

275
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,828
That's not the lamest thing
I've done, it's what came after that!

276
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,331
Alright! Here we go!

277
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,168
After he told me to kill myself,
I jumped into the sea to drown.

278
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:16,175
<i>It was so dark and suffocating</i>
<i>that after 30 seconds</i>

279
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,978
<i>I started screaming,</i>
<i>"Help! I don't want to die!"</i>

280
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,949
What do you think? Extremely lame, right?

281
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,487
Yeah, that's pretty lame.

282
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,189
I think you win.

283
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,328
- Were you able to catch a lot of fish?
- Yes!

284
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,964
- We need to go!
- What?

285
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,701
Once you're back in your seats,
please drink some water, okay?

286
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,237
- Your bag!
- Okay!

287
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,573
- Hello!
- Hello.

288
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,942
- Hi.
- I'm sorry for intruding!

289
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,545
- Not at all! Would you like to join us?
- No, thank you.

290
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,382
- We have seats!
- No, it's okay! Thank you.

291
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,685
Back to your seats!

292
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,761
<i>I'd never told anyone</i>
<i>that part of the story.</i>

293
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,332
<i>Him laughing it off, made me feel</i>
<i>light physically and mentally.</i>

294
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:18,937
<i>Before I knew it,</i>
<i>I had forgotten that it was our last day.</i>

295
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,077
This looks great.

296
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,079
- It smells great, too!
- Right?

297
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,352
I'm so hungry!

298
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,289
- Nice.
- Welcome!

299
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,558
- Have a seat here!
- Thank you.

300
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,429
- Welcome!
- Hi.

301
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,601
Let me pay. I'm older than you.

302
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:53,338
But I want to show off! As a man.

303
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,409
- That's kind of old-fashioned.
- Really?

304
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,345
All my princesses love it when I pay.

305
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,980
I see, that's nice.

306
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:04,650
Ms. Chihuahua, don't sulk!

307
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,453
This is the menu. Help yourself to water!

308
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,787
- Okay!
- Okay!

309
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,857
SEAFOOD RICE BOWL, SEAFOOD CURRY,
SASHIMI SET, TOASTED SANDWICH

310
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,629
Handwritten menus can be hard to read.

311
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,100
Excuse me. What do you recommend?

312
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,169
The seafood rice bowl and seafood curry!

313
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,472
- Seafood rice bowl, please!
- Okay.

314
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,173
- Curry for me, please.
- Sure!

315
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,909
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I did.

316
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:39,284
Like that and then…

317
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,788
Shall we ask for something to write?

318
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:43,989
What?

319
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,725
This symbolizes water…

320
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,563
And then there's a hair ornament
on top of the kanji for mother.

321
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,967
Wow. How can you write
so neatly upside down?

322
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,274
Learning the origin of the kanji
helps you remember them.

323
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,711
But why is there the word
for mother in "ocean"?

324
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,215
I don't see the connection
between the ocean and a mother.

325
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,621
It's because the ocean
is where everything flows into.

326
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:20,859
Soil, trees, remains of animals,
trash produced by humans.

327
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:26,031
The ocean accepts everything
just like a mother does.

328
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,602
Not all mothers are like that though.

329
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,071
My mom's the opposite.

330
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:37,276
She's the one who scatters trash.

331
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,046
But your mom seemed so happy
to see you the other day!

332
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,081
Because I'm a money tree.

333
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,785
- That's sad.
- I don't care.

334
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,254
She dates different guys one after another

335
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,857
and doesn't even tell me who my dad is.

336
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,193
Thanks.

337
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,131
You must be curious who your dad is.

338
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,400
Not really.

339
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,070
I bet he's a good-for-nothing anyway.

340
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,374
He's probably an insignificant person
unlike your dad.

341
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,911
My dad might be
an important person at work,

342
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,347
but he's just
an old-fashioned tyrant at home.

343
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,549
He's super unkind to my mom,

344
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,752
and he only respects successful people.

345
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,090
Sometimes I wish I had a kinder dad
who would listen to me.

346
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:28,860
I wouldn't care if we didn't have money.

347
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:35,434
If you really were poor,
you would never say that.

348
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,770
Rich people often say things like that.

349
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:44,476
It's like they're looking down
from above a garbage dump, saying,

350
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,514
"I'd like to see
what it's like down there once."

351
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:55,287
"I wonder how it smells.
I bet it smells, but I'm just curious!"

352
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:05,163
Oh, can I order a draft beer, please?

353
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,666
- Two, please.
- Sure!

354
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,016
Time to time, you shut yourself off
all of a sudden like that.

355
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:29,554
I don't know what you have
gone through in life.

356
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,157
I can never know.

357
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,161
But I've never pitied you.

358
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,098
You are so much stronger than I am
and much more mature!

359
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:44,002
- So stop acting like a child and--
- Are you lecturing me?

360
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,772
So annoying…

361
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,177
We're never going to meet again,
so let's just have fun, okay?

362
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:56,248
I'm telling you now
because it's my last chance to tell you.

363
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:02,454
Do you think that you can change me
or something?

364
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,823
It's impossible.

365
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,463
Not everyone can succeed in things
no matter how hard you try.

366
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,764
That's not true!

367
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,834
I think you can do
whatever you want if you try.

368
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,669
- Which is why…
- Here we go!

369
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:23,342
- Your son's very handsome.
- What?

370
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,344
Son?

371
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,246
I'm joking.

372
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,016
Lucky you to have such a young boyfriend!

373
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,784
- He's not my--
- Yes, I am.

374
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,621
But we're here to talk
about ending the relationship.

375
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,256
Really?

376
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,394
I guess the age gap can be troublesome,
but you can make it work!

377
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,730
We used to fight constantly,
but we're good now.

378
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,864
- Kinu!
- Yes?

379
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,100
Stop being nosy! Food's ready.

380
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,802
Can't tell who's older, right?

381
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,275
Cheers!

382
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,878
I guess not.

383
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:06,017
What?

384
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,986
A firework display?

385
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,054
FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

386
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,088
It's today!

387
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,223
No way!

388
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,860
- That was in 2019…
- Oh, that festival?

389
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:18,697
They haven't brought it back since COVID.
Here's your seafood curry!

390
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,500
- And your seafood rice bowl!
- Thank you.

391
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:26,638
If they bring it back in the future,
can I come here to see it?

392
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,473
Of course!

393
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,942
I will be by myself then, though.

394
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,680
<i>- A fireworks display we can never see.</i>
- Thanks.

395
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,317
<i>- I wish I hadn't seen the poster.</i>
- Oh, it's hot!

396
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,420
Ouch!

397
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,558
- Wow, that's hot!
- Hey, it's mine!

398
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,360
Can't I try it?

399
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,167
We have some
newly released machines today.

400
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:59,571
If you'd like to play them,
please ask one of the staff members.

401
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,943
Are you playing them one by one?

402
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,347
No, just keep the knob twisted
the whole time!

403
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,850
Don't twist it too far!

404
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,252
- Your personality is showing.
- What?

405
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,123
About this much.

406
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,792
That's it.

407
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,727
- See?
- Oh!

408
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,696
- Yes! Okay.
- Keep your hand on it!

409
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,665
- Yes!
- Don't you let go of it!

410
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,066
Roger that!

411
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,801
- Try aiming here. Good!
- I hit it!

412
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,036
Right here. Okay?

413
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,804
Looking good!

414
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,407
Keep going, Miss!

415
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,009
You're getting better!

416
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,147
I love you.

417
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,218
I don't want to go home.

418
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,188
Yes! Keep going!

419
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,591
FOUR YEN BALL X 27

420
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,229
Here, take one.

421
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,231
- Can I have two?
- Rules are rules.

422
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,366
You're right.

423
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,239
Thank you so much.

424
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,542
Wait, miss!

425
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,381
27 BALLS - 52 BALLS

426
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:17,282
Really?

427
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,850
Please take another one.

428
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,685
- But that's--
- Just take one.

429
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,121
Thank you!

430
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,267
NEW MACHINE DEBUT

431
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:07,999
Huh?

432
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:26,484
Strange…

433
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,756
<i>It was nice to have someone</i>
<i>looking for me.</i>

434
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:38,263
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to secretly follow him forever.</i>

435
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,973
You're not very good at this.
Did you panic?

436
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,576
- Not at all!
- Hmm?

437
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,344
- Let go of me.
- Hey, wait a minute.

438
00:27:26,411 --> 00:27:29,848
- Hey, can you please--
- Did you panic when you lost sight of me?

439
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:32,751
I did.

440
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,253
Good.

441
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,959
Here. I got prizes for both of us.

442
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:41,960
Wow!

443
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,162
Thank you.

444
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,602
I left my UV umbrella!

445
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,304
At the restaurant?

446
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:55,874
Never mind.

447
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,043
Instead of an umbrella…

448
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,587
- I don't think this suits me.
- Hang on.

449
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,157
How about this?

450
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,995
That's it!

451
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:18,863
I think so.

452
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:20,565
What about you?

453
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:22,500
- Hats don't suit me.
- Come on!

454
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,704
It doesn't look that bad.

455
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:30,341
Okay, maybe not this one but…

456
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,243
How about this one?

457
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,547
You look like a kid!

458
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,317
Now you look old!

459
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,586
- Give me a break!
- Not that you're old!

460
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,456
Your head looks big in this one.

461
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,057
The hat's too small!

462
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:46,958
There!

463
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,095
Stop being so mean!

464
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,698
You can stop laughing, too!

465
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,268
This is the one!

466
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,406
See? It looks so good on you.

467
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,610
Excuse me. Can we buy these?

468
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,911
Sure thing!

469
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,781
Give me one second.

470
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,350
- What?
- Excuse me.

471
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,993
I'm guessing it's just past 4:00 p.m.

472
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,762
You can tell?

473
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,632
I can tell from how low the tide is.

474
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,705
Whenever my mom brought me here,

475
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,909
she told me I needed
to wait until 5:00 p.m.

476
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,618
And I waited patiently for her.

477
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,721
I see.

478
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,565
- Do it with me.
- What?

479
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,815
Sit here.

480
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:19,250
Thank you so much.

481
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:28,793
Can school trips last until the evening?

482
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,963
Not usually, no.

483
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,068
Before we part…

484
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,040
Do you want to write a short essay
about this trip?

485
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:03,995
I'll write it here.

486
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,870
Like this?

487
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,205
A line here and straight…

488
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,908
Straight…

489
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,881
Wait. Hang on.

490
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,983
What's next?

491
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,739
And then to the left, I think?

492
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,877
Done!

493
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:56,147
TAKE CARE MISS

494
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,758
You should add some punctuation marks.

495
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,303
- Makes sense.
- Yeah?

496
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,607
- This is called a comma.
- Okay.

497
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,542
It means the sentence will continue.

498
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,044
- A comma.
- Yes.

499
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,748
TAKE CARE, MISS.

500
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,483
This is a period.

501
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,086
- A period.
- It marks the end of a sentence.

502
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:42,327
So we're putting a period
on our relationship after today?

503
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,664
Yes.

504
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,237
I had so much fun!

505
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,541
My first ever date.

506
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,043
First ever?

507
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,879
- There's no way!
- It's true!

508
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:06,985
I've met so many women in my life,
but I've never been on a date.

509
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,887
I'm honored.

510
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,423
Hard to believe, huh?

511
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,894
I've dined with over a hundred women,

512
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:18,629
had drinks with them,

513
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,833
and kissed them.

514
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,440
Which is why I won't kiss you.

515
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,911
My lips are filthy.

516
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,447
- Super gross.
- That's not true!

517
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,383
It's okay.

518
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:39,917
I've accepted myself.

519
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,955
I'd say anything to increase my sales.

520
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,430
"Wow! You are especially cute today!
Your lips are so plump!"

521
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:56,801
"I know, let's make this
a special evening for us."

522
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,604
"I dreamt about you last night."

523
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:05,777
"There's a new restaurant
that I want to go to with you!

524
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:09,347
Shall we go now? Or maybe tomorrow?"

525
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:17,088
"If you'll buy me some champagne,
I can spend the night with you!

526
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:20,958
Because I have to reciprocate your love!"

527
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,997
Why are you crying?

528
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,267
I know it's weird.

529
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,803
Were you moved by my performance?

530
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,604
I'm sorry, I don't even know why!

531
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,554
Miss.

532
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,323
Want to run away with me?

533
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,161
An escape?

534
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:05,303
We can move to an unknown town
and live in a shabby apartment together.

535
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,506
Does it have to be shabby?

536
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:11,075
I'm a bit of a neat freak.

537
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,810
We won't have a choice!

538
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:16,981
You'll lose your job
because you ran off with a stupid host,

539
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:22,653
be disowned by your rich parents,
abandoned by your wonderful fiancé.

540
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:29,393
I will also be sacked from the club
and won't be able to pay my debts.

541
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,129
So we have to run away.

542
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:36,267
We'll need to get part-time jobs
to make money!

543
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,470
You're right.

544
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:44,842
I know, you can work
as a cashier at a supermarket.

545
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,746
And I can work at a construction site.

546
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,316
Are you sure? You'll get beaten up
for using a UV umbrella!

547
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,085
I'll have no choice!

548
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,855
The neighbors will be so suspicious.

549
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:02,326
"The woman's so much older.
Are they a couple or…"

550
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,396
"Maybe they are criminals on the run!"

551
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:10,234
People will gossip,
and they'll start throwing stones at us.

552
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,704
Even the dogs in the neighborhood
will start barking at us!

553
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,875
That sounds like a terrible escape!

554
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,279
But it'll be fun!

555
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:29,453
I'm sure that terrible would be fun.

556
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,804
I told you, I won't kiss you.

557
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,940
Yes. Sorry.

558
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:17,368
<i>A train is approaching.</i>

559
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:21,639
<i>Please stand behind the yellow line.</i>

560
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,709
You should go first.

561
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,614
I'll take the next train.

562
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,730
- Let's say goodbye now.
- What?

563
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,402
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

564
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,139
Okay.

565
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,245
Take care.

566
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,782
- You too.
- Yeah.

567
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,224
Go ahead.

568
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,063
- I will.
- Okay.

569
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,135
Go already!

570
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,275
I know.

571
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,546
Let's turn around…

572
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,716
at the same time.

573
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:12,683
Okay.

574
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,585
No looking back, okay?

575
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,754
Okay.

576
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,026
Ready? Go!

577
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:55,326
Miss!

578
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:59,423
MIURA BEACH

579
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,120
MISSED CALLS

580
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,289
What on earth…

581
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,290
What?

582
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,425
<i>Reality came crashing down on me.</i>

583
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,130
<i>The school called so many times.</i>

584
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:17,201
<i>Did you not go</i>
<i>with Mr. Kawahara to Miura Beach?</i>

585
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:26,243
<i>We received a call from a parent asking</i>
<i>about your relationship with the host.</i>

586
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,346
<i>Ms. Sawaguchi saw you</i>
<i>with him at the school gate.</i>

587
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:43,727
Kaoru from THE JOKER.

588
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:48,933
Who are you?

589
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:52,469
I'm Manami Ogawa's fiancé.

590
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:03,480
Why are you here?

591
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:09,453
Manami’s mother said
she was at Miura Beach, so I waited here.

592
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,491
Because I am her fiancé.

593
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,128
Yeah, you already told me.

594
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:26,804
Was it fun to steal
and toy with another man's woman?

595
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,308
Toy with?

596
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,078
It's not like that.

597
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:35,179
No.

598
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,748
You were together all day.

599
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,651
You expect me to believe nothing happened?

600
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,254
Hey.

601
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,291
You're sounding like a jerk right now.

602
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,127
It's called seductive marketing, right?

603
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,630
To make them pay more at the club,

604
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:55,833
you use sweet talk
to make them fall for you,

605
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,337
and make them obsessed through sex.

606
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,574
You're disgusting.

607
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,475
What?

608
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:08,746
Your fiancé isn't that type of woman.

609
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,148
What do you know?

610
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,118
- All you think about is money!
- Yeah, so what?

611
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:18,022
I am a host through and through.

612
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,824
I'll do anything
to make my princesses happy.

613
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:25,029
Perhaps I can teach you a few things?

614
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,534
Hey!

615
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,369
Here!

616
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,390
Ouch.

617
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,203
<i>Love is like a sweet dream.</i>

618
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,306
Hello? It's Ogawa!

619
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,709
I'm so sorry! I'll head there right away!

620
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,752
<i>Love makes people do stupid things.</i>

621
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,624
Can you open the door?

622
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,360
There you go.

623
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,062
- Thanks!
- I'll take that.

624
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,298
The wind is so strong!

625
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:35,699
- Hey, Kinu.
- What?

626
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,167
I think someone forgot that.

627
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,238
It's that couple's!

628
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,207
Oh, yeah.

629
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,276
They'll come and get it someday.

630
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:55,152
TAKE CARE, MISS.

631
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,192
Is it true that you're dating
a host from Kabukicho?

632
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,161
<i> I had actually fallen for him.</i>

633
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,796
<i>Kaoru is hospitalized.</i>

634
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:06,864
Hospitalized?

635
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,899
<i>Don't call me anymore, okay? Bye.</i>

636
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:13,904
THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS

637
