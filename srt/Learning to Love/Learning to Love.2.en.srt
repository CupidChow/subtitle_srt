1
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:10,377
I met the worst guy I've ever met.

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:11,411
Princess!

3
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,747
Promiscuous and frivolous.

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,115
Ms. Sawaguchi!

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,818
I don't even want to say
I've met him, to be honest.

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,621
It was more like
we bumped into each other.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:24,791
Goodbye.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,296
This is the last day of your detention.

9
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:35,235
From next Monday,
please go to your normal classes.

10
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:36,936
What…

11
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,807
happened to him?

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,743
Him?

13
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,281
The host? You need to forget about him.

14
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,951
Please tell me he wasn't arrested…

15
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,122
or fired from his job because of me.

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,261
If you want to remain a student here,

17
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:03,663
stop thinking about him.

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,366
Understood?

19
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,602
My apologies.

20
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,805
Understood?

21
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,410
Ms. Sawaguchi.

22
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,480
Don't worry.

23
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,949
We didn't report him.

24
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,118
Really?

25
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:29,522
But I had to make that host
called Kaoru write a signed promise.

26
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,025
Your mom and dad requested it.

27
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,528
He promised that
he will never see you again.

28
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,299
-What?
-Let's move on and prepare for the exams.

29
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,301
Hilarious.

30
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,174
Why should I do the right thing?

31
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,580
Once you get into the university
of your choice and start a new life,

32
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,416
I'm sure you'll be able
to forget about him.

33
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,017
You're sure?

34
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,089
How can you say that?

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,391
You know nothing about Kaoru!

36
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:06,826
I do, actually.

37
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,563
He's a host.

38
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,333
He gets paid to entertain women.

39
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,801
There's no way he actually cares…

40
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,371
-Ouch!
-Hey, Ms. Sawaguchi!

41
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,141
Wait.

42
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:22,775
Ms. Sawaguchi.

43
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,881
Sorry, let me through!

44
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,649
Sorry, I need to get through!

45
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,085
-Sorry!
-Sorry, please let me through!

46
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,455
Sorry.

47
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,422
Ms. Sawaguchi!

48
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,095
This month marks
the 10th anniversary of THE JOKER!

49
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,263
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

50
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,864
If you rank first this month,

51
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,168
you'll receive three million yen
from our president!

52
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,036
-Wow!
-Thank you!

53
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:53,006
I will announce the results as of now.

54
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:57,410
The top three are, as usual,
Tsubasa, Hiroto, and Island, but…

55
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,846
-But?
-We have a new face in the top ten.

56
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,449
Is it me? It must be me! It's me!

57
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,518
Kaoru! Congratulations!

58
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,187
Oh, it's Kaoru.

59
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,354
-Kaoru!
-Me?

60
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,124
He said Kaoru! Me? Really?

61
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,859
Yes!

62
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,763
Yeah! I did it! I'm in the top ten!

63
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,065
Congratulations.

64
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,200
Listen up.

65
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,270
They say that the competitive society
is over. But disagree.

66
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,706
Competition makes people grow the most.

67
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,243
Have the best time out there today!

68
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,444
-Yes!
-Thank you!

69
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,314
Thank you!

70
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,084
You shouldn't count on that
high school teacher.

71
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,888
They tend to have their guard up
and are often stingy.

72
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:45,491
I'll make her my top customer
with my skills.

73
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:51,497
"The host who got stabbed
used some pushy sales tactics."

74
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,468
What does "pushy sales tactics" mean?
It needs to be more specific.

75
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,605
The hosts I interviewed
were quite tight-lipped.

76
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,242
It's a host club, so I guess
they give customers an extortionate bill.

77
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,478
I heard some clubs even arrange

78
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,781
for customers who can't pay
to work at a brothel.

79
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,050
Did you fact-check that?

80
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,054
Sorry, I'll check again to be sure.

81
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,126
There's no way we can regain viewers
if we issue false reports!

82
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,295
-Yes.
-Okay, next!

83
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,632
I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING!

84
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,767
-The topic on heatstroke.
-Yes.

85
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,403
-Do you have the materials?
-Yes.

86
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,072
-Oh, gosh…
-Sorry. This one?

87
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,376
-Hurry or we'll be here until morning!
-Sorry.

88
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,545
What's up? I'm busy right now.

89
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,748
Oh, I'm sorry! I'll keep it short.

90
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,317
You took that host,
Kaoru's business card, right?

91
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,185
Do you have his number?

92
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:50,189
Oh, so you are curious about him.
You should've been honest!

93
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,837
Go!

94
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:09,042
-Go on! You can do it!
-Go!

95
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,011
Hello?

96
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,180
Mr. Takamori?

97
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,749
Who's this?

98
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,718
I'm Ogawa from Pietas Girls' School.

99
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,988
Oh, Ms. Chihuahua! What's up?

100
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,192
Well… Has Natsuki been to see you?

101
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,897
I haven't seen her
or talked to her since that time.

102
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,166
You made me promise not to, remember?

103
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,336
Are you telling the truth?

104
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,738
You don't believe me?

105
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,640
It's normal not to.

106
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,644
Did something happen?

107
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,146
I can't tell you the details.

108
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:53,319
If Natsuki contacts you,
could you tell her to call me?

109
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,522
If you tell me what happened.

110
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,661
Never mind then!
I need to go, this is an emergency!

111
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,663
Sorry, Miss!

112
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,498
Sorry!

113
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,799
I'm sorry!

114
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,468
We cannot apologize enough.

115
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,204
We sincerely apologize for the oversight.

116
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,440
We have raised Natsuki
with unconditional love.

117
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,977
No matter how busy our work was, we--

118
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,281
We always put Natsuki first.

119
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,784
-If anything happens, how--
-Excuse me!

120
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,919
What are you doing? Sit back down!

121
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,522
-Ms. Ogawa!
-Ogawa! Stop right there!

122
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,490
Come back!

123
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,491
Hello?

124
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,894
Miss? Have you found Natsuki?

125
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,529
What?

126
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,465
She's been missing, right?

127
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,536
I'll tell you where she is, so come over.

128
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:57,383
Nope! You need it to be smoother.

129
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,720
-Like this. Yeah, flowy like that!
-Like this?

130
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,355
Exactly.

131
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,627
Ms. Sawaguchi!

132
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,369
Miss.

133
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,971
-Can you do this?
-What?

134
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,009
Throw it up high…

135
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,410
Welcome!

136
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,816
I was practicing this.

137
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,722
Ready? Throw it up high and…

138
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,193
Oh no. Not even close.

139
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,365
It's so good!

140
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,867
So tasty.

141
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,702
What's so funny?

142
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,041
See you, Miss.

143
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,543
Sorry for calling,
but it was an emergency.

144
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,549
-Hang on a minute!
-What?

145
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,952
I didn't ask you to find her!

146
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,721
So annoying, just say you found her.

147
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,257
-Hey, but…
-Miss.

148
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,696
Kaoru told me something.

149
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,500
The thing is…

150
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,806
My love can only be bought with money.

151
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,741
Natsuki.

152
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,178
Go to a good university and become rich.

153
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,216
And then you can come buy my love.

154
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,665
Miss…

155
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,102
Do you know what my mom often says?

156
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,815
A mother's love…

157
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,919
is unconditional.

158
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,160
Which is more valuable?

159
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,629
Bought love or…

160
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,335
We will never know.

161
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:32,905
What?

162
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,743
You didn't say unconditional love.

163
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,149
I misjudged you.

164
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,186
Try this.

165
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,907
Ready? Throw it up high and…

166
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,442
Welcome! Oops!

167
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,339
Here you go.

168
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:42,975
Thank you.

169
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,748
I'd never laughed with a student before.

170
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,018
I felt just a bit more accepted.

171
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,555
What? Hang on.

172
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,925
Does this mean he helped me?

173
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,206
Miss?

174
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,489
Want some?

175
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,780
I got you a present!

176
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,482
To celebrate my divorce?

177
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,452
-Let's drink it.
-A housewarming gift!

178
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,456
It's so messy already, though.

179
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,559
I don't live with a mom like you do,
who cleans for me!

180
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,760
Ouch.

181
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,163
Did you see Kaoru again?

182
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,398
Kaoru?

183
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,835
He's kind of cute.

184
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,171
He's around 22, 23 years old, right?

185
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,677
But more mature than me in some ways.

186
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,546
Really?

187
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,984
Speak of the devil, is it Kaoru?

188
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,420
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm a teacher, remember?

189
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,688
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

190
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,555
CAN WE TRY AGAIN?

191
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,790
It's Mr. Kawahara.

192
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,992
Are you officially engaged?

193
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:41,961
I called it off.

194
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,130
Why?

195
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,235
He had this image of me as a kind,
earnest and naive teacher.

196
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:53,239
Well, that's kind of suffocating.

197
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,641
I told him the whole story.

198
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,614
About how I got dumped, became a stalker,

199
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,316
and even got fired from work.

200
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,554
I thought it would scare him off…

201
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,125
but he wants to try again.

202
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,228
You don't want to?

203
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,731
You thought about marrying him once.

204
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,138
I think he's the best
kind of man to marry.

205
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,606
But…

206
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,709
I don't feel excited!

207
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,446
I thought it would be disrespectful
to marry him like this.

208
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,449
I think it's fine.

209
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,754
He might feel the same way about you.

210
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,855
I see…

211
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,024
You're surprisingly
narcissistic sometimes.

212
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,492
-Hey!
-Take that side.

213
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,128
-No, the other way!
-Sorry.

214
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,967
Invite him here!

215
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,336
Kawahara or whatever his name is.

216
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,805
I'll check him out for you.

217
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,773
What?

218
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,408
Okay, okay.

219
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,911
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

220
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,150
You made good money today!

221
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,952
You could definitely make number one!

222
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,021
Not in front of the princess. Bad manners.

223
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,556
-You'll bring bad luck.
-Sorry.

224
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,426
Table A!

225
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,597
Our princess is visiting! Welcome!

226
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,265
Welcome!

227
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,106
Please have a seat.

228
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,009
Thank you for coming, Ms. Akina.

229
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,144
No, the pleasure's mine.

230
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,246
Bring one more of this.

231
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,781
Geez, that'll be over five million yen.

232
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,950
A first-time customer requested you.

233
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:46,652
How does she look?

234
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,488
Older lady, but she looks rich.

235
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,423
That's amazing!

236
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,325
-Keep Akane company, okay?
-Okay!

237
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:58,631
-Hey, where are you going? Don't go!
-Woah! It's okay, I'm not going anywhere.

238
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,434
-Look! It's okay, he's here instead!
-No! Kaoru!

239
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:04,770
Go to sleep

240
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,605
Understood, thank you.

241
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,806
Excuse me.

242
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,242
Welcome to JOKER!

243
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,912
Nice to meet you, Kaoru.

244
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,483
It's a nice club. So new and stylish!

245
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,618
Why are you here? You need to leave.

246
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,187
-What? At least buy me a drink!
-Scary hag!

247
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,591
-See you!
-You scared me again!

248
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,861
Are you mad at me?

249
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,363
I only came to say thank you
for the other day.

250
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,099
Bullshit, you just want more money.

251
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,968
Sorry.

252
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:40,139
Yuki's treatment cost has gone up again.

253
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,777
Thanks to the politicians, Japan's doomed.

254
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,111
I couldn't care less.

255
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,447
Why can't his dad pay it?

256
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,685
His hair salon's not doing well.

257
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,555
During the COVID pandemic,
he lost a lot of customers.

258
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,491
It's all because of the politicians.

259
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:00,893
Not my problem.

260
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,696
He's not my dad.

261
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,499
But he's Yuki's dad!

262
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,768
And he's your precious young brother!

263
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,505
Hey, wait!

264
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,445
I'll get the money, so wait.

265
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,579
Don't come inside.

266
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,348
Thank you!

267
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,683
You're the only person I can rely on!

268
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,252
Number one!

269
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,488
Yeah!

270
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,391
I am so lucky!

271
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,494
Good evening.

272
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,196
Got right to it…

273
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,949
Make sure to close it.

274
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
Hey, Kawahara or whatever your name is.

275
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,019
Yes.

276
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,420
Why do you like Manami?

277
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,521
What?

278
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,659
Do you want some?

279
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,262
Oh, no thanks. I drove here.

280
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:14,433
Manami called off the engagement,
yet you still want to try?

281
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,567
Momoko!

282
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,871
You fell for her right away
and don't want to lose her?

283
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,473
-No, that can't be it.
-What?

284
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,410
Is it because your parents
know each other?

285
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,546
Or because you've already told
your work you're getting married?

286
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,283
You're being rude not to me, but to her!

287
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,820
I want Manami to get her happy ending.

288
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,922
-At all costs.
-Hey.

289
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,159
You heard about how she stalked
a guy who dumped her, yes?

290
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,629
I'm the one…

291
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,665
that took him from her.

292
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,769
No, that's not what happened!

293
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,473
She didn't know about me
when she started seeing him.

294
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,042
Mr. Kawahara, she's a rare gem.

295
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,045
A normal person
would cut ties, but not her!

296
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,182
I dumped the jerk right away, but…

297
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,984
I promised then that I'll protect
Manami until I die!

298
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,920
That's so over the top.

299
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:08,887
I guess.

300
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,589
Okay.

301
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,426
-No, you sit over there.
-What? Yeah.

302
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,661
-Excuse me.
-No worries.

303
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,063
And?

304
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,364
-What?
-And?

305
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,632
Oh, yeah.

306
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,804
I mean, our relationship
is nowhere near you two's.

307
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,943
But I want to be with Manami.

308
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,180
I can't exactly say
what I like about her yet.

309
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:42,454
But you're an honest person,
and I thought I could trust you.

310
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,423
You know…

311
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,729
My workplace is full of people
who deceive others with a smile.

312
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,499
I see.

313
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,634
Yes.

314
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,269
-What do you think, Manami?
-Huh?

315
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,846
-A big! Thank you! To Ms. Akina!
-Yeah!

316
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,015
Thank you!

317
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,051
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

318
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,521
Thank you for this. Cheers.

319
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,655
Excuse me.

320
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,027
You're good-looking.

321
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:22,928
Thank you.

322
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,331
Sorry, I was talking to this one.

323
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:27,900
Thank you, I'm honored.

324
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,301
What's your name?

325
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,103
My name's Kaoru.

326
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,406
Excuse me.

327
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,774
All right.

328
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,276
Here you go.

329
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,978
He looks promising.

330
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,848
You have a great eye.

331
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,717
He’s on a roll recently
and made it to the top ten.

332
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,086
Please root for him.

333
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,123
Are you sure you'll be fine with that?

334
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,759
Of course, I'll be jealous.

335
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,894
However…

336
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,566
You supporting him
will make me love you more.

337
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,334
So please.

338
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,775
It's okay, love needs its challenges.

339
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,744
Let's go on a date sometime, Kaoru.

340
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,580
Thank you.

341
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,683
But you are Tsubasa's princess.

342
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:21,620
I can't accept, as we have a permanent
designation system. I'm sorry.

343
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:37,302
But Tsubasa insisted
so it won't be a huge issue.

344
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,337
Yes, but…

345
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,340
I'll pay the penalty fee if I have to.

346
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,141
Hey, stop that!

347
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,643
-Right?
-Of course.

348
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,214
Please serve her well.
And don't be disrespectful.

349
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,984
Okay?

350
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,719
Hey.

351
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:02,027
I should tell you
about my past relationships too, right?

352
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,230
I'm a bit afraid to know.

353
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,498
You shouldn't be.

354
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,166
I don't have any.

355
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,535
What?

356
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,471
I've been told,

357
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:18,176
"I don’t dislike you,
but our personalities don’t match."

358
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,279
Or….

359
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:25,484
"I don't think we want
the same things for the future."

360
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,922
I wish they were more direct
and told me that they just don't like me!

361
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,858
I wanted to confront them.

362
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,766
So, you mean until now

363
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:46,038
there was no one else
you thought about getting married to?

364
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,307
You're the first one.

365
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:53,111
Actually, I feel really shy.

366
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,823
Can we go see your parents right now?

367
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,493
I want to seal the deal
before you change your mind.

368
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:10,996
-Okay.
-Yeah.

369
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,933
Okay, I'll go find a parking space.

370
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,273
I thought about
if I could see myself kissing him.

371
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,677
The thought didn't make me
want to run away.

372
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,848
I guess it's better for me this way.

373
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,050
There!

374
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,419
Hello. Nice to meet you.

375
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,520
Welcome!

376
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:39,725
-Hey, thank you for coming!
-I'm sorry for coming over so suddenly.

377
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,128
I'm so happy that Manami
was able to meet such a lovely…

378
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,464
-Just get the chair. Come on in.
-Oh, yes.

379
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:47,399
Thank you.

380
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:51,470
-I feel very fortunate to have met Manami.
-Please sit.

381
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,172
It's the first time
I truly appreciated my dad.

382
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,909
I'm glad he sat next to me
at the reunion party.

383
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,881
We were talking and realized we both
had a kid over thirty who was single!

384
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,950
My dad told me.

385
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,852
Let me just say this.

386
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,553
Manami is truly a great girl.

387
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,689
You have to say that!

388
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,525
It's embarrassing, isn't it?

389
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,327
Embarrassing? Why?

390
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,196
Parents should praise their kids.

391
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:21,433
Stop agreeing with people
without your own opinion.

392
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,937
I'm sorry. It's a bad habit of mine.

393
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:30,041
Manami has always been kind
and diligent since she was a child.

394
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:35,180
But my wife was overprotective of her,
so she can be a bit naive.

395
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:39,084
For a 35-year-old,
she can be too innocent for her own good.

396
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:45,123
Anyway, I want you to protect her
so she won't get hurt.

397
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:52,964
I was first attracted to Manami
because of how pure she is.

398
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,870
I've met many pompous,
condescending women.

399
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,807
She's a gem of a person.

400
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,645
I will give my all to protect her.

401
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,882
I'm so happy for you!

402
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,386
You guys are very lucky.
Start making plans.

403
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,921
Thank you.

404
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,024
I was thinking of going to see
the rings next week.

405
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,925
Good.

406
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,160
What do you think?

407
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,362
Manami.

408
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,730
What? Oh yes!

409
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,967
Actually, I booked us an appointment
at a jewelry shop.

410
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,405
Oh my, how wonderful! I'm envious of you!

411
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,074
Bankers take pride
in getting things done quickly.

412
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,878
Yes. The corporate sales department
deals with first section market companies.

413
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,980
-So speed is very important.
-I bet.

414
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,515
Sorry to talk about work.

415
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,750
I guess this is what happiness is like.

416
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,652
I can't complain.

417
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,921
I am happy.

418
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,990
Very happy.

419
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,859
-Thank you.
-Eat whatever you like.

420
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,360
Are you sure it's okay?

421
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,731
I could get banned
from the business, right?

422
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,566
Normally, yes.

423
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,201
However…

424
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,238
If the host and his princess agree,
it's allowed.

425
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,540
And Tsubasa wants you to take her on.

426
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,774
How come?

427
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,143
She's his top patron!

428
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,379
You can imagine.

429
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:18,517
Well, I've heard rumors.

430
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,786
She spends a lot of money on you,

431
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,256
but she demands meetings in private too.

432
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,761
Does this mean Tsubasa dumped her on me?

433
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,399
Okay then.

434
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:36,801
I accept.

435
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,872
Kaoru, aren't you
pushing yourself too much?

436
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,174
I'll never make number one if I don't.

437
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,681
You need to enjoy your job
to continue working as a host.

438
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:53,752
You've been in this business
for a long time, right?

439
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,821
I had no choice
but to keep working in this industry.

440
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,757
What do you mean?

441
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,563
You don't need to know.

442
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,167
-Pay for his meal, okay?
-Ouch.

443
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:21,413
Decide which university
to apply to before the summer break.

444
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:26,351
Whatever you decide, I will support you.

445
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,654
Ask me anything, okay?

446
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,157
CAREER PATH SURVEY

447
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,659
Okay.

448
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,400
Okay next,
the parent-teacher-student meeting…

449
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:47,305
Ms. Sawaguchi looks like a weight
has been lifted from her shoulders.

450
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,542
What did you say to her?

451
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,744
Nothing much.

452
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,046
I had no right to say anything.

453
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,851
You seem to have
come out of your shell more too.

454
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,287
I've decided on my path.

455
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:05,890
Pineapple!

456
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,326
-That's what you meant!
-Yes. Ready?

457
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,061
Rock-paper-scissors, go!

458
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,262
Um…

459
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,531
Glico!

460
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,166
Just three steps?

461
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,836
-That's no good!
-Why?

462
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,138
Did you use to play sports?

463
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,607
Sports? Hm…

464
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,242
I used to dance.

465
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,310
-Dance?
-Yes.

466
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,412
-Wow!
-Wow?

467
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,780
The green one too, please.

468
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,115
Of course.

469
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,585
The length of your inseam is 99cm!

470
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,289
This'll look good too.

471
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,825
Wow. Thank you.

472
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,766
But I'm concerned about the price…

473
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,770
The clothes will be happy to be worn
by someone who looks good in them.

474
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,372
Pick out a shirt and tie too.

475
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,707
Of course!

476
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,543
-Ms. Akina.
-Yes?

477
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,744
Are you sure?

478
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,015
Tsubasa acts like he's doing me
a favor by letting me buy stuff.

479
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,950
Previous one was better.

480
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,385
I see.

481
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:12,724
After this, we should go to the shop
in the hotel and see their watches.

482
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,162
Welcome.

483
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,399
Watch your step.

484
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,268
Oh?

485
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,572
Would you look at that?

486
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,980
Wow… This is amazing.

487
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,051
It looks so high-class.

488
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,721
I've never come to such place.

489
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,858
Oh, after you.

490
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,229
-It's so cool.
-Thank you.

491
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,032
I feel so good!

492
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,436
Being with someone like you
increases my status.

493
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,938
Really?

494
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:04,642
I mean, it's too predictable
if I'm with a rich middle-aged man.

495
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,547
I want to be unpredictable by being
with young handsome men like you

496
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,183
even if they don't have money
or high social status.

497
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,319
Thank you.

498
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,521
Welcome.

499
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:20,325
I'm Kawahara. I have an appointment
regarding engagement rings.

500
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,427
Okay. This way, please.

501
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,232
What do you think about this one, Kaoru?

502
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,167
-What?
-Well?

503
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,203
I feel bad…

504
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,105
Is something wrong?

505
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,508
-Nope!
-I'm getting kind of hungry…

506
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,612
Well, we're officially engaged now.

507
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:42,847
Yes, we are.

508
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,150
Um…

509
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,386
About tonight…

510
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,323
I've actually reserved
a room at this hotel.

511
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:56,761
Sorry to surprise you,
and I get it if you don't want to…

512
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:57,862
I'm okay.

513
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:04,936
What does that mean?
No thanks, I'm okay, or okay as in…

514
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,105
The latter.

515
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,743
Sorry to keep you waiting.

516
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,789
Sorry, can we get on?

517
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,825
Thank you.

518
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,536
It's so fast it's kind of scary!

519
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,938
True…

520
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,673
Lovely weather.

521
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,308
-What?
-What?

522
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,376
After you.

523
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,056
Wow…

524
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,199
It's kind of…

525
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:10,869
hot in here, huh?

526
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,076
I feel a bit nervous.

527
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,913
-Let's get some room service!
-Okay.

528
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,748
Cool. The menu is…

529
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,985
Where is it?

530
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,922
This is for the spa,
a menu for facial treatments…

531
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,359
-Safety instructions…
-I found the menu!

532
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,295
Oh great! Thank you.

533
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,498
The curry's good here.

534
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,736
-Or so I've heard.
-I see.

535
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,638
Look, it comes with a salad.

536
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,140
You know a lot about this place.

537
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,142
-What?
-I'll have the curry then!

538
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,545
Oh wait!

539
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,514
Please stop!

540
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,450
-Wait… huh? Oh, no!
-Ouch!

541
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,985
Ouch…

542
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,322
That's a lot.

543
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:07,292
Ouch…

544
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,061
These look amazing!

545
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,197
It's only been a few years
since I've been able to afford

546
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,133
a life like this, you know?

547
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:17,101
I was poor when I was young.

548
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,472
It was always my dream
to have room service

549
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,275
at a hotel with someone I like.

550
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,846
I will follow your example
and work hard too.

551
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,384
I want to know more about you.

552
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:34,886
How old are you?

553
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,087
I'm 23 years old.

554
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,490
You're so young. What about education?

555
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,427
Many hosts recently
have a university degree.

556
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:45,229
I didn't even go to high school.

557
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,865
I see. And that's fine, you know.

558
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,501
The reason I go to the host club

559
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:54,672
is because I like seeing men
competing against each other

560
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:59,610
in a world where their academic background
or parents' jobs don't matter at all.

561
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,512
I see.

562
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:10,288
Come here, Kaoru.

563
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,690
Aren't we eating this? It'll get cold!

564
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,727
We need to have a drink first.

565
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,405
What are we doing at our age?

566
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,911
Can I go home?

567
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:40,218
It was all so sudden
and women need mental preparation!

568
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,352
You're right.

569
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,657
Let's make a fresh start.
We have a lot of time.

570
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,031
-Ouch!
-Are you okay?

571
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:05,209
Cheers to our evening!

572
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,757
Why are you being so timid? You're a host.

573
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:24,362
Are you crying for help internally
because I'm too old for you?

574
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,197
No, not at all.

575
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,500
I'm not planning to eat you alive.

576
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,136
You look so anxious…

577
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,572
Screw you!

578
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:46,350
You don't have a bright
and promising future ahead.

579
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:50,788
You should earn as much
as you can while you're still young.

580
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,423
However…

581
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,259
Money isn't free.

582
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:04,102
What do you think I went through
to get to this point in life?

583
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,982
I'll see you at the club again.

584
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,987
If you want to be number one,
you'll need to give it your all.

585
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,861
I ordered a chateaubriand steak.

586
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,964
Sign for it and eat it before you leave.

587
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,126
Hey. Didn't I see you in here before?

588
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,529
I believe so.

589
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,138
It's me.

590
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,807
I thought you had a date tonight?

591
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,511
Come to the usual hotel.

592
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,580
Did she dump you?

593
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,616
I'm sort of bored with their curry.

594
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,553
I'm greedy!

595
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,656
-Chateaubriand 150g.
-I need to date two people.

596
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,791
-Okay.
-I need the excitement!

597
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:38,462
In order to maintain her happiness,
I need to keep seeing you,

598
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:43,367
and to see you,
I need someone I can call my wife!

599
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,604
It reeks.

600
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,574
Sign this receipt, please.

601
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:51,909
Right here.

602
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,145
My signature?

603
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,112
Yes.

604
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,552
My real name?

605
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:02,720
Yes.

606
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,768
Thank you. Please enjoy your stay.

607
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,480
Writing your name right is important.

608
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,015
For your future.

609
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,017
Taiga Takamori.

610
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,785
It's a very cool name.

611
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,069
The next part is…

612
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,471
like this, I think.

613
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,875
What was next?

614
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,343
The dots under it…

615
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,511
Four, right?

616
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,113
Like that…

617
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,587
Is this the same as this one?

618
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,555
Oh? Yeah, you're right! It's the same.

619
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,692
It's the same, so another line…

620
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,060
That's it?

621
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,064
TAIGA TAKAMORI

622
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,215
JULY 12TH, SATURDAY

623
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,124
Hello?

624
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,326
It's Ogawa from Pietas Girls' School.

625
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,395
I know.

626
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,097
Ms. Chihuahua.

627
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,798
What can I help you with?

628
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,000
I have a question.

629
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:31,969
What?

630
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,538
But not on the phone.

631
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,288
KOREAN BBQ RESTAURANT

632
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,061
Ms. Chihuahua!

633
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,662
This way! Come!

634
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,998
Thank you for helping me with Natsuki.

635
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:01,932
Have a seat.

636
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,201
You said you have a question…

637
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:08,339
When a host asks you to come out so late,
you shouldn't say yes.

638
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,808
Are you messing with me?

639
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,110
Was that your boyfriend?

640
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:15,246
Or your fiancé?

641
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,782
Why do I have to tell you?

642
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,385
I didn't think you had
a boyfriend, to be honest.

643
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,222
You didn't seem like you did.

644
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,657
How rude!

645
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:27,758
Have a seat!

646
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,829
Oh no, I put too much.

647
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,636
He bought me an engagement ring today.

648
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:41,572
I see.

649
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,276
I guess my senses were off.

650
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,446
Congratulations.

651
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,483
It's the happiest time of your life.

652
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,052
What?

653
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,389
Never mind.

654
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,927
Let me ask you something too.

655
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,462
Who's the lady you were with?

656
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,563
My princess.

657
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,298
-Princess?
-Yeah.

658
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:08,466
Right!

659
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:11,769
I forgot, hosts call
their customers princesses.

660
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,037
Exactly.

661
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,639
We make the princesses happy and get paid.

662
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,876
That's our job. Here.

663
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,046
Cheers to your engagement.

664
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,185
When did you become a host?

665
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,455
A little over a year ago.

666
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:36,527
I tried other jobs before this,
but this is my calling.

667
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,696
Your calling?

668
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:45,069
When I was little,
I wanted to be a train conductor.

669
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,807
There were train tracks
right under the window of our apartment

670
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,710
and so many trains went by every day.

671
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,248
Watching the trains
was the only thing that made me happy.

672
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,393
You didn't try to chase that dream?

673
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,028
It was impossible.

674
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,430
You know why.

675
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,900
I can't even write my own name.

676
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:21,171
Which means I can't get a driving license.

677
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,076
But you can write your name! We practiced!

678
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,046
I know!

679
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,881
Let's review it now!

680
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,416
No thanks.

681
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,552
Don't you want to?

682
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,987
Taiga Takamori!

683
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,424
It's such a nice name.

684
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:44,695
Fine. We can try.

685
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:54,872
Here you go.

686
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,219
Thank you for the drink.

687
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:33,911
There.

688
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,583
Oh, wow!

689
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,286
Your writing's gotten so much better!

690
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,056
Have you been practicing?

691
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,794
You can still learn.

692
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:53,197
We can make time to practice like this.

693
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:55,866
And I can teach you!

694
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,804
Private classes?

695
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,775
That's kind of hot.

696
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,244
Take this seriously or forget it!

697
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:08,946
The chihuahua came out!

698
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,082
You're so serious.

699
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,354
It'll be a waste of your time.

700
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:23,994
When I was in elementary school,
I got told I have a learning disability.

701
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,366
It's never a waste to try!

702
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,168
I truly believe so!

703
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:37,574
I'm sorry, I'm so serious.

704
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:41,912
But…

705
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,149
I feel bad to just be
on the receiving end.

706
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,518
I'll teach you something too.

707
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:48,852
Teach me what?

708
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:54,391
About love.

709
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,225
Love.

710
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:29,860
It is…

711
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,597
what I struggle with the most, but…

712
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:36,734
it's also what I want the most.

713
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,202
TAIGA TAKAMORI

714
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,006
I told you it was impossible to teach me.

715
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,675
I don't think it's impossible!

716
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:48,245
Stupid ones need
to show sincerity if they want to win.

717
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:50,481
Kaoru is not stupid.

718
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:55,953
THIS DRAMA INCLUDES BUSINESS PRACTICES
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLATIONS
