[Mr. Bad]

3
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,190
[Episode 18]

4
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,380
Sorry.

5
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,220
I should've told you earlier.

6
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,620
You don't have to apologise to me.

7
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,259
You did nothing wrong.

8
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,700
This matter

9
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,180
is beyond your imagination.

10
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,860
You're not mad anymore?

11
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,330
I'm not mad

12
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,500
at you.

13
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,100
Then, can you be happy?

14
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,240
Actually, I know

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,020
what's on your mind.

16
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,060
You thought

17
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,200
you were

18
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,620
an ordinary ancient man.

19
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,700
But you never thought
that you're not a human at all.

20
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,740
I'm not insulting you.

21
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,500
I'm saying

22
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,560
you found out the fact

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,540
that you're a character from a novel.

24
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,890
This

25
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,780
is beyond your expectation.

26
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,420
It's impactful.

27
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,740
Particularly,

28
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,020
I'm the writer of this novel.

29
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,020
Which means I'm your creator.

30
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,880
In other words,

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,220
I'm your mother.

32
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,580
It makes sense that you don't want

33
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,220
to date your mum.

34
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,340
Seriously,

35
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,780
I never thought about this before.

36
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,540
What about now?

37
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,620
I feel a little discomfort now.

38
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,860
What am I talking about?

39
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,900
Never mind.

40
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,540
Actually, this doesn't matter.

41
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,820
Then, what is it that matters?

42
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,730
Anything that you think it's important,

43
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,260
I'll fulfil it for you.

44
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,660
You can't help me with this.

45
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,410
How would you know

46
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,090
that I can't help you
if you don't tell me?

47
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,340
Just tell me.

48
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,660
What is it that you think

49
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,820
it matters the most?

50
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,780
I...

51
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,700
I actually think

52
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,920
that my current life

53
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,180
holds no meaning at all.

54
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,899
When I first came here,

55
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,769
at least I knew

56
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,860
who I was.

57
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,260
I was lost that time

58
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,420
but I knew

59
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,940
where I came from.

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,700
I, Xiao Wudi, was the smartest

61
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,020
and the strongest person in the world.

62
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,500
But now I realise

63
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,740
that everything is false.

64
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,780
I'm not the person

65
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,420
who I thought I was.

66
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,310
I'm not

67
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,300
the Xiao Wudi.

68
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,400
What is

69
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,980
the point of me staying alive?

70
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,980
You don't need a reason to be alive.

71
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,140
Don't think too much.

72
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,500
This is my problem.

73
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,890
You don't have to think

74
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,220
about such complicated thing with me.

75
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,700
It won't do.

76
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,820
I've got to be responsible for you.

77
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,260
Don't treat me like your son.

78
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,140
I got it.

79
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,700
Just give me

80
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,780
two days

81
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,100
to think about it.

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,420
Maybe I can figure it out.

83
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,250
What if you can't?

84
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,970
I wish I could.

85
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,260
Then, promise me.

86
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,620
You must figure it out.

87
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,460
Is this something that I can control?

88
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,940
Just promise me.

89
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,100
Okay.

90
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:00,940
I promise you.

91
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,890
Is there anything else?

92
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,380
Tell me if you've figured it out.

93
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,140
Nan Xing,

94
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,340
don't lock the door.

95
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm going out too.

96
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:38,740
Okay.

97
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,830
[Have you figured it out today?]

98
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,320
[If yes, give me a call.
If no, buy an ice cream to eat.]

99
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,820
Bye bye.

100
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,580
Good morning, Miss Ye.

101
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,340
Good morning.

102
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,020
Good morning, Miss Ye.

103
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,500
Good morning.

104
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,300
Good morning, Miss Ye.

105
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,140
Good morning.

106
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,370
Miss Ye.

107
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,900
Who told you that?

108
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,700
I didn't tell you because I didn't want

109
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,300
this to happen.

110
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,700
Sister Qing.

111
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,820
Jiaojiao, you're so pragmatic.

112
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,000
They say
that human relationship is superficial.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,020
I haven't left.

114
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,940
And you call me Sister Qing
instead of Miss Ye.

115
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,780
Let's see.

116
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,260
Don't cry.

117
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,220
You don't look pretty when you cry.

118
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,410
Girls are not allowed to cry.

119
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,260
It breaks my heart when you cry.

120
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Both of you are men.

121
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,620
Why do you cry like this?

122
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,020
I've never seen you

123
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:42,860
like this before.

124
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,460
I have to take a photo of this.

125
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,780
I'll take the photo for real
if you keep crying.

126
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,540
Well.

127
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,020
Just pretend that I'm going on a vacation.

128
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,700
Anyway, I've never

129
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,180
taken a break for all these years.

130
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,890
From now on,

131
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,810
I can

132
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,920
wake up at any time

133
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,890
I want every day.

134
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,400
I can eat whatever I like.

135
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,380
I won't have to socialise anymore.

136
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,700
Well,

137
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,180
are you envious of me?

138
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,750
Miss Ye, since you're going on a vacation,

139
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,740
just get a good rest.

140
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,980
The company,

141
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,620
we brothers and sisters

142
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,660
will keep on working hard.

143
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,860
Fight on, Miss Ye.

144
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,220
Miss Ye, can we take a photo

145
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,540
with you at last?

146
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,900
Of course we can take a photo together.

147
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,390
Then, let's take a photo with Miss Ye.

148
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:32,860
Come.

149
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,260
I want to see you smile.

150
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,100
Three, two, one.

151
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,180
You're really going to resign?

152
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,770
Sit.

153
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,860
The editor-in-chief told me

154
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,340
that you're handing over your job to him.

155
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:05,940
Yes.

156
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,900
For the company's business,

157
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,170
I already have it arranged.

158
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,140
Everything has

159
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,460
its person-in-charge respectively.

160
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,780
Are you protesting against me?

161
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,400
Is it because

162
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,330
I didn't let you have that day off?

163
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,140
I'll give you the day off now.

164
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,500
I'm not protesting against you.

165
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,520
I just think it's not suitable

166
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,090
for us to work together now.

167
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,250
Why is it not suitable?

168
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,660
I think it's suitable.

169
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,600
The company's business

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,900
is all on track now.

171
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:31,800
Every position

172
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,740
has its person-in-charge.

173
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,580
Don't worry.

174
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,060
It won't cause major problems.

175
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,910

I always have high hopes for you.

that we can't choose

348
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,260
our parents, right?

349
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,260
So,

350
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,710
let's just be down to earth

351
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,860
and live our own lives.

352
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,020
Do something that we like

353
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
and

354
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,380
enjoy the lives we have now.

355
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,780
This is the meaning of a life.

356
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,900
What we should do now is

357
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,020
to go to sleep.

358
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,180
Have you figured it out?

359
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,700
Go back to your room if you do.

360
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,920
Goodnight.

361
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,420
Goodnight.

362
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:53,900
Goodnight.

363
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,020
Goodnight.

364
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:19,260
[Have you figured it out today? If yes,
call me. If no, buy an ice cream to eat.]

365
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,140
Why are you still up at this late hour?

366
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,100
Xiao Wudi,

367
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,250
my mum said

368
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,620
we create our own lives.

369
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,430
Somehow, there are arrangements

370
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,490
in each person's life.

371
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,140
As long as you try your best

372
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,450
to do your favourite things,

373
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,180
you'll be able to find
the meaning of your life.

374
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,780
Or I can ask my mum to talk to you.

375
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,030
She's good at comforting people.

376
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,740
Stop messing around.

377
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,380
Have you lost your weight?

378
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,420
No.

379
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,860
Though you're confused,

380
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,900
you should also take care of yourself.

381
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,580
You should eat well

382
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,180
and have a proper sleep.

383
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Or else,

384
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,210
you'll starve to death when you figure out

385
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,720
the meaning of your life.

386
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,780
What's the point of that?

387
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,250
My body is protected by magical power.

388
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,820
I won't die.

389
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,940
You can't do that even so.

390
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,300
My wish

391
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,540
is to get a charming boyfriend.

392
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,260
If your face is distorted,

393
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,780
I'll return you to the fairy.

394
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,140
You're pushing your luck, aren't you?

395
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,660
Do you really think that I look handsome?

396
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,890
So what?

397
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,740
You're ruined.

398
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,890
What do you mean?

399
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,740
Look at you.

400
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,180
You look more handsome than the others.

401
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,700
And you're smarter than regular people.

402
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,980
You're good at martial arts

403
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,900
and you're knowledgeable.

404
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,500
You always succeed

405
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,980
in doing the things you want.

406
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,780
If even a person like you

407
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,300
can't find the meaning of your life,

408
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,340
what are the ordinary people

409
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,540
like us going to do?

410
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,340
What's the point?

411
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,980
I'm a created character.

412
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,340
What's the difference between you and us?

413
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,660
Isn't this flesh?

414
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,580
Do you still remember

415
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,620
how you looked when you were a kid?

416
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,860
I remember it.

417
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,700
I've never

418
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,220
thought about this before.

419
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,180
But I've been working hard

420
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,940
to figure it out these two days.

421
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,360
I realised that I can't remember

422
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,700
any of this.

423
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,900
Do you get it now?

424
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,420
I'm the only one

425
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,460
who can solve my own problem.

426
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,080
You don't have to think too much.

427
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,060
It's merely a burden for you.

428
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,500
Rest assured, don't worry about me.

429
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,740
Go to sleep.

430
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,020
Goodnight.

431
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,180
Xiao Wudi,

432
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,300
I'll be responsible to you.

433
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,940
Sure.

434
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,260
Then, you can't lie to me.

435
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,740
Why would I lie to you?

436
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,460
Just you wait.

437
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,140
Goodnight.

438
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,140
Goodnight.

439
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,220
So this is how you go

440
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,300
to work everyday?

441
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,420
Ye Qing resigned.

442
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,860
It's not like the sky has collapsed.

443
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,070
I'll send

444
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,260
someone over to manage your company.

445
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,180
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

446
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,180
But speaking of which,

447
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,660
you're a boss.

448
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,380
with the unkempt look of yours,

449
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,500
how are you going to face your employees?

450
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,320
How can you reassure

451
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,620
your shareholders?

452
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,580
Come.

453
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,460
Since you

454
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,860
don't have faith in me,

455
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,460
then why did you support me back then?

456
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,980
To be honest with you,

457
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,440
I never thought of supporting you

458
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,300
back then.

459
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,240
That

460
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,780
ridiculous plan of yours,

461
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,810
who would expect it

462
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,860
to work?

463
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,780
If Ye Qing didn't come

464
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,500
to me with the proposal,

465
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,860
how would I transfer

466
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,300
the money to you so soon?

467
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,010
Hence,

468
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,580
the person I had faith in was Ye Qing,

469
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,540
not you.

470
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,880
What proposal?

471
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,060
She met you in private?

472
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,280
I thought she was

473
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,980
a young lady

474
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,220
who tried to

475
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,740
take the opportunity to get ahead.

476
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,000
So I dictated

477
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,880
some terms to her,

478
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,260
trying to make her give up.

479
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,140
I didn't expect her to say yes.

480
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,160
She actually did it.

481
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,980
What did she promise you?

482
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,340
She promised me that she won't date you.

483
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,020
Or I'll withdraw

484
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,060
my investment.

485
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,530
You really said that?

486
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,740
For real.

487
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,940
You seriously said that?

488
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,820
Yes.

489
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,340
I was just trying to scare her.

490
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,800
I didn't expect her to be so determined.

491
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,340
She's more determined than you.

492
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,380
Just come home.

493
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,300
Get familiar

494
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,060
with the company's business
and environment.

495
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,220
I told you

496
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,380
that I'm going to retire.

497
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,080
I will

498
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,600
pay you back every cent.

499
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,140
Don't ever think of
controlling my company.

500
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,140
I'll never let you control my life.

501
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,660
Can you really do it?

502
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,730
If you're so determined,

503
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,740
don't use the cash flow of the company.

504
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,330
It'll be a large amount of money

505
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,420
if the shares

506
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,980
are converted into cash.

507
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
I'm sure no one

508
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,260
in this city

509
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,820
would dare to take over this company.

510
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,860
It's a deal.

511
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,180
Brat.

512
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,770
Look, mum.

513
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,180
I didn't forget the skill.

514
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,340
Not bad.

515
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,860
You're fast.

516
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,720
[Lu Zichen]

517
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,860
Why didn't you answer it?

518
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,340
It's an advertisement. Just ignore it.

519
