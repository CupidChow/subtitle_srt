4
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,060
Is it delicious?

5
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,690
It tastes good.

6
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,259
You should take a bigger bite
if it's delicious.

7
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,180
If not, it'll melt away.

8
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,900
Look.

9
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,660
I'll eat it for you.

10
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,930
I've eaten it just now.

11
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,140
But I want to eat it too.

12
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,410
You've got it all over your mouth.

13
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,690
I'll get you a tissue paper to wipe it.

14
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,490
I'll do it myself.

15
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,020
No need.

16
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
I can do it myself.

Nan Xing.

49
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,980
Why didn't you answer your phone?

50
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,970
What time did you come home yesterday?

51
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,490
I didn't hear a sound.

52
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,810
I don't remember it.

53
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,659
I was drinking with Sisi

54
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,620
yesterday.

55
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,530
Then, I went to...

56
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,900
Were you drunk?

57
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,340
You didn't even change your clothes.

58
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,340
And you came in with your shoes on.

59
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,620
You didn't wash your face, did you?

60
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,570
Quickly get up.

61
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,140
No.

62
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,820
I wasn't having

63
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,610
drinks at Xiong Sisi's place

64
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,450
yesterday.

65
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,420
I was with myself...

66
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,620
Then...

67
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,340
Come, get up and wash your face.

68
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:22,890
I'm screwed.

69
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,420
Mum, give me my shoes.

70
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,540
Where are you going?

71
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,290
Next door.

72
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,540
Xiao Wudi.

73
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:44,860
Xiao Wudi.

74
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,540
Are you awake?

75
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,490
Xiao Wudi.

76
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,340
Xiao Wudi.

77
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,820
Are you awake?

78
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,570
You're so early.

79
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,530
Good morning.

80
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,290
Good morning.

81
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,260
The moon was beautiful last night.

82
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,100
You looked gorgeous

83
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,980
last night.

84
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,740
What's wrong with you?

85
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,090
I'm flexing my muscles as I just woke up.

86
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,620
I'm going to take a shower soon.

87
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,370
Just go back to work.

88
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,610
You're going to be late.

89
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,170
I...

90
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,580
Just...

91
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,140
Just...

92
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,850
Actually, I want to ask you

93
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,730
if I came

94
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,250
to see you last night?

95
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,700
Last night?

96
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,660
Yesterday, after I came back,

97
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,410
I slept from evening until just now.

98
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,780
I slept soundly.

99
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,660
I didn't know there was thunder yesterday.

100
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,780
Really?

101
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,730
Yes.

102
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,460
Was I dreaming?

103
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,900
I don't think so.

104
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,170
Beers and ice cream.

105
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,180
Nothing at all?

106
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,420
What are you talking about?

107
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,060
Just go.

108
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,380
Leave.

109
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,130
Let me go in and take a look.

110
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,500
Didn't you just wake up?

111
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,700
I did.

112
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,730
Last night,

113
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,650
I slept

114
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,090
in this position all night.

115
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,940
I might really have been drunk

116
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,980
and it was a dream.

117
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Young Master Xiao,

118
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,500
why is your room so messy?

119
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,260
Were you sleeping

120
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,610
or fighting?

121
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,780
Young Master Xiao.

122
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,420
What do you want from me?

123
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,260
If there's nothing else,

124
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,610
just go back home, okay?

125
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,460
You're not lying to me, are you?

126
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,980
Are you sure
I didn't come here last night?

127
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,140
I'm sure.

128
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,140
Liar liar, pants on fire.

129
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,330
Of course.

130
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,050
Pinky swear.

131
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,290
Seal.

132
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,770
Okay, I'll get going.

133
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,580
Well, that U...

134
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,460
I've deleted everything

135
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,500
in the USB drive.

136
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,690
Do you still want the USB drive?

137
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,060
I don't want it.

138
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,300
Just do whatever you like

139
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,180
to it.

140
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,020
Are you alright?

141
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,290
Are you

142
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,930
not feeling well?

143
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,810
You have a fever?

144
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,410
You're fine.

145
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,170
Just go back to work.

146
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,690
You're going to be late.

147
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,340
I should go to work.

148
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,890
I'm leaving. Get some rest.

149
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,460
Bye bye.

150
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,530
[No.]

151
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,620
[I can't let her know about last night.]

152
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,890
[Nan Xing, I'll leave first.]

153
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,620
[Hurry up, or you'll be late.]

154
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,100
Thank you.

155
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,740
Nan Xing.

156
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,820
Miss Jiao, I'm sorry that I'm late...

157
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,010
No.

158
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,540
Mr. Lu asked you to go to his office.

159
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,100
Okay.

160
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:39,500
Come in.

161
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,660
Have a cup of coffee.

162
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,290
[Don't listen to gossip.]

163
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,290
[Don't listen to gossip.]

164
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,740
[Let's just focus on our business.]

165
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,220
[Okay, Boss?]

166
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,340
Mr. Lu,

167
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,980
what do you need to see me about?

168
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,290
I was doing well last night.

169
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,700
I'll rework it a bit tonight.

170
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,850
Then, it can be handed in.

171
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,370
Come and get it from me tomorrow morning.

172
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,810
And hand it to the Editorial Department.

173
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,620
Tell them

174
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,980
that I've read

175
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:15,730
the New Star Program.

176
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,980
I'm fine with my part.

177
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,700
I'm able to join it.

178
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,450
Okay.

179
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,930
I'll take a day off
after handing the drafts in.

180
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,650
Make an appointment

181
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,620
with Miss Ye for me.

182
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,220
What is this for?

183
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,740
What do you think is best to do with her?

184
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,220
I...

185
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,700
I ask this on my friend's behalf.

186
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,540
I think

187
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,570
you can do something

188
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,180
that she's interested in.

189
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,220
Her interest?

190
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,580
Then, you ask her to free up

191
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,700
more time.

192
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,810
How am I supposed

193
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,220
to tell her that?

194
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:04,930
You just

195
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,410
improvise.

196
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,660
Alright.

197
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,660
I'll go improvise.

198
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,900
Throw it all away.

199
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,850
I'll throw everything

200
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,140
that's related to you away.

201
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,180
Xiao Wudi.

202
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,410
Xiao Wudi.

203
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,170
I...

204
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,140
Xiao Wudi, watch your step.

205
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,930
He told me to ask you,

206
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:12,960
well,

207
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,330
to try and free up more time.

208
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,820
Okay, I got it.

209
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,060
[Isn't she going to ask]

210
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,050
[what Mr. Lu is going to do?]

211
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,050
Your boss has his own reason

212
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,770
if he doesn't say why.

213
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,210
You won't get an answer
even if you ask him.

214
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,570
What's the matter?

215
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,660
You're amazing.

216
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,900
I didn't say anything.

217
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,140
But you've figured it out.

218
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,460
Because I've been through it.

219
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,140
Miss Ye.

220
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,050
I'd like to know how I can become

221
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,420
an excellent assistant.

222
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,940
Do everything

223
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,180
before he tells you.

224
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,980
Do everything before he tells me.

225
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,540
An ordinary assistant

226
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,810
will do everything

227
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,690
the boss says.

228
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,819
But if it's

229
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,740
an excellent assistant,

230
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,140
you'll try to understand

231
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,220
the boss's mind and habits.

232
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,180
Especially when you meet

233
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,420
a strange boss like him,

234
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,740
you have to work harder to understand

235
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
his mind

236
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,619
and prepare in advance.

237
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,220
He's hard to understand, isn't he?

238
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,540
He's really weird, right?

239
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,530
Never mind.

240
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,860
You've done very well.

241
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,780
Keep it up.

242
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,820
I understand.

243
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,100
Thank you, Miss Ye.

244
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:39,900
Get back to work.

245
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,860
[Hallucination.]

246
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,660
[This must be a hallucination again.]

247
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,580
Why don't you greet me?

248
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,660
Why are you back?

249
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,980
I got off work.

250
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,100
Just go back to your house.

251
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,300
Why are you sitting here?

252
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,770
You didn't pick up your phone.

253
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,250
Today is my mother's birthday.

254
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,220
You're invited.

255
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,660
I'm not going.

256
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,650
Why?

257
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,130
Are you busy?

258
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,580
Or are you up to something else?

259
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,940
I'm up to nothing.

260
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,450
Then, let's go together.

261
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,580
No, I...

262
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,210
I've sworn an oath.

263
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,730
If I celebrate someone's birthday,

264
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,700
my meridians will be broken in three days.

265
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,290
What kind of nonsense is that?

266
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,090
Just go home.

267
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,660
Why is there a leak in your house?

268
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,940
What's going on?

269
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,020
How did this happen?

270
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,740
Don't touch it, I'll get a towel.

271
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,060
Take your hands away.

272
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,300
It's alright.

273
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,610
I'll block it with towel.

274
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,690
I'll do it.

275
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Let me do it.

276
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,650
Don't touch it.

277
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,130
The water...

278
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,410
It's a large flow of water.

279
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,940
Quickly wipe your face.

280
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,370
I told you to leave it.

281
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,220
Just stop.

282
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,370
Go.

283
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,010
I'll handle it.

284
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,850
But... But it...

285
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,690
I'll handle it.

286
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,650
Then, I'll call the plumber for you.

287
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:21,860
Nan Xing.

288
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,700
Mum.

289
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,580
You...

290
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,130
Why are you soaking wet?

291
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,300
The pipe in Xiong Wudi's house burst.

292
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,490
The pipe burst?

293
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,300
What about the house?

294
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,500
It's flooded.

295
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,130
But fortunately, it's not that serious.

296
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,240
I'll call

297
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,410
the maintenance company later.

298
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,220
Alright.

299
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,610
Wait until the worker repairs it,

300
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,780
clean yourself up.

301
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,290
We'll invite Xiong to eat out.

302
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,340
He doesn't want to go.

303
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,450
What's wrong?

304
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,500
I don't know why.

305
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,050
He seems to be mad.

306
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,690
You must've bullied

307
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,530
him again.

308
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,780
No.

309
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,340
Why would I bully him?

310
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,700
Fine, just go

311
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,010
dry yourself and get changed.

312
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,340
I'll go and check him out.

313
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,820
This way, please.

314
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,290
Okay.

315
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,610
There are many people.

316
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,020
Well, thank you.

317
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,380
Have a seat.

318
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:28,540
Thank you.

319
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,220
Take a look and see what you like to eat.

320
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,020
Did my mother force you to come?

321
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,850
No.

322
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,500
Xiong.

323
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,370
I'll order you a set

324
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,250
of M9 Wagyu, okay?

325
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,490
It's tasty but you won't gain weight.

326
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,260
Sure.

327
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,540
Today's your birthday.

328
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,980
It's your call.

329
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,010
Nan Xing, what kind of pizza
would you like?

330
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,420
I want this.

331
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,500
Cooked Ham and Mushroom Pizza
with Arugula.

332
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:01,900
Thank you.

333
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,980
That'll be all.

334
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,460
What would you like to drink?

335
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,100
We're offering the two-for-one discount
for orange juice today.

336
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,420
Apple juice would be good.

337
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,290
Sure.

338
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,660
Are you okay with it?

339
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,210
Shouldn't we have drinks
on my birthday?

340
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,500
Xiong,

341
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,130
drink some red wine with me.

342
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,900
Sure.

343
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,140
Today's your birthday.

344
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,420
We certainly have to drink red wine.

345
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,570
You can have it.

346
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,380

so that it can be fulfilled.

364

My first wish is

366

My second wish is

367
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,530
to hope that Nan Xing could get a man

368
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,090

369

372

373

374

375

Okay, let's blow out the candles.

376

379

It's once in a year.

380
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,730
We must carry on the tradition.

381
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,980

How could I hold it back?

385
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,730
Don't do it if you can't.

386

You've got a hard time.

392
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:13,010
So you already knew it?

393

Of course I did.

397

No.

398
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,500
It's because today is your birthday.

399
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,340
And I didn't prepare

400

a birthday gift for you.

401
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,970
This is what I should do.

402
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,340
Don't do that again.

403
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,820
Are you full?

404
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,530

408

409
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,130

410

Xiao Wudi, what's wrong with you?

416
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,300
Is it because

417
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,740
I rubbed the cake on your face?

418
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,820
So you're mad?

419
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,660
Didn't you rub it on my face too?

420
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,650
We're even.

421

Stop following me.

422

Or is it because

423
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,930
you didn't want

424
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,210
to come here at all?

425
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,340
Sorry.

426

Then, what is it?

430
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,020
What do you mean? What's wrong with you?

431

this and that to me.

Yes.

521
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,260
I'm very interested in his works.

522
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,050
Let's go.

523
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,610
This artist was debuted
as an original artist.

524
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:45,980
He has collaborated

525
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,420
with many major domestic game developers.

526
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,340
He participated

527
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,580
in many game developments.

528
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,100
Look.

529
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,460
His works

530
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,820
are filled with edgy style.

531
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,780
They are very special.

532
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,370
But most of the people

533
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,180
only notice his style

534
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,500
but they neglect

535
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,810
the deeper meaning his works express.

536
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,420
He never launched peripheral products.

537
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,460
This is the first time.

538
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,380
I once contacted him

539
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,620
on the Internet back then.

540
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,139
But we didn't meet up as we can't find

541
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,050
a suitable time.

542
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,659
You contacted him?

543
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:21,810
Yes.

544
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,659
I'd like to collaborate with him.

545
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:26,409
He always creates out-of-the-box works.

546
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,739
And I think

547
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,460
if we interpret your work

548
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,850
in his style,

549
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,460
maybe it'll have different vibe.

550
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,370
Don't you think so?

551
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:35,980
Yes.

552
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,420
It's him.

553
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,850
I think he's the artist.

I wonder if you have

563
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,010
any thoughts on it.

564
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,490
The content of his book doesn't match

why you choose me.

569
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,500
It may be safe

570
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,980

574
