There are many people in the office.

if other people see this.

20

He's staying in the office right now.

You were responsible for handling

Right now,

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,890
he has to deal with everything.

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,210
There are all kinds of contracts

40
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,460
on his desk.

41
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,740
He could not

42
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,940
handle that alone,

43
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,260
let alone writing novels.

44
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,810
He stopped publishing the current series

45
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,180
two weeks ago

46
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,710

Even so, he still produced nothing.

50
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:29,850
I guess he has to suspend the series.

51
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,800
I don't know what to do either.

55

and return to the company?

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,750
I've already asked him before.

57
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,180
He didn't want me to interfere.

58
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,950
In the past, you guys

59
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,950
used to think that he obeyed my will.

60
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,660
Actually,

61
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,390
he always had his own ideas.

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,290
And,

63
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,720
judging from our current relationship,

64
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,250
I don't think

65
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,740
he'll listen to me.

66

In the end,

67
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,470

177
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,620
Let go of me.

♫ Don't fear ♫

182
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,300

Xiao Wudi!

203
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,310
Where are you going?

204
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,900
I can go anywhere I like.

205
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,260
No one can stop me.

206
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,060
How could you forget about me?

207
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,810
I understand now.

208
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,430
You were captivated by

209
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:23,580
my beautiful looks.

210
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,140
Fine, I understand.

211
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,730
Everybody desires to look attractive.

212
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,550
However, I will

213
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,810
tell you this first.

214
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,090
If you keep following me,

215
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,980
don't blame me for beheading you.

216
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,170
You are Xiao Wudi!

217
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,900
Not only do I know your name,

218
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,320
but I also know that
you're Young Master Hehuan!

219
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,380
You're the number one villain
in the martial arts world.

220
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,460
You thought

221
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
you traveled through time

222
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,290
and came here from 500 years ago.

223
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,860
But in reality, you're just a character

224
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,260
in the novel I'd written!

225
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,250
You're the unforgettable relationship

226
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,860
that I had wished for!

227
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,660
You're my best friend.

228
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,220
You're the dearest person

229
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,500
to me

230
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,620
besides my mother.

231
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,580
You're the only person

232
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
who I had confessed to!

233
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,900
You're also the person

234
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,740
I had missed the most!

235
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,420
Such nonsense.

236
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,700
Stop following me!

237
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,610
Listen.

238
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,300
I don't understand what you're saying,

239
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,300
and I don't want

240
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,630
to understand them.

241
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,850
What's wrong?

242
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:44,930
Are you okay?

243
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,730
Are you hurt?

244
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,860
I'm fine.

245
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,750
Eat them while they're hot.

246
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,080
I'll clean up that area.

247
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,180
It's fine.

248
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,620
I'll hire someone to clean it tomorrow.

249
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,130
Anyway,

250
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,180
I'm living with my parents right now.

251
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,240
My house is vacant.

252
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,050
Why don't you move into my house?

253
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,940
It's fine.

254
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,050
I'm staying here

255
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,770
so that I could work more conveniently.

256
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,900
It's not that I don't have a place to go.

257
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,740
And, I've been handling
the company's affairs

258
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,340
pretty well lately.

259
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,090
Don't worry about it.

260
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,210
Eat up.

261
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,210
You...

262
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,420
How have you been doing?

263
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,530
Pretty good.

264
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,530
I no longer

265
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,660
need to answer calls

266
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,260
or read documents.

267
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,700
I have plenty of free time now.

268
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,730
But I couldn't get used to it.

269
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,930
That's pretty good.

270
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,700
You have time

271
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,300
to do the things you like.

272
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,730
You don't need to worry about
the company too much.

273
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,280
You should head back and rest.

274
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,940
Take good care of yourself then.

275
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,390
[Will you still]

276
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,730
[agree to it even if your relationship]

277
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,340
[will end terribly?]

278
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,970
[By then, you'll have to suffer]

279
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,220
[all by yourself.]

280
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,660
Let go of me.

281
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,420
Don't you recognize me?

282
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,820
I'm Nan Xing.

283
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,250
I'm your girlfriend.

284
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,700
You're my best friend.

285
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,260
You're the dearest person

286
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,410
to me

287
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,530
besides my mother.

288
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,360
You're the only person

289
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,500
who I had confessed to!

290
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,080
You're also the person

291
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,650
I had missed the most.

292
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,500
Such nonsense.

293
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,530
[You won't lose]

294
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,820
[your beloved again]

295
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,250
[if I stay away from you]

296
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,690
[this time.]

297
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,700
Say,

298
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,140
what exactly is wrong with him?

299
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,060
This can't be.

300
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,860
Is that actually the case?`

301
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,620
I know now.

302
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,990
Good night.

303
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,580
Why hasn't she returned yet?

304
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,220
Don't tell me she's in danger?

305
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,330
She's back.

306
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,860
Even if I want you to be happy,

307
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,870
you don't need to be that happy
without me.

308
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,650
Even if you do believe

309
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,190
that I've lost my memories,

310
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,190
you can't just ignore me like this.

311
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,700
At the very least,

312
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
I was once your boyfriend, you know?

313
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,870
To think that I was actually disheartened
about her call for help.

314
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,800
Xiao Wudi, help.

315
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,260
Come back immediately.

316
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,060
What's going on?

317
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,820
Why am I here?

318
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,330
Do you

319
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,660
cast a spell on me?

320
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,890
Although you don't remember anything,

321
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:33,730
this is

322
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,140
our relationship.

323
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,860
As long as I beckon you,

324
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,900
you have to appear in front of me.

325
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,140
Come.

326
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,710
Take off your shirt.

327
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,740
What are you saying?

328
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,580
Aren't you hot from
wearing that many layers?

329
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,380
You smell rotten.

330
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,440
You should take a bath while you're at it.

331
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,690
Don't touch me!

332
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,860
Who are you?

333
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,300
Do I know you?

334
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,020
How many times do I have to tell you?

335
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,320
I'm your girlfriend.

336
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,060
You were summoned by me.

337
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,660
You have to do everything

338
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,820
I tell you to do.

339
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,680
If not,

340
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,030
you will suffer from a headache.

341
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,860
Understood?

342
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,150
I don't understand.

343
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,230
Xiao Wudi, help.

344
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,050
Go and take a bath.

345
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,800
Xiao Wudi, help.

346
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,780
Go and take a bath.

347
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,260
Xiao Wudi, help.

348
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,660
The bathroom is over there.

349
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,250
Please.

350
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,860
You have no decency at all.

351
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,050
From what I can remember,

352
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,780
Young Master Xiao, you weren't someone

353
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,580
who was bound by codes of ethics.

354
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,700
Xiao Wudi, help.

355
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,090
Go and take a bath.

356
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,540
Stop acting tough.

357
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,790
I was just teasing you.

358
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,890
Go now.

359
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,460
I even scrubbed the bathtub for you.

360
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,330
She must be out of her mind.

361
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,020
I guess I won't be able

362
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,970
to see all of this again

363
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,330
once I return.

364
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,440
I can't even see her again.

365
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,180
Why am I missing all of this?

366
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,820
What are you up to again?

367
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,890
I got you some clothes.

368
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,550
Your clothes are dirty.

369
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,970
You can wear these later.

370
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,350
This shirt looks terrible.

371
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,150
Don't you have any other shirts?

372
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,240
The rest of them

373
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,650
belongs to my boyfriend.

374
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,850
Are you my boyfriend?

375
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
Xiao Wudi!

376
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,660
Have you truly forgotten about me?

377
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,860
That's right.

378
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,720
I already told you before.

379
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,580
It's possible that
you might have been rebooted.

380
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,900
What do you mean by that?

381
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,420
It's just like resetting a smartphone.

382
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,810
You've been reset.

383
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,200
You forgot about me

384
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,530
because your data was wiped away.

385
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,900
You'll remember me

386
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,760
once I restore your data.

387
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,890
I don't understand.

388
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,780
Come here.

389
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,300
Why should I?

390
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,410
Help...

391
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,820
[Handsome Chinese Boy]

392
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,370
You can sleep here tonight.

393
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,540
This is inappropriate.

394
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,510
Why is this inappropriate?

395
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,620
I won't treat you as my boyfriend.

396
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,600
Even so,

397
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,140
you have no place to stay tonight.

398
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,200
Why must you put yourself on the spot?

399
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,300
Miss,

400
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,300
you are a kind person.

401
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,370
I suggest you

402
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,780
forget about that boyfriend
of yours as soon as possible

403
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,740
and start a new life.

404
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:20,900
You!

405
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,260
Nan Xing?

406
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,090
Boss, you're here?

407
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,230
What does this mean?

408
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,420
She told me to live here
for a couple of days.

409
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,100
Boss,

410
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,800
I was handling

411
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,780
some personal affairs just now.

412
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,020
I didn't leave you alone

413
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,830
on purpose.

414
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,800
It's fine. I've handled everything.

416
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,060
Was Miss Ye here?

417
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,140
Although

418
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,000
I don't know

419
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,730
what happened between you two,

420
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,260
I think she's pretty concerned about you.

421
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,050
Why don't you recruit her again?

422
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,420
You won't be under that much pressure

423
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,900
if she's helping you out.

424
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,090
She and I have known each other
for a long time.

425
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,270
She has always been

426
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,800
solving my problems for me.

427
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,830
Now, she finally has the time

428
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,690
to take a break.

429
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,550
I don't wish to interrupt her.

430
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,180
Alright then.

431
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,920
I'll clean up

432
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,020
that area for you.

433
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,800
No need for that.

434
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,370
You should head back and rest.

435
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,830
Where will you sleep then?

436
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,790
I'll sleep on the sofa.

437
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,890
On the sofa? But...

438
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,350
I'll think of something tomorrow.

439
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:50,690
Boss,

440
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,100
let me bring your luggage inside.

441
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,860
Come in.

442
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,710
I thought you were leaving.

443
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,460
Go ahead.

444
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,270
I have no place to stay tonight.

445
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,650
Why must I

446
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,910
put myself on the spot?

447
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,030
I'll stay in this room then.

448
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:15,930
No.

449
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,940
So, you aren't leaving?

450
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,340
Boss,

451
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,630
give me a moment.

452
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,770
I need to speak to him.

453
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,080
Come in.

454
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,880
Enough already. Stop pretending.

455
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Aren't you tired?

456
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,980
Who's pretending?

457
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,100
What do you mean by pretending?

458
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,870
You were pretending
to have lost your memories.

459
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:01,650
This trope

460
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,420
is outdated.

461
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,950
Everyone is tired of it.

462
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,580
I didn't pretend to lose my memories.

463
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,770
You didn't, huh?

464
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,590
I never saw a person from the ancient era

465
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,250
who knew they have to wait
for the traffic light.

466
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,390
You don't

467
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,650
look adorable at all.

468
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,130
What do you mean?

469
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,260
Why didn't you tell me

470
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,230
when you knew about it all along?

471
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,170
I made a fool out of myself.

472
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,390
It's all because

473
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,700
I wanted to give you a way out.

474
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,850
I never expected you to keep acting.

475
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,180
You did grow smarter.

476
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,700
However, dumber you

477
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,740
was better.

478
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,580
What do you want then?

479
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,240
Do you want to break up with me?

480
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,620
Sure. I'll gladly oblige.

481
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,340
What are you laughing at?

482
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,790
How could you laugh

483
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,620
when I'm sad?

484
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,740
What are you sad about?

485
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,420
You pretended

486
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,080
to lose your memories.

487
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,100
What exactly were you up to?

488
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:47,810
[Pretty good.]

489
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,670
I no longer

490
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,990
need to answer calls

491
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,620
or read documents.

492
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,300
You don't need to worry too much
about the company.

493
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,040
So,

494
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,570
if that fairy wasn't lying,

495
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,150
I would only be able

496
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,940
to stay here for a short time.

497
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,640
I guess

498
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,540
I have to return

499
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,930
to the novel's world

500
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,660
once I completed my mission.

501
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,750
By then,

502
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,340
we have to part ways again.

503
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,180
You were trapped

504
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,500
in a fire back then.

505
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,210
I don't want you

506
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,340
to go through the same thing again.

507
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,190
Was that why you pretended
to lose your memories?

508
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,330
Even so,

509
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,250
it cannot resolve our issue.

510
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,660
I know that.

511
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,340
However,

512
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,620
I didn't know how to
break the news to you.

513
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,580
when I saw you again.

514
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,500
My brain couldn't function.

515
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,230
Your brain couldn't function?

516
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,570
I thought you were intelligent?

517
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,180
Caring too much about someone
will cause one to panic.

518
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,980
You're the jinx of my life.

519
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,620
Fine.

520
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,020
You can blame it on me.

521
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,900
I'm very grateful

522
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,270
that you considered my feelings.

523
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,740
But sometimes, we only learn our lessons

524
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,820
after losing something.

525
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,380
What have you learned then?

526
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,530
I said this before.

527
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,340
If I miss out on the present,

528
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,550
I will surely regret it

529
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,610
no matter what happens in the future.

530
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,160
Back then,

531
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,020
I was already mentally prepared.

532
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,270
I don't care about the ending.

533
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,100
I just want us to be together right now.

534
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,340
But it was just a guess back then.

535
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,460
Now, the ending has been confirmed.

536
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,660
How could you be sure

537
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,250
that I couldn't stand it?

538
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,020
Don't be so pessimistic.

539
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,820
Even if

540
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,820
your prediction does come true,

541
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,820
I believe that I can deal with it.

542
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,230
But...

543
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:21,900
Xiao Wudi,

544
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,040
you're a martial artist.

545
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,740
You should be cool about it.

546
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,340
That's what I wanted to do too.

547
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,470
But I can't just

548
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,040
act cool about losing you.

549
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,580
You're my first love.

550
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,850
Is that so?

551
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,290
Really?

552
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:40,660
I...

553
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,440
I was just saying that

554
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,090
in order to please you.

555
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,190
You're so easy to trick.

556
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,660
So, do you feel better now?

557
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,820
It's all because of you.

558
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,990
I was doing great

559
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,300
in my world.

560
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,620
You were

561
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,660
a villain anyway.

562
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,010
Why is he still here?

563
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,770
Boss, what's the matter?

564
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,139
It's getting late.

565
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,179
So?

566
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,659
I need to rush my manuscript tomorrow.

567
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,449
So?

568
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,710
It's time to sleep.

569
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,570
You should head home then.

570
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,940
I understand now.

571
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,580
I'll deal with the situation.

572
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,440
How could a boss

573
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,420
stay in his subordinate's house?

574
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:30,239
The situation is quite complicated.

575
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,810
I'll explain it to you later.

576
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,330
Boss, it's fine.

577
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,159
Follow me.

578
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,219
I'll bring your luggage to your room.

579
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,260
Boss,

580
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,620
although these sheets

581
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,110
aren't new,

582
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:44,010
I've washed and dried them.

583
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,889
They're clean.

584
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,260
You can sleep on them for now.

585
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,100
I'll buy new ones

586
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,989
for you tomorrow.

587
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:48,679
Both of you

588
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,480
can stay here for the time being.

589
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,340
Xiao Wudi is familiar
with the layout of the house.

590
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,130
You can ask him

591
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,590
if you have any questions.

592
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,900
I didn't even complain about it.

593
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,610
What's with the long face?

594
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,080
I'm just not used to

595
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,040
hearing footsteps

596
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,940
in the house.

597
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,960
I might suffer from insomnia

598
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,760
if I hear footsteps in the house.

599
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,840
This isn't your house.

600
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,330
It's Nan Xing's house.

601
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:15,340
I think I should return to the company.

602
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,660
But there was a fire just now.

603
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,780
You should stay here.

604
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,230
He can't even afford

605
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:26,810
a hotel room now.

606
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,210
You should go easy on him.

607
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,620
Did he lose all of his fortunes
in just a few days

608
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,300
after I returned to my period?

609
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,250
That's not it.

610
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,850
I'll explain it to you later.

611
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,930
Boss, you should rest.

612
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,430
We'll make a move first.

613
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,270
I'm living in the opposite house.

614
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,760
Text me

615
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,700
if you need anything.

616
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,360
Rest early.

617
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,220
I overheard your conversation

618
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,610
and heard something about

619
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,250
fairies and memory loss.

620
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,680
Were you guys talking about a novel plot?

621
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,340
Yeah.

622
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,900
Isn't the male lead

623
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,980
too absurd then?

624
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,280
What did you say?

625
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,160
It was just a discussion.

626
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,820
We don't plan on writing that.

627
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,450
See you. Goodbye.

628
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,740
Rest well, okay?

629
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,820
Good night.

630
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,680
Why haven't you gone to sleep yet?

631
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,180
It's been a long time since I saw you.

632
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,980
Can't I take a longer look at you?

633
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,370
Sure, you can.

634
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,820
One,

635
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,450
two,

636

three,

637
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,730
four,

638
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,540
five seconds.

639
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,220
Is that long enough for you?

640
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,500
Nope.

641
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,740
It's not long enough?

642
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,370
You can continue by tomorrow then.

643
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,030
Good night.

644
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,120
Aren't you afraid

645
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,890
that I might be recalled
to my world out of the blue?

646
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,460
You won't be recalled

647
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,710
before your mission is completed.

648
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,200

651
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,660
I came in through the window.

652
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,430
It isn't my first time doing it anyway.

653

♫ Maybe this is destiny ♫

689
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,450
♫ When I look into your eyes ♫

690
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,860
♫ The radiance
transcending time and space ♫

691
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,890
♫ Is love ♫
