131

I can't believe that in this era,

the writer would still use her pseudonym

133

as the name of the female lead.

134
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,230
The writer is honest and frank.

135

In this fan fiction,

138
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,310
Lu Zichen is the male lead.

139
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,610
It's a martial arts novel
set in the middle period

140
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,610
of Ming Dynasty.

141

Lu Zichen in the book

142
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:45,330
is a talented youngster,

143

you could date the Great Lu?

151
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,250
Is love unacceptable
in a martial arts novel?

152
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,080
Besides, it's just a novel,

153
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,450
how could you accuse me?

Okay?

156

There's no proper villain

160
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,890

161
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,890
and the Great Lu act lovey-dovey
right from the start.

162
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,210
Is the female lead being serious?

163
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,450
What makes her think...

164
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,000
Agree,

165
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,010
the relationship
between the characters is bad.

166
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,650
Would the writer be the kind of girl

169
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,810
It's her own problem.

170
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,170
If she does admire the Great Lu,

171
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,320
why doesn't she arrange

an even match for him?

173
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,330
Enough.

174
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,250
You think that the villain
I create is weak,

175
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,039
don't you?

176
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,380
Alright.

177
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,559
Then, brace yourself

178
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,970
for the invincible

179
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,650
Big Devil!

180
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,169
[Let's say]

181
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,040
[if Lu Zichen is the hero]

182

[who peeps at the human world.]

187
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,060
[He is the Gana]

188
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,940
[who toys with human life.]

189
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,360
[He is a thorn that
pierces the human heart.]

190
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,460
[He's your fear that is omnipresent.]

191
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,060
[He's excellent in martial arts.]

192
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,540
[He continuously breached every sect]

193
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,940
[with his own strength.]

194
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,980
[He took each sect leader's sword away]

195
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,580
[without killing anyone.]

196
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,020
[It embarrassed the sects
that have existed]

197

[in the martial world
for hundred of years.]

198
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,700
This is Longya Sword.

199
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
I won't...

200
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,060
I didn't need any sword.

201
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,410
Just that my servant said

202
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,010
she needed a handy fire stick

203
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,010
while cooking.

204
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,090
I heard that this sword was made
by your sect's ancestor.

205
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,970
It is fire and water proof.

206
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,090
I'll borrow it for a few days.

207
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,900
[Someone once said this.]

208
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,960
[If this man was kind-hearted,]

209
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,290
[that would be a blessing
for the people in the world.]

210

[But he happens to be]

211

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,560
[His purpose of going down the hill]

213
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,800
[is to ruin]

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,410
[Nan Xiaoxing's marriage with Hero Lu.]

[Xiao Wudi.]

00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,650
He's so handsome.

220
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,780
Mum, when did you come back?

221
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,150
I came back right after I got off work.

222
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,850
The Xiao Wudi you create

223
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,970
is more charming than Lu Zichen,

224
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,530
that male lead of yours.

225
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:45,970
Why?

226
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,250
Look, firstly,

227
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,290
he's handsome.

228
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,410
And he's good at martial arts.

229
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,760
He's also smart.

230
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,570
He's more interesting

231
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,450
than an upright hero like Lu Zichen.

232
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,050
Also, he's good at flirting.

233
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,570
But Xiao Wudi is a bad guy.

234
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,850
But he's handsome.

235
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,630
No.

236
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,370
He's got a wicked soul.

237
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,290
The stronger this kind of man is,

238
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,530
the more danger he'll cause.

239
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,360
You can change him.

240
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,140
Shaping a man's quality

241
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,720
first depends on his mother.

242
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,170
Secondly, it's his wife.

243
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,890
They're all women.

244
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,830
Why am I arguing

245
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,000
this out with you?

246
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,850
I've got to continue my work.

247
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,010
To study my recipe.

248
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,850
Let your eyes rest for a while.
Come and help me.

249
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,530
I can't.

250
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,170
I have to go out

251
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,210
later.

252
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,730
When I was little,

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,570
you can still get

254
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,360
something

255
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,610
with one or two yuan.

256
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,570
The coin is less valuable now.

257
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,520
Life is not easy for a scammer nowadays.

258
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,890
I...

259
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,140
Please help me pass tomorrow's interview

260
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,650
so that I could be Mr. Lu's assistant.

261
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,120
You're making a wish?

262
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,640
Is that all?

263
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,690
You should make a gesture.

264
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,640
It'll become yours at last.

265
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,530
I've said it many times.

266
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,790
I don't want money.

267
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
It's accurate.

268
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,290
You'll know soon

269
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,490
after you throw it in.

270
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,200
I've also said it many times.

271
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
Don't try to steal it from me.

272
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,370
Fine.

273
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,170
Miss and Mister,

274

if I'm not mistaken,

275
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,720
I suppose you're a couple.

276
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:48,930
Yes.

277
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,650
This is the local God Fountain,

278
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
Fairy Fountain.

279
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240

the couple like you
who have deep affection

282
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,080
for each other.

283
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,250
We don't need it.

284
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,040
Only bachelor will come and make wishes.

285
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,840
Geez.

286
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,720
What's so proud of having a relationship?

287
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,160
I'd love to have a relationship

288
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,240
if I could.

289
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,410
I'd also like to have

290
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,740
an unforgettable love.

291
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,730
An unforgettable love?

292
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,280
[What is this place?]

293
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,130
[Why am I here?]

[Why is he here too?]

297
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,040
It turned out that it was a dream.

298
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,290
Why are you here?

299
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,240
Am I still dreaming?

300

You're alive.

303

Are you alright?

304
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,730
Are you hurt?

305
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,360
Well,

306
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,280
I didn't mean it.

What's going on now?

311
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,840
Doesn't this scenario

only appear in the novel?

313
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,380
A handsome boy in historical costume.

314

The female lead rescues him.

315
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,520
The male lead falls in love
at first sight.

316
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,349
At last, he devotes himself to me.

317
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,930
Will it be

318
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,880
a little too exaggerated?

319
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,480
No, we should start out

320
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,200
-as friends.

You're awake.

330

Why didn't you tell me?

331
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,080
I've gone so far while carrying you.

332
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,000
Is it interesting to eavesdrop

333
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,170
on someone's conversation?

334
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,920
You're childish.

Goodbye.

336
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,720
You don't want me to devote myself to you?

What are you doing?

Let me tell you this.

339

I'm a little known hero

Don't try to do anything to me.

342

Hero?

343
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,440
Which sect are you from?

344
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,930
Sujiang Sport University.

345
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,170
You go ask around.

346
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,920
Even the principal and the security,

347
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,720
they all know about me, Nan Xing.

348
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,680
[Nan Xing?]

349
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,770
[I haven't heard this name]

350
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,100
[in the martial world.]

351
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,840
[This woman dresses so strangely.]

352
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,520
[And she talks crazy.]

353
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,200
[I should be careful
while dealing with her.]

354
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,280
The civilian police said

355
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,160
that I'm a nemesis to the criminals.

356
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,880
I tell you what.
I'm good at throwing discus.

357
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,010
I didn't bring the discus today.

358
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,360
Or I'll throw it...

359
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,940
It's not right.

360
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,850
Why do I feel guilty?

361
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,490
It was me who rescued you.

362
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,850
You said you rescued me?

363
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,810
Where did you rescue me?

364
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,410
The water is shallow.

365
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,010
Why would I drown in it?

366
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,640
Even if I drowned in it,

367
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,560
why did I come out with

368
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,610
dry hair and clothes?

369
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,810
That's why I told you it was in a dream.

370
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

371
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm not talking nonsense.

372
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,060
At first, it was

373
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
to pick up my co...

374
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,520
My coin.

375
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,850
It was in the bottom.

376
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,220
Why would it be missing?

377
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,780
Are you looking for this?

378
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,650
Give it back.

379
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,810
Why do you take my coin?

380
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,760
This is mine.

381
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,440
You have no evidence at all.

382
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,480
How are you going to prove it?

383
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,280
What is wrong with you?

384
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,120
You return favour with hatred.

385
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,970
I wanted to take you to
the hospital out of kindness.

386
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,320
Now, you take my coin.

387
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,090
I can give it back to you.

388
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,750
Just answer my questions.

389
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,930
Why must I do as you told?

390
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,410
Who do you think you are?

391
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,650
You

392
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,960
dress up

393
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,250
in historical costume
in the park at night,

394
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,050
acting all mysterious.

395
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,580
Who are you trying to scare?

396
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,290
[Why did she say]

397
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,880
[I dress up in historical costume?]

398
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,400
It's not right for me to dress up
in historical costume.

399
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,530
Then what kind of outfit is this?

400
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,130
I came out to have a walk.

401
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,330
So I dress casually.

402
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,010
Do I have to wear formal attire for that?

403
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,240
Besides, this is 21st century.

404
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,610
Everyone has the rights
to choose what to wear.

405
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,320
Okay?

406
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,600
I can wear whatever I like.

407
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,530
It's none of your business.

408
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,080
[21st century?]

409
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,320
[Is it an era name?]

410
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,330
[Did I come]

411
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,630
[to another dynasty?]

412
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
How did you show up

413
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,690
all of a sudden?

414
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,220
Give the coin back to me.

415
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,600
[It seems like she doesn't know about it.]

416
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,080
[I'm afraid I'll give myself away]

417
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,170
[and get myself into troubles]

418
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,320
[if I keep feuding with her.]

419
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,890
Take it.

420
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,150
Why didn't you give it back to me earlier?

421
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,490
We can talk it out now.

422
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,760
We're not finished yet.

423
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,240
Why were you holding my coin?

424
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,610
Why?

425
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,700
Stop following me.

426
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,690
But we should talk it out, shouldn't we?

427
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,920
Don't tell me

428
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,080
you're trying to pester me?

429
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,320
Who wants to pester you?

430
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,300
You can at least obtain my body

431
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,740
if you couldn't win my heart.

432
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,530
Right?

433
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,450
Nonsense.

434
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,840
Nonsense?

435
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,510
Didn't you

436
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,290
imagine it when I was asleep

437
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,960
just now?

438
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,640
I...

439
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,140
Are you sure you don't want me?

440
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,580
Just consider it

441
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,050
as your reward for rescuing me.

442
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,040
It won't do.

443
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,320
I was just imagining

444
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,600
the scenario of the novel.

445
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,240
I didn't want

446
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,400
[What a pushover.]

447
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,640
to do anything to you.

448
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,360
For real.

449
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,760
Don't take it seriously.

450
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,250
Where is he?

451
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,080
[What is this place?]

452
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,200
[I took a turn around it.]

453
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,330
[It's different]

454
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,630
[from where I'm from.]

455
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,650
[If I can get the history books
of this place,]

456
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,480
[I'll be able]

457
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,360
[to find out which dynasty I'm in now.]

458
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,050
Lad,

459
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,810
you can't cross the road
when it's red light.

460
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,380
Red light.

461
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,960
[Red light? What is that?]

462
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,580
Can I cross the road now?

463
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,240
You can.

464
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,880
Don't get too comfortable.

465
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,250
You'll meet her again.

466
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,370
Because you

467
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,280
are destined to be together.

468
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,290
[It looks like]

469
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,440
[he has successfully come]

470
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,520
[to this world.]

471
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,410
This is Sujiang Library.

472
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,680
The history books you're looking for

473
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,610
are all in there.

474
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,450
But it's closed at this late hour.

475
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,040
You can come again tomorrow.

476
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,610
Never mind, thank you.

477
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,760
Lad,

478
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,170
are you into classical style?

479
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,250
[Classical style?]

480
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,440
You look good

481
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,570
in this outfit.

482
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,600
Can I take a photo with you?

483
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,300
Can I?

484
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
[What is this?]

485
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,160
[Fine, just say yes.]

486
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:34,730
Sure.

487
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,410
Hurry up.

488
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,000
Look this way.

489
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,440
[So this is what taking photo like.]

490
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,680
[It's amazing.]

491
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,330
Like this.

492
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:48,770
Right.

493
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,680
Okay, thank you.

494
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,810
We'll get going.

495
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,520
Bye bye.

496
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,530
Bye bye.

497
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,540
[Luckily, I didn't show my weakness.]

498
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,400
[Forget it.]

499
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,980
[Let's get this over with.]

500
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,610
You're back.

501
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,490
What's wrong?

502
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,610
Who upset you?

503
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,110
Don't go there.

504
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,840
He's a rogue.

505
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,730
I'll punch him if I see him again.

506
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,130
I can rest assured, then.

507
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,190
An ordinary rogue

508
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,400
is no match for you.

509
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,970
Mum, what did you cook?

510
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,080
A course meal.

511
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,990
I learnt it from the recipe.

512
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,120
It's comparable to the dish
of a Michelin three-star restaurant.

513
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,650
