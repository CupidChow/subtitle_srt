4
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:34,020
Come in.

5
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:36,620
Mr. Lu,

6
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:37,940
I'll bring the newly recruited assistant

7
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,020
here to see you.

8
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,180
So soon?

9
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,180
I'll let you guys talk.

10
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,650
Why are you messing around?

11
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,100
What's wrong?

12
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,080
I haven't seen you in days.

13
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,490
And you say I'm messing around?

14
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,240
Didn't I ask you to do

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,580
something you like?

16
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,139
Yes.

17
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,940
That's why I'm here.

18
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,410
I don't think you understand me.

19
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,070
I'm saying the thing

20
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,620
that you genuinely want to do.

21
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,180
Stop being restrained

22
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,220
by this company and my dream.

23
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,180
I thought you understood me.

24
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,900
Do you like to be my assistant?

25
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,100
Lu Zichen,

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,460
don't push your luck.

27
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,340
You expect to be my assistant like this?

28
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,340
No assistant

29
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,540
will talk to her boss like this.

30
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,980
You're fired.

31
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,740
I'm not leaving.

32
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,579
I just signed the labour contract.

33
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,420
I'll just pay you the liquidated damages.

34
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,579
Zichen,

35
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,560
didn't you tell me

36
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,610
to do

37
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,780
something I like?

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,260
I've considered it carefully.

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,350
I like

40
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,450
the life here.

41
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,070
I need you in my world.

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,720
I thought

43
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,070
you didn't like me.

44
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,420
I stayed by your side back then

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,720
because I liked you.

46
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,820
Let's continue.

47
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,650
Then,

48
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,970
why didn't you tell me back then?

49
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,920
That time,

50
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,320
maybe I was too afraid to be rejected.

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,130
So I rejected myself first.

52
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,210
Weren't you the same?

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,700
Both of us were too silly

54
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,790
at that time.

55
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,030
Can we forgive each other

56
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,800
and give ourselves a chance?

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,030
I don't know what to say.

58
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,909
I don't know if it's right

59
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,850
to say yes.

60
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,100
Never mind.

61
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,200
I won't go anywhere this time.

62
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,380
We have plenty of time.

63
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,900
Let's start the handover process.

64
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,040
You had a long conversation.

65
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,840
How did it go?

66
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,230
Anyway, he didn't kick me out.

67
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,730
Xiao Wudi.

68
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,040
Xiao Wudi.

69
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,150
He's not home?

70
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,580
Well, I won't share it with you.

71
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,370
Mum.

72
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,700
She's not home.

73
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,940
I didn't switch off the light in my room.

74
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,430
Xiao Wudi?

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,090
What's with the outfit?

76
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,150
Aunt An got it for me.

77
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,750
That's yours.

78
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,740
What are you doing?

79
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,840
I'd like to treat your disease

80
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,230
before I leave.

81
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,590
I'm fine.

82
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,230
You fainted. How dare you say you're fine?

83
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,420
Nan Xing.

84
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,480
I know.

85
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,210
You want to toughen up.

86
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,930
You want to be brave.

87
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,590
You don't want to show

88
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,850
your sadness

89
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,060
in front of us.

90
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,630
But have you ever thought of it?

91
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,570
How could I feel comfortable to leave

92
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,080
while seeing you like this?

93
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,610
Didn't we agree

94
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,170
not to think about this?

95
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
Besides,

96
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,340
even if you want to give me

97
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,520
psychotherapy,

98
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,370
you don't have to dress like this.

99
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,980
This is situation therapy.

100
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,180
Trust me, okay?

101
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,780
Xiao Wudi.

102
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,100
Wait up, Mao Xiaojun.

103
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,080
You're trying to tell me something?

104
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,070
I...

105
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,840
Mao Xiaojun!

106
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,560
Wait up!

107
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,510
What a coincidence.

108
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,150
Why are you here?

109
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,130
I'm wearing headphones,

110
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,180
not a blindfold.

111
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,350
You think I can't see

112
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,110
you start chasing

113
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,330
after me from the bus station?

114
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,010
Mao Xiaojun.

115
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,230
Aunt An.

116
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,070
Nan Xing.

117
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm here to ask Mao Xiaojun

118
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,330
about some math problems.

119
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,560
Xiaojun, be nice and explain it to her.

120
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,580
I'm sure he will.

121
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,520
You're asking for help

122
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,610
or looking for a ghostwriter?

123
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,970
You always knock on my head.

124
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,310
That has made me a fool.

125
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,040
I beg of you. Please explain it to me.

126
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,170
Later when I finish cooking,

127
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,220
I'll ask Xiaojun to bring you supper.

128
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,650
Sure.

129
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,630
Though I've eaten,
I still have room for it.

130
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,950
My dad is in there.

131
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,980
I'll go rescue uncle.

132
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,750
No, Mao Xiaojun!

133
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,800
I'm sorry, Mao Xiaojun.

134
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,930
I shouldn't have

135
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,290
wilfully loved you.

136
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,390
I...

137
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,440
If I didn't keep asking you

138
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,750
to bring me supper,

139
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,740
you wouldn't have come to save me.

140
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,520
You wouldn't have died.

141
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,180
It'd be nice
if I didn't fall in love with you.

142
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,280
If...

143
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,830
It would've been much better

144
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,020
if the person who died was me.

145
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,380
Sorry.

146
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,450
Silly girl.

147
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,230
He'd be very upset

148
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,590
if the person who died was you.

149
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,530
Because he liked you too.

150
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,110
Fool.

151
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,940
He had liked you since he was a kid.

152
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,710
He had liked you very much.

153
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,270
He likes you now, too.

154
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,220
Just that he was a kid

155
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,180
like you

156
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,660
at that time.

157
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,810
So he didn't dare to open up

158
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,280
to you.

159
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,190
He told me

160
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,830
about his feelings in the dream.

161
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,960
Nan Xing,

162
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,690
you have to know this.

163
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,460
That was not

164
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,430
an unrequited love.

165
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,360
He liked you too.

166
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760

176

thank you.

177
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,280
Xiao Wudi!

178
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,660
Xiao Wudi!

179
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,950
It has ended.

180
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,810
Sorry.

181
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,110
Untying the knot in Nan Xing's heart

182
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,680
and making up for her past regrets,

183
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,150
it's my mission, isn't it?

184
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:45,750
Yes, it is.

185
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,930
Then, I've completed my mission.

186
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:50,370
Yes.

187
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,300
It's time for me to disappear.

188
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,520
Bingo.

189
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,090
I, Xiao Wudi, have never begged

190
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,090
anyone in my life.

191
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,079
But before I disappear,

192
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,470
I'd like to ask you a favour.

193
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,869
Well, I need to know

194
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,099
what it is.

195
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,579
So I can decide if I'll help you.

196
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,180
After I leave,

197
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,030
if she suffers

198
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,369
as much as before,

199
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,609
help me find someone else

200
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,260
to keep her company

201
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,650
and heal her.

202
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,800
But don't find

203
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,610
a bad guy like me again.

204
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,550
Find her a big hero.

205
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,470
Why?

206
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,500
You find yourself

207
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,590
a bad guy too?

208
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,280
Am I not?

209
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,750
Let me ask you this.

210
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,020
The world that you live in

211
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,750
and the world in Nan Xing's book,

212
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,390
are they the same?

213
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,520
It's slightly different.

214
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,750
But,

215
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,180
Nan Xing is the author.

216
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,030
She thinks it that way.

217
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,920
How can I explain it?

218
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,540
About this matter,

219
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,520
I have to start with something
that happened over 10 years ago.

220
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,300
You can tell

221
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,020
that I have

222
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,380
a lively personality.

223
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,480
After all these years,

224
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
I've gotten myself

225
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,830
into all sorts of troubles.

226
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,240
What a bad-mannered person!

227
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,330
Uncle,

228
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,310
how did you make it in?

229
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,680
[But speaking of
the most troublesome one,]

230
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,820
[it was Mao Xiaojun.]

231
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,510
How about this? Share your candy

232
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,350
with me.

233
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,610
Then, I'll tell you, okay?

234
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,260
Actually,

235
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,190
this is very simple.

236
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,460
Because I'm an adult.

237
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,600
When you grow up and practise more,

238
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,670
you can also make it in.

239
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,200
You're lying.

240
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,360
You like to deceive people.

241
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,770
You even cheat the kids
out of their snacks.

242
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,190
What do you mean?

243
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,700
Didn't you

244
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,130
give this to me?

245
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,970
You said you'd answer my question

246
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,530
if I gave this to you.

247
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,910
But your answer is a lie.

248
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,220
Isn't it a robbery?

249
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,270
I'll give it back to you, okay?

250
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,620
You ate it.

251
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,580
How could you give it back to me?

252
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,380
Give me money.

253
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,900
Sure.

254
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,420
Here you go.

255
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,070
How am I going to spend this?

256
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,330
Let me tell you this.

257
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,170
Later,

258
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,760
you go and make a wish.

259
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,200
If it comes true,

260
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,580
then you can't tell anyone

261
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,890
about what happens today.

262
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,470
Okay?

263
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,990
I can make any wish?

264
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,690
What else can a kid wish for?

265
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,380
A toy gun or a robot?

266
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,630
I want to protect
Four-eyed Girl my whole life.

267
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,020
And to make her happy.

268
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm screwed.

269
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,740
You this brat.

270
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,920
Do you know how to make a wish?

271
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,460
Take it.

272
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,440
Make another wish, hurry up.

273
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,030
No.

274
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,030
This is my only wish.

275
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,260
It's about your life. You'll regret it.

276
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,230
I won't regret it.

277
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,400
Goodbye, uncle.

278
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,650
Who is this Four-eyed Girl?

279
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,170

[that a kid]

[could make a wish like this.]

Wait for me!

287
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,220
I thought

288
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,990
it would be a joke.

289
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,540

I thought Mao Xiaojun

292
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,840
might not care much

293
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,610
about Nan Xing anymore

294
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,030

295

and saw more girls.

296
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:04,860
So this wish

297
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,280
would naturally be discounted.

00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,680
See for yourself.

347
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,370
This is Mao Xiaojun's notebook.

348
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:31,780
[Young Master Hehuan, Xiao Wudi]

349
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,010
So I was created

350
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,400
by Mao Xiaojun.

351
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,260
[Good at fighting]
[Just like his name, he's invincible.]

352
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,150
[Jade Worth, a fortune Weapon Fan]

353
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,350
He wrote me out.

354
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,530
[Smart and tactful] [Always think
out of the box] [Master is travelling]

355
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,880
Mao Xiaojun

356
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,400
had like Four-eyed Girl
since he was little.

357
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,950
Which is Nan Xing.

358
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,260
So he created

359
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,690
Xiao Wudi, the big hero.

360
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,670
He wanted him to protect Nan Xing.

361
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:11,810
Arguably,

362
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,210
you have the power that Mao Xiaojun wanted

363
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,270
but he couldn't possess.

364
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,820
After he died,

365
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,800
you inherited

366
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,020
his thinking and emotion.

367
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,370
Now,

368
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,170
you're the ideal vision

369
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,940
of who Mao Xiaojun wanted to be.

370
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:31,130
Well.

371
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,150
Xiao Wudi, congratulations

372
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,960
on passing the final test.

373
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,350
Test?

374
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,910
Didn't you say

375
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,010
I'll disappear?

376
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,800
Yes.

377
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,700
Xiao Wudi, Young Master Hehuan,

378
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,050
has disappeared.

379
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,260
Xiao Wudi.

380
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,750
You're back.

381
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:02,880
Nan Xing.

382
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,810
I thought you couldn't come back again.

383
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:08,970
Nan Xing,

384
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,150
I saw a fairy just now.

385
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,500
He told me

386
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,050
that I've passed some sort of test.

387
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,860
And he said Young Master Hehuan

388
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,910
has disappeared forever from the world.

389
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:19,720
Look.

390
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,840
Isn't this Mao Xiaojun's notebook?

391
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,730
How did you get it?

392
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,280
The fairy gave it to me.

393
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,160
He said

394
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,670
this is the world I used to live in.

395
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,130
I remember it now.

396
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,280
I mentioned "Xiao Wudi",

397
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,910
this name to Mao Xiaojun before.

398
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,010
I didn't expect

399
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,110
that he secretly wrote so much about it.

400
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,680
So you're...

401
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,860
So I'm not

402
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,120
a character in your novel.

403
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,510
I'm a character

404
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,190
that Mao Xiaojun created.

405
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,840
He always had

406
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,390
a secret crush on you.

407
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,610
You don't have to go back anymore?

408
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,810
That fairy told me

409
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,620
that each day I go back

410
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,170
might be my last day here.

411
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,970
He wanted you to cherish me.

412
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:13,390
Or he'd...

413
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:58,750
Chu,

414
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,360
I've amended

415
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,410
the copyright contract.

416
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,420
Yufan,

417
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,620
I've confirmed the event venue.

418
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,620
Okay.

419
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,330
Miss Jiao,

420
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,770
this is Mr. Lu's schedule for next week.

421
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:23,990
Miss Ye,

422
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,140
we're really not used

423
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,660
to you working here.

424
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,460
Just call me Ye.

425
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,040
I... I'm going to have a meeting

426
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,800
with Haitao.

427
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,060
By the way,

428
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,420
I'll need you to interface

429
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,890
with Miss Shan.

430
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,940
Sure, no problem.

431
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,550
The meeting records

432
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,260
stated that we got

433
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,020
the issue of derivative copyright.

434
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,830
I think we should consider about it again.

435
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,590
No problem.

436
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,090
Mr. Lu.

437
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,060
Mr. Lu.

438
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:58,980
Mr. Lu.

439
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,900
Mr. Lu.

440

[The road to be a writer]

441
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,980
Come in.

442
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,520
Mr. Lu.

443
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,410
Thank you.

Pu'er raw tea?

445
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,720
Yes.

446
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,850
My boss

447
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,110
specially prepared this for you.

448
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,690
I didn't know

449
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,160
that he'd be so kind-hearted.

450
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,630
If there's nothing else

451
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,340
you need,

452
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,060
I'll excuse myself.

453
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,020
Wait.

454
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,910
Would you like a cup of tea?

455
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,800
Do you want the kid at the door

456
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,110
to get you one?

457
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:58,790
It's not necessary, Mr. Lu.

458
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,800
You can just tell me what's on your mind.

459
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,490
Didn't you leave the company?

460
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,460
Why did you come back all of a sudden?

461
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,970
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

462
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,530
This is a personal problem

463
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,110
between me and my boss.

464
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,210
It's a private matter.

465
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,260
I can't answer that.

466
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,180
Please understand.

467
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,340
Do you still remember

468
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,520
the deal that we had back then?

469
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,030
I remember it.

470
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,630
If I date

471
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,640
Zichen,

472
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,780
you'll divest from the company.

473
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,510
After all these years,

474
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,980
do you still hold it against me?

475
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,040
No.

476
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,460
Just that

477
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,400
I was unconvinced that time.

478
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,240
You were unconvinced that time.

479
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,250
What about now?

480
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,340
Now,

481
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,360
you've divested from the company.

482
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,700
But both of us

483
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,590
aren't knocked down.

484
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,370
Where are they?

485
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,970
In your office.

486
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,810
Do you find this interesting?

487
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,700
Mr. Lu,

488
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,700
you are

489
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,010
a socialite, after all.

490
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:14,850
Don't always

491
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,980
threaten a girl.

492
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,530
Just take it up with me
if you have a complaint.

493
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,310
I must tell you this today.

494
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,160
I insist on being with Ye Qing.

495
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:23,830
You can play

496
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,930
any tricks you like.

497
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,770
I won't let go

498
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,870
of her hands again.

499
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,630
This is my answer.

500
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,670
What's with your attitude?

501
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,360
How could you talk
to your father like this?

502
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,640
This company will become better

503
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,430
because of us.

504
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,110
We'll exceed you some day.

505
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,620
This is a good tea.

506
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,670
Thank you.

507
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,870
What are you looking at?

508
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,690
You have such a good tea in the company.

509
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,990
Why didn't you send me some of it?

510
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,630
Insensible.

511
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,690
Don't send it to my company.

512
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,320
Send it to home.

513
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:23,770
Well.

514
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,540
What did he say to you just now?

515
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,570
Actually,

516
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,380
the deal we had

517
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,940
was nothing personal.

518
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,370
There's an old saying,

519
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,310
no one knows a son
better than his father.

520
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,730
But I'm not sure,

521
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,040
with my son's personality,

522
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,620
what kind

523
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,930
of a girl is suitable

524
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,020
to stay

525
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,450
by his side.

526
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,460
So...

527
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,110
Actually, I understand you.

528
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,630
You always thought

529
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,760
that Zichen was vulnerable

530
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,270
and gullible.

531
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:57,450
That's why

532
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,090
you made that request

533
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,850
to test both of us.

534
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,980
But I don't think

535
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,660
you know him well.

536
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,100
He's much stronger than

537
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,230
you thought he was.

538
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,639
Don't break it to me.

539
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,489
At least

540
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,679
you should show me some respect.

541
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,199
It doesn't matter what he said.

542
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,040
What you said is all that matters.

543
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,070
Did you say that

544
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,870
on the spur of the moment?

545
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,760
Can I regret it if I said that

546
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,949
on the spur of the moment?

547
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,590
Of course you can't.

548
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,010
I've finished the novel.

549
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,480
It's very touching.

550
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,949
Ma Leng told Su Yu

551
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,300
that she loves the world.

552
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,300
He wanted her

553
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,730
to go all over the world.

554
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,330
I love this world

555
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,710
just like Su Yu does.

556
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,730
But in my world,

557
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,990
you are indispensable.

558
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,560
You were so handsome just now.

559
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,730
I was so handsome just now.

560
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,240
That is

561
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,890
how it was.

562
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,510
Aunt,

563
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,560
I'm sorry

564
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,070
to keep it from you for so long.

565
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,160
I should've told you

566
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,170
right from the start.

567
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,890
Indeed.

568
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,330
Everything is my fault.

569
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,590
It's got nothing to do with Nan Xing.

570
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:51,480
Mum.

571
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,270
You shut up.

572
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
So,

573
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,130
Xiong is a modern person

574
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,140
like us?

575
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,770
Let me see if it's true.

576
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,870
Mum, of course it's true.

577
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,020
He feels pain

578
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,110
and his body is warm.

579
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,490
Because he's a human.

580
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,750
I'm a human, aunt.

581
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,950
Besides losing your martial art skills,

582
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,210
are there any other

583
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,380
side effects?

584
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,470
Will you suddenly

585
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,570
be summoned back?

586
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,200
I won't go back again,

587
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,580
aunt.

588
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,590
I will...

589
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,600
I will stay here

590
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,030
and keep Nan Xing company.

591
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,830
Really?

592
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:42,920
For real.

593
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,020
Then, you make an oath

594
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,960
that you'll never leave Nan Xing.

595
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,530
I swear.

596
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,170
That I'll never leave Nan Xing.

597
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,860
I'll stay by her side

598
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,580
to take care of her and accompany her.

599
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,680
That's more like it.

600
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,990
Mum, you're not against us anymore?

601
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,840
I've never opposed

602
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,940
you guys, okay?

603
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:06,910
Both of you

604
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,080
always acted mysterious.

605
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,130
You wouldn't tell me anything.

606
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:09,930
And you hid it from me.

607
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:10,770
I've never been

608
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,110
through such a surreal thing.

609
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,140
But I think

610
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,730
Xiong truly wants

611
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,330
to cure

612
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,590
your panic attack

613
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,730
and he sincerely wants to be with you.

614
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,910
I was just worried.

615
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,850
I worried too much back then.

616
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,160
Xiong, I hope you don't mind.

617
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,880
Don't mention it, aunt.

618
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,100
You did nothing wrong.

619
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,150
If I were you,

620
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,280
I would make the same choice as well.

621
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,300
I knew you'd understand me.

622
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,480
Mum, be gentle.

623
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,200
How dare you defend him?

624
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,650
But...

625
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,840
-But what?
-But what?

626
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,420
If both of you

627
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,430
get married and have kids in the future,

628
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,910
how are you going to register the kids?

629
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,450
You can register them
under my family booklet.

630
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,130
We've already obtained

631
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:02,970
a household registration.

632
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,740
You have?

633
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,880
What about him?

634
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,250
[Identity Card]

635
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:09,270
Aunt.

636
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,870
You look so handsome.

637
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,130
This is definitely

638
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,140
the nicest identification photo
I've ever seen.

639
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,980
Thank you, aunt.

640
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,000
If both of you have kids,

641
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,760
I'm sure they will have big eyes
with double eyelids.

642
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,000
If it's a girl, she'll look like Xiong.

643
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,260
Look at this little face.

644
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,850
And you've got fair skin, right?

645
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,690
You've got great skin.

646
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,040
If it's a boy,

647
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,050
he'll look like his mum.

648
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,030
Like our Nan Xing.

649
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,160
He'll have long eye lashes

650
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,250
and bushy eyebrows.

651
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,550
How handsome he'll be.

652
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,480
Okay.

653
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,660
Let's plan the next move.

654
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,220
What do you mean by next move?

655
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,650
Of course it's your marriage.
