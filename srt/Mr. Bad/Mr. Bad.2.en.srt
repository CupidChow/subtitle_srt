[Episode 2]

4
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,130
Why are you...

5
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,460
What's your name?

6
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,380
My name is Nan Xing.

7
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,420
Nan Xing.

8
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,030
Are you the answer I'm looking for?

9
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,580
[What answer?]

10
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,300
[What does he mean?]

11
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,550
Even if you can't have my heart,

12
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,770
you can still have me,

13
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,460
right?

14
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,380
I...

15
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,770
You really don't want to have me?

16
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,700
Consider it

17
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,840
my way of repaying you for saving my life.

18
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,300
No way!

19
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,340
[This guy]

20
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,010
[must be talking nonsense again.]

21
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,210
[You think I will be scared, don't you?]

22
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,900
So what if yes?

23
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,300
As expected.

24
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,500
But how did she do it

25
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,070
with her intelligence?

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,160
Who are you talking about?

27
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,620
What's wrong with my intelligence?

28
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,750
You've been stuck here for a long time?

29
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,820
No.

30
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,860
Do you need help?

31
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,730
No.

32
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,180
I can do it myself.

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,030
You really don't need help?

34
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,300
Just stay away from me.

35
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,910
Alright.

36
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,380
I'll stand here waiting for you.

37
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,020
Mister,

38
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,980
can you do me a favour?

39
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,750
What's wrong with you guys?

40
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,230
Did you have a fight?

41
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,780
She's mad at me.

42
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,700
Shut up.

43
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,500
No.

44
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,980
I don't know him, mister.

45
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,550
Mister.

46
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,500
Don't go.

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,340
Miss,

48
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,980
can you do me a favour?

49
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,420
Hi, can you...

50
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,380
I...

51
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:33,700
You should have asked me
to help you earlier.

52
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,260
You...

53
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,900
Do I owe you money?

54
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,500
Can you stop following me?

55
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,740
Can you tell me now?

56
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,700
Tell what?

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Tell me how you

58
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,660
summoned me to this world.

59
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,380
Summoned?

60
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,740
World?

61
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,800
Which mental institution

62
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,020
did you run away from?

63
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,500
No wonder you're dressed like this.

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,540
This is

65
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
the 21st century.

66
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,940
I came from the reign of

67
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,100
Zhengde of the Ming Dynasty.

68
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,820
It is 500 years from now.

69
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,580
Everyone dresses like this

70
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,300
in the world I belong to.

71
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,740
You really can't understand all this

72
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,260
with your intelligence.

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,220
So when I questioned you just now,

74
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,340
you were talking nonsense?

75
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,220
You...

76
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,180
You say you're an ancient?

77
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:45,820
I know

78
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,420
that time travel is still

79
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,340
unattainable

80
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,690
for people of this era.

81
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,020
But I am indeed

82
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,340
an ancient.

83
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,780
Assuming what you say is true,

84
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,659
I mean assuming,

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,180
what does that have to do with me?

86
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,780
Because there is a good chance

87
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,100
that the person who summoned me is you.

88
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,620
Why?

89
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,940
Do you remember yesterday when you said

90
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,140
you saw me in the water in a dream

91
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,380
and woke up

92
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,540
to find me in your arms?

93
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,730
Who are you?

94
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:17,980
Yes.

95
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,500
I still haven't

96
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
figured that out.

97
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,620
That was the first summoning.

98
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,580
First?

99
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,300
Is there a second time?

100
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:25,700
Just now,

101
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,340
I appeared behind you out of nowhere.

102
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,900
Don't you ever wonder?

103
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,580
I thought you were a stalker.

104
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,130
I was

105
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,659
in the library

106
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,540
and the next thing I knew
I was on the street.

107
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,740
This is the response to your summoning.

108
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,580
How is this possible?

109
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,280
This is too unscientific.

110
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,700
Gosh. Stop displaying
affection in public.

111
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,730
Please.

112
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,580
Did you say that?

113
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,980
How could you hear me?

114
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,659
Who are you?

115
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,480
Don't come any closer.

116
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,700
Tell me who you really are.

117
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,690

[Xiao Wudi.]

129
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,220
How did this all happen?

130
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,780
Because I made a wish?

131
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,980
But how can this be a wish?

132
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,660
What did you wish for?

133
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,020
Why are you following me?

134
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,710
I thought

135
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,020
I had got rid of you.

136
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,980
I'm a famous man

137

138

How can you get rid of me?

139
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,820
Why do you have to pester me?

140
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,300
If you're really an ancient,

141
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,780
you should be happy.

142
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,980
We have good food,

143
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
nice clothes

144
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,700
and medical equipment.

145
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,460
You can enjoy

146
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,500
modern life

147
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,220
to the fullest here.

148
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,480
I don't want to be here.

149
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,790
I want to go back.

150
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,140
Go ahead then.

151
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,659
You summoned me here,

152
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,620
how do you expect me
to get back on my own?

153
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,740
I'm not capable of that.

154
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,780
I know you aren't capable of that.

155
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
So you must have

156
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,750
accidentally triggered something.

157
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,740
Now think about it.

158
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,060
What happened

159
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,380
last night?

160
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Last night,

161
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,340
I came over to make a wish.

162
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,420
Make a wish?

163
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,500
You didn't

164
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,850
wish for a handsome man

165
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,460
from heaven, did you?

166
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,420
Aren't you ashamed

167
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,380
to say that?

168
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,540
Aren't you ashamed to make such a wish?

169
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,300
I didn't make such a wish.

170
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,260
I made a wish

171
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,520
that I would pass my interview today.

172
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,220
Then, I met

173
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,180
a couple

174
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,580
and got irritated by them.

175
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,450
Then, I

176
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,880
said...

177
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,540
What's the big deal about falling in love?

178
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,980
I would like to fall in love

179
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,940
if I could.

180
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,820
I want an

181
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,380
unforgettable love too.

182
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,270
What did you say?

183
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,700
I said something casual.

184
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,590
What's that?

185
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,760
I've forgotten it.

186
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,419
It's not important.

187
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,600
The important thing is

188
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,020
that I dropped my coins in there.

189
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,220
Then, I had a dream

190
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,840
while I was looking for it.

191
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,580
[I saw you in the water in my dream.]

192
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,500
You're next to me again

193
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,460
when I woke up.

194
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,700
This coin has been in my hand

195
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,380
since I first woke up.

196
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,980
You said you saw me in a dream?

197
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,020
Yes.

198
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,060
How did you do it?

199
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,540
You are a hypnotist,

200
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,170
virtual reality,

201
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:14,860
magician,

202
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,660
-or...
-Cut the crap.

203
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,220
Come on.

204
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,380
What?

205
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,530
I...

206
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,580
This is my...

207
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,580
Do it all again

208
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,260
to send me back.

209
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,970
[Let's give it a go.]

210
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,120
[Let's just play along with him.]

211
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,170
[Dear fairy,]

212
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,300
[if it was you]

213
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,960
[who brought Xiao Wudi here,]

214
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
[please take him back the same way.]

215
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:44,940
[I can't handle]

216
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,460
[this gift.]

217
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,790
[I beg you, please.]

218
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,820
After that?

219
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,740
Throw it in.

220
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,900
This is precious. I can't...

221
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,100
Look.

222
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,300
Nothing happens.

223
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,520
I told you it had nothing to do with me.

224
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,910
Now, it's time to dream.

225
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,740
That's not something
you can do just like that.

226
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,340
You can do it while you sleep.

227
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
It's not a good idea for us to do this.

228
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,740
If anyone sees us

229
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,180
lying here,

230
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,140
they'll think we're
committing suicide for love.

231
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,900
Do you want me to go back or not?

232
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,220
I do.

233
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,700
But how can I fall asleep like this?

234
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,530
Is there nothing you can do

235
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,700
if you can't sleep?

236
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,690
Tortoise Breathing Technique.

237
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,860
I can definitely fall asleep

238
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,900
between three breaths.

239
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,740
Don't worry about me.

240
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,780
You should sleep first.

241
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,940
Where am I?

242
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,820
Is this still Fairy Fountain Park?

243
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,660
How did I get here?

244
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,280
My place is quite nice, right?

245
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,100
Mister,

246
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,260
why are you here?

247
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,740
Why can't I be here?

248
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,940
This is my fairyland.

249
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,180
Of course I'm here.

250
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,580
Let me formally introduce myself.

251
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,180
I'm Fairy Zhen.

252
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,670
What have you done to me?

253
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,740
Why did you

254
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,820
bring me here?

255
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,500
Didn't you ask for

256
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,720
an unforgettable love yourself?

257
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,860
So I got Xiao Wudi

258
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,930
for you.

259
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,140
Xiao Wudi?

260
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,060
An unforgettable love?

261
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,390
He's handsome, right?

262
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,220
I'll fight you.

263
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,580
You...

264
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,370
You...

265
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,850
You

266
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,780
bite the hand that feeds you, huh?

267
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,460
You're being ungrateful, aren't you?

268
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,180
You're pissing me off.

269
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,620
Anyway, I don't want to be in love

270
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,220
with Xiao Wudi.

271
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,220
What's wrong with

272
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,940
Xiao Wudi?

273
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,900
He's Young Master Hehuan.

274
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,340
He's a handsome and intelligent man

275
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,780
with outstanding skills in both literary

276
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,700
and martial arts.

277
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,430
What is it about Xiao Wudi
that makes him unworthy

278
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,380
of a discus girl like you
who has never been in love?

279
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,780
He's a bad guy!

280
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,620
I wrote it myself.

281
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,350
Don't I know what he's like?

282
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,220
Devious and sinister,

283
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,420
full of mischief and ill will.

284
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,580
Do you like him?

285
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,940
We all

286
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,590
have our shortcomings,

287
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,220
right?

288
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,990
Be tolerant.

289
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,940
I just don't want him anyway.

290
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,130
I don't want him.

291
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,660
Take him back.

292
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,060
I can't take him back.

293
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,150
My magical powers are limited too.

294
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,480
Since it has happened,

295
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,340
You... You'll just have to
make do with him.

296
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,140
Why?

297
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,800
How could this happen to me

298
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,540
in my

299
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,530
great years of youth?

300
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,300
What am I going to do?

301
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,060
Actually, there is good news.

302
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,140
Human beings are very vulnerable.

303
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,670
A lifetime is not that long.

304
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,540
Humans have a short life span.

305
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,980
You just face it like this.

306
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,970
Put up with it for the rest of your life.

307
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,300
May you have long legs

308
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,660
in your next life.

309
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,260
Okay?

310
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,380
Long legs, huh?

311
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,260
Wait here.

312
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,940
What are you...

313
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,420
You...

314
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,060
Does it make sense for you to do this?

315
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,580
I am the fairy here.

316
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,060
Let me be frank.

317
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,020
Xiao Wudi

318
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,900
is the best match for you

319
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,500
in the world.

320
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,300
Get along well with him.

321
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,460
Cherish the time you spend with him.

322
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,350
Besides,

323
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,380
you can't stay much longer

324
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,460
in my place.

325
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,860
Take this back with you.

326
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,340
The dream was real.

327
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,860
No.

328
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,300
No.

329
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,500
I don't want him!

330
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,820
You're back.

331
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,460
Nan Xing,

332
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,560
what's wrong with you?

333
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,110
Are you alright?

334
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,980
You don't have a fever, right?

335
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,660
No.

336
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,460
Alright, you don't have a fever.

337
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,790
I thought you had a cold.

338
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,900
No.

339
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,460
I'm just a little too tired

340
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,920
from the interview today.

341
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,660
Would you like something to eat then?

342
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,060
I'll make you something.

343
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,700
It's fine.

344
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,180
I want to take a nap.

345
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,540
[Maybe]

346
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,710
[her interview didn't go well today.]

347
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,980
I'm going out of town

348
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,060
with the dance team tomorrow.

349
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,340
Would you like to join us?

350
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,800
Let's get away for a break.

351
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,140
I'm good.

352
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,700
I don't feel like going out much lately.

353
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,060
Alright.

354
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,100
Take a break then.

355
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,230
Have a good rest.

356
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,740
Okay.

357
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,500
Call me if you need anything.

358
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,220
Right.

359
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,740
All I have to do is delete the novel,

360
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,869
and the character will cease to exist.

361
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,500
Yes, delete it and I'll be fine.

362

It's deleted.

368
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,500
This should make him disappear.

369
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,840
Should I go out and have a look?

370
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,620
No.

371
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,080
What if he doesn't disappear?

372
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,910
What if he can still find me?

373
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,340
That can't be.

374
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,530
I'm at home now.

375
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,860

As long as I'm home,

379
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,300
I'm safe.

380
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,340
I won't go out.

381
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,850
I won't go out.

I won't go out.

Sorry about yesterday.

398
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,930
I was in a hurry

to get back

It's okay.

525
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,300
being adapted for films.

526
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,980
I've heard

527
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,580
that some of the most
popular young talents

528
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,420
have already made it

529
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,020
to the casting call.

530
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,420
Is it true?

531
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,420
Yes.

532
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,710
But I don't think they can do it.

533
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,820
There is still

534
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,380
a serious public outcry.

535
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,850
Jiao and I

536
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,140
have also made some proposals

537
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,300
to discuss

538
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,700
how to deal with this problem.

539
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,300
We don't have to deal with it.

540
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,580
Boss,

541
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,980
we're not afraid of being scolded.

542
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,340
It's just that their head office

543
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,140
is very close to

544
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,060
one of the investors of our film.

545
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,220
They are now

546
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,260
a tad unhappy

547
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,420
with your statement.

548
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,780
Commercial department warns

549
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,510
of the risk of

550
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,860
disinvestment at any time.

551
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,580
It's okay.

552
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,780
They were the ones

553
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,060
who let the news out.

554
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,420
There is a big difference

555
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,260
between these candidates

556
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,590
and the image of Ma Leng.

557
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,940
Based on the protection of the work

558
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,780
and the character,

559
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,310
there's no problem
with the boss's response.

560
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,500
Besides, things are still up in the air,

561
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,690
but they're making hype

562
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,620
out of our book.

563
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,940
We should consider

564
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,500
whether we should continue

565
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,160
to work with such an investor.

566
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,500
Our company's goal this year

567
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,900
is still to select new authors.

568
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,840
Ye Qing and I

569
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,090
founded X-Culture

570
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,260
not to sell the rights to make films,

571
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,500
but to give more young writers

572
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,540
like me back then

573
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,220
a chance

574
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,340
to write good works

575
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,940
and make a better life.

576
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,260
You all may continue.

577
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,900
That's all for today.

578
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,590
Dismiss.

579
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,140
Jiao,

580
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,650
how's the president's office
doing with the recruitment?

581
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,340
Quite good.

582
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,380
HR just gave me
a few profiles of graduates

583
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,980
from prestigious universities.

584
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,530
They are also good in all aspects.

585
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,420
Is there someone named Nan Xing

586
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,260
in the list of assistant to the president?

587
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,540
Nan Xing?

588
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,590
I don't think so.

589
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,710
I'll look for it.

590
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,060
No, as I recall.

591
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,520
All the profiles of candidates are here.

592
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,100
As I said, no.

593
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,940
I think she was on the list

594
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,900
for the initial interview.

595
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,220
Show me her profile.

596
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,680
[Takeaway]

597
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,660
[Today's spending: 1070 yuan]

598
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,780
[I'm going broke.]

599
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,420
[I'm going to be broke]

600
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,820
[before I can find a job.]

601
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,140
[I don't know if there's love,]

602
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,140
[but these are enough to make him]

603
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,740
[etched in my heart.]

604
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,220
Mr. Xiao,

605
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,960
is that all you can eat?

606
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,770
Would you like some more?

607
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,100
I don't have a good appetite

608
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,580
in the morning.

609
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,340
So why did you ask me to order so much?

610
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,900
Is it still a human life

611
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,510
to have less than 10 dishes for breakfast?

612
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,220
[If I had known this,
I would have written you]

613
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,020
[as a lackey of a beggar's gang.]

614
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:02,330
[Just go out and beg for food yourself.]

615
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,230
You seem to have
a good sense of propriety.

616
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,980
I'm done eating.

617
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,350
Those leftovers

618
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,850
are yours to enjoy.

619
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,100
You're treating me

620
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,030
like your servant now, aren't you?

621
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,810
I'm not treating you like a servant.

622
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,180
You're not worthy

623
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,780
of being my servant.

624
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,580
You're just my hostage.

625
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,510
Do you know what hostage means?

626
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:40,980
I do.

627
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,220
Don't eat.

628
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,140
Clean up and come to me.

629
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Go to you?

630
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,380
Where are you going?

631
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,380
Where are you going?

632
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,770
Take a bath and change my clothes.

633
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,580
Don't use

634
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,240
other people's bathroom.

635
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,260
You don't know how to use

636
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,720
the modern shower we have.

637
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,000
What's so difficult about it?

638
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,900
You'd better go out.

639
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,700
Don't try to scare me with this.

640
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,060
Am I trying to scare you?

641
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,500
Pervert.

642
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,430
Stand there.

643
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,780
Did I tell you to leave?

644
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,340
I've noticed that you have all these

645
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,340
flush toilet,

646
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,820
water heater

647
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,340
and bathtub

648
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,660
in one set.

649
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,900
This generation of yours

650
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,460
has more pleasure

651
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,020
than the Emperor of Ming.

652
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,500
How do you know everything?

653
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,020
I am a man who has been to

654
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,950
the library.

655
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,380
You've been to the library

656
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,980
and you know everything?

657
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,610
Well, not everything.

658
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
For example, there's one thing

659
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,440
I don't understand right now.

660
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,780
What is it?

661
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,300
Why are you still wearing a blindfold?

662
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,500
Is it because I'm not good-looking

663
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,410
or because you're afraid to look at me?

664
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,580
What am I afraid to look at?

665
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,650
I am a modern adult woman,

666
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,320
what am I afraid to look at?

667
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,980
I'll look at you now.

668
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,210
You're good at saying tongue twisters.

669
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,700
Since you've got your clothes on,

670
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,570
get out now.

671
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,460
Thank you.

672
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,360
No problem.

673
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,140
Xiao Wudi!

674
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,580
This is TV?

675
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,070
You can learn it all without a teacher?

676
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,200
I'm an ancient,

677
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
not an idiot.

678
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,200
A little research

679
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,540
into such tricks is all that is required.

680
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,220
[Yes, I'm the idiot now.]

681
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,470
Good.

682
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,710
Come here.

683
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,360
What is good?

684
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,260
Why did you ask me to go there?

685
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,880
Your mother should

686
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,900
want to talk to me.

687
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,430
Get me a pair of scissors.

688
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,620
While I'm in there,

689
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,780
go and get

690
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,260
some men's clothes.

691
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,510
What do you need scissors for?

692
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,340
Judging by the situation,

693
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
I'll have to stay here for a while.

694
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,570
I can't appear

695
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,700
as an ancient person every day, right?

696
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,160
No men's clothes in our house.

697
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,420
Aren't there two men there?

698
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,620
They are both

699
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,330
gone.

700
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,320
You have to think of a way then.

701
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,660
How am I going to think of a way for you?

702
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,700
If you can't think of a way out,

703
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,130
you're on your own.

704
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,780
How am I

705
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,260
going to think of a way for you?

706
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,530
I have a new idea.

707
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,060
After the murder,

708
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,120
Su Yu dived into

709
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,140
the deep sea of the Great Blue Hole
to investigate the case.

710
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,510
By then,

711
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,970
she would have found the key clue

712
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,700
at the bottom of the sea

713
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,740
but sunk in danger.

714
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,020
Will Ma Leng save her?

715
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:04,990
Of course.

716
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,320
I've pretty much thought

717
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,480
of a way to save her.

718
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,810
But there is one key question

719
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,330
that I think needs to be

720
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,440
discussed further.

721
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,120
So I thought that tonight...

722
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:12,930
Come in.

723
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:13,890
Miss Ye.

724
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:14,730
Mr. Lu.

725
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,070
This is the document you want.

726
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,400
Are you free tonight?

727
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,440
Let's have dinner

728
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:20,970
and talk.

729
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,020
Can we make it tomorrow?

730
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,650
I've got a date tonight.

731
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,450
Alright.

732
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:33,930
Wait a minute.

733
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,230
Miss Ye,

734
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,970
today is your birthday, right?

735
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:52,410
Yes.

736
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,230
Happy birthday to you.

737
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,920
Thank you.

738
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,850
The boss is quite harsh.

739
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,600
[Nan Xing.
Job Search: Assistant to the President]

740
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,610
Nobody would ask someone

741
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,660
for a work dinner on his birthday.

742
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:02,520
Why?

743
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,450
You want to buy me dinner too?

744
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,770
No.

745
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,300
That's not what I meant.

746
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,050
Miss Ye, go ahead with your work,

747
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,170
I'll get back to my work now.

748
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:09,680
Bye.

749
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,690
I've arrived.

750

Come on, take it.

Si Si.

752
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,690
As soon as I got your call,

753
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,690
I rushed to take it off

755
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,480
How is it? Is that okay?

756
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,140
No problem.

757
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,400
What are you doing?

758
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,450
I'm going to the toilet.

759
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,130
I can't hold back anymore.

760
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,130
Go to McDonald's.

761
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:33,900
McDonald's?

762
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,610
Nan Xing, I want to use the toilet

763
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,330
and you ask me to go to McDonald's?

764
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,460
My toilet is broken.

765
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,210
Nan Xing,

766
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,030
there are so many food.

767
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,130
That's my leftover supper

768
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,060
from yesterday.

769
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,490

[Where are the clothes?]

Just go to McDonald's.

773
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Is that the stench

774
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,210
of love I smell?

[have you got for me?]

If you want to wear international brands,

you should kidnap a rich woman.

Okay?

You don't have to explain it.

Who is this guy?

841
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,800
of any other specific characteristics

842
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,660
of the person that you can recall.

843

It's definitely not him.

844
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,010
The tattoo on his hand is different

845
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,370
from that of the thief.

Why don't you come back
to the office with me

Yes, I have.

Stay safe.

860
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,770
This robbery ring is in fact

861
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,480
related to the last ram-raiding

No, not yet.

-Bye.

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,370
these bad guys must not be allowed

871
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,760
to get away with it so easily.

872
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,220
I got it.

873
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,130
Besides,

874
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,220
why do I feel like

875
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,170
a lot of people in our division

876
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:19,930
know you?

877
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:20,930
You've just been transferred here

878
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,130
and don't know it yet.

879
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,890
Nan Xing is amazing.

880
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,450
She has helped us catch a lot of bad guys

881
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,050
and is our crime buster here.

882
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,090
No, you flatter me.

883
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,850
Especially now.

884
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,570
It's unexpected.

885
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,650
Come, this way.

886
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,180
[Chinese Handsome Boy]

887
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,130
Mister,

888
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,210
how can I help you?

889
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,490
You are a shop assistant, right?

890
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,770
This.

891
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,040
Mister,

892
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,650
have you decided which one you want?

893
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:34,790
All of them.

894
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,330
Can he afford them?

895
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,810
Count the money

896
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,170
you need.

897
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,930
Mister,

898
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,840
please wait a minute.

899
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,570
Quick, make him a cup of coffee.

900
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,000
[With money,
you can do anything you like.]

901
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,500
[It's been 500 years,]

902
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,260
[human nature never changes.]

903
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,600
I wonder if Xiao Wudi is causing me

904
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,250
any trouble at home.

905
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,290
Nothing good has happened to me

906
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,690
since he's been here.

907
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,450
He's going to put me in danger

908
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,850
one day.

909
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,210
Dear fairy,

910
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,040
you sent him here

911
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,610
to punish me, right?

912
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,610
Hello.

913
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,180
Who is speaking?

914
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,050
[Are you Nan Xing?]

915
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,690
Yes.

916
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:23,770
[Hi.]

917
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,010
[I am a HR officer of X-Culture.]

918
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,050
[You came to our company yesterday]

919
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,730
[for an interview for the position
of assistant to the president,]

920
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,260
[right?]

921
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,330
Yes.

922
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,370
[I'm calling to inform you]

923
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,100
[that you have been selected.]

924
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:39,970
Sorry.

925
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,050
I'm too excited.

926
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,960
I thought I had failed.

927
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,330
[You are indeed selected.]

928
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,730
[Full details]

929
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,010
[are in the email.]

930
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
[It has been sent]

931
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,650
[to your email address.]

932
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:51,730
Okay.

933
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:52,700
Alright.

934
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
I'll check it now.

935
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,580
Yes, I have received it.

936
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,050
[If there is no problem,]

937
00:42:59,050 --> 00:42:59,930
[we will wait for you]

938
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,370
[to report to the office tomorrow.]

939
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,920
Okay. Thank you!

940
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,560
It's true.

941
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,490
X-Culture.

942
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,290
Senior Lu.

943
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,930
He didn't recognise me,

944
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,010
did he?

945
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,730
He didn't see me

946
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,700
at the book signing event, did he?

947
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,010
No, I can't do this.

948
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,200
People will think

949
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,530
I got in by the back door.

950
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:37,580
Stand there!

951
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,170
Don't run!

952
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:04,990
Don't come any closer.

953
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,350
Don't come any closer.

954
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,020
I've called the police.

955
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,770
Fire.

956
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,250
Help.

957
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,810
Help.
