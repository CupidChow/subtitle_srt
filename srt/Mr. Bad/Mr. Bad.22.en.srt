[Mr. Bad]

00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:32,190
[Episode 22]

4
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,390
Are you still bothered

5
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,780
by what Ms. An said?

6
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,520
Times are different now.

7
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,100
She didn't really mean it.

8
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,860
She won't stop you from seeing me.

9
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,900
It is not about that.

10
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,420
So what's bothering you?

11
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,700
I am just wondering

12
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,460
how much you like Mao Xiaojun.

13
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,580
So many years have passed.

14
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,930
Why are you still

15
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,060
not moving on?

16
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,700
Are you jealous?

17
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,340
A little.

18
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,759
Anyway,

19
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,860
I didn't like him as much as I like you.

20
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,340
It is true.

21
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,060
Do you remember I told you

22
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,650
that he and I were close
because we grew up together?

23
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,280
Actually, we were

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,140
only close

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,660
when we were kids.

26
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,980
As we grew older,

27
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,660
he suddenly stopped

28
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,860
telling me what's on his mind.

29
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,140
Besides, he didn't seem to notice me.

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,900
I knocked.

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,700
I knocked again.

32
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,420
I knocked. But you didn't hear me.

33
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,340
Go out.

34
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,400
What are you doing?
Writing diary?

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,380
Go out.

36
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,140
I am just curious

37
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,980
what you are doing in the room all day.

38
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,140
Okay. I got it. I am leaving.

39
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,940
Mao Xiaojun.

40
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,260
Wait up.

41
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,100
[He was also like that]

42
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,060
[when we were in school.]

43
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,700
[He didn't let me talk to him.]

44
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,980
What a coincidence.

45
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,940
Why are you here?

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,660
I will say this one more time.

47
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,840
Next time when we are in school,

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,140
don't pretend that you know me.

49
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,620
And don't talk to me too.

50
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,820
I don't have to pretend that I know you.

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,020
I have known you for a long time.

52
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,270
After that,

53
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,060
he triggered my desire to win.

54
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,220
I thought

55
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,780
[maybe if I confessed my feelings,]

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,660
[he would start talking to me again.]

57
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,540
Mao Xiaojun.

58
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,140
What do you want?

59
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,060
I like...

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,920
Didn't I tell you to

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,290
go home by yourself?

62
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,960
Stop following me

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,820
or looking for me.

64
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,780
[Mao Xiao Jun]

65
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,060
I didn't say anything in the end.

66
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,840
Ms. An knows

67
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,260
how I feel.

68
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,380
She knows I am a bit slow

69
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,620
which is why she's always

70
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,660
purposely

71
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,300
creating opportunities for me.

72
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,110
Nan Xing, hurry up.

73
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,020
I am running late.

74
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,580
Don't forget your homework.

75
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,220
You are going out?

76
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,080
Nan Xing.

77
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,820
Aunt An.

78
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,980
You need to work overtime?

79
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,380
I am on night shift.

80
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,510
Then why don't you

81
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,580
let Nan Xing stay with us?

82
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,180
She won't get a good sleep
in the laboratory.

83
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,660
I can't trouble you like that
all the time.

84
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,010
It is no trouble at all.

85
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,470
I was actually thinking of

86
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,170
cooking more dishes tonight

87
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,970
and would like to ask you

88
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,140
to join us for dinner.

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,380
Thanks.

90
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,860
But we have eaten.

91
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,580
Then after making dinner,

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,540
I will ask Xiaojun to send you
some food for late-night supper.

93
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,340
Okay.

94
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,300
I still can eat.

95
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,820
Xiaojun needs to study.

96
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,580
You'd better not disturb him.

97
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,020
Don't say that.

98
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,480
You might not feel like eating

99
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,659
but Nan Xing does.

100
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,340
Right?

101
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,540
That was the day

102
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,380
the fire broke out at the laboratory.

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,220
My dad is still in there.

104
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,270
Nan Xing.

105
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,510
Are you okay?

106
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,420
My dad is still in there.

107
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,910
I'll go save your dad.

108
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,940
Mao Xiaojun.

109
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,820
Don't worry.

110
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,740
Wait here.

111
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,300
Uncle Nan.

112
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,140
Let's get out.

113
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,700
Dad. Dad!

114
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,860
Mao Xiaojun.

115
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,220
Mao Xiaojun!

116
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,940
He was so nice,

117
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,380
so smart

118
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,660
and so outstanding.

119
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,420
He could achieve

120
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,700
whatever he wanted to achieve.

121
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,540
Sometimes I even think that.

122
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,330
Except sports,

123
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,380
I am not good at anything.

124
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,020
Sometimes I think

125
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,660
he should be the one

126
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,140
to survive.

127
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,900
He might even be more outstanding

128
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,980
than my boss.

129
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,900
Besides, Ms. An

130
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,860
wouldn't be so sad.

131
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,860
It is just that he was
such a good person...

132
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,610
He was a good person.

133
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,060
But he died because of me.

134
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,740
He died in vain for someone

135
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,620
he hated so much.

136
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,860
He didn't hate you.

137
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,730
Actually, he had always liked you.

138
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,780
How is that possible?

139
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,350
If he was alive,

140
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,560
he would have woken up
out of anger at me.

141
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,000
He hated stupid people.

142
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,860
It is true.

143
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,260
Since returning from Hehuan Palace,

144
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,170
I had a dream about him.

145
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,620
Actually, those times
you thought he hated you

146
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,850
were just his way

147
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,060
of liking you.

148
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,040
How is that possible?

149
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,180
You don't even know him.

150
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,140
How could you dream of him?

151
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,090
Stop worrying about me.

152
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,140
After my work in the company

153
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,060
is all done,

154
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,060
I will ask my boss

155
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,300
for a two-day leave.

156
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,460
I will take a two-day break

157
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,900
to spend with you. How about that?

158
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,820
Alright. Let's go home.

159
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,620
Come on.

160
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,420
He was such a good person.

161
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,940
But he died because of me.

162
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,900
He died in vain for someone

163
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,170
he hated so much.

164
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,900
Sometimes I think

165
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,500
he should be the one

166
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,940
to survive.

167
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,500
The doctor said

168
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,060
this can only be solved
by the one who caused it.

169
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,940
But the people who can
untie the knot in my heart

170
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,260
are dead.

171
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,360
In exchange for your return

172
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,340
to save Nan Xing,

173
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,140
you have to complete a mission.

174
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,940
So this is the mission.

175
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,940
Can I ask you something?

What?

177
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,180

found that his beloved woman

179

is suffering

180
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,740

to untie the knot in her heart,

182
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,620
but the result of this

183
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,030
would be his disappearance

That's why I am very worried.

349
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,710
What's going on with you two?

350
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,260
Is there something

351
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,860
you can't solve?

352
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,800
Aunt An,

353
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,520
actually, I am not

354
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,950
from this world.

355
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,100
I am a fictional character
of Nan Xing's novel,

356
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,150
Xiao Wudi.

357
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:20,830
Hence,

358
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,470
I can't stay in this world.

359
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,370
He is so cool.

360
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,140
Mum, when did you come home?

361
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,660
Right after I finished working.

362
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,900
This Xiao Wudi

363
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,040
is more charming than

364
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,510
your male lead, Lu Zichen.

365
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,090
I got it now.

366
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,870
You two must be

367
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,260
treating me like a three year old kid.

368
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:48,930
Right?

369
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,050
How can you expect me
to believe a story like this

370
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,440
that you have made up?

371
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,190
Aunt An.

372
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,600
So

373
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,690
how did you

374
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,000
come to this world?

375
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,520
I only realised yesterday

376
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,780
my mission

377
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,410
in this world.

378
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,840
Mission?

379
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,850
Actually,

380
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,070
I am here to heal Nan Xing.

381
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,540
This is my mission.

382
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,380
You mean her panic disorder?

383
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,340
Yes.

384
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,380
The doctor said her treatment back then

385
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,350
wasn't very successful.

386
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,410
But

387
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,460
this can only be solved
by the one who caused it.

388
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,440
Both her father

389
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,700
and my son

390
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,880
are dead.

391
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,940
Regarding that,

392
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,370
you must have got it wrong.

393
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,960
Actually, the one who caused it

394
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,600
has always been Nan Xing.

395
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,360
She is the one

396
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,670
who created the knot in her heart.

397
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,190
If she doesn't let something out,

398
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,870
she will never be able to untie the knot.

399
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,600
What do you want to do then?

400
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,210
I need your help.

401
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,910
Yes. Come in.

402
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,210
Other than

403
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,140
these few terms and conditions,

404
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,020
the rest are fine.

405
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,110
Thank you.

406
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,170
Feel free to contact me
if you have a problem.

407
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,190
Mr. Lu, are you looking for me?

408
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,050
I have approved your resignation.

409
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,900
You can focus on writing from now on.

410
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,430
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lu.

411
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,200
Becoming an author

412
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:53,670
won't be as easy as being an assistant.

413
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,430
I have high expectations of the pieces.

414
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,690
Got it.

415
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,360
But...

416
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,080
I know.

417
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,250
I will leave

418
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,770
when the new assistant takes up her post.

419
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,750
You can deal with
the Human Resource Department then.

420
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,130
When you are on it, help me to find

421
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,980
if there is any suitable candidate.

422
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,260
Why don't you sit in

423
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,640
during the interview?

424
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,780
That's not necessary. I trust you.

425
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,790
I will send you
the remaining information

426
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,670
after I organise them

427
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,640
tomorrow.

428
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,940
Okay. We'll get going now.

429
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,530
-Alright.
-Bye.

430
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,110
Bye.

431
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,480
Why are you here?

432
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,670
I am here to celebrate Nan Xiaoxing

433
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,190
officially becoming a full-time author.

434
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,170
Didn't I tell you

435
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,090
I would be having dinner

436
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,100
with Miss Ye today?

437
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,480
I told you not to come over.

438
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,490
I know.

439
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,510
That's why I came to cut in.

440
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,860
I want to be the first person

441
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,910
to share your happiness.

442
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,650
I thought you would think

443
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,330
I am too impulsive.

444
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,380
How would I?

445
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,140
You have a talent.

446
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,650
Of course you have to use it.

447
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,710
Besides, when I think of

448
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,010
the fact that you don't need
to be Lu Zichen's

449
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,890
assistant,

450
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,670
I am all for it.

451
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,820
But with this change,

452
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,540
I will have a lot of work to do.

453
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,550
There will be a lot of stuff to hand over.

454
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,110
I won't have time to accompany you.

455
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,750
Don't worry.

456
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,590
I will find every opportunity

457
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,270
to accompany you.

458
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,660
Since you're going to
have dinner with Miss Ye,

459
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,880
I'll send you there.

460
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,470
After your dinner,

461
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,440
I'll go and pick you up.

462
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,330
Why are you so nice?

463
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,390
Of course. You just noticed it now?

464
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,940
Let's go.

465
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,050
Since I can't have dinner
with you tonight,

466
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,640
I'll treat you to a big meal
tomorrow night.

467
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,110
How about that?

468
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,280
Great.

469
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,380
Let me think

470
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,480
what Xiao Wudi likes to eat.

471
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,910
He told me

472
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,420
he must have at least 10 dishes

473
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,930
for breakfast.

474
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,620
Then, let's have dim sum for breakfast.

475
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,090
We can order egg tarts.

476
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,280
-[My time here]
-Shrimp dumpling.

477
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,100
[is running out.]

478
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,930
Stir-fried rice noodles with beef.

479
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,900
-[Whatever you do, I'll accompany you.]
-And chicken feet.

480
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,830
Here comes the food.
It is still piping hot.

481
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,630
This is a lot.

482
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,720
Nan Xing,

483
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,400
we don't have customers now.

484
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,210
Qing will eat with you.

485
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,090
Okay.

486
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,110
Here, mum.

487
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,630
We serve these here.

488
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,270
Try them out and give me some feedback.

489
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,650
Sure. Thanks, Mrs. Ye.

490
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,040
One more dish is on the way.

491
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,090
You may start eating first.

492
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:27,510
Okay.

493
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,140
Don't trouble yourself, Mrs. Ye.

494
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,410
Quick, eat while they are still hot.

495
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,050
Try these.

496
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,690
These are all from my mum.

497
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,470
Congratulations

498
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,570
on becoming an author,

499
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,790
Miss Nan Xing.

500
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,060
Don't tease me.

501
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,860
Actually, when I first

502
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,910
went for the job interview,

503
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,340
I only thought of

504
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,270
getting the job

505
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,450
so that I can

506
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,750
work with my idol.

507
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,630
I never thought

508
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,720
you would give me that opportunity.

509
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,450
It never even crossed my mind

510
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,000
that you would encourage me to write

511
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:58,880
and make me believe

512
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,310
that I can become an author.

513
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,120
This is all thanks to you.

514
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,750
Other than thanking me,

515
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,810
you should also thank yourself.

516
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,500
I was someone

517
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,800
who didn't have a dream.

518
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,690
But now I've found one.

519
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,910
My dream

520
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,670
is to become a good author.

521
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,700
It is a great blessing

522
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,960
to have a dream to work towards.

523
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,010
You must cherish this.

524
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,010
Keep it up.

525
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,870
How about you then?

526
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,340
What is your dream?

527
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,470
Set up a company,

528
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,360
get it listed,

529
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,920
earn a lot of money

530
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,390
or what?

531
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,130
Your dream must be great.

532
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,150
My dream

533
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,700
is to realise a dream

534
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,300
with a guy.

535
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,710
In that case,

536
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,310
do you no longer want to

537
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,570
realise that dream with him?

538
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,750
Actually, I was someone

539
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,970
who was very afraid of loss.

540
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,370
But now I think that

541
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,930
as long as two people are happy together,

542
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,280
face challenges together

543
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,620
and look forward to the future together,

544
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,430
even if it may not

545
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,770
be a happy ending,

546
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,200
at least

547
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,340
we won't regret it so much.

548
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,390
I think I am

549
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,910
less afraid of loss now.

550
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,880
Here comes the food.

551
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,220
You've prepared so much food for us.

552
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,270
Here.

553
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,880
What else do you want to eat?
Tell me.

554
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,770
I am good, Mrs. Ye.

555
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,610
This is a lot already.

556
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,240
Thanks, mum.

557
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,710
You two shall go ahead.

558
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,270
I will let you enjoy your food.

559
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,280
Okay. Thanks, Mrs. Ye.

560
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,870
You should try it.

561
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,480
Which one should I start with?

562
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,360
Fried tiny fish.

563
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,280
I've been eating this since I was little.

564
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,210
Have a try.

565
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,350
Does it taste good?

566
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,550
Now try this one.

567
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,830
Mr. Lu,

568
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,890
this Thursday, representatives
from the platform will be coming

569
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,110
to discuss about copyright.

570
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,200
I will need to check with you

571
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,170
about the content.

572
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,220
Remind me again.

573
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,690
Why do you need to be
reminded of such a thing?

574
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,500
Xiao Wudi, we are talking about work.

575
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,620
Your relationship looks stable.

576
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,480
What's wrong with you, Mr. Lu?

577
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,920
Falling in love

578
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,650
seems like a far-fetched thing for me.

579
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,220
But at least I am still rich.

580
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,400
Not so much these days,

581
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,910
it seems.

582
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,860
But I still have my talents.

583
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,160
You've improved so much.

584
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,920
You can crack a joke now.

585
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:09,890
Crack a joke?

586
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,240
You think I am cracking a joke?

587
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,390
You think I am not talented?

588
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,740
The last one is a joke.

589
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,640
That is quite funny.

590
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,280
Good.

591
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,160
I am looking for a place to stay.

592
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,120
When I find a suitable one,

593
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,130
I will move out.

594
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,120
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

595
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,680
You don't need to rush it.

596
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,230
Really?

597
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,410
When are you moving out?

598
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,090
Xiao Wudi.

599
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,700
I am just showing my concern.

600
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,880
I don't want to be in the way
of your creative process.

601
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:51,760
Don't ever think that

602
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,810
becoming our author

603
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,490
is easy.

604
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,460
Alright, Mr. Lu. I got it.

605
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,680
I will go to bed now.

606
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,150
Okay.

607
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,260
Mr. Lu.

608
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,140
I had dinner

609
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,280
with Miss Ye just now.

610
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,720
I think she is

611
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,770
very concerned about you.

612
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,530
Do you want to find a time

613
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,500
to chat with her?

614
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,890
This is not the time yet.

615
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,710
I can only go near her

616
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,560
when I am no longer so childish.

617
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,240
But

618
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,130
what if she doesn't wait for you anymore?

619
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,580
If that's what she really wants,

620
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,350
she can make another choice.

621
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,660
But you can't.

622
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,520
Your only choice is me.

623
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,050
Got it.

624
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,230
I want to brush my teeth.

625
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,490
Carry on.

626
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,700
You seemed to have

627
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,170
a good chat with Nan Xing.

628
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,930
Yes.

629
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:27,600
She is now

630
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,610
officially an author.

631
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,700
I am happy for her.

632
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:33,900
True.

633
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,370
It's a pleasure indeed

634
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,550
when one is able

635
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,770
to do what one enjoys.

636
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,620
You should be doing so too.

637
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,360
[What about you then?]

638
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,830
[What is your dream?]

639
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,260
[My dream]

640
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,940
[is to realise a dream]

641
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,410
[with a guy.]

642
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,950
[Actually, I was someone]

643
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,260
[who was very afraid of loss.]

644
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,610
[But now I think that]

645
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,170
as long as two people are happy together,

646
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,480
face challenges together

647
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,870
and look forward to the future together,

648
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,670
even if it may not

649
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,100
be a happy ending,

650
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,360
at least

651
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,540
[we won't regret it so much.]

652
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,790
Mr. Lu,

653
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,340
are you ready?

654
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,780
The car is here.

655
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,830
Mr. Lu...

656
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,610
Are you so eager to go to work?

657
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,870
Of course.

658
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,270
Your breakfast.

659
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,850
It is only for you.

660
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,449
Don't share it with anyone.

661
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,420
Got it.

662
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,659
Before you go to work,

663
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,060
do you forget to do

664
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,900
something?

665
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,469
What?

666
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,770
Your lips look dry.

667
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,810
Why are you so clingy lately?

668
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,650
Am I?

669
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,590
Well,

670
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,900
perhaps I'm worried that
if I don't be clingy now,

671
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,410
I will lose my chance.

672
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,880
Don't talk nonsense.

673
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,660
The car is here.

674
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,170
Yes.

675
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,250
I'll get going now.

676
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,260
Okay.

677
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,520
Come home early.

678
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,710
Xiao Wudi.

679
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,890
Why didn't you catch

680
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,980
the love I gave you?

681
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,250
I dropped it.

682
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,270
I'm keeping it now.

684
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,160

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,110
♫ Guess who likes each other more ♫

694
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,850
Bye.

695
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,500
♫ If it wasn't for writing a novel ♫

696
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,990
♫ In case of memory errors ♫

697
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,440
♫ How should the lost be found? ♫

698
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,680
♫ Only love can be summarized in a word ♫

699
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,630
♫ Maybe a little insubstantial ♫

700
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,980
♫ Just entrust it with time ♫

701
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,590
♫ Word-by-word consideration ♫

702
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:03,110
Why aren't you letting her in yet?

703
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,140
Do you think she is

704
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,150
fit for the job?

705
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,030
Yes.

706
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,500
I think she is a very good fit.

707
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,430
When I look at her resume,

708
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,280
I just don't know what to ask.

709
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,080
Since she

710
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:16,550
sent in her resume,

711
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,780
let's just meet her first.

712
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,010
Can we

713
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,480
start the interview now?

714
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,200
Miss Ye,

715
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,510
why don't we just

716
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,650
get over with it now?

717
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,110
Miss Jiao.

718
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,760
Let me do this.

719
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,770
Miss Ye.

720
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,050
Miss Ye Qing.

721
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,580
The position you applied for

722
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,050
is the President's assistant.

723
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,900
May I know why you applied

724
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,910
for this position?

725
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,460
In our company, this is a position

726
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,760
with the highest turnover rate.

727
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,330
In our company,
the president's assistant

728
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,430
is a position

729
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,730
with the highest turnover rate.

730
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,610
Even if you fail,

731
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,000
it is no big deal.

732
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,270
It is because

733
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,450
I want to do

734
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,830
something I really like.

735
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,820
What do you

736
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,710
really like to do?

737
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,370
I treasure every book

738
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,540
that Mr. Lu has written.

739
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,390
Working with him

740
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,480
and growing with him

741
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,290
were once my biggest dream.

742
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,630
It has never changed.

743
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,900
This faith will support me

744
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,780
as I take on the job

745
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,210
and face bigger challenges.

746
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,480
Never abandon, never give up.

747
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,010
I have been taught as an athlete

748
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,690
to never give up until
I have achieved success.

749
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,540
Never abandon, never give up.

750
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:07,510
Good.

751
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,990
Welcome to X-Culture.

752
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,590
Thank you, interviewers.

753
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,890
I'll work hard.

754
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,790
Miss Ye,

755
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,800
it is so great to have you back.

756
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,230
Miss Ye.

757
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,090
Miss Nan Xing,

758
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,400
you've become so daring.

759
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,120
I have already resigned.

760
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,250
I can do what I want.

761
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,430
About Mr. Lu...

762
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,440
Don't tell him.

763
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,580
I will take her to his office.

764
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,370
Let's go.

765
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:42,790
Come in.

766
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,350
Mr. Lu,

767
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,740
I'll bring the newly recruited assistant

768
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,800
here to see you.

769
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,340
So soon?
