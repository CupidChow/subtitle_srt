1
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:07,300
I'm here to discuss cooperation with you.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,900
What are we talking about?

3
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:15,866
I'm a writer.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Don't.

5
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:24,833
Yoyo, you're on fire. Do you know?

6
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:25,433
Some time ago,

7
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,466
I'll post the video of you making desserts here online.

8
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:28,866
The hits are pretty good.

9
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,800
Xia You, why don't you shoot a few more episodes for me?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,633
This column is also my chief editor.

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,133
It's good to earn extra money.

12
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:34,966
a row

13
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,866
I suggest we shoot that first.

14
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,966
Tear the fish with your hands.

15
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:39,700
That's right.

16
00:00:39,766 --> 00:00:41,300
Didn't you say that

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,533
Is this dish handy?

18
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,133
After all, I've been criticized for so long.

19
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,266
You must have improved.

20
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:46,533
good

21
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:47,366
Then take this.

22
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,966
It's time to show off.

23
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:55,866
The ingredients should be fresh.

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,266
The umami must be preserved.

25
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,800
Handle it properly.

26
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,366
It's best to accurately determine the time

27
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:01,833
Controlling temperature

28
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,366
The taste can't be destroyed.

29
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:15,600
Thanks to Lin Zeyan,

30
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:17,266
I've improved my cooking skills.

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,533
I don't know how he is.

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,233
You're always acting like a stranger.

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,633
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

34
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:27,566
Be frank with me.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,633
But your strengths

36
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,633
It's not good to keep it inside.

37
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,033
Also

38
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:32,100
It's not like me at all.

39
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:33,466
come

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,933
Why is it so dark?

41
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:42,966
Well

42
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:49,100
What is this?

43
00:01:59,166 --> 00:01:59,633
Ah

44
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01,066
Have you touched it enough?

45
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:02,100
Enough. Close the door.

46
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,666
What did I just do?

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,733
Yes, Lin Zeyan.

48
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,233
I want to talk to you.

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,400
good

50
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,400
How about we go out to eat?

51
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,866
I know a good shop.

52
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:22,966
It's good for chatting.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,333
After President Lin got injured in the eye,

54
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,633
I almost never set foot in any unfamiliar place.

55
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,966
Xia You, why are you always so talkative?

56
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,933
You haven't forgotten the old hatred yet.

57
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:35,900
Actually, it's good to be at home.

58
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:35,966
There's no need to go out.

59
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:38,200
It's inconvenient to stay late at night.

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Xiayu

61
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you know what I like most about you?

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,033
My favorite place is you.

63
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,800
Because you're different from others.

64
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,833
It's not because I can't see.

65
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,400
I didn't think I could do anything.

66
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,600
I used to.

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
I hope I won't.

68
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,900
that

69
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,466
Hold on to me.

70
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,033
I'll leave you on the street.

71
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,033
This is the place you mentioned.

72
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,333
Of course

73
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,366
Absolutely delicious.

74
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,633
Is absolutely perfect.

75
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:15,733
It's delicious.

76
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:19,533
Please give me a fried chicken steak.

77
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,933
And two baked cold noodles.

78
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:21,966
Alright.

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,166
The smell of smoke is so strong.

80
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:28,933
The hygiene is definitely not up to standard.

81
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,366
And it's crowded and noisy.

82
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,800
Why don't we

83
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,166
What about

84
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,700
Is it delicious?

85
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,500
Careless

86
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,566
Can you still eat it?

87
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,933
Hey, I'm telling you,

88
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,466
You must try this.

89
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:44,033
This is their signature dish.

90
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,633
Very delicious.

91
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,500
I promise you won't forget it after you eat it.

92
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,533
You still want to eat it.

93
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,900
How about we take a group photo?

94
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,300
Just a souvenir.

95
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,666
It's your first time to eat a street vendor.

96
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,300
Do not

97
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,100
Come on.

98
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,433
Let's take a photo.

99
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:07,366
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

100
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,966
He's not my boyfriend.

101
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,966
Try this again. It's delicious.
