1
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:07,833
Zeyan is about to remove the stitches.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,133
Why can't Xia You get through?

3
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:11,766
Stay here.

4
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:14,000
I always feel uneasy when I go to Youyou.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,400
Zeyan, can you see us?

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,800
Mr. Lin's surgery was very successful,

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:25,833
but you should take a good rest in the near future.

8
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:26,833
Take good care.

9
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:27,833
Don't overdo it with your eyes.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,366
Something happened to Xia You's family,

11
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,200
so I didn't have time to tell you.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,933
But don't worry,

13
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,033
I'll be back in a couple of days.

14
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,166
Take good care of yourself.

15
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:40,300
Ms. Lin, Miss Xia,

16
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:42,166
she needs to clean up.

17
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:42,966
I'm leaving the hospital.

18
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:44,400
Your condition is not suitable for discharge.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,533
In case it doesn't recover properly.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,333
Forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

21
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:21,966
I'm going abroad.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,733
Don't wait for me.

23
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:28,833
Xia You?

24
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,366
Do you know that?

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,766
The first person I want to see when I open my eyes is you.

26
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,900
No matter what,

27
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,100
I must find you.

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,033
What's going on?

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,833
A bunch of losers,

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,666
Mr. Lin,

31
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,966
We were following Miss Xia as planned.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,133
I don't want to hear the reason,

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,700
but I can't find Xia You?

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,066
All of you will plant trees in the desert of Africa,

35
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,666
but none of you will come back.

36
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:56,566
Get lost!

37
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,966
It's Mr. Lin.

38
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,166
Let's have a chat.

39
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:08,833
About what?

40
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:11,200
Don't think I don't know where Xia You is.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,933
You did it, didn't you?

42
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,066
Say it or not?

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,833
What does it have to do with me?

44
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,500
It's fine if you don't say it.

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,433
If the Lin family knows what you've done,

46
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:22,500
will you still be Ze Yan's fiancée?

47
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,200
I admit that I gave her some advice,

48
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:29,933
but I just want Lin Zeyan to stay with me.

49
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,000
As for where Xia You went,

50
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:34,333
I don't know either.

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,700
Xia You has arranged

52
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:37,733
to avoid Lin Ze Yan's men,

53
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:38,733
He's gone now.

54
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:39,533
That's enough.

55
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,566
I don't need to know where she is now.

56
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:42,700
I just need her.

57
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:44,666
Don't ever show up next to Lin Zeyan again.

58
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:55,566
What do you think?

59
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:57,100
Are you feeling better?
