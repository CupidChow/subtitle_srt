1
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,966
Why did you give him the money?

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,233
He is a bottomless pit.

3
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:11,200
I don't need you to return it.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Why didn't you tell me?

5
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,700
I can help you.

6
00:00:14,766 --> 00:00:15,633
Tell me what?

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,833
I've got a gambling father.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
Or her seriously ill mother.

9
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:20,333
Lin Zeyan.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,833
Not everyone has a carefree life like you.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,700
Money can't solve all problems.

12
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,333
Isn't my money enough?

13
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,200
I just don't want to owe anyone anything.

14
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:30,600
This is my bottom line.

15
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,233
So you can go to the competition without boundaries.

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,600
The competition is because I thought you were different.

17
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:37,833
Now I find you are no different from those people.

18
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:39,566
And say some high-sounding words.

19
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:41,000
To do the same thing.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,133
What a coincidence.

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,900
You can always be there when I'm sad

22
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:02,633
Fool

23
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:05,233
Are you all right

24
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:08,266
I'm fine.

25
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,233
Let's go somewhere.

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,400
Do you remember when we used to

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,766
I often climb over the wall to play.

28
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:34,666
time

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,166
It's so fast.

30
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,766
Cheng Mu, tell me.

31
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:44,033
Can we get what we want in the future?

32
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,200
Actually, what I want

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,500
I was there.

34
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:59,700
Don't pretend. I saw it.

35
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,800
That Qin Luo Luo came out of the hospital.

36
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,733
I just don't want to owe anyone anything.

37
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,133
This is my bottom line.

38
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,466
Help me check the latest operators behind Weibo.

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Who is it?

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,233
Thank you for enlightening me.

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,400
I'm feeling much better.

42
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,500
Don't go back today.

43
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,333
This is my job.

44
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:25,366
You'll have to face it sooner or later.

45
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:34,800
Where were you just now?

46
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:38,966
Mr. Lin, I'll prepare dinner for you now.

47
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,366
Do you know how worried I am about you?
