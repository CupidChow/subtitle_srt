00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:09,200
Hello, the number you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,333
I didn't take her there.

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,600
It was an accident.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,700
It's a hangover cure. This is a human.

5
00:00:18,766 --> 00:00:20,000
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,333
Don't touch me.

7
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:23,533
I can still drink it.

8
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:26,766
Lin Zeyan.

9
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,766
They hurt

10
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:31,633
Where does it hurt?

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,500
here

12
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:37,633
Didn't you eat?

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,066
You're so weak.

14
00:00:39,566 --> 00:00:40,366
Try harder.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,866
You can't do this.

16
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:48,200
Take the medicine.

17
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,066
I'm not eating.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,700
I'm not eating.

19
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:53,033
obedient

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,066
Mom

21
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,766
When will you recover?

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,400
Don't go.

23
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:39,700
Yeah, my head hurts.

24
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,333
Why am I here?

25
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,133
I went to earn money yesterday.

26
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:48,933
No way. I really want to die.

27
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:51,266
Lin Zeyan doesn't want to kill me now, right?

28
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,366
Feed the orange.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,866
You know,

30
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:03,833
The defending champion is suddenly very nice to the sheep.

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,200
Why is that?

32
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,700
To form a department.

33
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,966
And fattened up.

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,300
Ah

35
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,533
Are all the writers so clever?

36
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:13,833
Oh, right.

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,533
I've decided to join the creative food competition.

38
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:19,200
I always believe you can do it.

39
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:24,766
I have a friend.

40
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:26,266
It's a friend.

41
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:29,300
She has a tough boss.

42
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,033
But after a few days,

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,733
Actually, he's not bad.

44
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,633
It's a typical cold and hot inside.

45
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,033
So she has a little bit of heart.

46
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,300
No, right.

47
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,266
Conscience discovery

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
therefore

49
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,700
How should I persuade her?

50
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,233
Actually, you might

51
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,566
Your friend might

52
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:00,833
Doesn't really like her boss.

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,733
Just attracted by the contrast, right?

54
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,300
Oh

55
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:09,966
such

56
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
You asked your friend

57
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:12,933
As far away from her boss as possible.

58
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:14,866
From the perspective of a bystander,

59
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,433
Analyze yourself.

60
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,000
The impulse of the moment.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,066
It will fade.

62
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Well

63
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,266
You recovered much better than I thought.

64
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,066
Keep it up.

65
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,600
Why didn't you see your girlfriend today?

66
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:32,033
Isn't she always with you?

67
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:34,566
Don't tell anyone about my eyes getting better.

68
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:35,866
Okay, I understand.

69
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,366
After all, the accident was an accident or a human being.

70
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:40,266
It's hard to say.

71
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:44,333
Zeyan

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,733
Why are you leaving without me?

73
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,366
How is the report? Show me.

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,466
My mom said she missed you recently.

75
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,966
I want to ask you to come home for dinner.

76
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,300
I've been busy recently.

77
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,300
The schedule is full.

78
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,366
Next time.

79
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,966
You always make excuses.

80
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:02,633
Do you have a problem with my mom?

81
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,033
Or you don't want to see me?

82
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I'm really busy.

83
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,166
If you think I'm making excuses,

84
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,266
Welcome to the gallery.

85
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:09,800
Zeyan

86
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,900
It's not that I don't believe you.

87
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,933
I was too anxious.

88
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:15,066
Get back to work.

89
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,500
I'll explain it to mom.

90
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,666
OK!
