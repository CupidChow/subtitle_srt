1
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,133
What? Are you back?

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,700
What? Be my maid of honor.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,600
Yes, I'm getting married soon.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,400
No, that's not the point.

5
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,200
You said you weren't coming back.

6
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:22,900
You don't want to see that person.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,600
Are you sure this is okay?

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,366
Don't worry.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,900
Didn't you send me the makeup schedule?

10
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:31,933
By the way, don't forget.

11
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,400
You must wear a girlfriend's outfit when you meet.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,333
A sister is bigger than the sky.

13
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:35,800
I don't think so.

14
00:00:37,566 --> 00:00:39,266
Mom, where are we going?

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,933
Honey, be good. Wait a second.

16
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:42,833
Let's give Mrs. Orange a surprise, okay?

17
00:00:44,466 --> 00:00:46,500
What? You said you didn't have time.

18
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:49,000
Who are we going to marry?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,266
You said you wanted to try on a best man costume and I had to work with you.

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm too busy.

21
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:53,533
That's a lot of nonsense.

22
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:56,266
I don't care.

23
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,233
Or you can come now. I'll send you the address.

24
00:00:58,466 --> 00:00:59,600
That's it. Bye.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,000
feed

26
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:10,533
Come down.

27
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:11,966
I'm here.

28
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:20,300
Why are you here? I've been waiting for you.

29
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,266
Hello, orange.

30
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:30,533
Are you looking for me?

31
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,100
Ah, I'm back now.

32
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,700
How are you?

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,066
You still can't talk.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,800
this

35
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:47,833
Is it your child?

36
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:51,500
This time,

37
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,100
Are you still leaving?

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,633
I've been looking for you for a long time.

39
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,666
Ling Chen, what are you doing?

40
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,700
Well, I suddenly remembered I have something to do.

41
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
orange

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,666
Let's go together.

44
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:13,900
This is

45
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,000
Xia Yan, aunt.

46
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,933
Hello, Mrs. Orange.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,733
With whom?

48
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:20,766
You can't even eat.

49
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:22,066
Hello, Uncle.

50
00:02:22,766 --> 00:02:24,033
Hi, dad.

51
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,900
Why do you call me father?

52
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:35,366
Mom said that.

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,066
What else did I tell you?

54
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,566
Mom also said that

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,100
Dad's name is...

56
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,166
Lin Zeyan.

57
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,833
You're already three months pregnant.

58
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,833
Why don't you have a good rest?

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,433
Can't you see me?

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,100
Hello. Alright. I'll be right there.

61
00:03:10,866 --> 00:03:11,666
Ah

62
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,833
Xia Yan, will Mrs. Orange take you to play?

63
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,866
Do not

64
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,033
Xia Yan, please.

65
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,333
I'll find you later.

66
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,333
Well

67
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,900
Let's go somewhere.

68
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,133
When are you going to tell me the truth?

69
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,433
You know everything.

70
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,933
Am I so untrustworthy?

71
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:49,666
I'm just scared.

72
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,600
Qin Luoluo and the company will hurt you.

73
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,700
After all, my eyes haven't healed yet.

74
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,666
So I dare not bet your happiness.

75
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,866
Why don't you let me face it with you?

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,066
I didn't dare to take the risk.

77
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,800
When I think of you being hurt,

78
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:04,833
I'm really scared.

79
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:07,833
You fool.

80
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,600
I thought you gave the ring to someone else.

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,466
It only belongs to you.

82
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,366
I won't let you escape this time.

83
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:28,766
Hey, wait a second.

84
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,033
What about your gossiping girlfriends on the news?

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,633
actor

86
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,000
Why are you looking for an actress?

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The kind you pay for?

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,800
Group acting

89
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,733
Be more serious this time.

90
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:39,733
Mrs. Lin.
