1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,500
I announce the winner of this competition

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,400
Xiayu

3
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:13,833
Yeap

4
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,000
Your vote is...

5
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:18,966
Right

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The jade wears a thousand silk.

7
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:31,166
Where are you going?

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
You're so late.

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,200
You know what?

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,466
I'm going to attend a competition today.

11
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:37,133
And won the first prize.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
The first prize is so happy.

13
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,600
You haven't improved at all.

14
00:00:41,966 --> 00:00:44,033
For the sake of winning the competition, I won't argue with you.

15
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:45,866
A little gift for you.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,400
You're so happy with a gift.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,566
You have regressed.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,933
I'm doing this to save someone's face.

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,666
You should smile more.

20
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:01,833
It's actually quite cute.

21
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:04,600
Be honest with me.

22
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,333
Last time,

23
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,333
Did you do it secretly?

24
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,100
The taste

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,100
Only she can do it.

26
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,700
You smile means you agree.

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,366
If you don't speak, it means something is wrong.

28
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,766
How is your friend doing?

29
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:24,166
Before the game,

30
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:25,766
No

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,466
And ignored my friend.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,900
I don't know why.

33
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:32,833
Now you are always fooling around in front of me.

34
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:36,966
Go ahead. Any new developments?

35
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,066
There's no progress.

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,500
There's no progress.

37
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,033
Look at this tie on your chest.

38
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,000
It's not more than 500 yuan.

39
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,866
She must have sent it.

40
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:46,600
But judging from your appearance,

41
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,033
Is not very smooth.

42
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,166
Tell your friend

43
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,333
Keep calm

44
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:52,933
Just pretend nothing happened.

45
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:56,433
This is 36 anti-customers.

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,733
You must have figured out our plan.

47
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,666
It's better to leave as soon as possible.

48
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,066
Well

49
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,233
This woman

50
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,266
This man

51
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:06,266
It's not easy.
