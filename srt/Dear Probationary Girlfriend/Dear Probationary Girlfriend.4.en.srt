1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,733
Hello

2
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:07,833
Is this Miss Sandy?

3
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:14,433
to have a close call

4
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,133
I thought Qin Luo Luo was crazy enough.

5
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:19,033
I didn't expect that there's no normal person around Lin Zeyan.

6
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:20,866
What's your relationship with Ze Yan?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,400
Can't you see that?

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,100
You shameless woman.

9
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,800
You did it for money.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,766
You're wrong.

11
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,666
I see your public relations press release is very happy to admit it.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,633
The same to you

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,366
We still have feelings.

14
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:38,566
If Zeyan hadn't been too busy,

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,500
It's your turn.

16
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:42,166
But as far as I know,

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,633
Your rumors can be published as a tutorial.

18
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,833
Hello, Li.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,200
You got it?

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,333
The clothes are 2,680.

21
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,066
It's 580 yuan.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,600
For mental injury.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,933
Two thousand six hundred.

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,933
It's 5,000 yuan.

25
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,133
You have one minute to think about it.

26
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:18,266
Can't cure Lin Zeyan.

27
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:20,166
I can't cure you.

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,333
Who are you?

29
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:34,766
It's me.

30
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,166
I'm your fan.

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,600
Did you really shoot it just now?

32
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,466
You believe the trick of lying to a fool.

33
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:42,733
It's interesting.

34
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,500
How can Lin Zeyan tolerate your mouth?

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,766
There's no other way.

36
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,033
It's Dad.

37
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:48,366
Wait

38
00:01:48,766 --> 00:01:49,966
Do you know Lin Zeyan?

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
Isn't it stupid?

40
00:01:52,366 --> 00:01:53,466
Hey, Wildcat.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,400
What's your name?

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,466
I'm in a hurry.

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Thanks for the coat.

44
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:57,900
Give me the contact information.

45
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,333
I'll pay you back next time.

46
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,933
Hey, wait a second.

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
If I have a part-time job next time,

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
I miss you first.

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,200
no problem

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,700
I'll give you 20% off.

51
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
Zeyan, Luo Luo told me everything.

52
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:21,766
She's also your fiancee.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
You chose her.

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,700
I didn't choose it.

55
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,633
She saved you back then.

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,466
I don't want to see those messy reports.

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,200
So you asked someone to watch me.

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,266
That's what I want.

59
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,333
But also to take care of you.

60
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,366
I have a meeting to attend.

61
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:36,666
If there's nothing else,

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,600
I'll hang up.

63
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,033
I'm just taking care of the patient.

64
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,666
To the top search for no reason.

65
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,400
And was splashed with coffee by his ex-girlfriend.

66
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,833
Why are you so unlucky?

67
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,033
Why don't you change your job?

68
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,900
This is not a long-term solution.

69
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,033
I signed the contract of selling my body.

70
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,700
If you break the contract, you have to pay ten times the salary.

71
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,633
if

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,700
You don't want to.

73
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,366
and

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,233
I found a way to make money.

75
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,100
The wool of capitalism.

76
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:06,933
Hey, wait a second.

77
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:07,933
Let me record it first.

78
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,333
I'm going to write a grand drama.

79
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,933
Let that Midnight have a look.

80
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,300
What is art?

81
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,600
By the way, Yoyo.

82
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,500
Don't be angry.

83
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,100
I'll take you there tonight.

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
go

85
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,533
Young Master Lin,

86
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,500
The taste has changed, right?

87
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,066
I heard you have a wild cat at home.

88
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,566
You've learned to hide a lady in a golden roof.

89
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:34,766
When are you going to let me meet your little girl?

90
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:37,733
Well

91
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:38,933
Well

92
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:41,766
Hold on. I have something to deal with.

93
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,100
Ha-ha

94
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:44,533
Are you all right?

95
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
Nothing.

96
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,400
Are you a person

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,266
My friend and I

98
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,066
I just went to the bathroom.

99
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:51,666
Hey, where's my friend?

100
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,233
Xiayu

101
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,266
Xia You, where are you?

102
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:58,400
Why does the name sound so familiar?

103
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,500
This is not a cafe war.

104
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,000
An old artist with an ex-girlfriend?

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
The Earth is really round.

106
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,366
This is your best friend?

107
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:07,766
I know him.

108
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:08,766
She's a wonderful woman.

109
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:10,700
Since we are so fated,

110
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,133
Let me buy you a drink. Let's go.

111
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,666
Mr. Lin, this is the first half of the company's business.

112
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,533
There are some documents for you to sign.

113
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,400
To summarize the market trend in recent months.

114
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:25,066
And analyze the trend of the second half.

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,833
To work out the next step.

116
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,833
Alright, President Lin.

117
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,466
The cup is in the right place.

118
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,533
Although this woman is arrogant and greedy,

119
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:51,766
And your brain is not sharp.

120
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,900
But at least it has some advantages.

121
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,666
At least until now.

122
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,433
En

123
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,500
Well

124
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,100
Well

125
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Well

126
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:16,766
Well

127
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,400
Mr. Lin, we received a message.

128
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,033
President Shang wants to hold a small birthday party for her little girlfriend.

129
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,633
This is the best time to get on the line.

130
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:24,566
Look.

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,100
Yes, I know.
