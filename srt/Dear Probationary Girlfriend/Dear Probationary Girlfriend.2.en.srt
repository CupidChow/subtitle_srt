1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,166
If that happens,

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,066
You're still my girlfriend.

3
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:10,399
Then I won't steal the professional shield.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,333
Cut the crap.

5
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:12,266
The probation period is one month.

6
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:13,766
Be there before 7 tomorrow.

7
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,800
That's 20,000.

8
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:19,066
You can't go against the money.

9
00:00:19,466 --> 00:00:20,866
No problem.

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,366
My name is Xia You.

11
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:26,533
Is an ordinary worker.

12
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:27,866
Because of a gambling father,

13
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,066
Mom is sick.

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,466
So I've been on the way to pay my debts.

15
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:32,599
Feed the orange.

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,466
I'm telling you,

17
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,466
I found the door to wealth.

18
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:39,266
Ah

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,166
Broken cars can break.

20
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,033
Hey, take that.

21
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,833
Manager

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Can you pay me for the last few days?

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,100
I might not come after that.

24
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,400
Your salary was taken by your father yesterday.

25
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:56,766
I don't need to inform you when you come here.

26
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,066
You have been dismissed.

27
00:00:59,166 --> 00:00:59,966
I

28
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:04,100
Others are cheating on me.

29
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:06,533
Why am I always cheated by my father?

30
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:09,233
You're late.

31
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,300
1,000 yuan.

32
00:01:10,733 --> 00:01:12,933
I missed the bus during the rush hour.

33
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:13,966
I don't want to hear your explanation.

34
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,033
Two things.

35
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,500
First, you can't be late.

36
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:16,966
second

37
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,833
You can't put anything I don't like on the table.

38
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,266
Don't try anything.

39
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,433
Don't cross the money.

40
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:22,166
Also

41
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:23,000
Also

42
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,566
Aren't there only two?

43
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:26,500
And you smell too strong.

44
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,600
Stay away from me.

45
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,199
You can't have dirty things at home.

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,933
Including you.

47
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,366
I want to hit you.

48
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,800
For the sake of money, I'll bear it.

49
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:45,266
OK

50
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,300
Feed the orange.

51
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,766
Why didn't you tell me he was so mean?

52
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:52,933
How else would this happen to us?

53
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,400
This is too difficult.

54
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,066
How much is the salary?

55
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,800
It's hard to serve.

56
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,200
He is the landlord.

57
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:02,500
You didn't tell me it was fraud.

58
00:02:02,533 --> 00:02:04,300
Aren't you short of money?

59
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:15,966
I haven't ironed the gap.

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,900
The crease at the collar is crooked.

61
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,566
I'm curious about what else you can do.

62
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,466
Also

63
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:23,800
Did you know what event I'm attending today?

64
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,200
Did you read the schedule?

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
If you don't do your homework, wait for me.

66
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:29,400
Is it too late for me to leave now?

67
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,566
Ten times the penalty.

68
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:31,666
It's up to you.

69
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,166
There are so many additional regulations.

70
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:38,533
All capitalists are vampires.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,266
I'm going now.

72
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,466
And prepare the lunch.

73
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,333
OK

74
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,566
happy couple

75
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,733
Braised chicken wings.

76
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,266
The seasoning proportion is out of proportion.

77
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,700
Next.

78
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,666
And play Shuangjiang.

79
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
Boiled river shrimp.

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,966
No flavor.

81
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,666
Next.

82
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:15,700
Fried Meat with Green Pepper

83
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,900
I don't like it. Leave.

84
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,133
You don't want to eat?

85
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,300
Is this human food?

86
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,466
What a waste.

87
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,466
waste

88
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
Feed it to the pigs.

89
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Ah

90
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,766
And feed them to the pigs.

91
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,900
And feed them to the pigs.

92
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:42,000
He said I was...

93
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,100
Lin Zeyan, wait for me.

94
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,133
Your coffee.

95
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,100
Mr. Lin, I'm here to report.

96
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,000
The revenue and expenditure accounts of each branch for the quarter

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,900
And the latest proposal of F & B management R & D.

98
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,300
What is he doing?

99
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,333
You want to fool me with instant coffee?

100
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,466
Don't you know how to use the coffee machine?

101
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,733
You don't need me to teach you how to read.

102
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:19,166
Why is he so close?
