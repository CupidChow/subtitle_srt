1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,100
If you want to know what a girl is thinking,

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,100
Depends on her subconscious reaction.

3
00:00:12,866 --> 00:00:14,400
Is the air conditioning broken?

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,533
Why is it so hot?

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,500
No.

6
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:24,433
What does he want?

7
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,866
What's the play today?

8
00:00:34,866 --> 00:00:36,066
I think there's a ruse.

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,066
Don't look.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,466
Form is empty, and form is void.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
Isn't it meat?

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,100
Everyone is different.

13
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:56,533
What's up

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,300
Do your eyes hurt?

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,300
Well

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
feed

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,633
Xia You, where are you?

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,633
Are you all right?

19
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,333
Of course I'm fine. What are you talking about?

20
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:15,366
That's good.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,900
What happened?

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,300
Uncle, just now,

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,000
You came to borrow money from me.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,100
Something's wrong.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,100
I need money.

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,700
How much did he take from you?

27
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,533
Why did you borrow money from Cheng Mu behind my back?

28
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,166
You don't know anything.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,733
I was about to turn the page.

30
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:35,800
Just a little bit.

31
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,866
Don't borrow money in my name.

32
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,500
If it wasn't for my mom,

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,966
Do you think I will care about you?

34
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:45,433
When you are outside,

35
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,733
No matter what,

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,400
Has nothing to do with me.

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,100
I'm telling you,

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,033
This girl

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,933
To spoil you.

40
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,800
Cheers.

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,966
This person looks like Xia You.

42
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:25,633
You must be dizzy.

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,333
No, this is Xia You, right?

44
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,933
Why is she here? Does Lin Zeyan know?

45
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:33,433
Oh, forget it. I'd better mind my own business.

46
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,700
President Ling didn't come to see me.

47
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,433
Oh, get out of here. Didn't you see I was busy?

48
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,433
Hey, what are you doing?

49
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,766
Drink it. Hurry up.

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,000
No way

51
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,200
Orange can't know that I know so many girls.

52
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:05,933
I didn't like Midnight.

53
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:08,066
If I hate Ling Chen again, how can I stay here?

54
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:09,800
Come with me.
