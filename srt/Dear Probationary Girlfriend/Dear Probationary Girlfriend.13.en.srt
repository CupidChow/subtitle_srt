1
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:10,400
You're so big.

2
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:11,900
And catch a cold.

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,566
Why is it so hot?

4
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:19,366
Lie down.

5
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:20,700
I'll make you a cup of cold medicine.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,166
Why are you here?

7
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,366
Orange said you were sick, right?

8
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:33,666
I'm here to bring you some chicken soup.

9
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:35,066
It's better to hurry up.

10
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:36,366
Then come in.

11
00:00:42,966 --> 00:00:43,766
come

12
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,300
You're reliable.

13
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,633
Orange didn't even know to visit me.

14
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:51,633
Is it good?

15
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:52,966
How is the chicken soup cooked?

16
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:53,966
It tastes so good.

17
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:54,966
Cheng Mu, right?

18
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:57,366
It's getting late.

19
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,733
Xia You should rest.

20
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:01,466
If you want her to recover quickly,

21
00:01:02,266 --> 00:01:03,133
Go back first.

22
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:04,733
It's not far.

23
00:01:17,533 --> 00:01:18,333
What are you doing?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,800
I just...

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,500
Don't catch it.

26
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:42,533
Ah

27
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:44,733
Ah

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,900
Oh dear

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,733
How can you catch a cold this season?

30
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,300
I heard that Xia You caught a cold two days ago.

31
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,266
Are you two

32
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:56,733
Hey, don't.

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,166
I'll go then.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,233
bye-bye

35
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:02,866
I'm dizzy.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm dizzy.

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,300
You didn't mean to pretend to be pitiful, right?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
I'm really pitiful.

39
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,333
orange

40
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,333
Do you know where Xia You is now?

41
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,166
I want to talk to her.

42
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:28,966
It's hard enough for Uncle Yoyo to be alone.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,266
Can you stop putting extra burden on Yoyo?

44
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:33,766
Gambling really hurts people.

45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,166
I've quit orange.

46
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,233
Really

47
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:38,266
Are you looking for Xia You?

48
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,500
I want to see if she's doing well.

49
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,100
I won't cause her any more trouble.

50
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:43,866
I really quit.

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,500
Xia You is fine now.

52
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,733
He's working as a butler for Lin Group in An Lan District.

53
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,133
Don't worry.

54
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,233
Orange, I know.

55
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:52,266
Let's do this first.
