1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,500
Are you there? It's urgent.

2
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,566
What kind of trifle is it?

3
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,666
Brother, I'm pushing for the draft.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,300
I want to give you some breathing room.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,633
Whether to go to a birthday party or not.

6
00:00:23,633 --> 00:00:24,633
No.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,433
If we take Xia You to the party,

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,700
Must be very interesting.

9
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:31,533
Are you there?

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Well

11
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,933
Let me catch him, little miser.

12
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:48,033
Hum

13
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,233
Hey.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,466
Xia You, Ling Chen.

15
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,233
There's something I don't know if you have time.

16
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:00,900
Don't bother.

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,900
Paid

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,033
Hey, good friend.

19
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,800
Send me your address.

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,600
Rook, she's all yours today.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,100
OK

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,500
It's my first time to wait for a woman to put on makeup.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,533
So long.

24
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:28,266
Don't let me down.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,800
wow

26
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,000
What a marvelous skill!

27
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:47,066
Bravo

28
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:54,766
Who is that?

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
What background?

30
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,800
I don't know.

31
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:57,833
Why haven't you seen it before?

32
00:01:57,866 --> 00:02:00,200
Is it a relative of the chairman?

33
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:03,466
President Lin, Ling Chen's female companion seems to be Xia You.

34
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,066
Zeyan, let's toast to Mr. Li.

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
Take me to Ling Chen.

36
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,233
Where are you? Get me some money.

37
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:13,866
dad

38
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,633
Did you gamble again?

39
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:18,666
If you still want me alive, you should send the money here.

40
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:20,900
Xia You, right?

41
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:21,900
I have the money to pay back.

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,233
If you don't have any money, leave your father's hand.

43
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,233
How much is it?

44
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,233
Give me the card number.

45
00:02:25,733 --> 00:02:26,633
And tell him

46
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,033
Even if he is beaten to death outside,

47
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,266
It has nothing to do with me.

48
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,300
Xia Youhum.

49
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,833
Why is she still haunting?

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,500
You are really unscrupulous for fishing.

51
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,233
Does she know it's your birthday party?

52
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,900
You dare to go to any occasion.

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,766
I really don't know how much I weigh.

54
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,266
Do you know what day it is?

55
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:02,666
How did you sneak in?

56
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,033
Why are you here again?

57
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,333
It's none of your business.

58
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,733
How dare a maid sneak out to a party?

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
I have to say, you have some skills.

60
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,833
You so-called high-class people,

61
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:14,466
Is that all?

62
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,300
You look uneducated.

63
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:19,233
So it's the person who follows Lin Zeyan.

64
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,466
Mr. Lin is really weak and strong.

65
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,600
I admire you.

66
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:23,933
It's so embarrassing.

67
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:26,166
No wonder the Lin clan is under pressure.

68
00:03:26,566 --> 00:03:28,033
Miss Sandy, don't you think so?

69
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,500
Mr. Zhao, you're right.

70
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,300
Lin Zeyan is indeed inferior to you in some aspects.

71
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,933
Ha ha, you admit it.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,466
Listen to it.

73
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,766
Lin Zeyan's little lover has betrayed us.

74
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,966
Why? Are you considering

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
If you brag and don't write a draft,

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,700
Lin Zeyan can't learn it.

77
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,000
What are you?
