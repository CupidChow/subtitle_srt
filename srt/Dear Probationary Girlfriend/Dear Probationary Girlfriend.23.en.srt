1
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:07,066
Zeyan

2
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,100
Lin Zeyan.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,133
Are you willing to watch such a small internet celebrity

4
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:17,033
Wouldn't even look at me.

5
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:17,533
Really?

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,666
You already know that.

7
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:19,533
Zeyan

8
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:24,033
What did I do to deserve this?

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,166
What do you want?

10
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:26,533
I can promise you.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,700
Only one.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,700
Don't imagine that I will marry you.

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,833
Lin Zeyan, you'll get what you deserve.

14
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,633
You will never find Xia You.

15
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:49,666
Dear orange,

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,566
I'm fine.

17
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,600
The foreign food is so terrible.

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,266
So you did it for your mother and Lin Zeyan.

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,600
So I agreed to Qin Luoluo's condition and chose to go abroad.

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,100
Now you're telling me.

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,200
Do you know how worried I am about you?

22
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,533
Sorry, orange.

23
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:01,566
Don't tell anyone.

24
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:03,300
Alright.

25
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,600
I won't tell anyone.

26
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:05,433
Don't worry.

27
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,766
When are you coming back?

28
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,366
I'm getting married next month.

29
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,066
And wanted you to be the maid of honor.

30
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:12,633
You've been abroad for so long.

31
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,066
Do you have any news?

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,466
Orange, I suddenly stopped talking.

33
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,433
Always like this.

34
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,900
It's hard to beat him before we have a chat.

35
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,966
The president's temper is worse than the rumors three years ago.

36
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,066
It's better than that.

37
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,633
Besides, what kind of party do you attend in public?

38
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,733
The female companion

39
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,666
Has never appeared more than twice.

40
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:32,866
Correct!

41
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,833
I have...

42
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,100
When I passed by the president's office,

43
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,833
When I saw the president's desk,

44
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,866
Put a photo of a woman.

45
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,966
Hasn't the president forgotten Xia You?

46
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,133
Hey, Mr. Lin is here.

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Xia You, where are you?

48
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
It's been five years.

49
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:51,966
I keep everything the same in my life

50
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,200
I hope you won't feel unfamiliar when you see me again.

51
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,066
When can I see you again?

52
00:01:58,933 --> 00:01:59,933
I wanted to protect you.

53
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,766
But I lost you.

54
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Mr. Lin, I've found out about the file.

55
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,133
Yes, Qin Luoluo.

56
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,300
She sent Xia You's father to another place.

57
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,633
I haven't found out.

58
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:10,366
estimate

59
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,666
To threaten Miss Xia You to help.

60
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,800
Have you found out the mole of the company?

61
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,233
All kinds of clues lead to Mr. Zhao in the group.

62
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:18,266
before

63
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:19,600
Be frank with me.

64
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,366
It seems that Miss Xia You was injured because of him.

65
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:28,566
Xiayu

66
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:29,966
Where are you?
