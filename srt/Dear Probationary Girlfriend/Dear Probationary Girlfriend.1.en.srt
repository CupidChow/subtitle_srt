1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,533
Don't look down.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,900
How did this happen?

3
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:20,366
Mrs. Lin.

4
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,966
The care worker was driven away by President Lin again.

5
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:23,333
And arrange it.

6
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,933
Find a smarter one.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,200
Don't tell him

8
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:27,700
that I'm behind of this.

9
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,366
Hello

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,200
Is anyone there?

11
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,400
I'm here to apply for a job.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
The client needs a senior escort.

13
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,200
To take care of the customer's daily life.

14
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,900
Requires a senior chef certificate.

15
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:01,166
With rich experience.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,566
The most important thing is

17
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:04,200
And get along well with customers.

18
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,533
The salary is 10,000 yuan.

19
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:06,833
You can do it.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,866
Ten thousand.

21
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:11,766
I'm the senior escort of the cat cafe downstairs.

22
00:01:11,766 --> 00:01:13,733
You should be able to handle this.

23
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:17,166
The room is so messy. Should I clean it?

24
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:45,233
Hold

25
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,800
He can't see it.

26
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:49,800
to have a close call

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,566
Oh, no.

28
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:55,766
What is he doing?

29
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:59,266
Don't come here. Stay here.

30
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,100
Ah

31
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:18,466
Why are you here again?

32
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,533
Please bless him. Hurry up.

33
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:26,200
Is he going to take a shower?

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,666
Don't look down.

35
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,600
It's not my fault.

36
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:44,133
He made me watch it.

37
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,466
Wow, you have abs.

38
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,400
The butler doesn't have to come today.

39
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:04,766
Who is it?

40
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:06,966
Sorry.

41
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:08,066
I didn't know anyone was at home today.

42
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm here to apply for a job.

43
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,466
I'll leave now.

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,366
stop

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,566
Or I'll call the police.

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,000
This is my home.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,100
I didn't tell anyone to come.

48
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:15,666
say

49
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:17,300
What is your real purpose here?

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,966
You really introduced me here.

51
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:19,966
If you don't believe me, tell her.

52
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,033
I'm not interested in hiring a nanny.

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,000
Are you going by yourself or am I asking you to leave?

54
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:25,133
You're treating me like a monkey.

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,100
Okay, let me go.

56
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,300
Claim the travel expenses.

57
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,300
What are you doing?

58
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:39,333
Who is Zeyan?

59
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,133
It's not your turn to ask about me.

60
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,100
Zeyan, I really just care about you.

61
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,533
These people are here for money.

62
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,100
Do you know the history?

63
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,366
Miss, are you talking about me?

64
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:49,566
Aren't you the same?

65
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:51,566
Zeyan

66
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,300
I'm the one who can accompany you to the end.

67
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
Why don't I go now?

68
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,766
Let's talk.

69
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:55,766
You wanted to leave after you took the money.

70
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:56,566
You are so shameless.

71
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,500
Don't bother.

72
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,566
This is my new butler.

73
00:03:58,566 --> 00:03:59,400
I like it so much

74
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,466
If there's nothing else,

75
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,200
Miss Qin can leave now.

76
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:03,333
Don't you mean me?

77
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:03,900
you

78
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,266
Take out the second layer of clothes in the closet and put them on.

79
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:07,566
Oh

80
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:10,500
That's not right.

81
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,600
Why should I listen to him?

82
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:15,100
Take care of Zeyan.

83
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,366
Don't give birth to something you shouldn't.

84
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,766
Zeyan, this is the chicken soup I cooked.

85
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
I'll call aunt later.

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,900
Tell her not to worry.

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll leave now.

88
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,966
Is this a wolf den?

89
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:33,200
I'd better take the money and leave now.

90
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,933
Well, I want to remind you that

91
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:39,100
I'm very expensive.

92
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,800
You have to think clearly.

93
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,533
I'll double your salary.

94
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,800
There are three additional clauses in the contract.

95
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,733
first

96
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,066
Obey my order unconditionally.

97
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,733
Second, you're on call.

98
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,000
Third, if that happens,

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,766
You have to be my girlfriend.

100
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,733
I'm tired of you.

101
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,766
I don't want to be disturbed by another irrelevant person.

102
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:56,300
Then I will be a professional shield.

103
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,233
Cut the crap.

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,333
The probation period is one month.

105
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,600
Be there before 7 tomorrow.
