1
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:09,966
What's the smell?

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,233
It's okay. I've taken care of it.

3
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:16,666
What happened to your hand?

4
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,200
I forgot to turn off the fire when I went out.

6
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:26,233
Nothing

7
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,233
What's wrong with you?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,200
In bad mood

9
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,566
What happened?

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Cheng Mu is going abroad.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,300
I don't know if he will come back.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,600
Studying abroad is the best choice for him.

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,200
Don't be sad.

14
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:40,666
Don't worry.

15
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm here with you.

16
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:43,566
Well

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,000
Your hand.

18
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,833
How did you treat the wound yourself?

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,933
My eyesight

20
00:00:52,066 --> 00:00:53,066
He's recovered now.

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,500
About 40%.

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Really?

23
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:58,733
In this way,

24
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:00,933
It will soon recover.

25
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:02,966
If you kiss me every day,

26
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,433
I will get better faster.

27
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,233
Actually, based on your recovery,

28
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,633
Is a miracle.

29
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,166
But if you want to recover,

30
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,966
With the current situation of our hospital,

31
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,466
This is unlikely.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,433
Hello, where are you?

33
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,466
I'll be there soon.

34
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm warning you.

35
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,266
Don't move those who shouldn't.

36
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:26,866
Or I won't let you off.

37
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,833
I didn't want to scare you.

38
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:36,266
But Ling Chen disappeared suddenly.

39
00:01:36,566 --> 00:01:38,433
Let's get to know each other.

40
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm not familiar with Ling Chen.

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,600
Did you misunderstand?

42
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,300
I don't know if I'm familiar.

43
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,833
But I only give you ten minutes.

44
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,333
You should live well in the United States.

45
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:53,966
CAUTION

46
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:55,766
Well

47
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:57,966
I will.

48
00:01:58,966 --> 00:01:59,766
Let's go.

49
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:02,766
bye-bye

50
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:03,966
bye-bye

51
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,700
Why didn't you answer the phone?

52
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,800
He's probably still working on the draft.

53
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:23,666
Go to her tomorrow.

54
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:38,466
I won't allow you to think about others.

55
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,933
In your mind,

56
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:42,366
You can only pretend to be me.

57
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:53,033
Are you feeling better?

58
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,933
My biggest wish now

59
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,500
Your eyes will recover soon.

60
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:12,666
Stop

61
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,100
What are you doing?

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,433
Don't you know what I want to do?

63
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:17,366
Don't pretend to be silly.

64
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,433
My ex-girlfriend can get to France from here.

65
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:22,433
I'm just having fun with you.

66
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:23,933
Ling Chen, are you crazy?

67
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,433
Come to me if you need help.

68
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:26,800
Don't get involved.

69
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,400
You wanted to save your little lover.

70
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:32,166
Is she your little fan again?

71
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,200
Have you seen it?

72
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:35,133
This is your character and nature.

73
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,033
Stop

74
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,100
You're so timely.

75
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,933
I don 't want to see this internet celebrity anymore

76
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:56,933
Did you hear that?
