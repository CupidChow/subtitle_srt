1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,300
Well

2
00:00:18,966 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Sorry.

3
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,900
I was wrong.

4
00:00:38,733 --> 00:00:39,833
I shouldn't have made you sad.

5
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:41,500
I just want to be there for me.

6
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:42,666
You can always be yourself.

7
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:05,566
Yes?

8
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,600
You changed your mind.

9
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,400
You were different last night.

10
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,266
I'm still a patient.

11
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,933
Do you want to murder your husband?

12
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,400
Don't worry.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,333
Your father's affairs have been handed over to the secretary.

14
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,033
What about the competition?

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't worry.

16
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:29,566
I'll handle it.

17
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,433
This is

18
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,633
My mom asked me to give her future daughter-in-law

19
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,833
You must tell me anything in the future.

20
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,100
What's the use of asking you?

21
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:56,633
You can't even watch a man.

22
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,033
I only know how to cry.

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,766
Qin Luoluo, tell me directly if you need help.

24
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,400
While I still look good,

25
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:03,833
Take back the stretched hands and feet.

26
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,766
Don't touch those you shouldn't.

27
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,000
Otherwise, I will make the whole Qin family disappear.

28
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,166
Has spent money to take down the popular search.

29
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:13,800
I've asked other food critics I know.

30
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,533
And blamed the mistake on the company's supervision.

31
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,900
And didn't provide effective ingredients.

32
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,300
At the same time,

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,933
Has been compensated.

34
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,766
And sent all the food products

35
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:26,100
To poor primary schools and orphanages around.

36
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,033
According to the recent reaction on Weibo,

37
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,266
The public will be very anxious

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,733
Has made a great impact.

39
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:35,066
But also the impact on the company's stock price

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,000
To the lowest level.

41
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,766
Everyone is doing well this time.

42
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:39,366
This matter will pass.

43
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:40,600
to accept

44
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,966
Report the overall planning of each department for the second half of the year.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,233
Why are you doing this?

46
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,433
hey

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,066
That's right, brother.

48
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,833
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

49
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,266
Why hang from a tree?

50
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,033
Then ask Lin Zeyan to change the tree.

51
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:12,933
Alright, bro.

52
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,133
Drink this cup.

53
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,466
Time will fade everything.

54
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:18,033
Don't think about it.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
I'll definitely forget it.

56
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,633
Besides,

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Whoever is with Lin Zeyan won't suffer.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,000
Isn't this a good thing?

59
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,033
Why don't you open the pot?

60
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,900
I'm fine.

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,700
Leave.

62
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,266
Don't worry.

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,433
Men recover quickly.

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,466
The old one won't go.

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,766
The new one is not coming.

66
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:50,766
parking

67
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,800
Scum, do you think every man is like you?

68
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,966
Look at my mouth.
