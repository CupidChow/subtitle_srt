1
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:09,766
To work overtime with me.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,600
I need help with my work.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,900
How can I help you?

4
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,633
Do you usually use computer voice at work?

5
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:15,966
You still need me to help you watch something.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,966
There are things they can't do.

7
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:35,766
These books

8
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:38,866
I can't understand any of them.

9
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:40,633
What does this mean?

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,600
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,933
You too.

12
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:46,066
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
You're lying, not Mingyue.

14
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,966
Smarter than I thought.

15
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:51,966
Of course.

16
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,366
Such a proud man.

17
00:00:58,466 --> 00:01:00,900
I don't know how much I suffered for these eyes.

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,933
Hey, I'm telling you,

19
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:07,100
You are indeed the president's wife.

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,633
Well, who says it's not?

21
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,166
She touched Mr. Lin's eyes.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,400
Do you want to work in the Lin's restaurant?

23
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,066
Do not

24
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:16,200
I'm not fit for soft food.

25
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:18,233
However

26
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:20,066
Speaking of delicious food,

27
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:23,000
We can make some creative dishes together.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
What do you think

29
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,300
It's not impossible.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,100
After all, there are not many picky people like you.

31
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,733
I'm quite lucky.

32
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,266
You're such a troublemaker.

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,733
Troublesome likes me.

34
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,333
I'm blind.

35
00:01:37,366 --> 00:01:38,366
you

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,700
feed

37
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:55,666
What did you say

38
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,600
Yoyo, why are you so late?

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,600
Cheng Mu is going abroad.

40
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:05,733
Go and persuade him.

41
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:09,166
Cheng Mu.

42
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,366
Are you sure you want to go abroad?

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,366
I decided to study abroad.

44
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,766
My dad has been urging me for a long time.

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,733
To discuss a long-term project outside.

46
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,000
Then why didn't you tell me so suddenly?

47
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:23,766
I'm not acting on impulse.

48
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,200
The reason I stayed is because

49
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,000
I have something I can't let go.

50
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,100
Now?

51
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:32,800
I know she's good.

52
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:35,433
I have no worries.

53
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,666
Who are you talking about?

54
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:48,466
Although it's late,

55
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:50,766
But the confession is true.

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,033
Do you remember the question you asked me that day?

57
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:00,500
What I treasure most

58
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:02,000
I've always been there.

59
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:04,966
It's you.

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,700
Xiayu

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,433
I already know your choice.

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,700
It's just that

63
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,400
I still want you to know.

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
if

65
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,500
If someone wants to bully you,

66
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,500
I won't sit by and watch.

67
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,533
If I had been brave,

68
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,266
I've always believed that

69
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,233
You will get what you want.

70
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:50,433
Take care of yourself.
