1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,400
Orange hasn't replied to my messages for two days.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,133
Is she having an accident?

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,466
She might be with Ling Chen.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,500
Can't you come back?

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,566
That's right.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,033
I'll call Ling Chen now.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,333
feed

8
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:23,366
Ling Chen.

9
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:24,733
Is Orange with you?

10
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,833
Yoyo, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

11
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:29,600
You were together yesterday.

12
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,433
Hey, where are you now?

13
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:32,633
I'll be right there.

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,966
No, no.

15
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:35,666
I'm telling you, how is the orange now?

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,500
Don't bother me.

17
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,233
I'm fine now.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,366
I'll see you later.

19
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,533
That's it.

20
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:42,266
With Ling Chen,

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,300
It's okay.

22
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Leave them alone.

23
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,600
Don't you have time to look at me?

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,466
It's because of him that I'm worried.

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
Really? Are you sure?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,733
That's right. I can do this.

27
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:11,500
Zeyan's eyes can finally recover.

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,700
You can tell me

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,200
Why are you looking for me?

30
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,300
Instead of Lin Zeyan?

31
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,566
What do you think?

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,533
Dean Han is an outstanding oculist.

33
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,000
I didn't come back from abroad.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,500
And won't accept the invitation.

35
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,566
This time, I asked a lot of people

36
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,533
So I decided to help.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,300
Are you so kind?

38
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,233
I did lose to you.

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,500
But about Ze Yan's eyes,

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,466
Only I can do that.

41
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:43,866
I can help you.

42
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,333
But I have conditions.

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
What's the condition?

44
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,100
As long as you agree,

45
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:56,866
Your mother's illness

46
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,300
I can find a way to cure him.

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,600
Make your own choice.

48
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,300
Don't tell Lin Zeyan.

49
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,533
This is our little secret.

50
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,366
Don't worry. The surgery tomorrow will be successful.

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,633
After my surgery,

52
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:26,266
You should be with me from now on.

53
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:31,666
Zeyan, I found a way to treat your eyes.

54
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,400
Your eyes can be restored.

55
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,633
I thought I would never see you again.

56
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:38,966
didn't expect

57
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:41,200
Dean Han has made a breakthrough in ophthalmology.

58
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,200
When my eyes are healed,

59
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,500
Let's get married, okay?

60
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,100
Will be fine.

61
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,600
The necklace on your neck is for the mistress of the Lin family.

62
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,000
Since you're wearing it,

63
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,066
You can't change your mind.

64
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:55,200
When the surgery is successful tomorrow,

65
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,266
I will be the first to take off the gauze for you.

66
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,233
I want you to take a good look at me.

67
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,266
I will protect you.

68
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,533
According to the original plan.

69
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:08,233
OK

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,533
Do you know what I like most about you?

71
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:22,966
You must tell me anything in the future.

72
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,500
My biggest wish now

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,033
Your eyes will recover soon.

74
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,633
If you're late, 1,000 will be deducted.

75
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:21,566
Bye.

76
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:23,166
Lin Zeyan.
