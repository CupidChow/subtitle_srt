1
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:06,966
What about

2
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:07,966
Nothing.

3
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:09,900
Nothing.

4
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,866
It's not easy to use.

5
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,266
How about this?

6
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:17,600
Let's try to play hard to get.

7
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:20,300
You always brush the sense of existence.

8
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:21,400
When she gets used to it,

9
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:22,033
hey

10
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:23,100
And ignored her.

11
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey, I don't believe it.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,933
She can escape my hands.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
Ah, the palm of your hand.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Your friend's boss is amazing.

15
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,766
You can play hard to get.

16
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,200
Have you heard of the 366 Strategy?

17
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,466
One step back today for two steps forward tomorrow

18
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,366
Don't pretend to be silly.

19
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:47,433
Your friend.

20
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,700
Tell your friend to pretend to be silly.

21
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,166
I made a new dish recently.

22
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,166
Give it a try.

23
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,266
Don't bother.

24
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,700
Give it a try.

25
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:00,733
I'm busy.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,500
Help me try it on.

27
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:05,433
sit

28
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,400
The tofu is too strong.

29
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:14,666
Is not suitable for making desserts.

30
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:17,900
According to Lin Zeyan's suggestion,

31
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,600
Should be able to win the game.

32
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:28,966
It's too spicy.

33
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:30,233
Without taste.

34
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:34,233
Next time it tastes so bad,

35
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:35,533
The salary is deducted.

36
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:37,333
OK!

37
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:42,700
He's too picky.

38
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,466
I will endure it for the food competition.

39
00:01:50,033 --> 00:01:51,033
Food competition.

40
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:52,633
From now on,

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,066
Xia You Team.

42
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,733
In the first round.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,266
The second qualifying round begins now.

44
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,000
Go and fix the ingredients of Xia You.

45
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,833
Hurry up.

46
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,833
Got it?

47
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:34,933
understand

48
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,600
It's an honor for you to participate in the finals.

49
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:42,966
The game begins.

50
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:44,866
Once again,

51
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,733
To ensure the fairness of the competition,

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,266
This competition can't be used.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,133
Ingredients other than those prepared in the restaurant

54
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,300
Otherwise, I will be disqualified.

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,466
Cheng Mu, have you seen the candy?

56
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:00,733
No.

57
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:02,833
No sugar.

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,700
Then our dishes

59
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:07,066
I can't make it so delicious.

60
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:09,600
No way

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
I must be the first.

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,466
The game is over.

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,433
Mr. Lin, these are the last two dishes.

64
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:31,566
The first dish.

65
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,733
The jade wears a thousand silk.

66
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,900
This jade wears thousands of silk.

67
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,033
And innovative.

68
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,300
Dare to match the ingredients.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
The flavor between the ingredients is balanced and attenuated.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,433
With a hint of sweetness.

71
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,300
However

72
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,566
This shouldn't be the taste of sugar.

73
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:52,933
The second dish.

74
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,266
Flying wings.

75
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,000
The Tao is soaring.

76
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:01,566
The taste is strong and not greasy.

77
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,233
Soft glutinous slippery mouth

78
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,033
The fire is good.

79
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,433
It can be said that the essence of the chicken wing is in place.

80
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,100
Your vote is...
