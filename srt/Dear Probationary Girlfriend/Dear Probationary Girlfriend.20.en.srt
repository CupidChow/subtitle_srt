1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,966
Emmmmm

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,200
Well

3
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:17,933
Well

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,700
Well

5
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,100
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,300
No, no.

7
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,033
I'm an upright man.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,933
Form is empty, and form is void.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,500
orange

10
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,133
When will you understand my heart?

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,900
Mr. Lin, I have a file here.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,733
It's Xia You who won the championship.

13
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:47,566
And was framed.

14
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:48,866
Something out of nothing.

15
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,533
As long as the investigation is clear.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,366
It's signed by Xia You's father.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,900
This is equivalent to sitting down.

18
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:55,266
I'm afraid that no matter how we investigate,

19
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:56,533
Will only be accused of fraud.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,633
If you can't handle it well,

21
00:00:58,033 --> 00:00:59,733
I'm afraid Miss Xia will be imprisoned.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,400
Find out who did this.

23
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,033
President Lin, something happened to Miss Xia.

24
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:11,600
Miss Xia is fine.

25
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,833
I was just frightened.

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,200
Just take a few days off.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,833
Fortunately, it was sent to the hospital in time.

28
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:22,766
Mr. Lin, this is the file you asked me to check.

29
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:24,200
We found this at the scene.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,466
Should be left by the person behind.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,900
Mr. Lin is very smart.

32
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:31,433
You don't have to guess who we are.

33
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,233
We're just doing our job.

34
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:36,233
This is just a little warning.

35
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:39,333
If you still hold on to the Sukai Hotel acquisition,

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,600
It won't be so easy next time.

37
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,366
Where am I?

38
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:01,666
orange

39
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,633
Where are you going?

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,333
Are you telling the truth to everyone?

41
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,100
Is it funny to play me like this?

42
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:11,833
I'm just an ordinary person.

43
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,733
Please stop coming into my life, okay?

44
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,100
Wait, orange.

45
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,633
orange

46
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:19,433
orange

47
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,266
I lied to him on purpose.

48
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:23,466
I was afraid that you would get hurt.

49
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:24,966
What about the midnight incident?

50
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,166
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,533
I'm afraid that you hate me.

52
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:30,833
Orange, I really like you.

53
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:32,533
If you don't like midnight,

54
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:33,966
I won't write anymore.

55
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,300
What I said is true.

56
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:37,966
If you don't believe what I said,

57
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:40,233
Then listen to my heart, orange.

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,600
Ah

59
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:46,433
Ah

60
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,233
Does it hurt?

61
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
They hurt

62
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,500
It hurts.

63
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,266
I'll leave it to you.

64
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:01,966
Han Yuan.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,833
I will try my best.
