1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,266
If you brag and don't write a draft,

2
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:09,233
Lin Zeyan can't learn it.

3
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:11,000
What are you?

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,233
And girls.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,600
It's disgraceful.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,133
It's not good.

7
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,266
Xia You almost fought with President Zhao just now.

8
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:31,933
go

9
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:32,866
Take me to Xia You.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,900
Are you alright?

11
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:35,833
Are you hurt?

12
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,000
Why are you here?

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,700
I

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,166
My dad asked me to help the chairman.

15
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,366
To help with something.

16
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:43,866
Zeyan, let's go home together.

17
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't bother Sandy and the chairman.

18
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:48,833
Sandy.

19
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,533
President

20
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,566
Did I cause him trouble?

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,500
Wow, that Wildcat is so cool.

22
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,866
You dare to say anything.

23
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:03,700
I can't even hold her.

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,600
It's so ridiculous.

25
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:05,366
That's right.

26
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,533
That crazy man didn't even want me to fight with him.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm talking about you.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is this place?

29
00:01:10,066 --> 00:01:11,333
How dare you bring her here?

30
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,000
It's all my fault.

31
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,700
I'm just curious.

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,500
I want to help you, Miss Qin.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,400
But don't worry.

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,633
You won't do it again.

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,133
You're so late.

36
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,966
Do you know what you did today?

37
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:29,633
a row

38
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,433
It's none of my business.

39
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,933
I will never do such unnecessary things again.

40
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:35,333
You can say whatever you want.

41
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,733
Why did you stand out for me?

42
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,366
What are you thinking?

43
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,900
Because you pity me.

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,000
Or because

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,300
Care about me.

46
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:51,900
And who is that man?

47
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,966
Is Xia You Orange with you?

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,400
No, she went to the Joint Publishing House.

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,733
At the book signing.

50
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,500
hey

51
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:11,833
orange

52
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,033
What a coincidence!

53
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,000
Are you here to read the new book?

54
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:16,700
It's a coincidence.

55
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Isn't this my book?

56
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,300
Then I have a chance.

57
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,366
Hey, are you also a fan of Midnight?

58
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,466
How do you introduce yourself?

59
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,733
Actually, I'm a writer. My pen name is Midnight.

60
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:25,600
No

61
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,500
I don't like him.

62
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,933
The writing is exaggerated and vulgar.

63
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,133
What he writes can only be used to cheat little girls.

64
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,700
You don't like him?

65
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:36,133
It's annoying.

66
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,566
Have you read what he wrote?

67
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:38,566
Yes, I have.

68
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:39,566
How are you feeling?

69
00:02:39,566 --> 00:02:40,566
It's not bad.

70
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,333
I'm glad you like it.

71
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,833
Actually, it's not good to read it carefully.

72
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,100
Not deep enough.

73
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,166
The words are shallow.

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,333
You think so too?

75
00:02:50,366 --> 00:02:51,366
Well

76
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,300
Why are you here to read his new book?

77
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:54,866
Oh dear

78
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:57,933
I just want to see how bad his writing is.

79
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:00,300
I didn't expect you to have a special hobby.

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh dear

81
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:03,700
Since it's fate,

82
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,300
Let's watch it together.

83
00:03:05,966 --> 00:03:07,866
No, I'm here to see another author.

84
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:08,766
Look.

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
Ah

86
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,466
Well

87
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:12,566
Alright.

88
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:30,800
Sorry

89
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,600
I

90
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,500
Don't prepare.

91
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,600
I'll go to the office directly.

92
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,600
Why is the line always busy?

93
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:48,866
Don't bother me.

94
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,333
Why are you so angry?

95
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,666
Can't you sell the book?

96
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,833
Miss Qin, what's wrong?

97
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,533
Lin Zeyan is not here.

98
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:00,966
I'm here to discuss cooperation with you.

99
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,833
What are we talking about?
