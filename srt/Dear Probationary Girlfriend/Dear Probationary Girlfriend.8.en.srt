1
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,266
Try this again. It's delicious.

2
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:18,366
Calm down.

3
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:19,933
This is Party A's father.

4
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:22,166
How can I have any thoughts of him?

5
00:00:22,566 --> 00:00:23,400
Calm down.

6
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:28,400
Actually, that day in the banquet hall,

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
I didn't mean to cause you trouble.

8
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,400
Yeah, it's fine.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,033
Actually, I know

10
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:34,900
Thank you

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,766
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,400
Nothing to eat.

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,633
This fried chicken steak is really delicious.

14
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:52,666
Right? I said it's delicious.

15
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:54,600
I've never been here before.

16
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,466
For the first time.

17
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:57,666
Can we come again next time?

18
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:58,733
good

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,633
Someone took the bag.

20
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:04,866
Zeyan, move away.

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,600
Xiayu

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,800
What's wrong with you, Xia You?

23
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,166
Xiayu

24
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:21,966
Ah

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,333
Mr. Lin,

26
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,966
The robber was caught by the police yesterday.

27
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,900
Yes, I know.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,400
Mr. Lin,

29
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,533
What do you think of the creative proposal?

30
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh, I know.

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,233
Mr. Lin,

32
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,500
I have good news and bad news.

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Which one do you want to listen to first?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
spit it out!

35
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:57,666
Okay, I'll tell you the bad news.

36
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,633
The bad news is,

37
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,866
Your fiancee is out to cause trouble again.

38
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:05,566
She asked me for help to send Xia You.

39
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,833
And tell me about your heart.

40
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,033
The pay is very generous.

41
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:11,866
She doesn't know you very well.

42
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,633
But I want to interview you.

43
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,633
So many girls fought for you.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,700
What do you think, Mr. Lin?

45
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Don't compare me to you.

46
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:19,033
a row

47
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:20,700
How about this?

48
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,400
I think Xia You is pretty good.

49
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:23,566
How about I make an appointment with her?

50
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
What's the good news?

51
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:27,566
Ah, that's the good news.

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,833
Hey, it's good news that I'm here.

53
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,866
Don't you feel it?

54
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,133
Hello, security, come here.

55
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:34,566
Don't.

56
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:35,566
Let me tell you something.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,333
What do you think of Xia You?

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,133
I have something to do. You can go now.

59
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:42,933
Oh dear

60
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,300
If you want to know what a girl is thinking,

61
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,900
You need to know her reaction.

62
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,266
For instance

63
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,266
Beauty seduces.

64
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,133
Close contact.

65
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,700
As long as you find her subconsciously,

66
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:54,866
I guess you'll have a chance.

67
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:55,766
I have something to do.

68
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,600
Go first.

69
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:58,466
Don't.

70
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,833
Why don't you say I'm here? I can give you another trick.

71
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:01,966
You know what?

72
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:03,900
Xia You has set up a food column recently.

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,333
We can hold such an event.

74
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:08,333
To collect all kinds of foodies.

75
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:10,733
To inspire you, right?

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Our chips are higher.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you afraid someone won't join us?

78
00:03:14,366 --> 00:03:15,166
What is this?

79
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,633
Four eyes see more than two

80
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,866
Such a good chance.

81
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:20,733
You can give Xia You a chance.

82
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,100
And promote the company.

83
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,566
Kill two birds with one stone.

84
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:28,033
Hey, are you interested in participating in the Creative Food Competition?
