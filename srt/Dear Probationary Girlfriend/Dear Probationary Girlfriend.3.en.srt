1
00:00:06,166 --> 00:00:08,800
You don't need me to teach you how to read.

2
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:12,766
Why are you so close?

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,233
The smell of toilet water is too strong.

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,100
you

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,966
Lin Zeyan, wait and see how long you can stay.

6
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,600
The position of the slipper has changed 30 cm.

7
00:00:57,233 --> 00:01:00,666
Secretary Li, I just want to ask you something.

8
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,300
Lin Zeyan. No, no.

9
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:07,000
Does President Lin have any dietary restrictions?

10
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,000
No, I think he has eaten less recently.

11
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,666
It's not the way to go on like this.

12
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,200
Mr. Lin is very picky.

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Mr. Lin hates green pepper. He doesn't eat coriander.

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,066
I don't even like mushrooms.

15
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:22,066
You're so picky.

16
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:24,966
If you have conscience, don't say it was me.

17
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:25,966
Don't worry.

18
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:27,366
I wouldn't have said it was you.

19
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:28,800
It's too late for me to thank you.

20
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:31,300
By the way, Lin Zeyan

21
00:01:31,733 --> 00:01:33,800
He seems to know his family very well.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,833
I can see them.

23
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,933
That's because the location of the house is according to President Lin.

24
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm used to designing.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,433
Everything is the same.

26
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,266
I'm telling you,

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,400
It's the same as opening it.

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,366
This is a new dish.

29
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,266
Have a taste.

30
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:59,666
It must be delicious. Hey.

31
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,300
Xia You, it seems that you don't want your salary.

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,666
Did you taste it?

33
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,066
Unless my sense of taste fails.

34
00:02:08,766 --> 00:02:10,433
You are so careless.

35
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,300
sorry

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,933
How dare I do that next time?

37
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,066
The taste

38
00:02:16,566 --> 00:02:18,033
The accident was handled cleanly.

39
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:20,466
If it's only made by the touch,

40
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,400
You are talented.

41
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:26,766
It's hard to change the taste completely.

42
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,600
Try another way next time.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,300
She did it on purpose.

44
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:35,166
It seems she can't get away with deducting her salary for a month.

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,133
My eyes hurt.

46
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,233
Open the window and give him some air.

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,033
What's wrong with him?

48
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:36,900
actually

49
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:41,400
Lin Zeyan looks good with his mouth closed.

50
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,433
President Lin, Xia You was caught by the tabloids.

51
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:05,533
On the top search list.

52
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,633
Now the public opinion is everywhere.

53
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:11,999
Is it pretty?

54
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,233
good-looking

55
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:16,133
It's a misunderstanding.

56
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,500
Get up and change.

57
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,500
You still have time to dress up.

58
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,900
I mean get changed and go to the office with me.

59
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,133
Ah

60
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:34,000
Sandy, do me a favor.

61
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,966
Isn't this President Lin's rumored girlfriend?

62
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,199
Why are you leading the company?

63
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,433
You brought them out.

64
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:48,099
Is it her?

65
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,866
Is it the hot topic on Weibo?

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,766
President Lin, Sandy wants to meet you.

67
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,900
Seems to be using this scandal

68
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,266
To bring up the money.

69
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:55,233
What should we do next?

70
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,133
Don't worry. Just let her wait.

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,866
How about I handle this?

72
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:02,066
Make me a cup of coffee.

73
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,233
You don't have to look at him.

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,500
I won't let you fool him.

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,433
I told you he's not blind at all.

76
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,133
Miss Xia, you scared me to death.

77
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:16,933
Take a seat here.

78
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:17,633
Don't go anywhere.

79
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:18,433
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

80
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:19,233
Well

81
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:29,933
I've been working in Solai Cafe.

82
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,200
For more than two hours.

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
What's wrong with you?

84
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,333
I'll go to your company if I don't come.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
Mr. Lin, Miss Xia is gone.

86
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,200
It's okay. I know.

87
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,966
Hello

88
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,900
Is this Miss Sandy?
