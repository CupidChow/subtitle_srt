1
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,300
I'm not here for Lin Zeyan.

2
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:13,266
I'm here to see you.

3
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:17,333
I don't think Miss Qin and I have anything in common.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Because of your competition,

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,233
Lin Zeyan will be kicked off the board soon.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,400
You know what?

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,900
What do you mean?

8
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,800
It seems you don't know more than I thought.

9
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,900
Lin Zeyan protects you like a good-for-nothing.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,033
Why are you standing by him?

11
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,133
Is that what you want to talk about?

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,633
Marriage is a family affair.

13
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,300
You two are impossible.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,300
I'm his benefactor.

15
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,933
The Lin clan will never give up on me.

16
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:47,833
Lin Zeyan won't forget me.

17
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,600
If you want money,

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,466
I advise you to leave as soon as possible.

19
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,933
I will definitely marry him.

20
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:56,666
I'm not doing it for the money.

21
00:00:58,466 --> 00:00:59,333
It's not about money.

22
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,833
Then tell me why you are attending the Creative Food Exhibition.

23
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,366
For your dream?

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,733
What's wrong with the money I earned on my own?

25
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,666
Don't you know that

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,833
Is the food exhibition held by Lin Zeyan Company?

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,033
The little thing you did on the field.

28
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,733
Really, no one knows?

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,633
Lin Zeyan hates liars.

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,133
If he knows the truth,

31
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:24,666
What would he think?

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,266
Are you interested in guessing?

33
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,800
Why didn't Lin Zeyan tell me?

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,633
This competition is held by the subsidiary company.

35
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:37,466
Because you don't trust me?

36
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,700
Why would she know the truth about the ingredients?

37
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,566
Why hasn't Xia You come back?

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,900
I'll get some medicine for my mother.

39
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,266
The driver has arrived.

40
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:48,666
I'm not going back with you.

41
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:55,066
Oh, my Young Master Lin.

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,400
Did you play a harem fight?

43
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,700
What fight?

44
00:02:01,266 --> 00:02:03,600
Don't pretend. I saw it.

45
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:06,833
That Qin Luo Luo came out of the hospital.

46
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:12,866
Zeyan called me.

47
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:15,800
Hello, Zeyan.

48
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:16,800
QINLUOLUO

49
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,400
If you need help, just tell me.

50
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:21,433
Take my arms and legs back while I still have a good look.

51
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:23,400
Don't touch those you shouldn't.

52
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,066
Otherwise, I will make the whole Qin family

53
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:26,600
Zeyan is not what you think.

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,333
Aunt, Ze Yan is giving me a tantrum again.

55
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,400
President Lin, Xia You's creative food is on the headlines.

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Someone reported that

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,300
The ingredients of this dish are not provided by the restaurant.

58
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,200
Many people are questioning Xia You's qualification.

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,300
And the integrity of the competition.

60
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,433
How can I explain this to Lin Ze?

61
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,233
You should tell him.

62
00:02:58,266 --> 00:02:59,300
Hey, Yoyo.

63
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,066
dad

64
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:00,800
Why are you here?

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,266
Long

66
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,433
Lend me some money.

67
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,300
I was so close.

68
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:05,866
How much do you want?

69
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,033
Lend me as much as you have.

70
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,400
That's all I have.

71
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:15,266
That's it?

72
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,000
Rich people live here.

73
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,866
You just sent me away?

74
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,466
dad

75
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,533
Let go of me.

76
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,533
Don't touch her.

77
00:03:22,066 --> 00:03:22,866
You want money?

78
00:03:23,266 --> 00:03:24,100
Take it.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,900
Hey, thanks.

80
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,833
My eyes are uncomfortable.

81
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,200
Let's go home.
