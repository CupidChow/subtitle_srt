1
00:00:12,266 --> 00:00:14,000
Why did you catch a cold this season?

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,100
You might catch a cold.

3
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:16,566
Why isn't Luo Luo here?

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,766
Does she know about your illness?

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,633
Xia You, help me get the medicine.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,700
I won't marry Qin Luoluo.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,766
I can only promise to take care of her like a real sister.

8
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:30,233
I didn't reject it clearly.

9
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:31,866
Because I haven't found the one I love.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,133
I have it now.

11
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,433
So I have to draw a line with Qin Luo Luo.

12
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,066
Kindness is kindness.

13
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,700
Love is love.

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Don't mix it up.

15
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,400
Xiayu

16
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,733
I meant every word I just said.

17
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,600
Although I can't see clearly,

18
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:56,000
But the heart can see clearly.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,800
Xia You, trust me.

20
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:00,066
Give me a chance.

21
00:01:00,466 --> 00:01:01,666
I will definitely cure my eyes.

22
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:02,633
To give you a future.

23
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:04,533
That's because I was

24
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,233
I didn't say I wanted to be with you.

25
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,266
You really want to be beautiful.

26
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,666
Someone's here.

27
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:14,200
Check the thermometer.

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,033
It's a bit serious. I need an injection.

29
00:01:21,066 --> 00:01:23,400
Just behave yourself.

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,933
Or the disease will get worse.

31
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:28,433
When you're ready,

32
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,600
I will cook delicious food for you.

33
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:32,400
It turns out that Lin Zeyan has such a childish side.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,133
Really?

35
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,633
They really came together.

36
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:36,933
It's amazing.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Oops,

38
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,866
My rumors.

39
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:42,866
It's very reliable.

40
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:44,333
They are definitely in play.

41
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:53,133
But life is a drama.

42
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:54,533
The drama is like life.

43
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,033
I heard a new book came out at midnight. Do you know?

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,333
I really don't know.

45
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:03,066
It must be bad.

46
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:04,933
Ah

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,100
That's right.

48
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,300
But he's fast.

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,700
Hello, Editor Wu.

50
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,000
I have a food competition here.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,233
It's great.

52
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:28,200
I hope you can produce a food review here.

53
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:31,266
And post the recipe information on the Internet.

54
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,366
Xia You, how do you explain this time?

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,233
It should be here.

56
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,266
Right?
