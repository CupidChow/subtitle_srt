1
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,988
Boss! Let me drink first.

2
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,448
You're just in time. Have some noodles.

3
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,119
Miss Beautiful, another bowl of noodles.

4
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,914
Boss, Balat's here with a big knife.
He's running amok.

5
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,334
He saw you and his ex, Donnabelle,
coming out of a motel.

6
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,091
Come on! Let's go!

7
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:59,512
- You son of a bitch! Come out!
- He's here!

8
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,472
I'm going to kill you!

9
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,268
Santa Blanca is too small
for the two of us!

10
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,105
Wait! Hold on, Balat!

11
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,149
I will chop you into tiny bits!

12
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,028
Wait! Why are you so angry?
Didn't you and Donnabelle break up?

13
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,449
But I still love her so much!

14
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,829
Attorney!

15
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,585
You're so stubborn…

16
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,715
I'll kill you, Attorney…

17
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,885
You can kill me later.
We need to get you to the ER.

18
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,220
Call an ambulance.

19
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,314
And guess what happened?

20
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,025
I dragged my no-good husband to town!

21
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,070
We agreed that on Mondays,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays,

22
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,571
he'd cook dinner.

23
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,158
Then on Thursdays, Fridays
and Saturdays, it'd be my turn.

24
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,619
And on Sundays, we'd each cook our own.

25
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,955
Looks like you sorted it out.

26
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,333
He's being difficult!
He doesn't want to cook on Sundays!

27
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,461
He wants me to cook his too
or else he'll leave me!

28
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,213
I want to sue him, Attorney!

29
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,966
I want you to squeeze him.
Five billion pesos!

30
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,094
But where will he get that kind of money?

31
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,887
- I don't care!
<i>- David Roman…</i>

32
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,995
Attorney, are you listening?

33
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,246
Look, Rosa,

34
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,040
if you go on with this
against your husband,

35
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,293
you'll spend more than you'll gain!

36
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:57,588
You don't need a lawyer!
You need marriage counseling!

37
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,257
You bastard!

38
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,467
How dare you say that to me?

39
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,722
You think I'm crazy?

40
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,806
I'm leaving!

41
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,516
Pay what you owe me!

42
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,393
Or else I'll kick you out!

43
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,229
And you!

44
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,856
You look like a snatcher!

45
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,358
You're giving me a headache!

46
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,484
Jerks!

47
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,240
Tolits, what's taking so long?

48
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,618
Boss, what do you expect me to do?

49
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,621
Your air conditioner
was already a piece of crap.

50
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,499
Now it's dead.

51
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,877
I'm not Jesus, I can't raise the dead.

52
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,477
Scram, Satan!

53
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,440
- Are you Attorney Roman?
- No.

54
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,535
I'm attorney Alex Roman.
Do you need a lawyer?

55
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:14,082
I don't believe in lawyers like you, man.

56
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,462
Gabbie. Your new receptionist.

57
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,340
Dude…

58
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:27,095
We're looking for a receptionist
for our office, not for a cult.

59
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,349
You have any experience as a receptionist?

60
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,018
Do you have a resume with you?

61
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,229
Or what school did you come from?

62
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,980
- You have any records?
- None.

63
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,566
None.

64
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,278
I don't believe in academic shit
like that, man.

65
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,073
The real school is in the streets.

66
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,326
Not in the four corners of the classroom.

67
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,411
I'm a film dropout.

68
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:56,457
And I'm applying because
I want to see some shocking crimes.

69
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,335
Bodies torn apart.

70
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,420
And clever killers.

71
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,758
I'm going to make
an awesome documentary film.

72
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,009
See this?

73
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:12,056
I'm using this old camera because
it's cooler if the video looks raw.

74
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,433
And then…

75
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,435
I'll get to Busan, to Berlin--

76
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,279
You're really hiring her?

77
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,158
What if she slits our throats
when we're sleeping?

78
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,951
We're lucky someone applied.

79
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,787
That sign's been there
for four years already.

80
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,207
You know we really need the help.

81
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,127
When can you start?

82
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,046
I can start now if you want.

83
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,882
But I'm telling you right now

84
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,634
I'm not calling you "boss" or "sir"
or "Your Honor."

85
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,052
I have no master.

86
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,601
If that's settled, can I get an advance?

87
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,896
I still have to pay
the rickshaw downstairs.

88
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,982
Okay, wait…

89
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,692
Thanks, man.

90
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,616
It's your fault, boss.

91
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,243
If you're going to hookup,

92
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,747
you should make sure
she's not a tough guy's ex-girlfriend.

93
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,792
Boss, why don't you just find someone
you can be with forever?

94
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,629
Forever isn't a thing anymore.

95
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,965
What? That's a tragedy!
There's no forever?

96
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,427
Once, maybe, there was someone.

97
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,679
I was a dumbass then.

98
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,433
That's what I'm talking about!

99
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,268
You have a TOTGA!

100
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,854
This is the only time
I'll talk about this.

101
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,481
Sure, yeah, there was one.

102
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,442
In law school, there you go.

103
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,696
I was so in love with her, man!

104
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,783
Aside from being beautiful,

105
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,910
sexy,

106
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,370
resourceful,

107
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,580
what I loved most about her is

108
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,416
she was really smart!

109
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,126
That's how it is, isn't it?

110
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,128
When you're really in love,

111
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,508
the person you love looks cute,
even if it's idiotic.

112
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,134
For example…

113
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,845
When she…

114
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,391
bites her pen…

115
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,393
- The end of her ballpen…
- Yeah.

116
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,521
She bites it when she's deep in thought.

117
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,107
So when we find a pen in the classroom,

118
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,695
we immediately know it's hers
because it's been chewed.

119
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,280
And here's another thing.

120
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,074
She has a tattoo on her wrist.

121
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,867
Two swallows.

122
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,412
Birds.

123
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,125
She got them because she was drunk.

124
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,377
Yeah.

125
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,171
We were happy…

126
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,757
Until we weren't.

127
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,017
Hey!

128
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,019
Wait!

129
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,062
Hold on!

130
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,774
Long time no see…

131
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,241
I swear, I can pay!
I have a new client, big time!

132
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:22,038
I don't give a shit
where you get my money.

133
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,375
One month, you understand, Alex?

134
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,503
Boss, what about six months, huh?

135
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,840
Six months?

136
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,425
Like an installment plan?

137
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,926
Let's go.

138
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,471
I'll be back for you.

139
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,666
Those are great shots, man.

140
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,252
Where were you hiding there?

141
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,630
I was hiding by the plants, boss.

142
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:16,884
But I couldn't leave
because Mr. Chang's car arrived.

143
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,096
You think Mrs. Chang
would be satisfied with this?

144
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,308
Yeah, give it to me on a flash drive
so we can get paid.

145
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,977
Hey, boss. I was wondering…

146
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,817
I always thought lawyers were paid well.

147
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,777
So how come…

148
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,613
you're still poor?

149
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,949
Asshole!

150
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,617
I'm just kidding, boss!

151
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,619
How are we supposed to earn big?

152
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,454
We've got small time clients.

153
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,373
- Remember Mr. Ipe?
- Yeah.

154
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:53,129
What happened after we got his cow back?
What did he pay us?

155
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,672
Five chickens.

156
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,760
How can I bill him more than that?
He doesn't have any money.

157
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,637
How?

158
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,435
I wish I'd just joined a band.

159
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,064
I didn't really want to be a lawyer.

160
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,483
So why did you become a lawyer?

161
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,609
It is what it is.

162
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,946
My father's an asshole, he forced me.

163
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,748
How are you, Attorney Roman?

164
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:38,632
Why? Can't I check up
on an esteemed colleague?

165
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,553
Don't fuck with me. What do you want?

166
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,397
And I saw on the TV
you have a top law firm.

167
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,819
I'm not so sure why you're looking for me.

168
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,239
There are a lot of lawyers here,
sure, but…

169
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,845
Okay. Where are you?

170
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,737
Didn't you hear it the first time?

171
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,494
I had nothing to do
with the victim's death.

172
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,958
You have no business in Santa Blanca.

173
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,418
I don't know.

174
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,380
I just woke up--

175
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,298
Who's the victim?

176
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,804
I don't know her.

177
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,141
I just woke up in the motel…

178
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,686
with the corpse.

179
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,565
I remember nothing.

180
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,612
Do you hear yourself?

181
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,740
You don't remember anything?

182
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,465
This is going nowhere, then.

183
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,385
I'll tell you what, I'll just file some--

184
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,205
But I'm doing this for Mom.

185
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,918
<i>Art, music, literature, high marks.</i>

186
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,546
<i>But when it comes to math and science,</i>
<i>you almost flunked.</i>

187
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,343
<i>How are you going to be successful</i>

188
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,304
<i>if you're wasting your time</i>
<i>on useless things?</i>

189
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,223
Haven't I told you?

190
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,937
I don't want to be a lawyer!

191
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,314
You have no choice, do you understand?

192
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,358
You have no choice, okay?

193
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,403
David! Stop it!

194
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,447
Your son is not an extension of you!

195
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,959
Because you coddle him just like that!

196
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,049
Don't talk to me about…

197
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,219
the battles you fight!

198
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,616
Is David Roman really your father?

199
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,869
Shocking, man. That's awesome.

200
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,539
Isn't it obvious? We're both named Roman.

201
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,377
The best lawyer in the country
is your father.

202
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,255
You're a far cry from your father.

203
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,593
Thank you very much for your sarcasm!

204
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,772
Look, boss, all I want to say is,

205
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:30,317
I'm not a lawyer.

206
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,861
I didn't even finish high school.

207
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:38,826
But even I know you shouldn't
take a relative as a client.

208
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,160
It's not right!

209
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,081
Let's get something straight.

210
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,210
I don't have any emotional attachment
to my father.

211
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,796
We haven't spoken in a while.

212
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,091
I came to Santa Blanca
to get away from him.

213
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,717
That's all there is to it.

214
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,722
I took this case for my mother's sake.

215
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,144
And even if he's like that,
I still have to represent him.

216
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,189
Because everyone has a right
to have a lawyer.

217
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,695
Money's not too bad either.
Didn't you count it?

218
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,660
Look, I'm just here
to witness heated exchanges of…

219
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,291
Dude, I bet you've won a lot of cases.

220
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,919
I bet when you show up,
prosecutors shake in terror, huh?

221
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,922
What are you talking about?

222
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,551
This is the first time
one of his cases is going to court.

223
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,222
Let's leave then. We've lost, let's go!

224
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,807
So that's how you put it?

225
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,687
Just relax and watch how I work.

226
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,856
This face… See this face?

227
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,527
I maybe a first-timer,
but I'm sure I can charm the judge.

228
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,237
So just relax.

229
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,906
Cool.

230
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,491
Wait, why is it taking so long…

231
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,744
It's 8:55! You're running late!

232
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,454
My watch stopped!

233
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,998
All right! I'll go ahead!

234
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,254
- Break a leg!
- Fix your clothes!

235
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,301
What happened to you? You're late.

236
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,021
Your necktie is a mess.

237
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,444
How are you?

238
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,410
What are you doing in Santa Blanca?

239
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,756
I know it's so hard to get into
the public prosecutor's office.

240
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,135
But here you are, wow.
You're still as brilliant as ever.

241
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,059
Since you're here, maybe we can talk?

242
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:55,285
So Public Prosecutor Jenny Templo
is the reason

243
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,705
why you don't get into
serious relationships, boss.

244
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,917
What are you talking about?

245
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,257
When you're really in love,

246
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:17,974
whatever the person you love does

247
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,227
is cute.

248
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,151
I knew that would happen.

249
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,756
Hey, man, why are you recording?

250
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,092
What we're doing here is confidential.

251
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,012
I said I'd be making a documentary, right?

252
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,222
Are you stupid?

253
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,682
It's all right.

254
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:04,604
Boss, this is the testimony
of Brenda Sebastian, the housekeeper.

255
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,195
<i>There wasn't anything strange</i>
<i>that evening.</i>

256
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,324
<i>Lovers having their trysts.</i>

257
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,329
<i>Mistresses with their aging sugar daddies.</i>

258
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:26,251
<i>They tell us to knock three times.</i>

259
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:34,009
<i>When we've knocked thrice</i>
<i>and no one answers,</i>

260
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,471
<i>and there's no "do not disturb" sign,</i>
<i>we can enter the room.</i>

261
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,814
<i>Help!</i>

262
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,191
What do we do? There's a witness.

263
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,570
Are you even sure your father is innocent?

264
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,535
It looks like Attorney Jenny
has strong evidence.

265
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,495
The evidence is strong, yes.

266
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,373
But remember…

267
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:15,633
Until the prosecution proves
that there is no other conclusion

268
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,677
with the evidence at hand.

269
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,304
And that's our job.

270
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,016
To show there's reasonable doubt.

271
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,548
<i>Like I disappeared.</i>

272
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,770
<i>My head felt heavy.</i>

273
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,446
Boss, what's so funny about that?

274
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,533
Sorry, I was just thinking.

275
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,662
I know my father well, he's a germophobe.

276
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:31,835
It's impossible for anyone
to force him to,

277
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:37,132
much less for him to willingly
enter a motel like Sangria Inn.

278
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,563
That means your father
was telling the truth

279
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,189
when he said he was drugged.

280
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,775
By whom?

281
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,863
He has a lot of enemies.

282
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:20,884
Someone should have seen him entering
or being taken into the motel that night.

283
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,886
Well, boss,

284
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,056
here's a copy of the motel's logbook.

285
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,981
This is not my dad's signature.

286
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,984
So someone signed in for him?

287
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,947
We need to look at the CCTV footage.

288
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,951
All right, I'll go to the motel.

289
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,460
I need to know what her relationship is
with my father.

290
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,338
Tolits will get the CCTV footage
from the motel.

291
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,593
Based on your sworn testimony,
Miss Witness,

292
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:07,055
you saw the accused killing the victim?

293
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,808
- Yes.
- Objection, Your Honor.

294
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,435
Speculative.
The witness didn't actually see

295
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,479
the accused killing the victim.

296
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,403
Miss Witness, you stated here,

297
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,156
<i>"I saw a man covered in blood."</i>

298
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,951
<i>"He was holding</i>
<i>a bloody woman in his arms."</i>

299
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,829
Is this correct?

300
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,580
Yes.

301
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:37,418
How far were you from the bloody man
and the bloody woman?

302
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:43,049
About eight to ten feet.

303
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,262
If you saw the bloody man,
could you recognize him?

304
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,889
Yes.

305
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,975
Is he here, inside the courtroom?

306
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,519
Yes.

307
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,020
Can you point him out?

308
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,775
It's him.

309
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,873
Mr. Gatdula, who were you with

310
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,292
when you responded that night
to Sangria Inn?

311
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,420
I was with Police Corporal Dalisay Gomez.

312
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:24,424
<i>My partner and I were on patrol.</i>

313
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:29,262
<i>We were radioed by dispatch</i>
<i>to investigate a potential homicide.</i>

314
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:33,308
<i>Attorney Roman was dazed.</i>
<i>We could barely talk to him.</i>

315
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,559
Get down!

316
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,061
According to this,

317
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,315
you found the drugs fentanyl

318
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,151
and benzodiazepine.

319
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:47,906
If used on humans, these can cause

320
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,825
dizziness and unconsciousness.

321
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,619
So, Mr. Witness,

322
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:58,207
can you say someone
administered these drugs to the accused?

323
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:09,052
It's asking the witness
to share his own opinion.

324
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,642
But, Your Honor,
since Mr. Gatdula is a cop,

325
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,312
he is aware of these drugs, right?

326
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,941
What the hell are you doing?

327
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,504
You stated in your sworn testimony
on page two,

328
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,257
<i>that the accused requested</i>
<i>to have the victim's body bag opened.</i>

329
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,300
Is this correct?

330
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,227
When the body bag was opened,
what did the accused do?

331
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,314
<i>He looked at the victim,</i>
<i>and then he cried.</i>

332
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,151
What did Mr. Roman say to the victim,
Mr. Witness?

333
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,537
He was crying as he said sorry.

334
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,124
He was crying while apologizing.

335
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,169
I haven't asked a question yet,
Your Honor.

336
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,891
Sir, you're the examiner
who performed the autopsy.

337
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,309
- Is this correct?
- Yes.

338
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,237
Is this true?

339
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,741
Yes, there was a laceration wound
on the victim's neck.

340
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:59,370
Based on the trajectory of the wound,
her throat was quickly cut.

341
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,922
We haven't submitted
the CCTV footage of the motel yet.

342
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,216
But we have already requested for it.

343
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,682
I already said no! No!
Don't you understand that?

344
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,608
Is she a client in your law firm?

345
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:15,613
Why are you looking for a connection
between the victim and my law firm?

346
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,563
…if you're not telling me everything?

347
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,023
What is the truth?

348
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,695
I've already told you
what you need to know.

349
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,057
Uncle.

350
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:43,951
This car

351
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,998
was Nick Maximo, Dave Roman
and Pablo Mandala.

352
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,650
Aren't you wondering why, until now,

353
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,903
this scandal hasn't blown up yet?

354
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,268
Thank you, thank you.

355
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:17,003
First… my father's mind is made up.

356
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,991
But why?

357
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,792
Uncle…

358
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,631
Are you sure you want to give me your SUV
for that shitty car?

359
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,811
When you get to my age…

360
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:24,695
I just want to preserve
the artifacts of my past.

361
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,031
If there's anything left to preserve.

362
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,394
Like I said,
we'll run to each other again…

363
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,798
What do you think, Attorney?
Will she be impressed?

364
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,552
She's a shallow woman

365
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,931
if she only looks at the car
and not the character of a man.

366
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:53,701
There's still a sticker
for Roman, Maximo and Mandala Law.

367
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:09,008
Excuse me, miss, one black coffee please.

368
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,218
To give me confidence. Thank you.

369
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,025
Why did you follow me to Santa Blanca?

370
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,985
The nerve!

371
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,718
You, how did you end up here?

372
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,086
I saw this guy getting beaten up.

373
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,171
He was being accused

374
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,175
of stealing food from an eatery.

375
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,596
That's it.

376
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,516
Actually, I wasn't yet
cynical back then, so…

377
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,984
And since that happened,
the guy didn't leave my side.

378
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,823
Tolits, the guy who's always with me.

379
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,658
After that,

380
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,121
I decided to open my own law office here.

381
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,920
Even if you didn't want to show it.

382
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,630
You wanted to be an edgy boy.

383
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,509
Admit it,

384
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,346
the edgy sad boy act was effective.

385
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,769
You were pretty smitten with me
back in the day.

386
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,473
You know, I said…

387
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,488
Don't worry, I'm not hung up
on that anymore, in fact--

388
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,789
Because of your father…

389
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,250
Why?

390
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,420
Because that asshole's father
is your dad's compadre?

391
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,005
And because of your dad…

392
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:57,569
I became a prosecutor because
I wanted to help cleanse society.

393
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,199
Because I want to incarcerate
all the monsters pretending to be human.

394
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,576
Like your father.

395
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,013
I know it's hot,
here are some cold treats.

396
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,684
So cold! Thanks, boss! You're the best!

397
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:32,521
You know I love my employees.
This is how it should be.

398
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,483
But it'll be better
if you buy a new AC unit.

399
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:41,822
Yeah, well, an AC unit is expensive.
Let's have cold treats for now.

400
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,533
So what's your report? Any news?
Fresh leads?

401
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,037
We have two leads.

402
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,126
Buknoy is a crazy homeless man
usually seen in Purok Diamante.

403
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,878
Near Sangria Inn.

404
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,338
I talked to some people there.

405
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:02,509
Nadja was usually seen there
giving Buknoy food, talking with him.

406
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:09,933
All right, maybe Buknoy can shed light on
the relationship between my dad and Nadja.

407
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,019
How about you, Tolits?

408
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,772
It's a positive on the CCTV.

409
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:20,194
It'll show Attorney David and Nadja
entering the room.

410
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:24,239
Problem is someone stole the computer
where the footage was stored.

411
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,039
A former security guard now in hiding.

412
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:35,918
- Boss, she has a long rap sheet.
- She's probably already escaped.

413
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:45,010
We'll have to be resourceful.
For now, we follow the Buknoy lead.

414
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,849
How are you?

415
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,813
Buknoy, can I ask you a question?

416
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,235
Do you know the woman in this picture?

417
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,863
That's Nadja.

418
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,034
Yes, that's Nadja.

419
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:13,872
Someone told us that you're friends,
that she gives you food.

420
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,834
This guy, you know him?

421
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,839
We go watch at Gigi's.

422
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,718
You watch at Gigi's?

423
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,512
Buknoy,

424
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:34,226
do you know what Nadja
and David Roman's relationship is?

425
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,605
You need to go.

426
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:55,080
So, your father and Nadja
do know each other.

427
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,250
But they were never seen
in photos together.

428
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,796
They're hiding the fact
that they know each other.

429
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,549
I don't know.

430
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,156
You son of a…

431
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,074
- Take it easy.
- Sorry, boss.

432
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,203
So…

433
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,919
My debt is paid.

434
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,432
Bunsoy, count this.

435
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,101
Answer!

436
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,228
Yes, boss!

437
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,938
I added a little extra, Baltazar.

438
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,691
I need a favor.

439
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,110
What favor?

440
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:11,406
I need you to find this one.

441
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,327
Seriously?

442
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,257
She was born Nathan Galang.

443
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,357
Artist and bar singer.

444
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:51,405
But she could afford to go to Thailand
for a sex change.

445
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,323
Maybe she has a rich boyfriend.

446
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,123
I'll be right back. Excuse me.

447
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,130
Don't be mad, okay? But…

448
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,340
What if…

449
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,260
your old man is Nadja's sugar daddy?

450
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,512
And they had a falling out.

451
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,932
And there you go, it ended in violence.

452
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,478
Right? Or he didn't know
Nadja was born a man,

453
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,565
and when he found out, he went berserk--

454
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,066
Tolits, you know what?

455
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:32,988
I don't really care
who my father chooses for a partner.

456
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,616
But one thing's clear.
I've never known him as transphobic.

457
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,784
He's got no opinion--

458
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,371
Alex, it's Junilin. She's on the phone!

459
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,669
Is this Junilin?

460
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,754
Yes.

461
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,549
I got your number from the tall guy
who looks like a monster.

462
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,634
<i>Bunsoy.</i>

463
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,096
- He said you were looking for me.
- Yes.

464
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,851
I need something from you.
You took something from the motel.

465
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,687
<i>The computer with the CCTV footage</i>
<i>for Sangria?</i>

466
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:09,065
Is it still with you?
I'll buy it, name your price.

467
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,817
<i>It's still with me, Attorney.</i>

468
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,945
<i>But it's not money I need.</i>

469
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,661
Someone's hunting me.

470
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,372
Someone wants me dead.

471
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,293
The people who were
with the victim in Sangria.

472
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,629
People?

473
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,674
It wasn't just the two of them?

474
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,011
<i>You'll see it in the video.</i>
<i>The hard drive is yours.</i>

475
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,513
<i>Just help me.</i>

476
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,226
Don't bring cops.
We don't know if any of them are involved.

477
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:49,439
I'll cooperate, but I need protection.

478
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,857
Do you understand?

479
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,944
All right, I'll help you. Where are you?

480
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,797
I have a bad feeling about this.

481
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,883
This is the kind of thing I see
on Noyflix Horror.

482
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,971
The heroes enter an alley…

483
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,265
then zombies eat them.

484
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:25,934
Really, Tolits?

485
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:29,980
You're scared of zombies?
Not muggers, kidnappers, junkies, rapists?

486
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,065
You're right.

487
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,402
What if they rape me, boss?

488
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,028
And then kill you two?

489
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,781
Wait.

490
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,492
We need to be careful.

491
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,620
This isn't just a case.

492
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,585
Move, move, move!

493
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,772
Call an ambulance!

494
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,107
Okay.

495
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,763
Uncle.

496
00:54:55,917 --> 00:55:00,171
That's why he cannot understand
why he was in the motel.

497
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,175
He doesn't remember anything
that happened.

498
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,472
He doesn't even remember that…

499
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,142
he really killed the victim.

500
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,200
What is that? Stop! Stop!

501
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,954
It's terrible! It's driving me crazy!

502
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,790
It's obvious that somebody's missing
in the middle!

503
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,500
Where the heck is Olga?

504
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:41,212
Ma'am, that hag messaged me earlier.

505
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,508
She's still at the construction site,
doing overtime.

506
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,886
It'll take her an hour to get here.

507
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,971
Goodness, it's driving me insane!

508
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,223
You'll be the death of me!

509
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,309
Just continue! Continue!

510
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,730
Excuse me, are you Ms. Gigi?

511
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,283
You have the same body size as Olga's.

512
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,661
Her costume will fit you!

513
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,710
Dress up the guy
who looks like a snatcher.

514
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,963
And I want to see you complete right now!

515
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,717
Wait! Wait, boss! What's going on?

516
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,805
We'll make you a star!

517
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:37,060
Ms. Gigi, can I speak to you about Nadja?

518
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,238
The poor child.

519
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,700
I'm sorry, Ms. Gigi,
for bringing bad news.

520
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:57,539
Our sisters need to know
what happened to her.

521
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,042
Maybe after the performance tonight.

522
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:03,336
Or else it'll affect our show.

523
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,465
But wait, Attorney.

524
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,425
Did they catch Nadja's killer?

525
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,348
I have to come clean
about something, Ms. Gigi, I am…

526
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,308
the lawyer…

527
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,229
of the person accused of killing Nadja.

528
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,279
That's really impossible.

529
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,323
Dave loves Nadja very, very much.

530
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,370
He loves her?

531
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,168
The truth is the old man comes here often,

532
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,004
especially if Nadja
has a performance in the club.

533
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,882
Here in your bar?

534
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,049
Yes.

535
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:55,054
That's why it's impossible
for Dave to have hurt Nadja.

536
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,142
Why?

537
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,396
Are you out of your mind?

538
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,899
What are they, then?

539
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,361
Father and daughter.

540
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,314
<i>The truth is the old man comes here often,</i>

541
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:49,317
<i>especially if Nadja</i>
<i>has a performance in the club.</i>

542
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,696
<i>Why are you looking for a connection</i>
<i>between the victim and my law firm?</i>

543
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,366
<i>Dave loves Nadja very, very much.</i>

544
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,034
<i>I don't know her.</i>

545
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,536
<i>What are they, then?</i>

546
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,037
<i>Father and daughter.</i>

547
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,247
Do you want to try it?

548
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,920
Dave says you like music.

549
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,382
Nadja was the same.

550
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,137
Are you sure that…

551
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,888
you won't testify

552
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,766
in Dad and Nadja's case?

553
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,854
Your dad said I don't need to.

554
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,615
Whoever did this…

555
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,955
I could sense Dad's fear of them
whenever we were talking.

556
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:38,301
If it will help,
here's your dad's computer.

557
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,430
You'll have to ask him for the password.

558
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,558
I'm sure he won't give it to me.

559
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:51,481
He doesn't want me
to go deeper into this investigation.

560
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,815
But don't worry.

561
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,818
I swear to you, I will find

562
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,946
whoever killed my sister.

563
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,796
But that's exactly what we wanted, right?

564
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:02,635
Since our college days,
because we wanted prominent cases.

565
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,061
Because we were arrogant!

566
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,081
And so…

567
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:03,946
Nice!

568
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,866
Just look at that damn view!

569
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,119
I just know that
you don't want to come with us.

570
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,413
You want to go somewhere else.

571
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,332
You want a different table.

572
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,834
That's because…

573
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,085
Isn't that right?

574
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,506
Alex, here you are!

575
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,136
David,

576
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,641
you have to be careful, in a few years,

577
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:35,269
a different Attorney Roman
will be in news reports.

578
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:47,698
Didn't I tell you
I don't want to see that instrument?

579
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:49,450
I don't want to see that.

580
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,042
You won't be able to buy good gifts
aside from…

581
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:02,046
All you can buy is this shitty mug!

582
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,105
He really did that?

583
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:43,880
That instinct of his
is the reason why he's a good lawyer.

584
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,966
But what he did was still inexcusable.

585
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,552
<i>Just another lesson learned.</i>

586
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,019
…since college.

587
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,104
Thanks.

588
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,445
You know,

589
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,699
I know that what happened earlier…

590
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,132
I can't believe you.

591
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,475
I humiliated you?

592
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,273
We need to talk about
this family's problems.

593
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:35,866
But you shouldn't take them out on Alex,
your frustrations about my condition.

594
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,443
What do you know of love, Dad?

595
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,614
You can't even show Mom that!

596
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,244
You only know how to love yourself.

597
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:21,954
Your life and your success!

598
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:24,957
What…

599
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,874
Right?

600
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:08,292
A better idea.

601
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:26,060
She's your daughter.

602
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,031
She was born as…

603
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,961
Her mother is Sofia Galang.

604
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:55,673
Your former executive assistant.

605
01:08:55,756 --> 01:08:57,508
You put her through college.

606
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:03,180
And it was you who
gave her the money to go to Thailand…

607
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,797
I'm Nadja's father. I had her with Sofia.

608
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,633
My God!

609
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,060
She was born when…

610
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,902
She was born when my mother was sick.

611
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:07,119
You had guts to do that
while she was undergoing chemo.

612
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,746
You betrayed her.

613
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:17,588
You did all that.

614
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,134
You got your mistress pregnant.

615
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,420
You're not going to change.

616
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:01,257
That's you.

617
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:17,564
I'm exhausted.

618
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:44,758
I'm tired.

619
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,155
And I will find…

620
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,241
whoever killed my sister.

621
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,477
Son, listen to me.

622
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:25,651
I know I was never a good father to you.

623
01:13:27,194 --> 01:13:29,571
I wasn't a good husband to your mother.

624
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:34,118
Even now, I bear that.

625
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,960
I want to fix our relationship.

626
01:16:16,321 --> 01:16:19,408
You're still a lightweight
when it comes to drinking.

627
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,828
I don't know how you do it.

628
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,663
For such a small woman,

629
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,625
your alcohol tolerance is off the charts.

630
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:30,752
You know what?

631
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:35,799
That's the difference between you
rich kids and we who grew up poor.

632
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,176
When you puke,

633
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,096
you go home to Mommy and Daddy.

634
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:43,932
But us, we can never give up.

635
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,608
What I know is
I will never give up on you.

636
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:48,205
He didn't know.

637
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,918
He thought he knew the defendant.

638
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,212
He thought he was a good person.

639
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,393
He victimized another woman.

640
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:22,698
It's not his fault if…

641
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,482
…that I can't forgive.

642
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,824
Things that made him…

643
01:19:42,903 --> 01:19:44,446
I wish you never have kids

644
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:47,032
so there'll be less stupid people
like you.

645
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:51,244
I wish your dad just wiped you on a wall
so you don't spread stupidity.

646
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:53,163
You look like a wall.

647
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:55,123
At least my dad loves me.

648
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,709
You're never been loved
because you're a plague.

649
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,961
- Hi, boss.
- I bought some snacks.

650
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:03,590
You lost.

651
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:05,759
No, I didn't.

652
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,053
Thanks, boss!

653
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,138
Okay.

654
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:19,397
We know that my father didn't kill Nadja.

655
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:21,817
He was framed.

656
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,529
Who killed her

657
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:29,741
and who framed my father?

658
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:34,704
It's whoever killed Junilin,
who stole the hard drive with the video

659
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:38,041
of whoever took Attorney David
and Nadja to Sangria Inn.

660
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,710
Actually, here.

661
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,213
I just got…

662
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:45,674
my father's laptop.

663
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:52,889
Problem is I can't open it
because of the password.

664
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:54,099
I'm going out.

665
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,810
Looks like we're going
to be here all day--

666
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:58,103
I'm in, boss.

667
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,692
- But how--
- Boss, have you forgotten?

668
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:07,195
That was my first job.
Hacking laptops and cell phones.

669
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:14,077
Dude, are we sure we're going to find
sensitive files there?

670
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,872
Why would your father
even hide files there?

671
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,749
He knows that laptop can be subpoenaed.

672
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:23,336
Boss, it looks like Gabbie is right.

673
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,297
This is clean, just documents.

674
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:30,510
And if we find anything there,
we can't use it as evidence, right?

675
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:35,557
This. What's this?

676
01:21:36,349 --> 01:21:38,435
Boss, it needs another password.

677
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:41,563
We can't hack that, it'll get deleted.

678
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:43,940
You only get three tries.

679
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,361
Try "Nadja."

680
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,043
Boss, what if…

681
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,961
we use your name first?

682
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:07,339
You.

683
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:10,008
All right.

684
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,427
Then "Elizabeth."

685
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:16,431
Nope.

686
01:22:17,641 --> 01:22:19,351
All right, try "Elizabeth."

687
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,105
Wait! Wait a bit.

688
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:41,122
What's this?

689
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,793
Receipts…

690
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:48,171
of Roman, Maximo and Mandala Law firm.

691
01:22:48,254 --> 01:22:51,633
They have politicians,
generals, businessmen.

692
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:04,020
Boss, it was Attorney Nick
who framed your father.

693
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:16,032
This rabbit hole is deep.

694
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:28,211
What do you want?

695
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,630
Stay right there.

696
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,354
Gabbie, we can't stay here! Let's go!

697
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:30,732
Hey! What are you doing? Let's go!

698
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:35,361
All right, this is what we'll do.

699
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:39,991
We can pass through Emerald Street.

700
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:43,745
Behind the church. After that,
there's a police station, we can…

701
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,873
What is it?

702
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:03,431
Gabbie, what's this?

703
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,434
I'm sorry, man.

704
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,169
You're a spy.

705
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:36,381
She is.

706
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,469
Why are you recording?

707
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,888
What we're doing here is confidential.

708
01:25:44,722 --> 01:25:46,474
So someone signed in for him?

709
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:48,893
We need to look at the CCTV footage.

710
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,521
All right, I'll go to the motel.

711
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:56,526
And if we find anything there,
we can't use it as evidence, right?

712
01:25:56,609 --> 01:26:01,364
Boss, it was Attorney Nick
who framed your father.

713
01:26:03,074 --> 01:26:04,909
He ordered your sister's death.

714
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:22,385
She was my eyes.

715
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:27,599
So you won't come to
this exact conclusion,

716
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:29,267
but you're stubborn.

717
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,560
I'm sorry.

718
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:36,316
I tried my best to keep you from--

719
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,533
I gave you everything, boy.

720
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:50,914
The dementia,
so your father could be acquitted.

721
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,918
Nadja and David's real relationship,

722
01:26:56,169 --> 01:27:02,592
to show that a father
cannot do that to his own daughter.

723
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:09,182
But the places you shouldn't ever go to,

724
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:13,394
that's exactly where you went.

725
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:18,274
Are you going to kill us,
just like you killed my sister?

726
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:21,611
If that was my intention,
I would have done that long ago.

727
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:23,821
Always with the killing.

728
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,991
Killing! My clients are so brutal!

729
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:32,372
This shouldn't have happened.

730
01:27:47,136 --> 01:27:48,596
No one should have died.

731
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,435
This shouldn't have happened.

732
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:12,036
I treated you and Nadja

733
01:28:14,038 --> 01:28:15,915
like my own children.

734
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,001
And David

735
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:22,380
as a real friend.

736
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,257
I love all of you.

737
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:28,720
I wanted to wake your father up
to reality.

738
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,596
That when he retires,

739
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,057
you'll take his place

740
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,393
as my partner.

741
01:28:38,187 --> 01:28:42,900
Or you can pursue your musical career,

742
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,111
like Nadja.

743
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:50,867
Everything was in place.

744
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,786
It was everything you wished for.

745
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,415
But all these plans…

746
01:28:59,834 --> 01:29:01,836
were destroyed by your father.

747
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,510
It's not too late.

748
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,429
The pieces are still in place.

749
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:15,641
You don't have to do anything, Alex,
just follow the script.

750
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:20,480
David will be freed.
Things will go back to how they were.

751
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,900
Things are not going back, Nadja is dead.

752
01:29:23,983 --> 01:29:26,944
I am not responsible for Nadja's death!

753
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,413
You want justice?

754
01:29:57,183 --> 01:30:00,353
You will face the court.

755
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,856
You will save your father.

756
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:05,817
You will use his dementia.

757
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:12,573
And we will all find peace.

758
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,502
I forgot something.

759
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,259
If you

760
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:17,346
continue investigating the organization…

761
01:32:10,983 --> 01:32:12,693
<i>My name is Gabriela Boro.</i>

762
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:17,281
<i>Before anything else,</i>
<i>I'd like to apologize to Alex and Tolits.</i>

763
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,784
<i>They're great to work with.</i>

764
01:32:19,867 --> 01:32:21,661
<i>They became my friends.</i>

765
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:24,121
<i>Even if Tolits is a jerk.</i>

766
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:27,750
<i>That's why it's hard for me</i>
<i>to betray them.</i>

767
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:30,795
<i>This is my testimony.</i>

768
01:32:31,545 --> 01:32:35,049
<i>On this drive, you'll see a video</i>
<i>we were ordered to delete.</i>

769
01:34:37,963 --> 01:34:41,133
<i>You will face the court.</i>

770
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,470
<i>You will save your father.</i>

771
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,476
<i>And we will all find peace.</i>

772
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:47,408
What a nice office!

773
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:50,786
Which one is heavier here?

774
01:35:51,954 --> 01:35:54,457
Boss, is this gold?

775
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,515
You're the boss.

776
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,642
Right?

777
01:36:22,318 --> 01:36:24,778
What if you can only run a nursing home?

778
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:26,322
You jerk!

779
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:38,292
But I'm not going to wait around
playing golf.

780
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:48,427
The only thing is I noticed something.

781
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:52,556
Son, I noticed something about you.

782
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,310
It seems like…

783
01:36:56,393 --> 01:36:58,729
you abandoned your music.

784
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:04,235
I know you have a new passion, which is

785
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:08,113
you being a lawyer,
and you're really serious about it, but…

786
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:23,587
Because, if you didn't know,

787
01:37:24,713 --> 01:37:27,508
I have a weekly gig at Randy's bar.

788
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,654
Uncle David, can I speak first?

789
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,972
You don't have to apologize.

790
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:23,606
I may not have felt what you went through
because of what happened to your sister…

791
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:47,838
So…

792
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:50,090
I'm a lawyer.

793
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:51,425
But being…

794
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:12,237
May I speak to Alex, Uncle David?

795
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,368
All right, we're going over there.

796
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:20,788
- Let's go.
- No, I'm good.

797
01:39:20,871 --> 01:39:21,830
There's bread.

798
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:24,208
No, it's better over there.

799
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:29,254
Yeah! All right Attorney Daddy, okay.

800
01:39:30,881 --> 01:39:32,424
Congratulations again.

801
01:39:35,219 --> 01:39:37,054
You off to the next case?

802
01:39:41,141 --> 01:39:42,976
Dad and I were talking

803
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:46,647
about putting up a new law firm, and…

804
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:52,319
Me?

805
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:04,415
We need someone as brave
and as fierce as you in the courtroom.

806
01:40:12,631 --> 01:40:14,925
Attorney Maximo is being investigated.

807
01:40:21,765 --> 01:40:23,767
His connections are too powerful.

808
01:40:32,067 --> 01:40:33,360
For now, yes.

809
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:35,320
They're quiet.

810
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:39,074
But it'll only be a matter of time

811
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,952
before they strike back at us.

812
01:40:43,245 --> 01:40:44,413
That's why…

813
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:47,875
we have to be ready for that.

814
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:55,966
Your enemy's strength is formidable.

815
01:41:00,095 --> 01:41:01,972
Isn't this what you want?
