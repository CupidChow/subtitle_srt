1
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,592
Who are you?

2
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,346
Are you

3
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:55,848
Bella Jin?

4
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,487
Bella Jin?

5
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:12,281
Wait, but I thought you were in Barcelona.

6
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,701
I got a call
that someone was looking for me.

7
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:16,827
You must be the ace.

8
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,079
Me? Yes.

9
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,789
Anyway, I'm Bella Jin.

10
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,417
I'm Seo Ji-woo, Director of JARIM Apparel.

11
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,086
Let me first pay for the scarf…

12
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,464
I'm afraid you can't.

13
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,300
Ji-woo.

14
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:38,015
The ace here grabbed that scarf first.

15
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,728
I did grab it first, but sure, go ahead.

16
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,396
It's only right for us to buy it.

17
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:51,027
Hey, this one. Isn't this pretty? No?

18
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,491
You have the Delta two-piece?

19
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,327
Yes.

20
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:00,871
My mom does.

21
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:16,887
Oh, hey.

22
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,097
Okay. Here.

23
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,985
Gracias.

24
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,447
EPISODE 9

25
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,826
I get the situation.

26
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,121
Actually, when I got the call
that you wanted to see me…

27
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:45,040
The call was
from Trend D's editor-in-chief.

28
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,961
I looked up JARIM Apparel.

29
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,631
And Daniel knows you, Ms. Seo Ji-woo.

30
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,758
I asked him just in case. You know Daniel?

31
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,345
Yes. My friend in England.
He runs a select shop.

32
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,643
Daniel said I should meet you.

33
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,938
I appreciate that you came
all the way here.

34
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:13,027
I think I already know what this is about.
But I have nothing to discuss with you.

35
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,614
But since we've had coffee,
is that enough for the greeting?

36
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,783
You're right. We've come a long way.

37
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:27,625
Will you spare your time for Director Seo
to explain? We'd appreciate it.

38
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,004
Is the scarf for your mom?

39
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,260
You're not on good terms
with your mom, are you?

40
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,054
Can you tell?

41
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,222
It'll be a good gift.

42
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,101
Málaga is nice. You might as well
check it out while you're here.

43
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,437
It was actually nice meeting you.

44
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,815
I'll root for JARIM Apparel. Bye now.

45
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,486
But, Bella. I…

46
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,826
Hey, let's follow her.

47
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,786
Wait.

48
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,205
We need a strategy.

49
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,801
You said we needed a strategy.

50
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,055
Waiting is also a strategy.

51
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:41,573
Let's get up there and ring the doorbell.
We can't just wait here forever.

52
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,952
Isn't she having dinner?
She'd come down soon.

53
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,545
Hey!

54
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,344
Have you been waiting here?

55
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,058
It's a nice alley. I like watching alleys.

56
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:14,440
We've been waiting for a very long time.
My legs are swollen, and I'm hungry.

57
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:21,905
Do you like wine?

58
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,334
What about you? You don't drink?

59
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:41,675
I'm… taking oriental medicine.

60
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,054
I should refrain from alcohol,
flour, or anything spicy…

61
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,100
Ji-woo, is he your ace?

62
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,311
Sorry?

63
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,815
I've read your article. You two met
while doing theater together or something?

64
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,192
Anyway,

65
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,905
you two met when you were 20,
and it didn't end.

66
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,116
The ace wrote about your ex-husband?

67
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,540
I didn't publish it myself,
but technically, it was me. Yes.

68
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,419
You two are not in love.
There's a word for it.

69
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,255
"Baseless." Is it really baseless?

70
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,674
Yes, that's correct. Baseless.

71
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,260
What about now?

72
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,805
Now we're together.

73
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,315
Well… to continue on with my explanation…

74
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:44,071
You met when you were 20,
and you're still in love?

75
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,824
Have you ever liked any other woman?

76
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:48,909
Am I too indiscreet?

77
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,661
Well…

78
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,665
I am kind of flustered. Yes.

79
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,167
I need the answer.

80
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,510
I have.

81
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,724
The 28-year-old Seo Ji-woo.

82
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,772
You're a selfish guy.

83
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:19,690
What?

84
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,776
He is?

85
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,487
You grew old, from 20 to 28,

86
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,490
all the while loving her,
and not taking your eyes off her.

87
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:32,536
And even now,
you came all the way here for Seo Ji-woo,

88
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,330
but how come you don't respect my love?

89
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,301
Yes.

90
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:54,850
I get that Pirco to you
is what Seo Ji-woo is to Lee Kyeong-do.

91
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,478
Thanks.

92
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,150
All right.
This is where our conversation begins.

93
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,929
Who's going to be Lucas's successor?

94
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,514
Judy Wong or me?

95
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,684
Judy Wong.

96
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,480
On what grounds?

97
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:47,486
After Pirco's oldest son took over,
trouble brewed between him and Lucas.

98
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,656
They were going in different directions.

99
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,034
He is likely to choose Judy Wong

100
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,370
rather than Lucas' protégé, Bella Jin.

101
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:01,291
It's not that he's likely to choose her,
but it's already been decided.

102
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,964
Why did I go to Barcelona?
I went to see it for myself.

103
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,800
Pirco's owner was coming to Barcelona,

104
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,719
and I heard the rumor
that Judy Wong was accompanying him.

105
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,515
If they went there together,
hundred percent.

106
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,559
Then you're...

107
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,145
not coming to JARIM, are you?

108
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,401
No, I'm not leaving Pirco.
You should put it that way.

109
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:32,281
Even if I get to work under Judy Wong,
I have to accept it.

110
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,784
It was decided in my dad's laundromat
when I was 15.

111
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,997
I can still draw that dress from Pirco
even with my eyes closed.

112
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,833
It is what it is.

113
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,127
There's no other way.

114
00:09:55,637 --> 00:10:00,142
Let me say goodbye before I get drunk.
Thank you for coming all the way here.

115
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,813
Thanks to you two, I'm less angry.

116
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,364
It was a good idea
to exercise regularly, right?

117
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,992
I mean, you jog a lot, don't you?

118
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:18,702
Gosh…

119
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,747
I'll tell everything to Mommy.

120
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,210
Hang in there a little more.

121
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,844
Just a little more, Kyeong-do.

122
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,180
CAUTION
ELEVATOR OUT OF ORDER

123
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,851
Oh, no. Are you crying? Are those tears?

124
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:43,769
Is this funny?

125
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:44,728
No.

126
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,689
You can carry her too.
You can carry her up to the 2nd floor.

127
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,941
Oh, stop talking. Hurry up.

128
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,153
This is so narrow.

129
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,282
Gosh, are you okay?

130
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,244
Gosh. Shit.

131
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,121
Damn it.

132
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:08,627
Shit. Shit.

133
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,756
Good job.

134
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,175
We did well.

135
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:21,098
We were polite.
With respect and honor, we let her go.

136
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:22,891
That was cool.

137
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,941
But we came all the way here.
You used so many of your vacation days.

138
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,570
That was your first step as a director.
So it's a bummer.

139
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,449
I tried to take it for granted.

140
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,411
I'm going to take it slowly from scratch.

141
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:47,082
I'll find good designers so we can be
on the Paris and New York runways.

142
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,003
Just thinking about it
makes my stomach ticklish.

143
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,886
Why does your stomach get ticklish
when you have happy thoughts?

144
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,348
-You remember that?
-Hey, what was that for?

145
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,853
You still have strength left?
You definitely could have carried her.

146
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,105
Seo Ji-woo, don't move.

147
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,149
Don't be like this. I'm hungry.

148
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,275
-Engage your spine.
-No…

149
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,568
-Be ready.
-But…

150
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,944
-All right.
-No, I…

151
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,699
Walk to the runway like this. Okay?

152
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,452
Hey, come down. You'll break my backbone.

153
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,557
CEO Seo.

154
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,936
She's keeping it a secret and fighting it.
But the truth is, she's getting worse.

155
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:57,235
How could I not know when I'm watching her
so closely? It's kind of pitiful.

156
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,073
Don't mind Seo Ji-woo's word
on getting rid of MANZAAR.

157
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:07,746
You've seen it too.
Getting rid of MANZAAR,

158
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,957
that's her first mission? My goodness.

159
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,626
Isn't that brilliant and bold?

160
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,379
Executive Director Choi.

161
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:21,468
When Seo Ji-woo returns from Spain,
she'll soon look ridiculous.

162
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:24,429
How is she going to scout
a luxury brand designer?

163
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,806
She probably went because she had a plan.

164
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,058
Do you trust her?

165
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,017
Not yet.

166
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,935
That's what I mean.

167
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,479
Still, I'm looking forward to it.

168
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:37,609
She might not sell the company
for a dirt cheap price.

169
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:42,697
I'm getting the thought
that Seo Ji-woo could be the dark horse.

170
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,116
Executive Director Choi.

171
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,117
Can't you feel it?

172
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,037
The atmosphere is brightening up.

173
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,081
Young employees are supporting Seo Ji-woo.

174
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,250
Director Seo Ji-woo said

175
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,795
she'd bring a luxury brand designer
who lives up to their name.

176
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,007
You think she brightened up the mood
without any plans?

177
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,385
Seriously?

178
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,807
Right now, I'm even thinking

179
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,185
that JARIM's second prime is coming.

180
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,396
What if she fails

181
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,356
to bring a designer?

182
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,234
Then Seo Ji-woo

183
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,988
will turn out to be digging her own grave.

184
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,793
Here.

185
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,465
Do you want milk?

186
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,224
Kyeong-do.

187
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,061
Yes?

188
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:59,149
Move your damn head.
You're blocking the tiny sea view we have.

189
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,322
-Happy now?
-Yes. Nice.

190
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,406
Yes. Good job.

191
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,205
I wonder if Bella Jin is okay.
We should say goodbye before we go.

192
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,415
Should I call her?

193
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,338
JOIN ME TO RELIEVE YOUR HANGOVER?

194
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,341
She wants to relieve a hangover together.

195
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,318
Lucas's number.

196
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,696
I was wasted last night.

197
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,826
I was struck by the Delta two-piece
and by the Seo Ji-woo and Pirco metaphor.

198
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,954
I got so excited that I talked to Lucas
on the phone for an hour.

199
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,751
He hasn't decided where to go.

200
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,962
I recommended you
under the influence of wine.

201
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
Thank you for carrying me
to the 5th floor.

202
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,931
He said it's interesting

203
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,558
that you spotted the Delta scarf
at a street stall in Málaga.

204
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,019
By interesting, he means…

205
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:22,065
When Lucas likes a result,
he calls it interesting.

206
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,817
Call him.

207
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,944
He wouldn't give you an immediate answer,

208
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,613
but give him time.

209
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,700
Interesting…

210
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:49,134
You know, every country
has different alleys. I like it here too.

211
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,803
What's your favorite?

212
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,515
The alley next to Somang Laundromat?

213
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,602
Oh, right. Let's buy snacks.

214
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,770
Why? Are you hungry?

215
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,022
No, not that.

216
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,651
Something you'd find
in the department store.

217
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,944
Pretty and delicious.

218
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,780
Department store…

219
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,991
Pretty and delicious?

220
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,286
Not from a real one,
but if we could find something like that.

221
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,708
Then… a dessert?

222
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,172
LETTER OF INTENT TO SUE

223
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:33,470
JARIM DIRECTOR KANG MIN-WOO

224
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,139
Hey, CEO Bae.

225
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,268
You scared me. Is this really necessary?

226
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,396
If this doesn't get resolved,
I'm going to talk to CEO Seo Ji-yeon.

227
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,731
No!

228
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,320
We're almost there.
If you do this, we'll both--

229
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,946
I heard Seo Ji-woo went to Spain.

230
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,950
She's working hard.
If it's like this, I can't vouch for you.

231
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,495
Sorry. I'm still in a meeting.

232
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,677
ACCUSED
KANG MIN-WOO

233
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,124
What are you going to do about this?

234
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,753
Hello.

235
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,256
Oh, hello. One second, okay?

236
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,799
-Hey, look.
-Yes.

237
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,719
I asked to remove the stain, not smear it.
How am I supposed to wear this?

238
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:01,724
That's why I explained it to you
in the first place.

239
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,436
It's not easy to remove the red oil stain.

240
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,481
I also explained to you
that a dark fabric could be bleached.

241
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:11,359
"Could" means there was a way
to prevent it, no?

242
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,697
Because you kept the stain for too long,
it wasn't easy to remove.

243
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,324
Then you should've said
you couldn't do it.

244
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,285
This is my favorite dress.

245
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,619
Damn it.

246
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,913
You must've really liked it.

247
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,999
Who are you to barge in?

248
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,542
Sorry.

249
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,713
What do you want me to do?

250
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,464
Why are you asking me?

251
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:37,302
That's what I need to know.
Are you going to get me the same dress?

252
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,846
You won't be able to find the same one.

253
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,515
That's too old,
so you can't even find it in the outlets.

254
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,475
Hey, who are you to keep barging in?

255
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,104
Well, it's just an unfortunate situation…

256
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,399
Then mind your own business and walk away.

257
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,902
Wait, this is from JARIM Apparel.
Isn't it?

258
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,070
You got nothing else to do?
You think this is funny?

259
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,655
I do have other things to do.

260
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,744
And so do they. It seems you're the one
with nothing else to do.

261
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,873
I'll call the police.
Are you out of your mind?

262
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,084
Take this and get whatever dress you want
from our store.

263
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,130
JARIM
SEO JI-WOO

264
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,216
Which store is the closest?
I'll let them know.

265
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:21,179
The closest store… I'll have to look.

266
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,057
Can I really take whatever I want?

267
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,391
Yes.

268
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,895
Even the Lusae store in Cheongdam-dong?

269
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,897
Yes, I'll call them.

270
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,901
Wait, you need to pay before you go.

271
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,027
What?

272
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,112
For removing the stain and dry cleaning.

273
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:40,990
Wait.

274
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:46,037
Don't forget to take this.
Your favorite dress.

275
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,215
Well…

276
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,886
Here. I didn't buy it
in a department store basement floor,

277
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,846
but from a good place near my work.

278
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,686
The lady Kyeong-do's seeing.

279
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,272
Hello.

280
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,108
It's too cramped in here--

281
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,485
No. I was going to leave
after giving you this.

282
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,070
Are you busy?

283
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:20,697
No.

284
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,128
I wanted to get something from Málaga,
but I didn't find anything good.

285
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,964
Is that in Spain?

286
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:38,965
Yes.

287
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,926
Kyeong-do was very helpful.

288
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,344
Did things go well?

289
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:49,183
That is… kind of iffy.
I haven't received the answer yet.

290
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,685
Did Kyeong-do go to Spain?

291
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,729
I told you the other day.

292
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,984
-You must be anxious.
-I can't even sleep.

293
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,777
It must be very important.

294
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,365
Yes. This is my first project
since I joined the company.

295
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,908
I'm worried about it.

296
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,079
Gosh, even running a laundromat this size
is not easy.

297
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,749
A company that big must be even harder.

298
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,666
Oh, no...

299
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,378
I'm sorry. Excuse me…

300
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,548
Who keeps calling…

301
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,681
Lucas. Mother. Wait. Excuse me. Sorry.

302
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,060
Lucas?

303
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,937
Do you think he fell for that?

304
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,279
Did she leave?

305
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,032
But her bag is here.

306
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,127
Please excuse me…

307
00:22:58,836 --> 00:22:59,670
Oh, my!

308
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,135
Excuse me, Father.

309
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,179
Yes… Yes, sure.

310
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,060
Lucas is coming. He's coming to JARIM!

311
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,895
-Lucas?
-It's a good thing, right?

312
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,064
This is totally awesome.

313
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:22,151
Being together with you two
brings me good luck. This is amazing!

314
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:27,740
Oh, my God. Let me call Kyeong-do.

315
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,749
Hey, Kyeong-do. This is crazy.
Don't be surprised.

316
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,460
Lucas is coming!

317
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,256
-Ouch…
-Oh, no.

318
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,049
I was so surprised.

319
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,805
I was more surprised
that you went to the laundromat.

320
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,891
That place has good energy.
I think that place is a lucky location.

321
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:56,102
Did you let the CEO know?

322
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,229
My sister is excited.

323
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,023
She's busy setting her schedule
to meet Lucas.

324
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:06,320
Our laundromat
is indeed a lucky location, but--

325
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,407
Things are turning out well
because I met you, Kyeong-do.

326
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,826
That's right. Here.

327
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:23,129
Speaking of which,
I need a painting of you as well.

328
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,340
No, just take that with you.

329
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,467
No, that should be here.

330
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,846
Since you have good energy,
I should have your portrait in my house.

331
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,308
Maybe about the size of…

332
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,102
a photograph?

333
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,814
-Why is mine small?
-It doesn't match my house design.

334
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,400
A small one next to my bed would be great.

335
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,652
Hey, my house also has a design.

336
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:49,488
You're on a lease.
But I live in my own house.

337
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:51,532
That's not logical.

338
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,160
Why are you nitpicking?
It is if I say it is.

339
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,079
Just finish your drink.

340
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,837
Is this what people call
an after-work drink?

341
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:06,881
-You kind of get fake drunk, right?
-No.

342
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,218
Imagine you do.

343
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,969
-Yes, I do.
-Right?

344
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,095
-Yes.
-Okay.

345
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,263
Gosh…

346
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,728
One more!

347
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,387
Sorry for calling you out so early.

348
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,765
Better than getting stopped out of nowhere
in front of my house.

349
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,726
It's nice and quiet.

350
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,442
Mr. Bae Jun-soo?

351
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,828
Min-woo got worked up and called me
when he got the notice.

352
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:24,500
You probably won't get
that 30 billion won back.

353
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,629
Director Seo Ji-woo is doing pretty well.

354
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:33,050
She scouted the lead designer of Pirco,
the company is hyped up.

355
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:37,013
We won't be selling the company.

356
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,100
Thanks to you, I could secure my credit.

357
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,186
If I had counted on Min-woo
and kept going…

358
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,940
I asked you to see me today

359
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:53,654
because I wanted to ask you
if you could invest the budget in us.

360
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,325
I'm going to meet Designer Lucas.

361
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,829
The key deal points are already agreed on.
I'll meet him to sign the contract.

362
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:06,125
Once Lucas arrives,
JARIM will change completely.

363
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,252
I'm sure you know it better than I do.

364
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:21,098
NAMU ART ACADEMY

365
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,975
Jeong-min, you're awesome.

366
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,062
Go wild, okay?
It's not a good look to babysit it.

367
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,231
As if this is nothing,
just ride it nonchalantly, okay?

368
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,901
You should've got a used one.
What if I scratch it?

369
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,612
I wouldn't let Actor Cha ride a used one.

370
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,865
Hey, if I get the delivery guy role,
I'd be the best.

371
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,577
You dream so small.

372
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,579
Ride with a pretty girl, not food--

373
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,123
-I can't ride with him every day.
-Honey.

374
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:49,543
Whatever. Forget it. I'm getting dizzy.
Try it. Ride it.

375
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,381
Wait. It's Hyeon-u. It's my boss.

376
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,716
CEO Im. Hello. How are you?

377
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,179
What? Really? Is he hurt badly?

378
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,849
That's a relief. Yes.

379
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,354
Yeah. I understudied it for quite long.

380
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,441
I can still recite it
at the drop of a hat.

381
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,236
Yes. Okay. Yup.

382
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,906
Yes. Goodbye. Yes, sir. Bye.

383
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,290
Why? Is someone hurt?

384
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,418
Waiting for Godot.

385
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,629
It's near the end of the run,
but the lead role is hurt.

386
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,006
Oh, no. Is it serious?

387
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,550
No, not that serious.

388
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,052
But you know,

389
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,847
I understudied the play twice.

390
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,849
-Yes.
-What's understudying?

391
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,768
You know, the replacement
when the actor can't make it.

392
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:51,105
Since you never know what might happen,
you memorize everything.

393
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:52,731
-Right, Woo-sik?
-Yes.

394
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,608
So…

395
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:59,697
He's telling me to take over
for the rest of the show.

396
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,584
Hey, you!

397
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,836
He told me to come now.
I'm in a hurry. Manager.

398
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,381
Okay. Where to? Where is it?
But I don't have a motorcycle license.

399
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,340
You idiot. Get off.

400
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,508
I do. I have a license.

401
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,761
Honey. You need to calm down.
Relax. Calm down!

402
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:27,057
Get ready for the class. I…
Let me go get ready for the play.

403
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,435
-For the play.
-Woo-sik, you're so hot.

404
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,353
-Go. Go now.
-Okay, I'll go now.

405
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:35,608
-Be careful. You've got this. Drive safe!
-Yes. Bye. I did it!

406
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:42,156
Is he riding that to work?

407
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,492
Does he even know how to get there?

408
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,666
Chinese food for lunch is too heavy. Jeez.

409
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,422
What did the food do wrong?
Perhaps it's your heart that's heavy?

410
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:01,884
I have no appetite.
I don't want to exercise either. Shit.

411
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:11,393
Well… Min-woo. You know, about last time,

412
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:15,147
what I said when I was drunk.
You know you must keep it a secret, right?

413
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,150
Hey, is that true though?

414
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:22,112
I can't tell if you got too drunk
and talked nonsense.

415
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:23,447
That makes no sense.

416
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:26,367
My father was Chairman Seo's best friend.

417
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,412
The old folks who run companies
tend to take each other's side.

418
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,122
Only my father knows about this.

419
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:36,335
One time, Chairman Seo got drunk
and cried his eyes out because of it.

420
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,923
But it's strange. Why did your family
accept someone like that?

421
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,842
Maybe because I have a lot of flaws,
damn it.

422
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,055
I used to do drugs and beat people.
I caused a lot of trouble.

423
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,599
Still, why would your father do that?

424
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:55,271
But Chairman Seo did adore her
like she was his own. I know that.

425
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,899
Min-woo, promise me
you must not tell anyone, okay?

426
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,776
Ji-yeon probably knows.

427
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:04,321
When I hint you the timing,
talk to her for me, will you?

428
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:09,577
I'm not interested in JARIM at all, okay?

429
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,037
It seems
Seo Ji-woo scored something in Spain.

430
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:15,040
Once this gets out,
how could she run the company?

431
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,208
She's not a real daughter.

432
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,047
So what are you going to do about it?

433
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,009
It's over. You might as well move on.

434
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,386
I need her back, you know?

435
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,849
If she grows old with that lowlife,
her life will become a real mess.

436
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,018
I'll get her back.

437
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,610
This mapo tofu is good.

438
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:05,132
GENETIC TESTS FOR TWO SISTERS
WHO SHARE THE SAME MOTHER

439
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,804
How am I supposed to test the DNA
with a dead man?

440
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,599
I can't open the coffin.

441
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,686
Damn it.

442
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,125
What's the point of having my portrait?
This is the best.

443
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,171
This…

444
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:51,470
Still, give it a try. You might find it.

445
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,388
Okay.

446
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,849
There's nothing… What's in here… Wait.

447
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,756
Whenever my sister was seeing someone,
she used to make paper cranes.

448
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,759
Every time she got a new boyfriend,
she made a thousand of them.

449
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,514
Would she still make them? She's 60 now.

450
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:41,895
Hey, are you going to put them in a jar
and give it to someone?

451
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,773
Do women still like it these days?

452
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:47,818
I've only given a jar
filled with rolled bills.

453
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,904
Origami is so old.

454
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:54,158
Mind your own businesses.
Why are you wasting paper?

455
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,661
You know, I've been only writing articles
about economy.

456
00:33:57,745 --> 00:34:00,414
And now that I see something
so uneconomical and unproductive,

457
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,083
I'm getting a dopamine rush.
Didn't I do a good job?

458
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,586
That's pretty good.

459
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:06,879
Your sister taught you?

460
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,088
The flowers.

461
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,672
You were making these?

462
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,092
Be romantic and make the flowers.

463
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,303
Are you on an expedition to my team?

464
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,599
I wonder if our manager is back.

465
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,558
The chair…

466
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:21,976
What are you doing?

467
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,980
I've started a new hobby
using the lunch hour.

468
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:30,860
And you?

469
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,781
I'm trying it out
because it's interesting.

470
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,241
Okay.

471
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,786
I don't even have the energy
to make a fuss.

472
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,663
You're groundbreaking in so many ways,
Lee Kyeong-do.

473
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:44,958
The lunch hour is up.

474
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,460
-Let's get back to work.
-Yes.

475
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,130
Just out of curiosity,

476
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,759
-Are you going to put them in a nice jar?
-Yes.

477
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,136
Not just these little pieces of paper,
are you?

478
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,722
They're origami roses,
not pieces of paper.

479
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,768
Making them one by one
with heart and sincerity.

480
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,896
Hey, she can't even throw it out later.
It's useless.

481
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:08,106
Are you going to add something shiny too?

482
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,652
-Like what?
-What do you think, Doo-jin?

483
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,862
-A rose gold necklace?
-Bingo.

484
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:15,989
A diamond ring of a modest size?

485
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,074
Good.

486
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:20,369
Luxury brand earrings, bracelets,
et cetera.

487
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,037
-Thank you.
-Shallow.

488
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,622
-What…
-Excuse me?

489
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:30,379
I'd welcome these origami roses
made with such care for me.

490
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:34,424
Is that so? Then make them with him
in the meeting room every day at lunch.

491
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:37,636
I don't like to make them myself.
Here, Assistant Manager.

492
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,595
Yes.

493
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,973
Thank you.

494
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,809
Hey, lunch time's up,
let's get back to work.

495
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:47,271
Work now.

496
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,273
Hobbies are for lunchtime.

497
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:00,701
Not just these little pieces of paper,
are you?

498
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,995
Jeez. Damn it.

499
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,981
Is this a lucky draw or what?

500
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:38,447
Making them one by one
with heart and sincerity.

501
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,491
Hey, she can't even throw it out later.
It's useless.

502
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,412
Are you going to add something shiny too?

503
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:55,005
Forget it. Gosh. Jeez.

504
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,382
Jeez.

505
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,552
WAITING FOR GODOT
CHA WOO-SIK

506
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:02,262
Dong-won. Go stand there.

507
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,603
Hey, Woo-sik gets to perform
by chance, right?

508
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:14,775
What do you mean "by chance"? A prepared
actor is getting his moment to shine.

509
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:16,652
The original actor got hurt--

510
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,278
You need to talk less.

511
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:20,238
Dong-won, isn't your dad cool?

512
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,448
Yes, he's cool.

513
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,534
-All right. Let's go.
-He's handsome.

514
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,788
Didn't you play the Boy in this play?

515
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,122
You didn't even come to watch.

516
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,417
"Godot is not coming.
Ji-woo is not coming."

517
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:42,010
How many times did you watch this play?
Only when you wrote that article?

518
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,059
Sometimes at the national theater
whenever it came to my mind.

519
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,022
This stop is the national theater.

520
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:57,150
WAITING FOR GODOT

521
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,611
The next stop
is Songjeong Integrated Center.

522
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,283
NATIONAL THEATER

523
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:12,582
WAITING FOR GODOT

524
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,300
Sorry.

525
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:30,183
WAITING FOR GODOT
HAEUM THEATER

526
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:37,691
Hurry up.

527
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:46,283
WAITING FOR GODOT
HAEUM NATIONAL THEATER

528
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:53,915
WAITING FOR GODOT

529
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,511
JANGCHUNG SNACK BAR

530
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,522
JANGCHUNG SNACK BAR

531
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,280
WAITING FOR GODOT

532
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,587
WAITING FOR GODOT
FINAL PERFORMANCE

533
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,214
Waiting for Godot?

534
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:46,885
Yes, it's been performed every year,
but this year will be the last one.

535
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,013
Why should we write about this?

536
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:55,310
They were in deficit due to low turnout,
yet the play ran for ten years.

537
00:39:56,061 --> 00:40:00,690
But now, they can't keep going anymore,
so it'll be their last show.

538
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:06,446
It's meaningful. A theater that put on
a good play despite no profit.

539
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,281
I thought it'd be a good article.

540
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:09,991
Kyeong-do will write

541
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,745
about Godot?

542
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,625
What does that smile mean?

543
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:25,132
I remembered someone else
also saying Godot sounded like Kyeong-do.

544
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,969
-It's personal, isn't it?
-No.

545
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,056
It is.

546
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,644
Sure, go with it.

547
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,105
It better be good.

548
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,107
Yup. I'll do my best.

549
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,651
Thank you.

550
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:48,363
You've been showing it
despite the long deficit.

551
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:51,032
What kept you going?

552
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:54,578
It's not that I endured it
because I had any specific reason.

553
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,414
"Just for this year. Just one more year."

554
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,541
Then it's been ten years.

555
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:05,297
It seems the cast didn't change much
over the decade. Am I right?

556
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,965
That's part of it.

557
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,593
After the show ends,
we get some soju and go home.

558
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,512
Then the next year, we gather again.

559
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,681
Preparing Godot was…

560
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,933
How can I put it?

561
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,104
It's not something you do out of duty,

562
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:24,441
but something you're doing
before you even realize. Is that it?

563
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:31,656
When the article is out, buy the paper.

564
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,909
And keep it. It's our history.

565
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,035
Godot.

566
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,622
I see. Then are you ending it too?

567
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:40,540
Ending what?

568
00:41:40,624 --> 00:41:43,585
Waiting For Godot is closing.
Are you moving on as well?

569
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:50,133
Honey. That sounds like
he couldn't go on a date because of her.

570
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,134
Read the room.

571
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:54,512
Why bother? That's not like you.

572
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,643
Right. Move on, will you?
She disappeared without a trace.

573
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,895
If you know where she is,
you'd at least visit her.

574
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,023
For goodness' sake,
move on already, will you?

575
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,066
I already have.

576
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:09,903
Okay, let's call it that.

577
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,655
-Here.
-No, I mean it.

578
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,784
Now, Waiting for Godot is over.

579
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:17,702
Everything is over.

580
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,955
Everyone, raise your glasses. Cheers.

581
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,082
-Cheers.
-Sure, cheers.

582
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,541
Cheers.

583
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,969
We've come a long way.
Is it finally over tomorrow?

584
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,597
You must be getting tired.

585
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,100
It's not that I'm tired.

586
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:43,353
I've simply been walking forward.

587
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:49,401
I don't know what I passed
or what passed me.

588
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,778
Everything

589
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,739
sounds like an old song.

590
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:02,080
The lyrics are gone, but the melody keeps
ringing in my mouth. A song like that.

591
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:08,169
I don't even know if I sang it
or if someone else sang it.

592
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,630
I don't know anymore.

593
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,354
WAITING FOR GODOT
HAEUM NATIONAL THEATER

594
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,082
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

595
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,947
Do you like this play that much?

596
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,868
You watch it every time you come to Korea.
Is it still fun?

597
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,329
It's boring.

598
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,541
Hurry up. We're late.

599
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,709
WAITING FOR GODOT

600
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,467
What a liar.
He said he'd come if I waited.

601
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,185
WAITING FOR GODOT

602
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,189
Oh… So hot.

603
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,822
Why do you never see him
even though you come every year?

604
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,032
But you watch that damn play every time.

605
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,495
I just watch it for old times' sake.

606
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:08,915
We had so much fun then.

607
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:14,629
Ji-woo.

608
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,257
Are you really not going to see Kyeong-do?

609
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,886
Se-yeong, you see…

610
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:26,516
I thought it was wrong after our breakup
so I went to see him.

611
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,354
He wanted to buy me a pork cutlet,
so I was going to ask him to buy it.

612
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:36,151
While sitting in that restaurant,
I was going to call Kyeong-do.

613
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,571
And an older couple
were having the pork cutlet next to me.

614
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:40,864
It must've been her birthday.

615
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:45,034
The man bought her a 50,000-won blouse.

616
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:49,038
And the woman nagged at him
for buying something so expensive.

617
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,168
She seemed to like it though.

618
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,837
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

619
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,717
They were Kyeong-do's parents.

620
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:03,887
What?

621
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,556
They were talking to him on the phone.

622
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,227
That's when I understood
what Kyeong-do meant.

623
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,649
There is a life I'm not aware of.

624
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,320
And I'll never know.

625
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:23,573
Every time that happens,
I'll hurt Kyeong-do's feelings.

626
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,909
Then we'll end up

627
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:28,453
hurting each other again.

628
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,922
WAITING FOR GODOT
THE LAST SHOW

629
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,382
The curtain's closed.

630
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,510
I should end it as well.

631
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,723
With my idiot Kyeong-do.

632
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,603
Every time I watch it,

633
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:56,105
I think it's long and hard to understand.

634
00:46:58,066 --> 00:47:00,652
I still can't believe you watched it
so many times.

635
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,656
Hey, then can you tell

636
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,784
what social absurdity is
just by looking at it?

637
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,627
But how come
we've never run into each other?

638
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,672
Maybe one of us is lying.

639
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,175
Then you're lying.
I even wrote an article about it.

640
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,219
I'm not lying either.

641
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,439
What?

642
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:45,488
Godot, you, and me,

643
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:48,616
we must have missed each other so fiercely
to end up here now.

644
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,502
I got something for you.

645
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,280
I wanted to ask you.

646
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:32,619
I always wanted to ask you if you had it.

647
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,163
Why didn't you?

648
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,671
Because you'd be in pain,

649
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:46,966
and so would I.

650
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,266
Don't leave me now.

651
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,477
Or I'll die.

652
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:50,238
Triple the dosage.

653
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,502
Drink it while it's warm.

654
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,679
This medicine is kind of bitter.

655
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,141
This is your favorite chocolate.

656
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,184
I went to buy some myself this morning.

657
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,735
I'll drink it later.

658
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,617
It's only effective when it's warm.

659
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,999
Come on, don't be like Ro-a.

660
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:49,088
Even if it's bitter,
endure it and drink it up.

661
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,798
I used good deer antlers.

662
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:29,837
LEE GANG-HYEON

663
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,717
Oh, my. Oh, no.

664
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:35,635
Is your hand okay?

665
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:38,846
Yes, I'm okay. Honey. Sorry.

666
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:40,181
Okay.

667
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:42,725
Yes, Executive Lee.

668
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,020
Yes.

669
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,112
Yes.

670
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:22,640
Hello.

671
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,476
DONGWOON DAILY
LEE KYEONG-DO

672
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,354
Can you check if there's a graduate
named Yoo Dan-bi?

673
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:32,191
We can't provide personal information
at our discretion.

674
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:33,150
Then,

675
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:36,529
can you just check
if she graduated from here?

676
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:37,989
That is--

677
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,617
I'm not trying to
write an article about it. Please?

678
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,290
What year did she enter?

679
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,753
EDUCATION
ENROLLMENT PERIOD

680
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,505
Here.

681
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:02,096
There is no graduate named Yoo Dan-bi.

682
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:15,318
Do I report to you from now on?

683
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:16,903
Yes.

684
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,947
Is the pork cutlet good?

685
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,991
Yes. Do you want a piece?

686
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,368
Yes.

687
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,289
Everything is tasty here.

688
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,291
Bae Jun-soo went to the US.

689
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:33,461
And he stopped meeting Kang Min-woo.

690
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:38,090
The M&A expert investor.
Is he in Manhattan?

691
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:39,467
I think so.

692
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,010
Should I go?

693
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,637
Why bother going that far?

694
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:54,690
Follow this person, from where she lives
to what she does after work.

695
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:55,858
YOO DAN-BI

696
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,737

697
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,322
Okay.

698
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:03,741
Is the gimbap good?

699
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,202
Yes.

700
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:16,087
Teacher,

701
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:18,881
I'm okay

702
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,343
with the integral calculus questions,

703
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,137
but I'm stuck with geometry.

704
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:28,432
Really?

705
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:44,365
I marked them. I got everything right.

706
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:49,203
You're at an academy, aren't you?

707
00:54:51,122 --> 00:54:54,333
I have English after math.

708
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:58,337
Then you need to move
to the other class, right?

709
00:54:58,421 --> 00:54:59,296
Yes.

710
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:02,842
My workbooks.

711
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:05,094
Okay.

712
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:10,016
Here.

713
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,104
-Do you want to go to the class?
-Okay.

714
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:18,733
Oh, wait.

715
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:24,488
Secretary Cha,

716
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:27,366
can you grab the report from my room?

717
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:30,786
Don't send Secretary Yoo.
It's confidential.

718
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:32,621
Bye.

719
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:37,960
All right.

720
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:39,628
-Let's go.
-Okay.

721
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,599
Come on.

722
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:56,562
My English teacher…

723
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,023
Why would they...

724
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,406
I'm here to meet CEO Seo Ji-yeon.

725
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,699
One second.

726
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:15,247
Mr. Lee Kyeong-do is here to meet the CEO.
Yes, okay.

727
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:19,960
-At two o'clock, right?
-Yes.

728
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:24,048
The CEO isn't available at the moment.
Can you wait a moment?

729
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,257
Oh, okay. Sure.

730
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,562
This isn't the classroom.

731
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:42,691
It's right around the corner.
Go on. Let's go. Come.

732
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:56,330
Isn't that Ms. Seo?

733
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,271
Let me help you.

734
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,650
Don't you steal mine…

735
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:32,992
Ji-yeon. What's wrong?

736
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:30,132
Please be seated.

737
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,470
Waiting for Godot will start soon.

738
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,311
Sorry.

739
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,421
WAITING FOR GODOT

740
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:35,698
Hurry up.

741
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:39,243
JANGCHUNG SNACK BAR

742
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:57,005
When I went to meet you at the airport,
I was thinking,

743
01:01:57,798 --> 01:01:59,633
Only if you don't leave.

744
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,178
Was I the only immature kid?

745
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:05,681
Seo Ji-yeon's dementia,
Seo Ji-woo being an illegitimate child...

746
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:09,726
Where that asshole is going,
I have to be there first.

747
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:14,481
If Ji-woo really puts her mind to it,
even ten guys couldn't take her down.

748
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:18,610
An illegitimate child out of wedlock.
It's a nice keyword.

749
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:20,988
Let's get ahead of him.

750
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,823
You did earn the assistant manager title.

751
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:24,867
Just show yourself.

752
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:27,744
Just as I am.
