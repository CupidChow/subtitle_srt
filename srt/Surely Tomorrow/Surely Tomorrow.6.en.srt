1
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:44,962
SURELY TOMORROW

2
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,354
Be honest with me. Have you ever rented
a whole amusement park before?

3
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,816
I think I could rent it if I tried.

4
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,824
Just kidding. It was so much fun.

5
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,370
- You're going to work now.
- Okay.

6
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,139
You have a long way to go.
You must be tired.

7
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,143
At least there's no traffic.

8
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:49,193
I'm going to order some food.
Want to join me?

9
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,994
I knew something was missing.
There were no snacks at the park.

10
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,789
Right. I knew something was missing too.

11
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,958
It's not easy to have
only one serving delivered.

12
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,878
You're right. And the good places
always have the minimum order.

13
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:08,838
Right.

14
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:09,839
Right.

15
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,550
Are you coming?

16
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,552
Sure.

17
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,345
SURELY TOMORROW

18
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,389
EPISODE 6

19
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,734
- Who is it?
- What?

20
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,986
What? Let me see.

21
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,612
It's just work.

22
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,905
What is it? Show me.

23
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,407
You're embarrassing me.

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,743
- Fine. So mean.
- Watch the movie.

25
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,348
Hey.

26
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,853
What?

27
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,438
Aren't you going to work?

28
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,986
Good morning.

29
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,239
Sure, it's a good morning.
Wash up and go make money.

30
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,240
Okay.

31
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:06,747
Jeez.

32
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,675
Use the bathroom in the master bedroom.
That one's broken.

33
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,592
Okay.

34
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,369
Have you seen my clothes?

35
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,287
- I have.
- I'm late.

36
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,794
Shit.

37
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,175
I saw it all when I put the patch on you.
Why are you shy now?

38
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,011
Don't talk to me. I can't multitask.

39
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,441
Good morning.

40
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,234
Well.

41
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,779
You're wearing the same clothes,
but you look neat.

42
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:24,366
Well, my parents
run the laundromat after all.

43
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,868
Did someone iron it for you?

44
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,373
Why are you so early today--

45
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,374
We need to talk.

46
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,591
Good morning.

47
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:42,926
Assistant Manager, good morning.

48
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,344
Is it?

49
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,639
What's wrong with him?

50
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,406
Don't you have a brain?

51
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,076
How can I live then?

52
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,411
When you met with the general manager…

53
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,164
Are you out of your mind?

54
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,167
You're backing out
of the overseas training? Why?

55
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:22,049
There's something I have to do.

56
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,010
Don't you know others are desperate to go?

57
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:30,599
We pay for the tuition and the housing.
Why would you refuse to go?

58
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,978
You can't let this go. We didn't accept
applications from your level.

59
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,398
You're right.
I'm sure I'll regret it very much later.

60
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,358
But?

61
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,195
This thing that I have to do

62
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,531
can only be done now.

63
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,743
I've given it a lot of thought.

64
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,998
I know I'll regret it later
that I didn't go to Chicago, but…

65
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:00,337
if I don't get this sorted out now,

66
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,466
I'll be messed up for the rest of my life.

67
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,759
Is it Seo Ji-woo again?

68
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,387
I got scared
now that I was about to leave.

69
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,472
I have traveler's diarrhea,
and a sensitive stomach.

70
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:13,308
When you were assigned to Current Affairs,
Seo Ji-woo got in your way.

71
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,894
She disappeared,
and you drowned yourself in booze.

72
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:20,399
And you're giving up overseas training
that everyone's after? Again, you idiot?

73
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,984
That's not true.

74
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,529
I have an important plan.

75
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:33,203
Why does Seo Ji-woo have to ruin
every important moment of your life?

76
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,664
What does she mean to you
that you surrender every time?

77
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,708
You can't even plant the flag.

78
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,502
Don't you dare call that love.

79
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,560
Min-woo! Ta-da.

80
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,485
I'll stay quiet for a while,
and I'll start at my father's company.

81
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,697
How's your condition?

82
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,073
You mean drugs?

83
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,036
I should be a good son now.

84
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:17,164
Yeah, quit doing drugs
and come to my senses.

85
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:21,043
Apparently, I need to exercise a lot.
Then I heard you're here, so I came.

86
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:24,171
This place is nice and quiet.

87
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,967
Well, you know,
Seo Ji-woo has a man, you know?

88
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,844
That ass who was in the picture with her.

89
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,223
They say there's nothing,
but they're living together.

90
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,515
- Shit.
- Living together?

91
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,853
He said straight up
that he's flirting with her.

92
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,438
Min-woo, who the hell is he?

93
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:43,815
Ji-woo's living with a guy?

94
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,652
If that's what's happening,
I'm the only one defeated.

95
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,528
I feel like I fell for their trap.

96
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,157
Why do you care when you're divorced?
Just go on your way.

97
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,409
We could get back together.

98
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,703
- What?
- Whatever. That's up to me.

99
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,872
By the way, Min-woo, well,

100
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,668
An Da-hye keeps calling me.

101
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,754
Maybe because you keep picking up.

102
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:07,631
You know what she said?

103
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:12,511
She told me to tell you,
either answer the phone or pay a visit.

104
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:15,347
Why me?

105
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,850
That's what I mean.
Why would she want to talk to you?

106
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,437
Is it about the money she borrowed?

107
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,690
She said it was urgent,
so I lent her some.

108
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,609
It wasn't even that much. Why bother?

109
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,156
Give her a call. She's a pathetic girl.

110
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,123
FAMOUS COMEDIAN KIM U-JAE

INCOMING CALL
LEE KYEONG-DO

117
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:51,777
Hello?

118
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,113
Ms. Seo. This is Lee Kyeong-do.
You wanted to see me today.

119
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:57,783
Who?

120
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,243
Isn't this Ms. Seo Ji-yeon's phone?

121
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,955
Seo Ji-yeon?
I don't know who Seo Ji-yeon is.

122
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,878
Where are you? Where are you right now?

123
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:19,221
I'm at the company cafeteria. I'm eating.

124
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,160
Ms. Seo,

125
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,040
you said to have lunch together,
but you are eating alone?

126
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,503
I guess the food is pretty good today.

127
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,631
Ms. Seo, I think you're done.

128
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,758
The coffee's on me, okay?

129
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,596
All right. Shall we get going?

130
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,475
Why is the cafeteria so cold?

131
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,479
Do you want to put this on? It's okay.

132
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,731
We have a plan.

133
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,693
Now, get up. Get up slowly. Okay.

134
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,948
We have a meeting.
Do we go to the right or the left?

135
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,200
Right?

136
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,169
Ms. Seo, are you okay?

137
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,509
Yeah, right.

138
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,182
Can you get me a change of clothes?

139
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,517
Yes, ma'am. I'll prepare it right away.

140
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,524
Okay.

141
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,369
Get something warm for her.

142
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:07,996
Okay.

143
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,094
I guess I can't hide it anymore, right?

144
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,016
I'm such a mess.

145
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,189
You should get some rest at home.

146
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,525
How's Ji-woo doing?

147
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,154
If you talk to her,
she'll soon start working.

148
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,282
That's great.

149
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,910
That's really great. I'm finally relieved.

150
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:31,830
Thank you.

151
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,875
I think you should talk to Ji-woo soon…

152
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,170
I should, but not now.

153
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,218
She has finally made up her mind.
If she finds out that I'm sick,

154
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,761
she might get scared.

155
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,640
But it won't take long.

156
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,601
My husband is

157
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,229
already looking for a nursing home
in Canada.

158
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:01,985
Are you saying he knows?

159
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:05,780
Then why…

160
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:09,701
I told you.
He's not exactly a good husband.

161
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,413
It's not even that surprising.

162
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,586
Ji-woo should start working soon.

163
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,340
This is ironic.

164
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,218
I…

165
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,223
I was actually the one
who split you two up at that time.

166
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,602
<i>Ji-woo,</i>

167
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,354
you can't be here.

168
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,230
Ji-yeon, but…

169
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,069
But Kyeong-do is all I have.

170
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:47,697
That's all the more reason
why you shouldn't be here.

171
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:57,040
The amusement park.
I can't stop thinking about it.

172
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,543
I don't remember the last time
I had that much fun.

173
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,128
This dinner is a thank you.

174
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,799
Fine dining is surely different.

175
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,885
It's delicious. Oh, I'm full.

176
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,430
Why are you laughing? I said it's good.

177
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,935
I was scared because of the prices.
You know I have the shirt trauma.

178
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,356
It's nice to see you eat
without complaining.

179
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,611
It's nice to have a good friend
who treats me like this.

180
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,536
Sure, you have a good friend.

181
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,666
A friend who can take me
to an amusement park at this age.

182
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,751
Good.

183
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,173
What exactly made you upset--

184
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,551
Just call me a female friend.
A friend who is female.

185
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,930
We were having a good time.
Stop nitpicking.

186
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,182
You said you had a question.
Ask your female friend.

187
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,767
I'm not going to if you act so grumpy.

188
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:04,983
Kyeong-do,

189
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,446
what are you so curious about?
My friend Lee Kyeong-do?

190
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,866
My goodness.

191
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,793
About back then.

192
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,964
Don't take it too seriously.

193
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,968
I just think about it sometimes,
and I'm curious.

194
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,472
Why are you beating around the bush?

195
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,644
Why…

196
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,815
did you leave me?

197
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,487
Back then in Yeonnam-dong.

198
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,961
Do you want to get out of here?

199
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,589
Let's go somewhere refreshing.

200
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,512
Remember how Cho Jin-eon came to my house?
The day you saw him.

201
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,893
He called me Cinderella after midnight.

202
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,982
He said even if I fight back,
only rats will surround me.

203
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,530
That fucking son of a bitch.

204
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,456
Back then,

205
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,835
when I left you,

206
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,672
I saw myself after midnight.

207
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,301
This Saturday…

208
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,427
SUMMER, 2015

209
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,137
…we're going to a fancy restaurant.

210
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,764
Really? What? Where?

211
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,475
I found a nice Korean restaurant.

212
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,145
Why? Is it some kind of an anniversary?

213
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:08,857
A day to have great food.

214
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,734
Great food…

215
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,532
Hey, Mom.

216
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,745
Dad? How serious?

217
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,127
Which hospital? Okay. Bye.

218
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,716
I have to go to the hospital.
My dad is badly injured.

219
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,636
Wait for me at home. I will--

220
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,305
You should get going. Hurry up.

221
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,807
Yeah, sorry. See you later.

222
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,285
MISSED CALLS
JI-YEON - MOM - DAD

223
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,581
OPERATING

224
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:12,795
He just needs to survive. Your dad.

225
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,632
As long as he survives.

226
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,302
That's all I ask for.

227
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,977
He'll be fine. Don't worry, Mom.

228
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,029
JI-WOO

229
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,168
Hey, Ji-woo.

230
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:56,214
Yeah, he… He's getting surgery.

231
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,509
Don't worry too much.

232
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,181
Don't skip any meals.

233
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,602
I think I'll have to stay here.

234
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,145
Yes, I'm fine.

235
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,482
Call me if you need anything.
I'll keep my phone on.

236
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:16,818
Okay.

237
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,863
Sleep with the lights on if you're scared.

238
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:23,741
Bye.

239
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,973
MOM

240
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,905
Hey.

241
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,791
How's your father?

242
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:41,671
The surgery went well,
but his fever is not getting any better.

243
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,423
We'll have to wait
until he becomes stabilized.

244
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:45,842
Okay.

245
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:50,346
Still, I'm glad to hear
that his surgery went well.

246
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:51,639
Yeah.

247
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,811
I have to go back.

248
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,437
Right. Sure. Okay.

249
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,817
Are you going to be okay?
Do you want to stay at Se-yeong's?

250
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,529
No, I want to stay here.

251
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,408
I'm okay by myself. Don't worry.

252
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,622
Sorry.

253
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,375
Why are you sorry?

254
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,098
Make sure your mother eats well.

255
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,975
Yeah, you also should eat well.

256
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,477
You look terrible.

257
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,525
Bye.

258
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:22,647
Ji-woo.

259
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,525
Hey…

260
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,371
I see…

261
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,667
I was Mom's hell.

262
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,802
I had no idea.

263
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,389
I simply wanted to know
if I was her real daughter.

264
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,492
Funny.

265
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,832
She hates the kid
she got from having an affair?

266
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,466
Are you okay with me?

267
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,847
Were you okay?

268
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,817
I think you were about eight…

269
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,821
when I found out.

270
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:57,491
I overheard Mom and Dad talking.

271
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,166
I put some tissue in your ears
when you were sleeping

272
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,376
so you wouldn't hear anything.

273
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,049
I didn't want you to hear it forever,

274
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,802
but I'm saying it with my own mouth.

275
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,184
Ji-woo,

276
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,437
you can't be here.

277
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,319
Ji-yeon, but…

278
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:37,948
But Kyeong-do is all I have.

279
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,619
That's all the more reason
why you shouldn't be here.

280
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:46,582
The look she gave you your whole life
and her horrible contempt.

281
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,293
All that will go to Kyeong-do.

282
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,305
That drives people crazy…

283
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,768
Ji-woo.

284
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,564
You must have a decent life.

285
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:14,026
Not as the daughter of an actor
who barely makes a living in Vienna,

286
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,197
but as the shining Seo Ji-woo of JARIM.

287
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:22,743
His father.

288
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,038
He's very badly injured.

289
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,499
It's serious.

290
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:36,132
Lee Kyeong-do can't afford
to look after you.

291
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,242
Doctor, the BP is dropping.

292
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,910
- Check again.
- Yes.

293
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:18,048
YEONNAM UNDERGROUND WALKWAY

294
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,053
<i>That's all the more reason</i>
<i>why you shouldn't be here.</i>

295
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:09,058
The look she gave you your whole life
and her horrible contempt.

296
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,520
<i>All that will go to Kyeong-do.</i>

297
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,813
Will you change the server in charge?

298
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:19,068
It'll be uncomfortable
when we're here to enjoy dinner.

299
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:24,949
A mere part-timer in a VIP room?
It doesn't sound right, does it?

300
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:33,035
Ji-woo, why is your phone off?

301
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,142
Ji-woo…

302
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,652
- Ji-woo--
<i>- The phone is turned off. Please…</i>

303
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,238
Ji-woo…

304
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:23,460
I got to enjoy a life of luxury thanks
to a good stepdad and a good sister.

305
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,671
But now I'm just…

306
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,383
Cinderella.

307
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,470
A sad ending.

308
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:55,033
<i>At the time, I was too…</i>

309
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,538
I mean, it's not that I left you…

310
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,333
but I left to die.

311
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:08,255
But it was really frightening to die.

312
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:29,818
Good job, Seo Ji-woo.

313
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,448
Thank you for surviving.

314
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,410
I mean it. Thank you so much.

315
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,214
Hey, why is that a good job?

316
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:52,257
You almost died.

317
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,135
I was doing just fine
and suddenly showed up divorced.

318
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,806
Why…

319
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,684
Why are you still so stupid?

320
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,436
So naive. You're way too kind.

321
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:09,858
I'm sorry.

322
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,610
This is crazy.

323
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,196
Why are you sorry?

324
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,032
When you were having the hardest time,

325
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:21,245
I wasn't there.

326
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,248
I wasn't there for you.

327
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:27,960
At the time,

328
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,507
my father was in a serious condition…

329
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,643
That wasn't on you.

330
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,397
That was on me.

331
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,068
I wasn't there for you

332
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,446
when you were struggling the most.

333
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,127
Did you cry a lot?

334
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,549
Did it hurt a lot?

335
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,015
You're a damn kind lunatic.

336
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,024
It's because…

337
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,902
I was too petty…

338
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:37,863
I thought you left…

339
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,659
because my place was too small.

340
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,121
Because my bed was too worn out.

341
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,499
Because the bathroom smelled like a sewer.

342
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,713
Because the slime in the sink
would never go away.

343
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:02,054
I thought… that's why you left.

344
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:11,563
Every time… every time I drank,
that's all I thought about.

345
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,363
You know those suffocating thoughts
with no exit?

346
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,618
I drank because that was so stupid of me.

347
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:29,498
I drank again after calling you an asshole

348
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,875
and a bitch.

349
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:34,878
I drank again…

350
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,884
because… I missed you.

351
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,513
So I drank.

352
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:23,927
<i>Kyeong-do,</i>

353
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,806
<i>I hate the word shame.</i>

354
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:31,518
<i>I even hate how it sounds.</i>

355
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,896
<i>I hate how it keeps sticking to me.</i>

356
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,278
<i>When you're so close to me</i>

357
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,114
<i>and smile at me,</i>

358
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:50,454
<i>then it makes it so hard for me</i>
<i>to ask you to leave.</i>

359
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,419
<i>That's why I hate the word shame.</i>

360
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,213
<i>Ji-woo,</i>

361
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,883
<i>when I was 20 or even now,</i>

362
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,177
<i>I'm still clumsy.</i>

363
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:09,347
<i>I'm not sure about what I should do</i>
<i>to make you feel</i>

364
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,308
<i>comfortable.</i>

365
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,649
<i>Your sister seems very ill.</i>

366
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:21,943
<i>But don't be afraid.</i>

367
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,696
<i>I know I'm clumsy and sloppy,</i>

368
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:29,284
<i>but I'll do anything. Anything for you.</i>

369
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:58,313
I got home easily thanks to you.

370
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:00,816
Aren't you tired?

371
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,152
It's not so tiring to drive a nice car.

372
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,120
- You need to call a taxi, right?
- Yes.

373
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,545
I have something to say.

374
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,010
I should've told you earlier,
but the timing wasn't right.

375
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:31,972
What is it?

376
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,226
Can I have a cup of tea?

377
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,488
Be calm.

378
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,867
As if it's nothing serious. Okay?

379
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,704
Damn it.

380
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,145
That's Ji-yeon's number.

381
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:38,079
<i>I think it's best for me to tell Ji-woo.</i>

382
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,135
You got a call.

383
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:53,553
Really?

384
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,692
You're not calling back?

385
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,446
Yeah, later. It's not urgent.

386
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,405
Lee Kyeong-do.

387
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:18,703
Why do you have to talk to my sister?

388
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,165
What do you need to tell me?

389
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:33,760
Ji-woo.

390
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,012
Yes, say it.

391
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,395
INCOMING CALL
JI-YEON

392
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,319
Hello?

393
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,365
Yes. Now?

394
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,952
No, I'll come.

395
00:43:00,537 --> 00:43:01,371
Bye.

396
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,671
You'd better explain this.

397
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:13,967
I can explain.

398
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,263
We'll talk when I'm back.

399
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:19,681
Okay.

400
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:49,919
Are you angry?

401
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:53,423
Did I pick the wrong day?

402
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,385
Lee Kyeong-do's in my house.

403
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,928
Let's settle things face-to-face.

404
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:05,977
Ji-yeon, why…

405
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,022
Why are you in touch with him?

406
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:12,525
I guess you can,
but how come I didn't know?

407
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:19,240
Busted.

408
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,576
What's it about?

409
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:25,455
It might not be a big deal for you,
but I'm getting offended.

410
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,958
Lee Kyeong-do is such a consistent man.

411
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,295
When it comes to you,
he's always attentive.

412
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,547
What?

413
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,053
I asked him to stop you.

414
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,767
I told him the flight schedule and all.

415
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,687
Well, I told him just in case

416
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:53,483
because I was desperate,
but he dashed there right away.

417
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:01,241
Why is he… Seriously.

418
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:06,371
So? Did you tell him to coax me
into working at the company?

419
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:08,832
What?

420
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,252
No wonder he was being so diligent.

421
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,880
It was to make me quit drinking
before I start working.

422
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,298
My goodness.

423
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,886
You know what?
He moved into my house with his stuff.

424
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:22,804
Really?

425
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,056
He said
he's an alcoholism treatment expert.

426
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,144
That's putting too much pressure on me.

427
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:42,449
Get lost, you son of a bitch.

428
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:46,536
Don't even call yourself a human being.
How can you hide that from me?

429
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:50,290
Just get the hell out of my life,
you motherfucking fraud!

430
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:51,583
Damn it.

431
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,382
Was it funny?

432
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:02,343
I must've looked ridiculous
jumping around without a clue.

433
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,888
Here is the biggest butthead
in the world, Seo Ji-woo.

434
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,557
Why else would you have stopped me?

435
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,059
Will you leave?
Whether I drink or whatever,

436
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:11,769
get out of my life.

437
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:12,812
No.

438
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:16,566
No, stop.

439
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,068
Please stop!

440
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,365
You know how Dad
cherished this company so much?

441
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:29,787
I want to do well,

442
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:32,749
but I see the limit.

443
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,504
I guess I was only smart at school.

444
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,215
Right. You were damn smart at school.

445
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,052
But you're the one who likes fashion.

446
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:46,513
Yeah.

447
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:50,850
I want to get some rest now
and look after Ro-a.

448
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,483
You need to take over now.
Give me a break.

449
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,198
Ji-yeon, are you ill?

450
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,658
What?

451
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:14,249
It's just stress and a headache.
My head hurts a bit.

452
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,380
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

453
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:22,799
Ji-yeon, I…

454
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,512
- I was born out of wedlock.
- Ji-woo.

455
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,056
No, listen to me.
I've always wanted to say this.

456
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,480
Because of my situation, I thought
I shouldn't even set foot in the company.

457
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:43,903
I've received love, support,
and cheer from Dad more than I deserved.

458
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:48,241
I'm thankful for that.
I really wouldn't ask for more.

459
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:53,037
I didn't know
how much you were struggling.

460
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:57,917
I'm sorry that I was being selfish.

461
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,091
I was actually about to tell you.

462
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,887
I'll start working.

463
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,185
Are you crying?

464
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:18,396
Are you touched?

465
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:20,857
Yes.

466
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:25,028
I'm already overwhelmed
just imagining us working together.

467
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,119
When I thought about it,
I had no reason to chicken out.

468
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:34,912
I have you.

469
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:39,208
I can't do it alone, but with you,
it wouldn't be so bad.

470
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:44,255
What do you mean?
I bet you'd give JARIM Apparel wings.

471
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:00,647
Ji-yeon said…

472
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,149
I'm sorry. I should've--

473
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,653
…that it was Kyeong-do's fatal first love
that stopped Ji-woo.

474
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,321
What?

475
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,866
Am I really your first love?

476
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:12,784
What?

477
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,495
- Yeah.
- Nobody from middle school or high school?

478
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:17,580
Probably not.

479
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:21,042
Right. You wouldn't stop me
just because she asked.

480
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,168
You're a man of your own.

481
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,005
That's kind of true.

482
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,146
I've talked to Ji-yeon.

483
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,064
Okay…

484
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,486
When I said I'll start working,
she said it's like giving JARIM wings.

485
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,994
So what is it?
What do you have to tell me?

486
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,708
Well,

487
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:06,671
that you actually showed up at the airport
because Ji-yeon asked? Is it about that?

488
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:07,588
What?

489
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:10,383
Yeah.

490
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,844
What? Did you think
I'd be disappointed if I found out?

491
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,765
Well, it's rather

492
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,936
that she gave me an excuse to stop you.

493
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,856
It wasn't solely because she told me to.

494
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:30,194
That means Ji-yeon and you…

495
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:33,823
read each other's minds.

496
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:36,200
Just like that!

497
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:40,538
Hey, thanks a lot.

498
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,999
So Ji-yeon and you

499
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,419
both thought about me, right?

500
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:50,214
Hey, that's so touching.

501
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,341
Yeah, right.

502
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:21,996
INCOMING CALL
KIM DOO-JIN

503
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,170
Hey, Kyeong-do.

504
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,632
She is completely wasted.

505
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,509
Then you should've taken her home.

506
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,845
She won't budge
unless it's to take a drink.

507
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:39,180
Jeez.

508
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,766
Hey, Kyeong-do.
Did you do something wrong to her?

509
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:44,811
Why?

510
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:46,270
She wouldn't eat any food.

511
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:50,858
She kept murmuring your name
and clenched her teeth.

512
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:55,071
Whatever. We need to switch.
I feel like my back is going to break.

513
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,865
Sure. Good work.
I'll get a taxi for her. Get going.

514
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:00,827
Jeez… that reminds me.
Kyeong-do, are you not going to Chicago?

515
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:03,329
It ended up that way.

516
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,916
Wait, who told you?

517
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:12,255
Someone who said you deserved
to be beaten to death…

518
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:14,674
Bye.

519
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,386
Hey. Why are you involved with An Da-hye?

520
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,264
Gosh… Stop asking already.

521
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,307
There's nothing between me and her.

522
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,726
I've never even met her before!

523
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:30,648
That punk has an anger issue.

524
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,944
- Department Manager Jin.
- Yes.

525
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:38,030
Reporter Lee is here.
Will you please leave now?

526
00:52:42,243 --> 00:52:45,663
Who called this damn jerk?

527
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:48,624
Why are you Dongwoon Daily idiots
making a fuss at my job?

528
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:51,669
I have an actor's photoshoot tomorrow.
What if I can't get sober before then?

529
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,839
She probably didn't force you.
I know you drank on your own.

530
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,173
Hey,

531
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:59,844
one easily leads to another and ten more.
It tastes damn good.

532
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,847
I'm sick of drinking.
When will I ever stop?

533
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:04,765
I'm leaving.

534
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,686
Hey, where are you going?

535
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,187
Good night.

536
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,108
Kim Doo-jin that punk. Shit.

537
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,403
Why did you come?

538
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,656
Ow, my head. Let's go.

539
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,285
- Let me get you a taxi.
- Thank you so fucking much.

540
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,411
Han-kyeong.

541
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,707
To me, Ji-woo is like

542
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:32,877
a thick photo album that's always open.

543
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:35,755
I can't add a new picture.

544
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:39,050
I can't remove
all the pictures inside, either.

545
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,927
Shit.

546
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:45,181
But Chicago is too good to lose.

547
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:46,557
I know. It is.

548
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:52,980
You bring up a photo album
in the world of AI?

549
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:58,444
Just write a damn poem!
Assistant manager with analog sentiment.

550
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,029
Are you looking down on poetry?

551
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,073
Is calling it analog looking down,
you idiot?

552
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,159
Get yourself your own taxi.

553
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,620
So rude. You're always fucking rude.

554
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,210
Why are you following me?

555
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,461
There's only one exit.

556
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,048
Just jump off.

557
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,302
Don't we need to summon
the board of directors?

558
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:28,808
It's in the former chairman's will.
It wouldn't cause a problem.

559
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,435
Still, we should ask for their opinions.

560
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,897
It'd probably upset them.
Why bother listening to their complaints?

561
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,944
What did Ji-woo say? Is she confident?

562
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,279
Not sure.

563
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,617
You know what?

564
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:51,664
When I joined this company,
I wasn't confident.

565
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,835
How many people could say
that they're confident?

566
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:59,630
I'm sure Ji-woo will do better than me.

567
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:01,716
If she doesn't know anything,
she can learn.

568
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,301
You can help her.

569
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,723
Of course I'll help her.
That's not a problem.

570
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:13,686
I had to ask Ji-woo many times.
It wasn't an easy decision for her.

571
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,813
I barely convinced her into it
when she refused.

572
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,150
Because I'm ill,

573
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,570
she made a big decision to join.

574
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,363
You know what people are like.

575
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:27,283
When you're forced,
you're not that energetic.

576
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,535
Things could even end badly.

577
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:36,375
Aren't you going to ask how I'm ill?

578
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,299
Are you not well?
When was your last medical checkup?

579
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:52,850
I'm just making a fuss.
I just said that to make Ji-woo feel bad.

580
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:02,318
Well, it's a relief, then.
But you don't look that healthy either.

581
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,656
Take it easy.

582
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,077
It's your health that matters,

583
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:13,537
not the company.

584
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,334
Yeah. Thanks.

585
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,947
- Intern?
- Yes?

586
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,949
Is a female friend
different than a friend?

587
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,785
- What?
- It's the same category, right?

588
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:56,372
Look. Let's say I met a friend
who is a woman.

589
00:56:56,455 --> 00:57:00,251
And I want to tell her thanks.

590
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:04,839
"I'm lucky to have a friend like you."
That means "Thanks to you," right?

591
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,175
Yes.

592
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:11,345
Then she went,
"Why not just call me a female friend?"

593
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,430
and lost her temper.
Something got on her nerves.

594
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,600
Here's my analysis.

595
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:18,561
So, for your female acquaintance,

596
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,564
both friend and female friend
are not good.

597
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:26,902
If she's really interested in you,
a friend or a female friend,

598
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:29,864
either would be terrible.

599
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,866
Right.

600
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,076
You know this for sure. Why did you ask?

601
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,120
Are you awake now?

602
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,165
Did it show?

603
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:44,378
Here, take it.

604
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:50,217
Wait, this is Doo-jin's favorite, right?

605
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,303
I liked it first.
It helps when you feel drowsy.

606
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,139
Thank you.

607
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,066
I feel recharged.

608
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:06,984
Right?

609
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,237
INCOMING CALL
SE-YEONG

610
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,864
Hello?

611
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:14,575
A new job party?

612
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,580
But you didn't throw me one,
but you'd do it for Ji-woo?

613
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:23,500
<i>You? I nursed you when you were sick.</i>
<i>You want me to go into detail?</i>

614
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:25,294
Nope. What time?

615
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:28,255
Yes. Okay.

616
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:36,013
Does that mean
I have to see Seo Ji-woo again?

617
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:41,602
I guess I have no choice but to meet her.

618
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:46,398
If you become a director,
can I get clothes for free at your shop?

619
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,818
Let me ask my sister.

620
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:53,614
Hey! A director should be able to
do that much.

621
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,199
Probably? Maybe? Maybe not?

622
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:57,868
- Mom.
- Yes.

623
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,621
When are we having the cake?

624
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:02,498
Do you want it?

625
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,501
We don't know when Jeong-min will be here.
Let's put the candles.

626
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:06,752
Sure. Yes. Hurry.

627
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:10,256
Don't you dare put the candles, you jerks.
The birthday boy isn't here yet.

628
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,384
You're never on time.

629
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,927
Because he was overprotected.

630
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:18,806
Ji-woo, hi.
When will your beauty finally die down?

631
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,475
You're so bright
that I want to add eye drops.

632
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:32,236
Jeong-min, your lame phrases
are still the same.

633
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,196
We have a pure soul here.

634
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,657
You should raise him strong,
or he'd end up like Jeong-min.

635
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,034
- You--
- Hey, that was a little harsh.

636
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:41,662
Hey, I really appreciate

637
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:45,291
this little surprise for my birthday,
but why do you keep teasing me?

638
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:47,793
Is this for me?

639
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:52,965
But seriously, I get to laugh
thanks to my friends, you know?

640
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:56,051
Who celebrates my birthday now?
Not even my mom does.

641
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:58,846
Honestly, I cried a little this morning.

642
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:01,932
You know, seriously,

643
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:04,059
you're all I have.

644
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:07,855
It's for me.

645
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:10,607
What?

646
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:11,859
It's for me.

647
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:15,070
Today is about me.
It's to celebrate my new job.

648
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,623
It's one shot, two kills.
We can celebrate them both.

649
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:28,542
Wow, double happiness. Right?

650
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,962
Yes, we're perfect for each other, right?

651
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:32,963
Double.

652
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:34,340
It's not working. Cut it out.

653
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:36,967
I'll let you blow the candles. Go.

654
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:40,262
I appreciate it. It's been three years
since I haven't done it.

655
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:42,681
Your life is so pitiful.

656
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:45,059
You should try out
the matchmaking companies.

657
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:50,105
Ji-woo! It's a good day.
Do you have to say that?

658
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:53,859
Right. You even sent me Korean beef.
I should be nice to you.

659
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,071
What?

660
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:00,574
When?

661
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,035
- What is that reaction?
- Really?

662
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:04,995
Hey, you brought it over.

663
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,414
Dong-won, you're pretty old now.

664
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:12,795
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

665
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:19,134
<i>Happy birthday dear Jeong-min</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

666
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:20,427
One more time!

667
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:24,515
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

668
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:29,269
<i>Happy birthday dear Jeong-min</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

669
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:31,105
One, two, three!

670
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,276
Good job! All right. Birthday noogies.

671
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,405
Okay, birthday noogies!

672
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:42,741
Okay, that's enough!

673
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:52,835
What's it like among the executives?
They're probably not welcoming Seo Ji-woo.

674
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,796
They're not happy about it.

675
01:01:55,879 --> 01:02:00,050
But then they're not hasty enough to show
that they don't like it.

676
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:03,011
They all worked for
the former chairman after all.

677
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,848
It looks like they agreed to respect it.

678
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,436
What can I say about this company?

679
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:12,855
It's like some kind of a clique.

680
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:17,317
They didn't gather to make money,
but to worship my father-in-law.

681
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,945
I find that very uncomfortable.

682
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,824
It's something you need to acknowledge.

683
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,870
They've worked with Chairman Seo
since they were young.

684
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,039
And Chairman Seo looked after them
as if they were his family.

685
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,126
Do you think you can conquer
this mountain of obstacles?

686
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:36,795
Now that Seo Ji-woo showed up?

687
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,261
I'm so thankful that she showed up.

688
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:47,389
She's entering the cave
to get eaten on her own.

689
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:50,225
There's no way she'd do well.

690
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:53,896
She'll either bring the company down,
or stay crushed in one corner.

691
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,231
That only gives us a better excuse.

692
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,736
Sell JARIM, seize a fortune,

693
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:02,404
and disassemble.

694
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,115
I bet everyone will be on our side then.

695
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,872
Director Kang, what year were you born?

696
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,249
Out of nowhere?

697
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,044
You look at least
ten years younger than I am.

698
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,546
You're starting to drop the honorifics.

699
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,474
Oh, my, excuse me.

700
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:35,729
I guess I relied on you too much.
I was getting too comfortable with you.

701
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,105
I'll watch out.

702
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:42,694
Trust begins from such minor things.

703
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:47,783
The former chairman had never dropped
the honorifics with us before.

704
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:52,955
You might think it's not a big deal,
but things like that create respect.

705
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,209
I still have a lot to learn.

706
01:03:58,252 --> 01:03:59,795
Allow me to fill your glass.

707
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:18,313
DELUXE TAXI PRIVATE

708
01:04:19,815 --> 01:04:20,857
Thank you.

709
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:22,859
Good night.

710
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:40,002
Jesus, that old fossil. Seriously.

711
01:04:57,269 --> 01:04:59,229
Yeah. What was I going to say?

712
01:05:00,147 --> 01:05:01,523
Increase the doses.

713
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,485
I'll prepare more drugs.

714
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:08,864
Yeah. Thanks for your work.

715
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:13,201
We need to end it soon
for us to move on, Dan-bi.

716
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,245
Don't make any mistakes.

717
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,045
You're in front of a children's academy.

718
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:25,631
Oh, you're right.

719
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:31,845
I was actually thinking about
visiting you at work.

720
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,307
I think I was being too edgy
about Ji-woo last time.

721
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,352
But don't take it wrong.

722
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:43,273
I'm just worried.
I'm not saying anything about you two.

723
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:45,442
I know that. Jeez.

724
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:50,864
What is it between you two exactly?

725
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:54,993
Are you friends? Is it a fling?
Or are you in a relationship again?

726
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:00,248
I don't want us to be just friends.

727
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:01,958
Then get back with her.

728
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,960
- I can't ask her.
- Why not?

729
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:11,051
Are you afraid of losing her completely
if you break up again?

730
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,387
No, that was in the past.

731
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:19,685
Now I understand
why Ji-woo had to leave me.

732
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:26,066
No matter what happens,
I wouldn't lose her.

733
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,943
Then why can't you ask her?

734
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:30,237
I'm worried

735
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:34,157
what Ji-woo thinks about me.

736
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:40,706
What if she thinks that I'm making a move
now that she's divorced?

737
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:44,334
I'm afraid
that she might have low self-esteem.

738
01:06:44,418 --> 01:06:46,169
Jesus, come on.

739
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:51,299
You're the type who can't make soy sauce
because you're scared of maggots, idiot.

740
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:53,218
How come you never change?

741
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,638
You look like
you've been gossiping about me.

742
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:57,806
It was about him.

743
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,516
To my face.

744
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,644
Hey, time to go home now.
Dong-won needs to go to bed. Go now.

745
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,148
Let's go.

746
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,401
Oh, right.

747
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,864
Here.

748
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:15,741
What's this?

749
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,909
A gift for starting your job.

750
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,328
Who wraps a gift like this?

751
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,788
What's inside is what matters.

752
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:29,504
Wow…

753
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:31,381
You seemed to like walking barefoot.

754
01:07:31,465 --> 01:07:34,801
These are to stimulate pressure points.
My general manager wears the same pair.

755
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:38,263
Hey, forget it.

756
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:39,389
You wear them.

757
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,057
They're the best for circulation.

758
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,810
You can't expect
a fashion company director to wear these.

759
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:46,021
Keep them under your desk and wear them.

760
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:49,900
Put them on when you're alone.
It'll get rid of your back pain.

761
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:51,193
Do you sell these?

762
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:52,819
Oh, there you go again.

763
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:59,284
Is this really the only gift
you could get for me on Earth?

764
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,495
From the bottom of your heart?

765
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:05,749
You think the design sucks?
You want me to draw something?

766
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:07,918
Forget it.

767
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,442
There should be no traffic
on the Yeongdongdaegyo Bridge, right?

768
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,952
The traffic is probably gone.

769
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:43,703
Right.

770
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:56,049
Still, thanks. I'll wear them.

771
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:00,303
Well,

772
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,934
it'll be painful when you first wear them.
But if you keep wearing them…

773
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:11,147
it'll get rid of the headache and…

774
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:12,607
And the back pain.

775
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,901
Yes, that one. Yeah.

776
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:15,944
Yeah.

777
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,908
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye.

778
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:23,535
Bye.

779
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:31,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

780
01:09:47,726 --> 01:09:49,519
- Did you call the taxi?
- I…

781
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,356
I should.

782
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,363
Want me to drop you off
at the subway station?

783
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:08,288
Well… Sure.

784
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:19,591
Okay.

785
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:22,636
Bye.

786
01:10:25,347 --> 01:10:27,098
Don't cross the Yeongdongdaegyo Bridge.

787
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,269
Stay in Gangbuk today.

788
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:51,581
SURELY TOMORROW

789
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:02,175
"APRIL BRIDE"

790
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:07,639
JARIM APPAREL SEO JI-WOO
GETS MARRIED

791
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,381
"Only if…

792
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,845
one could entreat Elder Wolha…

793
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:51,307
that we be born…

794
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,603
with fates exchanged in the next life,

795
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,860
over a thousand <i>ri </i>away, I will die…

796
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,990

797
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,168
"Then… you shall know the depth…

798
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:24,883
of…

799
01:12:28,887 --> 01:12:30,722
of my sorrow."

800
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:27,654
"My second proposal to you!"

801
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:31,825
<i>What's this bullshit, a second proposal?</i>
<i>What does he take Ji-woo for?</i>

802
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:32,742
Damn it.

803
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,036
<i>Sell the company?</i>

804
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:40,333
<i>I'm worried</i>
<i>if Ji-woo could put up with all this.</i>

805
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,628
I'm happy
that you're not going to Chicago.

806
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:48,091
You're taking it personally
because she's your ex.

807
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,008
My current girlfriend.

808
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,636
<i>There's something</i>
<i>you need to know, Ji-woo.</i>

809
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:54,055
<i>Kyeong-do has always had</i>
<i>the highest priority.</i>

810
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:58,935
<i>Ji-woo, I'll find you a world</i>
<i>that you'll like.</i>
