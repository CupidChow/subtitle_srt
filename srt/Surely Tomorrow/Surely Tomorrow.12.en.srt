1
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,452
Mother, you can just keep working.

2
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,997
I'll just stay here quietly and leave.

3
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,541
Aren't you busy at work?

4
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,126
I am. I'm going to Paris
the day after tomorrow.

5
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,754
You'll have to pack your stuff.

6
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,049
Are you telling me to leave? Now?

7
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,300
No.

8
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,011
That's not what I meant.

9
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:21,058
I mean... But it's okay
to visit a friend's place.

10
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,142
Of course.

11
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:23,602
- Why wouldn't it be?
- You're the best.

12
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:32,027
If I can't even come here,
I'll suffocate to death.

13
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,532
This is messed up.

14
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,285
People just don't leave you alone.

15
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,877
Did you eat?

16
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,254
Want me to order in?

17
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,507
I'm suddenly feeling hungry.
I'm craving tangsuyuk.

18
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,260
What stops me from getting you
palbochae and yangjangpi?

19
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:57,845
Hon…

20
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,930
One large tangsuyuk, please.

21
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:04,143
It's Somang Laundromat.
Yangjangpi and palbochae too.

22
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,936
Do you want jjamppong?

23
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,271
I love it.

24
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,482
Two jjamppong. Hurry up, please.

25
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,987
Ji-woo.

26
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,405
Yes.

27
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,951
I learned only now.

28
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,913
It's all thanks to you.

29
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:33,172
Thank you.
I'm sure it wasn't easy to do that.

30
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,549
I really appreciate it.

31
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,312
I'll come again.

32
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,359
When I come back, get me creamy shrimp.

33
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,236
Sure, let's do that.

34
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,453
CORRECTIONAL CENTER

35
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,914
Like you said,

36
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,750
when I mentioned Didroxin,
Kang Min-woo came right away.

37
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,588
Dr. Kim at Bright Plastic Surgery...

38
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,800
The doctor who got me the drug.

39
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:23,222
I heard him talking to Kang Min-woo
on the phone.

40
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:24,890
JARIM KANG MIN-WOO

41
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:32,856
Min-woo, I heard you introduced him
to a lot of clinics.

42
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,943
Why are you asking him for drugs?
You should've told me.

43
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,653
What?

44
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,156
You're scaring me… Yes.

45
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,867
Okay, bye.

46
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,082
This fucker.

47
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,125
Why?

48
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,128
Kang Min-woo, that asshole.

49
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,257
I've been polite as he's my school senior,
and now he thinks I'm a doormat.

50
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,843
Kang Min-woo? Jin-eon's brother-in-law?

51
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,469
Gosh, he ruined the mood for drinking.

52
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,472
Why are you intimidated by him?

53
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,932
Do you owe him money?

54
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,225
You think it's funny?

55
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:14,273
You and Jin-eon should be careful.
This asshole seems to know something.

56
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,863
And what kind of drug is he after
that he's with a pharmaceutical salesman?

57
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,032
That's why.

58
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,662
I assumed the one who reported me
would be Kang Min-woo.

59
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,749
Do you know the salesman's name?

60
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,588
Why are you digging into Kang Min-woo?

61
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,881
I've read your articles.

62
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,050
Are you helping Seo Ji-woo?

63
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:43,927
Yes.

64
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,058
I bet Seo Ji-woo feels so supported.

65
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:53,187
If my suspicions are correct,
Kang Min-woo is committing a crime.

66
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,523
I'm not just helping Ji-woo.

67
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,527
I need evidence
for an investigation to begin.

68
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,032
That asshole said

69
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:10,746
I was a stupid bitch who did drugs
with a married man. Well, it's true,

70
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,957
but to hear that coming from him,
it pissed me off.

71
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,627
So I need to see that dick…

72
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,754
go down.

73
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,718
That salesman's name was Gu-han.
I don't know his last name.

74
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,888
And I'm not sure
if his company sells Didroxin.

75
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,765
I heard

76
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,644
Kang Min-woo got the drug
from a salesman named Gu-han.

77
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,606
That's all I know.

78
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,818
No one's getting me out.

79
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,989
Reporter Lee,

80
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,159
you need to smash
that Kang Min-woo bastard.

81
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,203
In here,

82
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,831
I'm getting no dopamine.

83
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,628
<i>The Wind of April.</i>

84
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,548
I like that movie.

85
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,219
When you were sweeping
international awards with that movie,

86
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,013
I was proud of you.

87
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:13,892
Thank you for your help.

88
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,204
All right, what we have to focus on
is Kang Min-woo's evil deeds.

89
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,582
Then what do we have to prove first?

90
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,628
It's time for our teamwork to shine.

91
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,672
This is serious.

92
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,258
I see his eyes have gone crazy.

93
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,676
You do? It motivates you, right?

94
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,136
What am I doing here?

95
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,095
Are you out?

96
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,347
No, I'm asking
what the Economics Team can do.

97
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,808
Once our article is ready,
you need to support it.

98
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,644
- With what?
- Lucas is coming to JARIM.

99
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,023
Focus on the value and symbolism
of an international luxury brand.

100
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,151
That JARIM Apparel will upgrade
Korea's fashion business.

101
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,570
You're good at it. It's your thing.

102
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:11,116
You're telling me to write
that Seo Ji-woo's done a great job.

103
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,118
So? You can't?

104
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,913
Jeez.
I'm a total pro with things like that.

105
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,875
That means
you have nothing to do right now.

106
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,210
Yeah. Wait, what?

107
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,795
Come dig into the clinics with me.

108
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,715
Is it too much by yourself?

109
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,092
There are places I can't get through
due to my youthful face.

110
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,263
Right. You'll have to go with her.

111
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:37,893
How come everyone in this team is…
What's your hiring criteria, Kyeong-do?

112
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,646
Different from you. Because I'm an ace.

113
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,482
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

114

126
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,068
Yeah, I'm on the skin care clinic street
you mentioned.

127
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,987
But there are so many.

128

KANG MIN-WOO'S SELLOUT SCENARIO - VER 2

141

[EXCLUSIVE] JARIM'S SELLOUT PLAN…
BY KANG MIN-WOO

142
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,926
You're still here?

143
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,263
I'm about to leave. But listen.

144
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,641
Why don't we add a few video screenshots?

145
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,725
What video?

146
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:09,104
I looked it up.
You know, when you went to JARIM.

147
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,691
When CEO Seo was showing symptoms,
someone filmed it.

148
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,735
With this, his evil deed
would stand out even more.

149
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,576
Wouldn't that make CEO Seo uncomfortable?

150
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,163
He did such a thing
to a completely normal person,

151
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,623
It'll deliver more effectively.

152
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,377
You are a real TJ.

153
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,589
- Should I send you the video?
- Sure.

154
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,636
A coffee at this hour
might upset your stomach.

155
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,183
Have this instead.
I've been having this like you.

156
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,685
When I need to focus, it wakes me up.

157
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,153
I feel refreshed already.

158
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:00,780
Here.

159
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,621

00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,716
You should go straight home.
It was a long flight.

164
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,219
Where do you live?
Should we drop him off first?

165
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,262
Yes.

166
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:09,224
No. It's okay. I'll go home
after reporting to the team manager.

167

00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,128
It's time for you to step up now.

177
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,922
Choose between an accomplice and a victim.

178
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,679
If I choose to be a victim,
do I need to give you anything?

179
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,765
The texts you had with Kang Min-woo.

180
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,729
"Didn't know about her condition
until the article."

181
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:40,357
"Thought the company sales
had already been agreed."

182
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:46,488
One more. "One of the conditions was
to keep it unofficial and low profile."

183
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:50,950
And don't mention the 30 billion won
that Kang Min-woo blew up.

184
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,012
All right. As of now, we begin
the search and seizure. Let's hurry up.

185
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:11,930
Yes, sir.

186
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:12,847
KANG MIN-WOO

187
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,683
Check under the desks and chairs.

188
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:19,062
<i>The prosecutor seized and searched</i>
<i>Kang Min-woo's office.</i>

189
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:23,775
<i>The whereabouts of Yoo, who prepared</i>
<i>CEO Seo Ji-yeon drink, are unknown.</i>

190
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,194
<i>The police</i>
<i>are currently searching for her.</i>

191
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,119
Choose.

192
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,580
Either get in this car
and go to the police

193
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,458
to confess everything to be on probation

194
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,213
or continue running away
and get caught and be imprisoned.

195
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,055
You i be sleeping in peace.

196
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,727
You finally got your revenge,
and JARIM's on a roll.

197
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,687
Your wish came true.

198
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:08,319
I hope Ro-a doesn't know any of this.

199
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,447
That's why I waited.

200
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,033
If you were a human being,
I thought you'd stop.

201
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,828
I waited.

202
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:21,166
How can I sleep at night
when I have a child?

203
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,602
There.

204
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,450
What on earth does he eat? My goodness.

205
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,661
Goodness.

206
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,935
Working in a company
is not an easy thing to do.

207
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:09,315
The work just never ends.

208
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,069
And why is the lunch hour so short?

209
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,281
I drink so much coffee
that my stomach hurts.

210
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,370
Should I get some misutgaru?
This is delicious, Mother.

211
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,539
But I should add less sugar.

212
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:27,667
Nowadays,
sugar-free, zero-sugar is the trend.

213
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,585
Right, Father?

214
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,171
Well, it's up to you.

215
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,093
Now, Lucas is here…

216
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:42,682
I told you about him before, right?
The famous designer, Lucas?

217
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:45,435
- Yes.
- The one from Spain.

218
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,936
Yes. Right.

219
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,649
I need to see if the designers
are settling down all right.

220
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,611
Because this is their first time
living in Korea,

221
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,239
I have to check everything
from what they eat to where they sleep…

222
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,749
What is Kyeong-do up to these days?

223
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:15,340
I don't know either. He's barely home.

224
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,442
He must be working overtime a lot.

225
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,987
But does an assistant manager
have to work overtime?

226
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,994
Do you think
he's taking vitamins at least?

227
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,834
Hello. Hi.

228
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,547
First… Department Manager Jin.

229
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,799
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

230
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:03,346
Dongwoon Daily and I have very close ties.

231
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:08,393
I happened to be in the area,
and I'd be too heartless to just pass by.

232
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,520
This is for you
to recharge vitamins and caffeine.

233
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,898
I thought you had to order these
in advance.

234
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,194
This is organic.

235
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,571
It includes no pesticides,
so you don't need to worry.

236
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:24,450
We appreciate you coming here
when you're busy…

237
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:27,829
Oh, sure, I'm busy. I have piles of work,

238
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:32,000
but I just happened to be in the area.
This is nothing for me.

239
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,960
Should I bring some sandwiches next time?

240
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,879
Wait, you need to say hi
to the Economics Team too.

241
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,632
I put in a lot of effort

242
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,552
into the supporting article.
I'm really disappointed.

243
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,724
I'm always like this.
Next time, I'll get one for everyone

244
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,727
from here all the way down the hall.

245
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,354
No need.

246
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,190
We're not as close as you think.
We only share the office.

247
00:21:58,234 --> 00:21:59,861
We have mouths too,
Department Manager Jin.

248
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,826
By the way…

249
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,412
Assistant Manager is out to gather news.

250
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:15,251
I guess the assistant manager
is busier nowadays.

251
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,463
We're busy too.

252
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,757
You're busy…

253
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,468
- Who says we're busy? We're not. Never.
- Some coffee…

254
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,136
- Yeah.
- Han-kyeong, I want coffee.

255
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:44,238
<i>Jeong-min's getting spicy braised chicken</i>
<i>from a famous spot. Want to join?</i>

256
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,240
<i>I'll make time.</i>

257
00:22:46,324 --> 00:22:48,451
SE-YEONG

258
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,629
Good boy.
Did you call Kyeong-do, Jeong-min?

259
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,964
I did. He's having a team dinner tonight.

260
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,758
What, you…

261
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,259
Why would you tell us now?

262
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,512
Since when did we need Kyeong-do
to gather?

263
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,930
That's not what I mean.

264
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,642
It tastes even better. But even if
he can't make it, we're still Chaos.

265
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:15,144
What are you talking about?
That's not what I mean.

266
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,855
You see…

267
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:24,695
I don't think we should spatter our saliva
in front of the chicken made by a master.

268
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:25,822
You're right.

269
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,618
I should've known better. Let's eat.

270
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,829
Okay, let's eat.

271
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:33,746
Enjoy.

272
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,332
How come you only understand
what Ji-woo says?

273
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,292
Dong-won, is it too spicy?

274
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:40,253
- Do you want me to rinse it?
- No.

275
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,712
- Hey.
- Dong-won,

276
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:45,550
you can eat spicy food, and you're here
even when Uncle Kyeong-do is not.

277
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:47,677
- You'll grow to be a good man.
- Yes!

278
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,805
All right.

279
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,557
Shut up and eat.

280
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,267
Just shut up and eat.

281
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,769
You're eating a lot.

282
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,771
Have the drumstick and go chirp chirp.

283
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,359
- Be careful. Okay?
- Yeah, bye.

284
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,529
- Bye. Look forward. The stairs.
- Bye.

285
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,447
- Get inside.
- Okay.

286
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,200
- Drive safe. Yeah. Bye.
- Bye!

287
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,910
I sent money to your account.

288
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,245
Money?

289
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:57,413
I've sent quite a lot.

290
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,708
It'll be enough for you
to live somewhere for a year.

291
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,376
Where would I go?

292
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,881
You were going to a university in Chicago,
then you couldn't. Go there.

293
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,259
It would've been nice
that the company covers the cost,

294
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,136
but it'd be meaningful if we send you too.

295
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,351
What? That's so out of the blue.

296
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,813
You kill time at work
when you have nothing to do.

297
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,024
Even when you're home, you don't eat well.

298
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,860
Do you call that a life?

299
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,028
I can take care of myself.

300
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,113
You didn't get any rest.

301
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:35,034
You took care of me, and helped us here
when we opened the laundromat.

302
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,079
And just when it was getting better…

303
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,581
We're giving you a vacation.

304
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:46,170
Take a year off,
and go somewhere nice you want to go.

305
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:49,548
Either study or just have fun.
Get some rest.

306
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,019
I'll think about it.

307
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:07,066
Besides, I have money. Why are you
giving me your hard-earned money?

308
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,526
Take it.

309
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,987
We're making money for you anyway.

310
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:15,783
Kyeong-do.

311
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,830
Are you able to carry on?

312
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:28,587
There are still videos
gossiping about you two.

313
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,466
You two aren't meeting
because you're scared of it.

314
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,886
Not being able to see each other
when you two are so close…

315
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:38,848
Are you okay with that?

316
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,728
Let me sleep well tonight.

317
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:47,773
Let me be your parent for once.

318
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,547
- I won't have it then.
- No, please have it.

319
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,466
Can't you read the room?

320
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,478
I was scared when you said
you wanted to see me here.

321
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,772
It's where you said
you wanted to quit before.

322
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,357
I was young back then.

323
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,654
Your mother and father are cool.

324
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,658
I'll accept your leave.

325
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,702
But promise me you'll return.

326
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,122
Thank you.

327
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,206
Jeez.

328
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,209
This is why I don't get in a relationship.

329
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,130
Even if it flops like mine,
it's still worth it.

330
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:38,050
That's why you should've dated me,
you idiot.

331
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,219
There you go again.

332
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,701
<i>Are you down for lunch?</i>
<i>I'll meet you near your company.</i>

333
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,289
What should I wear?

334
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,546
I'm taking time off from work.

335
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,924
Why? Are you sick?

336
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,554
No, I just want to take a break.

337
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,814
What are you going to do
with your time off?

338
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,401
My mom and dad gave me money.

339
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:41,155
They told me to go on vacation.
For about a year.

340
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,248
Where are you going?

341
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,966
I have a senior in Cuba.

342
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,137
I'm thinking about going there first.

343
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,063
That's far.

344
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,233
Yeah.

345
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,820
It's far.

346
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:29,954
Do you need money?

347
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,331
Aren't you short on budget?

348
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:54,061
Promise to tell me when you leave.

349
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,313
Promise…

350
00:30:58,566 --> 00:30:59,692
to tell me.

351
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,113
Okay.

352
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,757
Seriously, don't they have
anything else to do?

353
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,675
JARIM APPAREL SEO JI-WOO
GIMBAP WITH A FRIEND

354
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,802
Who can ever put up with that?

355
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,646
You can sleep on the plane.

356
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,522
Yes.

357
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,903
I was going to take off with your luggage.
But you checked your bag fast.

358
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,574
Exactly. In case you'd take revenge.

359
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,581
Make sure to eat well.

360
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,750
I'm worried about you.

361
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,295
I didn't cry.

362
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,341
I didn't when you said you were leaving.
I haven't cried since then.

363
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,056
Don't worry about me and have a safe trip.

364
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:58,852
Okay.

365
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:01,855
Bye.

366
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,483
Yeah. Bye.

367
00:33:09,113 --> 00:33:10,114
Go on.

368
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,513
Bye. Go on.

369
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,103
1 YEAR LATER

370
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:08,357
Bellinme S/S season is ready.

371
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,526
Thanks to Designer Lucas,

372
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:15,280
Bellinme will finally be on the gala show
runway early next year in Paris.

373
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:25,082
And the menswear brand MANZAAR
is improving steadily.

374
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,335
Like a child who almost ran away from home
has turned filial.

375
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:33,048
Next is our new SPA brand to be launched.

376
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,593
I'll have to fly to the head office
in Spain and check.

377
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,014
I believe the fabric quality is crucial
for a low-middle-priced brand.

378
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:43,642
Most people use dryers nowadays.

379
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,478
It's important to make clothes
that don't get damaged,

380
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:51,024
so we can start by choosing good fabric.

381
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:54,945
Next…

382
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,908
Lee Kyeong-do must have so much fun.

383
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:03,704
Once you leave home, it's tough.
How can he be having fun?

384
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,875
Where do you think he is now?

385
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,753
Last time, was it Hokkaido?

386
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,964
Up there in Japan.

387
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,592
See?

388
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:20,804
He's having fun traveling everywhere.
Mother, you shouldn't have let him go.

389
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,976
It's okay for Kyeong-do to have some fun.
He grew up without puberty crisis.

390
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,940
This is why it's always hard with in-laws.
They only pity their sons.

391
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,402
What are you talking about?

392
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,905
I wish we were in-laws.

393
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:43,493
Mother, you and I are pretty much
experiencing an in-law fling.

394
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,079
Right, Father?

395
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:50,834
If you're that curious and annoyed,
call him yourself.

396
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:52,002
Why are you asking me?

397
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:54,630
What's wrong about asking you?

398
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,590
Never stop complaining.

399
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,261
You see, I'm being patient.

400
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:04,222
I'd make an international call
a million times.

401
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:09,269
But I'm holding back,
so I wouldn't ruin Kyeong-do's effort.

402
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:12,105
What's he making an effort for?

403
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,361
I don't know.

404
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,699
You probably have a goal.

405
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,204
To rest or to have fun.

406
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,749
Or to study. Something like that.

407
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:40,926
Whenever I see you…

408
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,266
I just want to be happy.

409
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,858
What's that supposed to mean?

410
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,321
When I go home

411
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,992
after seeing you like this…

412
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,455
I hope to be able to say…

413
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,209
"I'm just glad."

414
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,960
Ta-da.

415
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,554
What are you doing?

416
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,557
My friend said I could try them on.

417
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,726
What's the point of trying that on?

418
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:13,810
It's a practice.

419
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,898
Why? Are you going to marry another woman?

420
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,274
What?

421
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:23,111
No, but it's not like
we're getting married now.

422
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:24,029
This is pretty.

423
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,414
Ta-da.

424
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:39,002
Let's take a picture.

425
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:41,922
What? Okay.

426
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:44,716
Hurry up.

427
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,844
Why are you smiling like that?

428
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:48,762
What?

429
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:53,642
Let's try again. One, two, three.

430
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,604
Ji-woo, you look so beautiful.

431
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,189
Let me.

432
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,732
Thanks. Thank you.

433
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,193
Okay, smile.

434
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:07,405
Ready. One, two, three.

435
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,615
One more?

436
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,577
Okay, smile.

437
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:15,831
<i>My phone showed this to me</i>
<i>as a souvenir of a few years back.</i>

438
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,335
Isn't it a good picture?

439
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:25,340
Should I put it somewhere here?
Or should I print more?

440
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,385
I'm this close
to take blood pressure meds.

441
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,887
If you put it here,
my blood pressure will rise.

442
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,348
It's proof that we had an in-laws fling.

443
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,850
I know you like it.

444
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,901
Whatever. I'm leaving that here.

445
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,406
Father, I'll see you later.

446
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,825
- You should stay for dinner.
- Should I?

447
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:55,412
What are you talking about?
We just had lunch. She has work to do.

448
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,831
I know you're happy to have me here.

449
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,458
- Bye.
- Bye.

450
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,376
I'll come again.

451
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,140
Still, she wore the wedding dress
with Kyeong-do first.

452
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,059
Show it to Kyeong-do.

453
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,562
What for? It'd only disturb him.

454
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,612
The show just ended.
Why are you working so hard?

455
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:31,281
Hey, I have a good feeling
about this play.

456
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,449
What about it?

457
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,201
The lines are easy to memorize,

458
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,661
and the movements are smooth.
How do I say it...

459
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:38,872
Anyway, it's different.

460
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,790
- Nice.
- It's nice.

461
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,083
- It's nice.
- It is.

462
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:49,883
Anyway, when is Kyeong-do coming back?

463
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:50,842
It's been a year.

464
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,510
Is he still wandering?

465
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,179
Kyeong-do did the right thing.

466
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,348
They shouldn't be
on the same latitude and longitude.

467
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,559
As if that could help him get over her,
seriously. Jeez.

468
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,271
- What if that idiot doesn't return?
- Should I go get him?

469
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,733
Yeah, you should go get him. Gosh.

470
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,987
Where do you think he is?

471
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,782
I miss him.

472
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,615
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

473
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,608
ECOLOGICAL LAUNDRY

474
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,417
Why did you want to see me?

475
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:58,131
Ro-a's school has a long break.
I'll be there for a while.

476
00:45:59,007 --> 00:46:01,426
You should come straight to New York
from Barcelona.

477
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,845
Ro-a says she misses her aunt.

478
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,015
Just go and enjoy mother-daughter time.

479
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,022
Here.

480
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:15,523
What's this?

481
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:19,444
You might need your dopamine recharged
before going faraway to work.

482
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,449
Let me see…

483
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,794
Seo Ji-yeon. You have a taste.

484
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:40,423
So let's have fun in New York
with your sister who has a taste.

485
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:47,931
I'll use this every day. I love it.
No way you picked this on your own.

486
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,309
- Who was it? Who? It wasn't you.
- I don't like you anymore.

487
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,685
Yeah, it was Secretary Cha.

488
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,365
Don't worry about me and have a safe trip.

489
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,035
Okay.

490
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,038
Bye.

491
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,084
Director Seo.

492
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:18,836
Did you arrive early?

493
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,547
I just got here.

494
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:21,839
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

495
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,683
BARCELONA

496
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,740
Hey, Ji-yeon. Is Ro-a having fun?

497
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:30,658
Nice.

498
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,412
The team manager and everyone
left already.

499
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,080
Yeah.

500
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:41,377
Well… I plan to stay here
for a few more days.

501
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,673
Me? I have so many places to go.

502
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:48,926
I plan to fly to England
and meet Daniel before I go.

503
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,014
I can have fun by myself.

504
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:57,477
Yes, sure. Say hi to Ro-a for me.

505
00:48:58,394 --> 00:49:00,021
Yeah, you too.

<i>and the lines were easy to memorize.</i>

525
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,228
<i>I was worried a bit</i>
<i>because the theater was old.</i>

526
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,690
<i>But then…</i>

527
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:25,609
<i>there was a fire.</i>

528
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:28,320
ROOM 5
CHA WOO-SIK

529
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,489
(CHIEF MOURNER) PARK SE-YEONG
(CHILD) CHA DONG-WON

530
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:34,952
<i>It would've been nice if I had gotten out</i>
<i>after the last audience did…</i>

531
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:38,998
<i>but the entrance collapsed.</i>

532
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,585
<i>So, Kyeong-do…</i>

533
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,630
<i>so I…</i>

534
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:50,217
<i>Kyeong-do.</i>

535
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:06,984
Kyeong-do.

536
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:09,820
Jeong-min.

537
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,820
Woo-sik…

538
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:36,448
Woo-sik…

539
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,118
How could this happen?

540
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,957
How?

541
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:48,836
Shit…

542
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:25,956
Have you been well?

543
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,002
So-so.

544
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,014
Is Dong-won sleeping?

545
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,098
Yes.

546
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,159
When our parents met before the wedding,

547
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:06,205
my dad kept apologizing.

548
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,123
It offended me.

549
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:13,212
I was probably upset
because I felt guilty.

550
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,715
You know how capricious I am.

551
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:23,931
No matter how much I think about it,

552
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,228
I don't have any memories
of hating Woo-sik.

553
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,900
He really did everything the way I wanted.

554
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:40,614
My dad was right.

555
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,534
I feel bad for him.

556
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:48,455
But you were good to him too.

557
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:49,998
Right.

558
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:53,710
Woo-sik didn't make a lot of money
from his acting jobs.

559
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,422
He was thankful
that you never nagged at him.

560
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,467
I thought about Woo-sik on my way here.

561
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:05,347
I'm glad he got
to perform Waiting for Godot.

562
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,309
Like a fool, I thought about that.

563
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,437
FOREVER FRIEND
LATE CHA WOO-SIK RESTS HERE FOREVER

564
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:18,921
Where are you staying these days?

565
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:29,932
I actually went to Málaga.

566
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,853
After a business trip to Barcelona.

567
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,981
The flea market was still there.

568
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,402
Ji-woo.

569
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,451
Those times
when you left far away from me...

570
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,497
I thought a lot...

571
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:59,169
about how much it must've been painful
to you during those times.

572
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:10,847
When you were left here,
your days must've been hollow.

573
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,102
That's what I thought too.

574
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,319
Are you going back?

575
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,492
Well, I left in a rush.

576
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:36,456
When?

577
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,836
After I take my dad to the hospital
for his medical checkup,

578
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:43,130
I'm leaving.

579
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:49,678
Right. You should leave.

580
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:41,248
<i>I keep thinking if I'm a kind man.</i>

581
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:56,388
<i>Some wise man said</i>
<i>that one's kindness eventually pays off.</i>

582
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,897
Mother, what time is Kyeong-do's flight?

583
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:07,065
What?

584
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,280
You should've called earlier.

585
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,533
Don't talk. Focus on driving.
If I miss him, it's your fault.

586
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:18,994
What if you catch him?
Will you make him stay this time?

587
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:21,580
Say it right now.
Just live together already!

588
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:22,956
Drive faster!

589
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,124
Damn it.

590
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:32,090
<i>If you have memories</i>
<i>of me being kind, and…</i>

591
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:37,179
<i>if life sends you to me for one last time…</i>

592
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,351
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

593
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:45,896
Lee Kyeong-do!

594
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:52,986
Kyeong-do.

595
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,579
Don't go.

596
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,625
I…

597
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,794
I don't mind.

598
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,255
I don't mind at all. I...

599
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:14,800
I'm fine with the adulteress stigma.

600
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:18,887
It doesn't upset me at all.

601
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,766
But living without you upsets me the most.

602
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:30,774
You're the only one I like.

603
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:36,363
As long as I have you, I don't mind
the slimy sink in Yeonnam-dong.

604
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:41,326
Just... Just one thing.

605
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:43,453
You.

606
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:46,873
You're the only one I like.

607
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:04,808
It's heavy.

608
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:07,519
No.

609
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:10,355
You can't go.

610
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,391
Let's go.

611
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:50,645
Let's go home.

612
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:53,732
Let's go…

613
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,821
and live together.

614
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:32,604
<i>In the end,</i>

615
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:35,065
<i>I surrender...</i>

616
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,234
<i>to our time.</i>

617
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,414
You and I probably have healthy livers,
right?

618
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:33,581
I guess so?

619
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:38,294
We don't drink. We don't smoke.

620
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,380
We must be in excellent shape.

621
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:46,428
I had a medical checkup. I'm no joke.
They say I'm like in my 20s.

622
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,060
People can be very cunning.

623
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:04,612
This coffee smells nice.

624
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,992
I thought I wouldn't need anything
as long as I had you.

625
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,411
And that is still true, but…

626
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:17,042
The thing about greed is…

627
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:20,420
Look, Lee Kyeong-do.

628
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,089
We're in our best shape.

629
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,216
Yeah.

630
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,135
Then what should we do?

631
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:36,102
Uh, exercise?

632
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:41,691
We should have a baby.

633
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,193
What?

634
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:46,279
Let's have a baby
who looks like you and me.

635
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,866
I'm already of advanced maternal age.
We need to rush.

636
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:53,411
Hey, Ji-woo.
We need to discuss in depth and plan--

637
01:12:53,495 --> 01:12:55,246
Are you scared that they'd take after me?

638
01:12:57,624 --> 01:12:58,666
That too.

639
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:02,754
Let's go.

640
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:03,880
Go where?

641
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:07,550
I said, we don't have much time.
Let's have a baby.

642
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:10,637
- Where to?
- Your house.

643
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,306
That place has good energy. Let's go.

644
01:13:14,933 --> 01:13:17,227
Hey, wait. But it's broad daylight.

645
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:19,229
Seriously. Stop complaining and follow me.

646
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:22,941
No. Wait, this is baffling.

647
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:28,196
Come on. This is all a natural process.
We should get it started.

648
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:30,490
What? Start what?

649
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:35,620
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING <i>SURELY TOMORROW.</i>
