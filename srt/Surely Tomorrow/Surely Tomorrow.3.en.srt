00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:44,962
SURELY TOMORROW

2
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,471
-You're a journalist for Dongwoon Daily?
-Yes.

3
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,515
-Do you really know each other?
-Yes.

4
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,394
Ms. Seo Ji-woo, are you sure you know him?

5
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:04,397
Not sure. Maybe?

6
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,192
"Maybe?"

7
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,446
One second. Fine.

8
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:12,823
Here, look at this.

9
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,033
JARIM APPAREL
SEO JI-WOO

10
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:15,701
We do know each other.

11
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,661
Then why take her luggage...

12
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,913
That's what I mean.

13
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,335
I had something to say to her,
but she avoided me.

14
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,545
Something important.

15
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:28,088
I don't have anything to say.

16
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:29,799
Hey.

17
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,175
What?

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,142
What is it that you have to say?

19
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,229
Is running away your specialty?

20
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,525
What I'm saying is…

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,238
Is this the right time
to run away to England?

22
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,032
Why do you care?

23
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:00,412
Whether I slack off here
or on the London Bridge in England,

24
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:01,664
it's up to me.

25
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,376
I'm saying that's a very selfish mindset.
Get it? Here's an example.

26
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,214
Your sister and her company, you know?
It's hard to run it.

27
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,676
Yet you're going around wasting money?
Why not stay and learn something?

28
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,594
You're being so damn nosy.

29
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:23,978
Anyway, I have to go back to work.

30
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,062
Let's talk again later.

31
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,565
-Are you serious?
-I am.

32
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,567
What about the flight I missed
because of you?

33
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,322
That's--

34
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:38,909
7.2 million won, first class.
How are you going to make up for that?

35
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,494
Why the first class?

36
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:41,620
-Pay me.
-Me?

37
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,247
Yes, you. You held me back.

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,461
I put my house on the market
and got rid of everything.

39
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:53,215
I hate to go back there,
so I'm staying at your place.

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,136
My place? Why? Just go to a hotel.

41
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,848
Oh, are you paying for the hotel as well?
I'm getting a suite.

42
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,810
If you just go back to your--

43
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:08,355
Shut up. It's either the ticket price
or the door code to your house.

44
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,278
Your account number.

45
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,325
Nuri Bank. 345864830.

46
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,202
-Too fast. Say that again.
-345864830.

47
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,457
Sent. Bye. We're not done talking yet.

48
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,254
NURI BANK
WIRE TRANSFER

49
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,798
1,121 won?

50
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,554
Never seen such a number in my account.
What the hell? What a lunatic…

51
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,847
You wanted the code.

52
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,142
Oh, the door code.

53
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:56,946
SURELY TOMORROW

54
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,447
EPISODE 3

55
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:05,245
Yes, well, Ji-woo's in my house.
Somehow it happened.

56
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,873
You should pick her up and…

57
00:04:07,957 --> 00:04:08,916
What?

58
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,043
If I step in, it'll all be ruined.

59
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,796
It will look like I'm snooping around her.

60
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:18,759
And if I tell her that
I asked you to help, it'll only get worse.

61
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,639
It is what it is.

62
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,768
Oh, I have a meeting to attend now. Bye.

63
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,858
These women…

64
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:37,987
Is this a setup?

65
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,116
I couldn't even check in, Se-yeong.

66
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,493
What? Kyeong-do showed up at the airport?

67
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,996
Kyeong-do? Put it on speaker. The speaker.

68
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,707
-Oh, wait. Ouch, that hurts.
-Gosh! Be careful!

69
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:51,750
He stopped me from leaving.

70
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,961
Next in line.

71
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,343
Don't go, Ji-woo.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,221
But we're no longer together.

73
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,098
I can't let you go like this.

74
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,226
Kyeong-do.

75
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:13,897
Come with me.

76
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,573
So where are you now?

77
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,659
Me? I'm at Kyeong-do's place.

78
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,327
Kyeong-do's place?

79
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,997
-She's at Kyeong-do's place.
-But why?

80
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:33,584
Oh, I don't know.
He told me to wait for him at his house.

81
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,254
He said he didn't want to leave me alone
in my house or whatever.

82
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,928
You should go back to work.

83
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,100
Where will you be?

84
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:55,022
I'll be home and lonely…

85
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,404
One, one, two, one.

86
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,491
You and me, the two of us,
become one again.

87
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,744
That's the door code to my place.

88
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:13,207
You being lonely in that house again?
I can't bear to see it.

89
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,001
Please go to my place.

90
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,254
Okay.

91
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,972
SEO JI-WOO

92
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,850
A green light?

93
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,686
Jeez, Kyeong… Gosh. Kyeong…

94
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,688
Kyeong-do is such a romantic, huh?

95
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:40,067
So romantic. I think he learned that
from me. Hey, hold on.

96
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,110
Oh, my gosh!

97
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:51,829
Hey, Woo-sik.

98
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,707
I heard you made a scene at the airport
to stop Seo Ji-woo today, you goof!

99
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:02,131
Me? At the airport? What?

100
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,718
Huh? What?

101
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:12,432
Oh, Woo-sik. I'm hanging up.
I feel like puking. Bye.

102
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,857
Why would she change the story like that?
Is she out of her mind?

103
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,322
This is so stressful, jeez.

104
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,830
Hey, were you going to England
to study Shakespeare?

105
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,373
Why did you change the story…

106
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,131
What? Study sex in England?

107
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,759
Are you nuts?
Did you drink all that by yourself…

108
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:48,677
Do you want one?

109
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,595
Hey.

110
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:53,223
Hey. Get up now.

111
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,476
This isn't a bar. What are you doing?

112
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,605
Go to your house.
I'll send you 7.2 million, so go now.

113
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,903
Hey, by the way…

114
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:11,700
This stinks. It smells...

115
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:13,702
weird.

116
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,120
Take it off.

117
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,164
Why are you telling me to strip?

118
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,794
You're hopeless. Let's go now. Get up.

119
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,547
I'm not going anywhere! You stopped me.

120
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,801
-Why don't you join me?
-No, I don't want to.

121
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,721
What? Why are you raising your voice?

122
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,015
Are you worked up, Kyeong-do?

123
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,393
Jeez. Get a grip, will you?

124
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,026
I did.

125
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,279
So, let's talk.

126
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,033
Why did you come to stop me?

127
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:59,039
When you heard that I was leaving,
did you feel…

128
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,501
feel... like...

129
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,795
Were you sad? Is that it?

130
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,424
We'll talk when you're sober.

131
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,759
Get changed first.

132
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:14,012
Gosh, you keep telling me to…
Fine, I'll take it off.

133
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,640
Hey, come on.
I didn't tell you to get changed here.

134
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,225
Why are you like this?

135
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,018
Huh? What…

136
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:25,315
Hey, wait.
Hey, what are you doing? Hold on.

137
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,610
Oh, my Kyeong-do, you pookie.

138
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:33,532
You're still so handsome,
aren't you? Right?

139
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,745
Hey, stop…

140
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,301
SPRING 2007

141
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,894
Take the rooms today instead of the hall.
All rooms are full.

142
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,271
Oh, okay.

143
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,449
That's funny.

144
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,132
Ji-woo, are you okay?

145
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,387
Oh, no.

146
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,017
Ji-woo, when are you going back
to the States?

147
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,102
When your semester begins?

148
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,146
She's going back soon.

149
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:09,331
You seem to be losing weight.
Ji-woo, are you on a diet?

150
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:16,213
She eats well and sleeps well,
but she's not gaining any weight.

151
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,631
Oh, no.

152
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,968
You won't be back for a while.
Let me get you some oriental medicine.

153
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,939
Sir, would you like to try the wine first?

154
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,233
No need to try. I'll just take it.

155
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,251
Ji-woo, let's go to the restroom.

156
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,629
Excuse us. We're going to the restroom.

157
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:07,514
Is this where you work on the weekends?

158
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:09,933
Yes.

159
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,230
Are you having a family dinner?

160
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,482
Yes.

161
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:28,076
Oh, then is your school…

162
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,169
Who's this?

163
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,298
Oh, hello.

164
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,008
Ji-woo's friend?

165
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,759
Oh, yes.

166
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,638
Since when? I don't recognize--

167
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:49,931
Mom, Kyeong-do is my--

168
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:53,226
Oh, one of my friends is her friend, so…

169
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,396
We've only said hi.

170
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,864
Ma'am, is there something you need?

171
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,327
Will you change the server in charge?

172
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,703
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:16,166
It'll be uncomfortable
when we're here to enjoy dinner.

174
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:21,671
A mere part-timer in a VIP room?
It doesn't sound right, does it?

175
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,387
Well... have a great evening.

176
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:31,723
Oh, this way...

177
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,565
Ji-woo, let's go.

178
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,859
Everyone is waiting.

179
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,063
You know the chairman's daughter?

180
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,149
-The chairman?
-JARIM Apparel.

181
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,943
The head office of Indiago.

182
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,280
Didn't you know about your friend?

183
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,057
WRITE A MESSAGE
HEY, KYEONG-DO...

184
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:28,983
Did you eat yet?

185
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,079
Let's go eat.

186
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,422
Come on. Let's grab something to eat.

187
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,765
I'm sorry, Kyeong-do.

188
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,148
Ji-woo.

189
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:18,283
Your feelings for me are real, right?

190
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,088
Why are you bringing that back?

191
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,257
I mean, it upsets me
when I think about it.

192
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,217
What does?

193
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,762
That I'm delivering my son
his dress shirts at this age.

194
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,389
Tell him to get them himself.

195
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,975
Had an argument with Deacon Lee?

196
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,001
Why did you get changed?
Embarrassed now that you're sober?

197
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:39,841
Get me one too.

198
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,250
-Do you even remember?
-Yes.

199
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,211
Think about why you
did something you'd regret.

200
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,588
It's all alcohol.

201
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,882
I wouldn't jump at anyone
just because I'm drunk.

202
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:24,552
I'm glad to hear that I'm not just anyone.

203
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,310
Was it romantic?

204
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,437
You carried me to the bed.

205
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,106
-I threw you.
-Bullshit. I said I remember everything.

206
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,821
Why did you stop me?

207
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,575
You know Ji-woo.

208
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,788
She's full of energy.
But what makes me sad

209
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,999
is that all that energy
is making her depressed.

210
00:22:56,209 --> 00:23:00,880
It was hard for Ji-woo to get divorced
because of her depression and alcoholism.

211
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:06,385
But if she finds out about this,
that I'm going blank due to Alzheimer's…

212
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,596
Then Ji-woo will probably…

213
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,391
This is frustrating.

214
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:17,772
Ji-woo must not know that I'm sick.

215
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,571
Here's what I think.

216
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:29,826
This is your chance
to redefine your identity before 40.

217
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,953
But you tried to run away again.

218
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,996
Like you did when you were 20 and 28.

219
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,167
New York or England, I wouldn't stop you
if you had a purpose.

220
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,377
What will you do in England?

221
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,129
Did you stop me to lecture me?

222
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:45,800
Look at all those cans you drank.
Just enough to die in England.

223
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,553
Even if you go,
you need to get a grip first.

224
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,847
Is that why you came running
to the airport?

225
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,973
I'm worried.

226
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,182
Is it love?

227
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,195
Do you want the car key?
Or do you want to call a taxi?

228
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,739
-Go home first and--
-No.

229
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,994
I'm going to leave anyway,
so why will I go back to that house?

230
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,371
It's a pain in the ass
to reset everything. No.

231
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,250
Did you listen to anything I said?
Going to England is not the point.

232
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,295
Did you stop me just to be a jerk?

233
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:25,089
I don't believe you. It was your feelings.

234
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,091
You didn't have a plan,
but you'd stop me anyway.

235
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,845
Your developing frontal lobe
brought those feelings back to you.

236
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,680
Is it too hard to understand?

237
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:36,184
Your nonsense isn't hard to understand,
it's just ridiculous.

238
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:37,560
Come home early. I'm bored.

239
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,772
I clock off sharp on time,
so get it together and go home.

240
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,775
We'll talk later.
You need to change the way you think.

241
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:55,828
Did you meet Aaron?

242
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,246
Briefly in Beijing.

243
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,123
The price is too low.

244
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:01,500
It's not my company,
but it'd leave us nothing.

245
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,503
-I think he's getting China involved.
-China?

246
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:08,549
It's an IT company.

247
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:12,303
They're interested in an apparel company
as big as JARIM.

248
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,222
Besides, Min-woo,

249
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:18,059
the price isn't what matters right now.
What matters is the time.

250
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,145
If this goes wrong,
both you and I are doomed.

251
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:24,148
You made me spend 30 billion won
to make a paper company.

252
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,609
Don't make me regret it.

253
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,323
We got rid of your brother-in-law,
that Cho Jin-eon guy.

254
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,783
When is it for your wife?

255
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,952
Soon. It won't be long.

256
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,457
One year maximum?

257
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,127
How long do you think
Seo Ji-yeon can hide it?

258
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,922
She's literally going,
"Where am I? Who am I?"

259
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,884
As soon as the news got out, it's done.
Just keep Aaron.

260
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,013
He's coming to Korea next month.
Let's meet him quietly.

261
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:00,935
What the heck?

262
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:04,146
What do you want for lunch?

263
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,856
The same place?

264
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,608
Sounds good to me.

265
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,616
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

266
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:23,499
You can only live in peace if you pick up.
Kang Min-woo.

267
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,380
They're in talks with a guy named Aaron.

268
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,590
A specialist
in buying and selling companies.

269
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:35,803
Bae Jun-soo said that a Chinese IT company
is interested in JARIM.

270
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,056
Does he meet up with Bae Jun-soo often?

271
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,851
No, maybe once a month?

272
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,978
They met at the tennis court today.

273
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,773
Okay. Thank you for your work.

274
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:57,658
You're excited because I'm sick.

275
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,507
Maybe she…

276
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:02,723
What?

277
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,253
Lee Kyeong-do, are you home?

278
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:34,880
What the heck?

279
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:43,973
Shoot.

280
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,437
I'm waiting for jokbal.
Don't get worked up, just wait.

281
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,024
I should just…

282
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,569
While getting jokbal,
you should've gotten makgeolli, too.

283
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,738
-Drink soda instead.
-Too much sugar.

284
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,574
Water. Drink water then.

285
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:06,287
Hey, still,
doesn't having someone at home feel…

286
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,205
Should I say, warm? You know?

287
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,540
No, I don't.

288
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:12,501
It's better than empty. You heard me
taking a shower, and you got jokbal.

289
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:16,088
What? What does you taking a shower
have to do with the jokbal?

290
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,843
Being a journalist made you a dick.
Nitpicking much?

291
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,554
You've been so idle
that you've lost all sense of reality.

292
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,222
You see the world like a child.

293
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:28,893
Bullshit. And you're so grown up
that you have jokbal with a child?

294
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,896
Whatever. Just eat your jokbal.

295
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:34,440
Where are you going again?

296
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,525
You're not going to your house.

297
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:37,693
I told you I can't.

298
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,863
So make yourself at home.
Imagine this is your house.

299
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:44,950
I'll waste my money at the sauna
and sleep uncomfortably.

300
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:48,287
Okay. But get changed every morning
before going to work.

301
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,580
We stink at that age.

302
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:52,750
That musty smell on a rainy day,
you know what I mean?

303
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,711
The musty smell? That's my favorite.

304
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,971
You said it was a lease.
You break, you fix. That's the law.

305
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,765
My landlord is cooperative.

306
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,684
Because someone died here,
he provides first-class service.

307
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:13,145
You like first class. Hope you enjoy.

308
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:23,072
That's scary. I'm scared of ghosts.

309
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,039
Shit. Lee Kyeong-do, that asshole.

310
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:39,380
If there are ghosts…

311
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,093
I'll stop them with alcohol.

312
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,348
SIKHYE

313
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,772
DONGWOON DAILY

314
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,232
Let's see…

315
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,990
Gosh.

316
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,706
Jeez.

317
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,046
I worked so hard to get a lease,
Seo Ji-woo took it over.

318
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,092
The well-off are worse.

319
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:35,144
Shit.

320
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:43,110
Still not coming?
Is he acting up, or being shy?

321
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,445
(FOR MEN)

322
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,949
Leave a text when you move out.

323
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,913
There are bugs in the food waste.
Better come home before they lay eggs.

324
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,585
The food waste card
is in the left sink drawer.

325
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,129
Clean up after you eat.

326
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,256
If the bugs lay eggs, stir-fry them.

327
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,135
So you're not coming home until I leave?
Are you serious?

328
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,554
By now, you're basically trespassing.

329
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,431
You're the one
who stopped me from leaving.

330
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,808
You're old enough to understand me now.

331
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:17,102
Seo Ji-woo, the trespasser.

332
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:20,272
Who's available on Thursday, the 16th,
at 1:00 p.m.?

333
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,777
I'll go.

334
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,613
But you're not available.

335
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,530
I'm not?

336
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,575
Check your schedule. Jeez.

337
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:32,493
Sorry.

338
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,663
Frozen shoulder, Kyeong-do?

339
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,207
It's andropause.

340
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,001
You should go, Assistant Manager Lee.

341
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,003
Damn it.

342
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:45,881
He's changed.

343
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,928
He's not innocent anymore.

344
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,986
JARIM Apparel?

345
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,073
That clothing company? That humongous one?

346
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,575
Why does that matter?
Hey, she doesn't go to this school.

347
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,453
Our club's identity relies on this matter!

348
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:17,371
Still, the club…

349
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,749
Ji-woo… Well, she missed the timing.

350
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,044
She wasn't trying to fool us or…
Wait, you're getting too close.

351
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:26,922
-You asshole...
-That means she's a semi-chaebol!

352
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,382
You sure spent money well.

353
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,176
You capitalist, money-crazed jerk.
That's not the point!

354
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,094
She has money, so--

355
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,303
Oh, shut up!

356
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:34,638
Shut up, you asshole.

357
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,015
I'm sorry.

358
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,812
Are we that cool?

359
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,648
Did you hide it to hang out with us?

360
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,650
What?

361
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,529
-She's kind of… yeah.
-Yes, yeah.

362
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,742
Then there's something we need to clarify.

363
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,662
You! That car.

364
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,789
You said it was your friend's.
Is it yours?

365
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,877
-Yes.
-You even have a car?

366
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,088
Hey, my father sells cars,
but I still don't have one--

367
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,050
Are you a good driver?

368
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,887
Well, no accident yet…

369
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:19,475
We should have a workshop
for our play, right?

370
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,563
What? Out of nowhere?
Did you say a workshop?

371
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,356
Why not? Isn't it perfect?

372
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,820
The workshop…

373
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:34,614
begins now.

374
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,202
Now? We're going now?

375
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,123
-Hey, a workshop!
-Are we going now?

376
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:46,460
Hey, wait…

377
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,932
Oh, I love it so much.

378
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,726
Jeong-min, can you do better
so I can feel the wind?

379
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:05,938
-This car is awesome!
-Ji-woo, can I borrow this for a week?

380
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,906
Do you want to sit in the trunk?

381
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,413
Nice. Let's go, let's go!

382
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:36,426
You deserve it, you idiot. Come here!

383
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,431
Chaos!

384
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:46,436
One, two, three, go!

385
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,108
One more time?

386
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,568
Wait.

387
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,168
I'm so happy.

388
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,129
One, two, three.

389
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:18,594
You're pushing me.

390
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,134
Ji-woo.

391
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,055
Do you want to go outside?

392
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:22,991
Oh… This is nice.

393
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,913
I love the sound of the waves.

394
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,211
It was a good idea to come.

395
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,505
I had so much fun today.

396
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,914
Ji-woo!

397
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,845
What are you doing here by yourself?
There's no one around.

398
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:07,888
Weren't you scared?

399
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,514
Search.

400
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,183
What?

401
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,978
I mean, there could be
a 500-won coin in here.

402
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,229
A 500-won coin?

403
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,357
Oh, hurry up and dig already.

404
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,987
What? A 500 won out of nowhere?

405
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,865
Hey, there's something my mom always says.

406
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:31,578
"Digging won't give you any coin."
That means you'll find no single coin.

407
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:36,583
Still, give it a try. You might find it.

408
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,376
I'll only get sand under my nails.

409
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:40,629
Well, how? Like this?

410
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,797
-Yes.
-Like this?

411
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,298
-Yes.
-Like this?

412
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:49,179
There's nothing… What's in here… Wait.

413
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,016
You hid it on purpose.

414
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,020
Wait, don't you recognize what it is?

415
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,397
It's 500 won.

416
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,400
No, do you know what that 500 won means?

417
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,825
-A 500-won coin with a hole.
-No.

418
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,078
It's the 500 won you lost.

419
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,747
The one you were looking for
in front of the School of Humanities.

420
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,250
What? Oh, yeah, right.

421
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,585
You had it all along?

422
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:25,298
Yes. I'll give it back to you
since that brought you to me.

423
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,681
So you've been keeping it.

424
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,725
You had it this whole time.

425
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,894
This is amazing.

426
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:41,398
Make sure to keep it
for a long time. Promise.

427
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:43,775
Okay.

428
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:52,284
I'll take this.

429
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,994
Sure. I'll get you a new item.

430
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:54,911
Thank you.

431
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,721
This is my dad's company…
But you worked so hard to make that money.

432
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,056
But I promised you.

433
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,101
Besides, I think they make nice clothes.

434
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:21,688
If you're going to buy clothes anyway,
it's killing two birds with one stone.

435
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,152
Sure, thank you.

436
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,197
Hey, I love the color.

437
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,699
-Really?
-Yes.

438
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,117
Did you pick this?

439
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:35,118
Of course.

440
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,497
And here.

441
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:40,999
What's this?

442
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,129
Huh?

443
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:49,132
Press here.

444
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:00,143
Kyeong-do.

445
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:03,939
It's a gift.

446
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:08,985
Our time together that 500 won brought us.
Don't forget that.

447
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,241
This is so pretty.

448
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,327
It's really pretty. I love it.

449
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:18,870
I'm glad.

450
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,749
I promise to cherish it.

451
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,055
Assistant Manager Lee, are you okay?
You're getting weaker every day.

452
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,100
It feels like you're rotting.

453
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,434
Andropause, he said.

454
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:44,437
Hey, how about some gopchang with cola?

455
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,397
Wow.

456
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,852
Oh, well… Let's talk outside.

457
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,898
I locked the gas.

458
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:31,234
And I vacuumed the place.

459
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,657
I didn't do the laundry, though.

460
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:41,703
It'd be a waste of water and detergent
if I only washed that one shirt.

461
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,246
You care about Earth now?

462
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,207
Oh. I ran out of underwear,
so I took one of yours.

463
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,461
-And I hand-washed that.
-You should've just thrown it out.

464
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:54,257
It was bittersweet to live together.

465
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:58,511
Bye.

466
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:12,484
No questions, please.

467
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,028
Why did she vacuum your place?

468
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,863
Why did she wear your underwear?

469
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,366
"Bittersweet" what?

470
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,250
What exactly happened?

471
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,002
Where are you going, Kyeong-do?

472
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:32,629
What the hell happened?

473
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,630
Don't cry.

474
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,881
Where are you going?

475
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,348
Oh, I couldn't take out the recycling.

476
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,481
Wouldn't taking out the recycling
need much less effort than this?

477
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:58,988
That maniac. Jeez,
I knew she was a lunatic. Seriously.

478
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,951
Mom. You scared me.

479
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,452
What is all this?

480
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:08,331
I didn't drink them.

481
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:12,710
Then where did you get them?
Are you drinking again?

482
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,379
No.

483
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:18,967
No, right?

484
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:22,971
Did you take it for refunds?
Are you out of money?

485
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,558
Oh, it's my friend.

486
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:30,812
He drank so much
so I'm taking them out for him.

487
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,273
Your friend left without cleaning up?

488
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,486
I admit that this is suspicious,
but it wasn't me. It really wasn't.

489
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,450
I can never stand that twice. You know?

490
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,411
Doesn't the Bible
say something about doubt?

491
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,956
Besides, why'd you take this route
to the store?

492
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,833
To watch you, you brat!

493
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,256
Bye, Mom.
I didn't drink any of them. I swear.

494
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,779
Again. They're at a disadvantage again.

495
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:06,616
And now, here, before the ball goes
any further in, it's caught.

496
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:10,495
With the second base vacant,
the ball is passed…

497
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,748
Be careful on your way home.
And don't fight!

498
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,917
-Bye!
-Bye-bye.

499
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,130
NAMU ART ACADEMY

500
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:25,760
Jeez, if you were going to fight,
why did you even stay together?

501
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,263
He always starts it first.

502
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,515
Gosh, now that he's older,
he's so twisted.

503
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,399
So? Did you move out?

504
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,316
Yeah.

505
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,193
Are you going to England?

506
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,113
-Yeah.
-Why don't you just stay?

507
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,323
Do you want me to stay here too?

508
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:51,244
That'd be nice. Then I'll get to see
your pretty face every day.

509
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,419
Do you think
that's why Kyeong-do stopped me?

510
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,754
He wouldn't have stopped you
if he hated you.

511
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,881
He did nothing when I threw myself at him.

512
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,008
You threw yourself at him?

513
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:09,470
Well, I just gave it a try.
To see how he feels about me.

514
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:11,389
If he still…

515
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:16,269
I just pulled a prank.

516
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,763
There should be a thesis about you two.
You guys are weird.

517
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,724
What did you do at his place
when he wasn't even home?

518
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,684
Oh, I just drank.

519
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,437
It seems Kyeong-do doesn't drink anymore.

520
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:02,440
Or he stayed sober
so he wouldn't fall for me?

521
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,028
Kyeong-do doesn't drink.

522
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:09,656
Why not? Does he have a liver problem?

523
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,374
Ji-woo.

524
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,421
When you meet Kyeong-do again,
don't drink.

525
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:30,301
Kyeong-do…

526
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:33,763
Something happened?

527
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,311
He was treated for alcoholism
over a long time.

528
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:46,818
Hospitalized for quite a while.

529
00:49:50,947 --> 00:49:52,448
He almost got fired from work.

530
00:49:58,871 --> 00:49:59,997
When?

531
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,668
When did that happen?

532
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:10,675
Back then… when you left…

533
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,312
He endured it when he was 20.

534
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,691
But when you left for the second time,

535
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:29,360
he crumbled.

536
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:42,665
Ji-woo!

537
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:46,252
Ji-woo!

538
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,337
You aren't kind. You're just stupid.

539
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:31,881
When an idiot goes nuts, it's hopeless.

540
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,559
Are you drunk?

541
00:51:43,935 --> 00:51:45,353
Keep your damn head off me.

542
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,897
What? What is wrong with you?

543
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,983
Hey, Lee Kyeong-do.

544
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:55,154
Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol!
I wondered why you went on about it.

545
00:51:56,739 --> 00:52:00,451
What, alcoholism?
That only appears in movies.

546
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:02,578
Why… Why you?

547
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:08,543
You're making a fuss over nothing.

548
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:09,919
"Nothing"?

549
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:13,297
You were hospitalized,
and almost got fired. That's nothing?

550
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,757
What do you want me to do then?

551
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:23,474
It just happened.

552
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,479
I just drank,
and ended up doing it every day.

553
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,065
It happened before I knew it.

554
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:36,445
That's why I told you to stop drinking
in case you end up like me.

555
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,741
And it's all in the past.

556
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,202
There's no need to get upset.

557
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:47,874
Why did you drink?

558
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,876
I don't know. I don't even remember.

559
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,294
Why did you drink so much?

560
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,007
Why? What do you want me to say?

561
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:01,721
You drank because of me.

562
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:07,560
Jeez.

563
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:12,773
It wasn't because of anyone.
I just boozed up because I liked it.

564
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:19,989
You...

565
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:24,160
You never blame me even a little.
That pisses me off even more.

566
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,871
I was a bitch to you,
but you say you just liked it?

567
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,373
I drank because I was frustrated.
That's all!

568
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,252
I tried walking, and I tried running!

569
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:37,173
But nothing helped me understand!
So I drank, happy?

570
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,432
I just couldn't get it.

571
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,020
Why you left me like that.

572
00:53:53,606 --> 00:53:56,359
Back then and even now,
I just don't get it.

573
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:10,725
Hey.

574
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,022
If you were going to leave me…

575
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,818
if you were going to leave me like that…

576
00:55:23,154 --> 00:55:25,114
you shouldn't have come back!

577
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,995
You… you jerk.

578
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:44,675
Shit…

579
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:46,510
Seriously…

580
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,429
I'm getting dizzy.

581
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:35,267
I'm running out of energy
after hearing I'm a jerk.

582
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:42,441
Sorry about calling you a jerk.

583
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:46,987
Let's call it even.
I'm too tired to even fight back.

584
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,336
Oh, don't look at me like that.
It's frustrating.

585
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:08,092
How am I looking at you?

586
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,761
I don't know.
It's frustrating because I don't know.

587
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,471
I don't know what to do with that look.

588
00:57:15,975 --> 00:57:18,602
It's because I want both of us
to get a grip.

589
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:34,410
Was it tough? I mean, the treatment.

590
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:38,539
Was it tough?

591
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:45,546
Yes.

592
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:52,511
Just how much did you drink
to be hospitalized?

593
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:59,727
I'm telling you, if you drink like that,
there's no other way. So quit.

594
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,813
I will. So you should also…

595
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:03,814
Ji-woo.

596
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:12,198
When you think about it,
we didn't even date for a whole year.

597
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,329
But perhaps…

598
00:58:20,206 --> 00:58:22,041
Maybe I'm too soft.

599
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,715
I guess I couldn't let it go.

600
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,885
I couldn't move on.

601
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,558
It's all in the past.

602
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,646
So I'm embarrassed to get so angry.

603
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:53,989
Did you eat?

604
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,574
Yes.

605
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,497
-Let's go. I'll walk you to your car.
-It's fine.

606
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,752
Now you're finally getting a grip.

607
00:59:19,265 --> 00:59:20,724
You know what, Kyeong-do?

608
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:29,233
At the time, I was too…

609
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:38,242
I mean, it's not that I left you…

610
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:43,539
but I left to die.

611
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:49,670
But it was really frightening to die.

612
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,843
It felt like a dream

613
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,220
to see you at home

614
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,557
when I went home after work.

615
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:05,060
I'm sure you had your reasons.

616
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:08,314
But still,

617
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,567
you should've seen me before you left.

618
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,954
I have a favor to ask you.

619
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,418
Don't worry about me from now on.

620
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,838
Sorry about messing with you
in the last few days.

621
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,008
I think I finally pulled myself together.

622
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,055
It's no longer love.

623
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,599
And I'd be such a bitch
to call it a friendship.

624
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,561
So I just hope…

625
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:56,362
the best for you.

626
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,244
Bye.

627
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,702
It's no longer love.

628
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:48,455
And I'd be such a bitch
to call it a friendship.

629
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,752
Stop drinking and stop swearing,
you woman…

630
01:01:57,548 --> 01:01:58,715
Seo Ji-woo.

631
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:03,011
Good decision.

632
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,014
Start learning the ropes.

633
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,601
I booked the ticket again.
I'm leaving soon.

634
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:13,689
Do you have itchy feet or something?
Why do you keep going abroad?

635
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,152
If you made a fuss over your divorce,

636
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,487
you need to show your next step.

637
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,575
Is my next step finding my spot
in the company?

638
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,243
Don't you know the situation you're in?

639
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:34,209
I do. I know it very well.

640
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:42,050
I guess one can't play dumb
unless they have the energy.

641
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:44,511
Am I your insurance?

642
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:47,890
Do you even qualify to be my insurance?

643
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,396
No shares whatsoever.

644
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,067
Seo Ji-woo, the illegitimate child.

645
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:09,745
You…

646
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:14,666
Since when did you know?

647
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,090
When I was 28.

648
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,968
I'm not Dad's, but you had an--

649
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,094
Shut your mouth!

650
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:30,599
Have you been pretending this whole time?
How despicable.

651
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:31,642
Despicable?

652
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:36,605
This is crazy.

653
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:43,570
Mom, why do you think
Dad cherished me so much?

654
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:45,948
I must've been an eyesore to him.

655
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,952
It's probably because he pitied me.

656
01:03:51,245 --> 01:03:54,998
Because you disdained me like a bug,
he must've pitied the poor, innocent kid.

657
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,710
Let's talk again later.

658
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:01,338
No, I'm never going to see you again.

659
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:06,176
I'm not working at the company.
I'm not going to do that for you.

660
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:10,806
Dad's will that he'd give me the shares?
I don't care.

661
01:04:12,933 --> 01:04:15,435
You used to yell at me
not to come back to Korea.

662
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,105
And now you want me to work here
to get my shares?

663
01:04:20,983 --> 01:04:22,734
I'm not going to be your insurance.

664
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:27,948
Does...

665
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,368
Ji-yeon know?

666
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:39,376
Aren't you going to apologize to me?

667
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:41,920
How did you know?

668
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:43,380
Ji-yeon told me.

669
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:51,513
Are you afraid now?

670
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,142
Are you finally afraid?

671
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:41,855
SE-YEONG

672
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,695
-Yes, Se-yeong.
-Hey, Kyeong-do.

673
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:52,908
I thought Ji-woo was pretty shocked today,
so I came to her place to check on her.

674
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:55,619
And?

675
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:58,747
I hear the phone ringing inside,
but she won't open the door.

676
01:06:03,794 --> 01:06:07,255
Hey, Seo Ji-woo!

677
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,466
Ji-woo!

678
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,135
-Call the locksmith.
-Okay.

679
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,012
Ji-woo!

680
01:06:14,096 --> 01:06:14,971
Hello?

681
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:19,101
Hi, my door is locked.
Sir, can you come here as fast as you can?

682
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:23,772
Ji-woo!

683
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:35,325
Ji-woo!

684
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:37,828
Hey, Ji-woo, wake up, will you?

685
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:42,165
Ji-woo, wake up, please?

686
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:46,670
Ji-woo, come on. Seo Ji-woo!

687
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:51,633
SURELY TOMORROW

688
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,946
Honey, have you seen the watch I bought?

689
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,905
What watch?

690
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:15,741
The one I bought for you

691
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:18,034
when I went to Seoraksan Mountain
with the ladies.

692
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:19,494
FULL OF HAPPINESS
SEORAKSAN MOUNTAIN

693
01:07:19,578 --> 01:07:21,997
I don't remember where I put it.

694
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:23,957
Kyeong-do!

695
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:33,049
Have you seen this small and round thing
by chance?

696
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:36,261
When you open it, there's a watch inside.

697
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,555
This small? Round?

698
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,056
Yes, did you see it?

699
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:42,726
A watch looks like that?

700
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,312
Jeez, you need to read more.

701
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:48,940
It's the kind of watch from the story,
The Gift of the Magi.

702
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:51,485
The one you can put
inside the pocket of your suit.

703
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:52,819
Oh, the story

704
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:56,114
where the wife cuts her hair
to buy a new chain?

705
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:57,491
Have you seen it or not?

706
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:58,533
No.

707
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:01,119
That's strange.

708
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:04,664
Did a petty thief steal it or what?

709
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,968
I know it's tough.

710
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:01,345
Whether I drink or take pills,
mind your own business.

711
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:02,264
Hey.

712
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:05,015
You should stop getting involved
with Seo Ji-woo.

713
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:09,104
Some people don't know when to stop.
Like Ji-woo and Kyeong-do.

714
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:10,272
Hey…

715
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:15,026
I keep coming back here,
but you're not here anymore.

716
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:20,740
Being sweet in a grumpy way.
The worried look in your eyes.

717
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,158
I keep imagining things.

718
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,622
If you stop me again,
that means you're also confused.
