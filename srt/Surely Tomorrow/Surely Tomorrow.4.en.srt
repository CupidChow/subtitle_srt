1
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:44,962
SURELY TOMORROW

2
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,342
EMERGENCY

3
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,220
Ji-woo…

4
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:24,168
Hey, are you awake?

5
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,670
What am I doing here?

6
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,088
Why…

7
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,258
Why did you do that?

8
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,762
Se-yeong, what are you doing here?

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,932
Why are we…

10
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,809
Kyeong-do carried you here.

11
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,315
Ji-woo,

12
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,069
I have to go because Dong-won has a fever.

13
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,906
But Kyeong-do is here,
so make sure to get treated, okay?

14
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,200
Sorry, Se-yeong. You should get going.

15
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,577
No need to say sorry.

16
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,123
My head is pounding.

17
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,755
Drop me off here.

18
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,426
Are you sure you can walk?

19
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,386
Yes.

20
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,014
Hey, Seo Ji-woo.

21
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:28,649
Why would you take pills with alcohol?
What were you thinking?

22
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,152
If it weren't for Se-yeong,
you could've been gone.

23
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,530
Did your decibel rise as you got older?

24
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,787
Fine. Then those pills.
Why did you take them?

25
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,541
Because my mom came by.

26
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:49,211
And I really don't like her.
She pissed me off.

27
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,924
Our mom is not a good mom.

28
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,260
I didn't take them to die,
so don't overreact.

29
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,513
Overreact?

30
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,767
Sure, I overreacted
and ran with you on my back.

31
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,313
I couldn't sleep.
Not even with the sleeping pill.

32
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,024
So I took another one,
but I still couldn't sleep.

33
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,360
That's what happened.

34
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,113
Is it true?
You did that just because you were drunk?

35
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,908
How many times do I have to say it,
damn Lee Kyeong-do?

36
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:22,536
I'm already out of energy as it is.
Stop roasting me.

37
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:29,126
"Damn Lee Kyeong-do," wasting your time.
What the hell did I do that for?

38
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,297
Go.

39
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,672
Fucking lunatic.

40
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,017
Hey.

41
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,107
Hey.

42
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,401
Overdosing on sleeping pills
after drinking?

43
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,945
You want everyone to know?
Should I write an article?

44
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,321
Now be quiet and listen.

45
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,826
When humans drink alcohol,
they become idiots.

46
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,953
It's okay if you know when to stop.

47
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,290
But some don't know when to stop.
Like Seo Ji-woo and Lee Kyeong-do.

48
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:56,296
That weed party in 2018,
why do you think you went there?

49
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,884
You don't even smoke. Huh? You got drunk,
and you didn't know where you ended up.

50
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:04,096
Imagine being a smoker.
Then you would've been in real trouble.

51
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,056
You won't drink when there's no more left.

52
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:12,354
You were a lunatic not to have realized
how many sleeping pills you were taking.

53
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,231
Do you collect my articles?

54
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:19,111
What about the gum on the way
to the fashion show? How do you know?

55
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,448
I dare you to buy alcohol again.
I'll come back and throw everything out.

56
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:25,075
Who are you? Who do you think you are?

57
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,911
What else? It's humanity.

58
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,001
Get out.

59
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,504
Whether I drink or take pills,
mind your own business.

60
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,299
So stop drinking already!

61
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,905
I know it's tough.

62
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,032
I know it best.

63
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,660
Still, you shouldn't drink anymore.

64
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:14,249
That's, you know, extremely tough.

65
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,711
It's better to make an effort
sooner rather than later. Okay?

66
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,175
Okay. I hear you.

67
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,471
Leave now, will you?

68
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,976
Sleep tight and order some porridge.

69
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,479
You had your stomach pumped, so go easy.

70
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,690
I'm sick of this.

71
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:42,486
I heard you, so get out.
You're making me sober.

72
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,534
Make sure to order porridge, okay?

73
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,632
SURELY TOMORROW

74
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,259
EPISODE 4

75
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,554
See? I told you it'd look good on you.

76
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,596
SPRING, 2007

77
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,098
Everything looks good on me.

78
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:16,562
That's true, but I think
this looks particularly good on you.

79
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,398
Kyeong-do,

80
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,234
I got overwhelmed while putting this on.

81
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,239
Because you felt my love?

82
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,658
I felt how much you worked your ass off.

83
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,536
You must've worked your ass off
with all those plates, huh?

84
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,001
Instead of saying "working my ass off,"
I prefer hearing "working hard."

85
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,795
Whatever. Let's go. There's a place to go.

86
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,547
Where?

87
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,218
See? I knew this color
would look perfect on you.

88
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,303
It looks nice.

89
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,766
But if you do this, my gift doesn't shine.
Is this give and take?

90
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,605
Okay, fine. Give and take.
All right. Very good. Yes.

91
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,485
It's 322,000 won.
How would you like to pay?

92
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,196
-I'll pay in full.
-Oh, okay.

93
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,159
Matching outfits.
It matches the color of my dress, right?

94
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,160
APPROVED

95
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,162
Sure.

96
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,832
Here is your card and your receipt.

97
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,588
-I'm home.
-Did you have dinner?

98
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,423
Yeah, I did.

99
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,258
Good job.

100
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,469
Gosh.

101
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,931
I barely made 300,000 won this month.

102
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,107
Wash your feet. They stink.

103
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,401
Okay.

104
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SENT

105
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,222
Lee Kyeong-do, call me, seriously.

106
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,350
Why are you just standing there?
Do something else.

107
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,103
Kyeong-do, you know
that tree is the most important, right?

108
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:23,105
Yes.

109
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,190
Hold it tight! It's scary.

110
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,734
Gosh, it's taking all day.

111
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:30,070
-Will you spend all day on it?
-Okay, okay.

112
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,947
JOO

113
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,952
I'm off to the restroom.

114
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,418
Looks like a break-up.

115
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,795
Is Kyeong-do having a hard time?

116
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:55,762
This stop is Dobong District Office.

117
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,819
I told you I was going
to your neighborhood.

118
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,405
I know you're tired.
You made the stage today.

119
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,615
-Did it go well?
-Yes.

120
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,826
I'll go see it.

121
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,620
Did I make you wait?

122
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,915
Oh, no. It wasn't so bad.

123
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

124
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,379
Did you all make the stage together?

125
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,923
Yeah, well, I only do...

126
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,134
what they tell me to do.

127
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,552
Anything funny happened?

128
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,682
Well… no. I was just busy.

129
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,148
Let's eat. I haven't had dinner yet.

130
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,154
There's a good pork cutlet place
over there.

131
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,115
But I want tteokbokki.

132
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,746
Let's have pork cutlet. It's on me
since you've come to my neighborhood.

133
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,798
You love tteokbokki so much.

134
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,633
Let's go.

135
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:21,348
TTEOKBOKKI
BUNSIK

136
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,567
Why? Is it bad?

137
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,277
No.

138
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,614
I thought you were hungry.

139
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,243
-Do you want the pork cutlet--
-What's up with you?

140
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,578
What?

141
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,624
You know I've always liked tteokbokki.

142
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,710
So we even had it twice a day.

143
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,799
So?

144
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,014
Why are you suddenly insisting
on having pork cutlets we barely eat?

145
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,397
I just thought it'd be a good idea
to try something else.

146
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,320
Because I'm the daughter of JARIM Apparel,

147
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,492
are you suddenly feeling uncomfortable
having bunsik with me, Kyeong-do?

148
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,467
I said I'd meet you in Apgujeong.

149
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,095
-It's too--
-Better than where your school is.

150
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,390
-What I'm saying is--
-What?

151
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,603
Are you trying to match the level?

152
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,864
Kyeong-do. Lee Kyeong-do.

153
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,115
What do you want me to do then?

154
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,869
Don't you think about how I feel?

155
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,789
Everyone around me is like me

156
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,584
and my family.

157
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,379
This is beyond my…

158
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,426
Ji-woo, will you give me
some time to get used to it?

159
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,511
"Get used to it"?

160
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,764
Do you need to get used to seeing someone?

161
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,975
Either I'm too young to know, or...

162
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,560
too poor to know.

163
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,270
Hey, seriously…

164
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:36,399
Why do you have to be so twisted?
What is wrong with you?

165
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,484
Ji-woo.

166
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,280
Because you're visiting my neighborhood,

167
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:46,284
I wanted to get you decent pork cutlet.
Why are you so uncomfortable about it?

168
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,996
I like tteokbokki more than pork cutlet.
I've always liked it!

169
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,959
I know that!
But I wanted to get you a pork cutlet!

170
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,671
I've been thinking about it since school.
So I even borrowed...

171
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,507
money from the other guys.

172
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,178
Can't you just eat it? Huh?

173
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,640
And make me proud.
Can't you do that for me?

174
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,981
Damn it.

175
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,193
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,282
I just don't know what to do.

177
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,077
What's so hard? What's so hard about it?

178
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,207
The shirt you bought me.
You asked me why I don't wear it.

179
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,544
322,000 won.

180
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,381
That's how much my mom makes in a month
from a side job.

181
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,302
You know,

182
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,264
I know that I shouldn't act like this.

183
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,020
But my parents always work so hard,
and that was…

184
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,607
That was natural for me.

185
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,278
But after meeting you,

186
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,281
everything that used to be natural…

187
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,910
feels so different.

188
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,130
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,216
This isn't your fault, but I…

190
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:36,978
Sorry.

191
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,399
No, I'm…

192
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,984
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,325
Kyeong-do, I'm sorry.

194
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,870
For buying you a 322,000 won shirt.

195
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,374
I'm so sorry that I got you that shirt.

196
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,834
Ji-woo, that's…

197
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,339
I never thought about how you'd feel.

198
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,679
I'm really sorry, Kyeong-do.

199
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,142
Let's talk about this later.

200
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,939
I'll go now.

201
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,132
Shit.

202
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,015
Oh, goddamn it.

203
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:19,497
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

204
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,835
Ji-woo, is everything all right?

205
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,920
Why can't I get a hold of you?

206
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,007
I'm really sorry.

207
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,468
That's not what I meant.

208
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,137
I should've given it more thought.

209
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,309
Let me see you for a second.
Do you want to meet near your house?

210
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,518
Ji-woo.

211
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,603
Ji-woo.

212
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,356
Ji-woo.

213
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,984
Mr. Kim!

214
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,319
Mr. Kim!

215
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,070
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:37,742
Ji-woo.

217
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,297
I'll... go.

218
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,762
I'll go to New York.

219
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:02,559
Okay.

220
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,569
Yes, Secretary Yang.

221
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,573
Get ready to send Ji-woo to New York. Yes.

222
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,910
The faster, the better. Okay.

223
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,520
BOARDING PASS

224
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,822
May I have your attention, please?
Flight 611…

225
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,034
Nice, good.

226
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,578
Hey, wait…

227
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:49,082
Excuse me.
Will you get off the field? Hey!

228
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,876
Go around him.

229
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,884
Kyeong-do, be happy.

230
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,972
I'll be happy too.

00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,674

00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,154
Hey!

241
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,199
Get in.

242
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:47,825
I have to go to work.

243
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,183
There's a bakery open at this hour.
Do you want to go?

244
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,063
I'm late even if I go in now.

245
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,731
That's none of my business.

246
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:19,816
Shoot…

247
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,778
-You woke up early.
-I couldn't sleep.

248
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,825
I stayed up all night
watching the useful videos you sent me.

249
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:33,579
What do you want me to do?
Are you saying that I'm an alcoholic?

250
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,289
Is my life doomed?

251
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,416
If you drink that much, you never know.

252
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,002
Hey,

253
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:44,966
if your mom tells you to study when
you're just about to, would it upset you?

254
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,009
It would.

255
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,387
You plan to lose weight
but your boyfriend tells you to do so,

256
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,596
wouldn't it piss you off?

257
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,683
-It would.
-And yet why are you doing this?

258
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,563
My algorithm gave me
a lot of useful information.

259
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,774
So I thought it'd be helpful
since you're slacking off. Too much?

260
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:06,529
Then sit down with me and read together
or work out with me.

261
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:10,575
That's how you show support.
Instead of bombarding me with videos.

262
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:26,757
Take them off.

263
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,302
What?

264
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,144
Hey, it hurts so much.

265
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,814
Hey, are you okay?

266
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,695
Jeez, she's so cold-hearted.

267
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,448
Wait. I can't do it. I can't.

268
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,119
Gosh, it's so painful.

269
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,540
Hey, are you done?

270
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,667
Then I'll walk this way.

271
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,465
Gosh, you and your temper.

272
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,593
People usually become kind as they age,
but you are… Jeez.

273
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,429
If I really let it out,
it would've been you I stepped on.

274
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,058
Why did I find all that information
until my eyes fell out?

275
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,857
What are you doing?

276
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,067
Washing my feet.

277
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,527
You still have soil there.

278
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:31,197
Where? Here?

279
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,493
Seriously. Jeez. Hey, come here.

280
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,456
-Hey, here…
-Hey.

281
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,918
Oh, come on.

282
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:53,219
It's still here. Did you do a somersault
when I didn't see you?

283
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,929
Gosh, hey, the other foot.

284
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,599
-Over here.
-Where?

285
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,726
-Here.
-"Here"? Here too?

286
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:11,737
Done. Oh, seriously,
you can't even wash your feet?

287
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,448
Jeez.

288
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,037
What are you doing?

289
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,664
Drying my feet.

290
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,296
Man.

291
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,301
Here.

292
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:55,406
You do it.
Seriously, you're such a handful.

293
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,623
Don't shake it. Wipe with it.

294
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,419
Oh, seriously.

295
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,609
Hop in. You stayed up all night.
You'll doze off and get into an accident.

296
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,029
Sure.

297
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,987
Lee Kyeong-do is such a gentleman.

298
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,158
But what is this conclusion?
You're still leaving?

299
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,994
-Yeah.
-When?

300
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,583
Would you stay if I yell at you?

301
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,712
Don't even think about dragging me
into the company. For whose sake?

302
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:34,797
Ji-woo.

303
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,384
I told Mom that I know everything.

304
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,929
And that you told me.

305
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:50,771
I've thought about
why Dad mentioned my shares in his will.

306
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,899
"Seo Ji-woo assumes
the position of director

307
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,110
and the shares shall be transferred
two years later."

308
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,989
He's telling me to defend myself.

309
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,784
To show that I may not be his daughter,
but I can make a big contribution.

310
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,661
So no one should question me.

311
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,871
Nothing was handed to me.

312
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,457
If you know that, why're you running away?

313
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,418
It's his company.

314
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:17,089
He raised me like his own daughter.
That's more than enough for me.

315
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,561
How would my shares help sell the company?

316
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,564
CEO Seo, who is the major stockholder,
wouldn't budge.

317
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,316
I mean, what's the point?

318
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,528
Don't worry about her shares.
They'll be settled naturally.

319
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,614
What matters is your decision.

320
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:48,662
I'm discussing with you a very important,
risky matter,

321
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:53,292
which can't be even discussed
with CEO Seo.

322
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:55,044
It means that I'm all in.

323
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,548
Now is the time to throw them.

324
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,968
Selling them in a rush
won't get you the right price.

325
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,140
You've explained this to me already
last time.

326
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,185
What I find strange,

327
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,856
is that CEO Seo is working day and night.

328
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,653
They say the clothing business is sinking,
but JARIM Apparel isn't in deficit.

329
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,740
Then why are you saying
we need to sell the company?

330
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,952
And why is now the time
to throw my shares?

331
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,038
CEO Seo Ji-yeon
won't be working for too long.

332
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:35,084
I'm the only one who knows about this.
Well, now you know it too.

333
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,335
What do you mean?

334
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,422
The owner of the company
will collapse soon.

335
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,049
She's very sick.

336
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:47,179
Well, she's not telling her family either.

337
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:50,015
Well, her symptoms will get worse
in less than a year.

338
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,645
What symptoms?
Is she terminal or something?

339
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:58,065
Alzheimer's. She has dementia.

340
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,241
What about Seo Ji-woo?

341
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,954
I know she has no shares, but she's still
the daughter of the former chairman.

342
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,456
Oh, Executive Director Choi,

343
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,833
don't you know Seo Ji-woo?

344
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:19,795
She can't do anything productive
except for breathing.

345
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,840
All she thinks about is having fun abroad.
That girl...

346
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,552
You can't call her "that girl."

347
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,388
You sound pretty aggressive.

348
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,726
If I sell the company,

349
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,394
what's in it for me?

350
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,398
MANZAAR. You can take the men's wear.

351
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:41,817
It's your dream to run your own company.

352
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:46,655
Sounds good to me.

353
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:49,450
All right. Let's eat.

354
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,227
Has CEO Seo noticed?

355
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,688
She loves coffee, so she drinks it often.

356
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,284
Anyway, what kind of drugs are these?

357
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,703
She's not responding much.

358
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:35,913
You don't need to know.

359
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:38,999
She's sensitive.
Be careful not to get caught.

360
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:42,211
I need to know
if this would kill her or not.

361
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,796
I'd end up becoming a murderer.

362
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,967
It won't kill her.

363
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,345
Just do your job.

364
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,190
Today's sermon was great.

365
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:05,859
Exactly.

366
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:07,528
Thank you. Bye.

367
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,822
-Yes. Bye.
-Be careful. Bye.

368
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,058
Kyeong-do.

369
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:41,186
Let's go sleep at home, will you? Get up.

370
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:43,814
Lean on me.

371
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:46,984
Kyeong-do.

372
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,904
-Let's go home.
-Oh, my gosh. It's cold.

373
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:51,989
Should we call the police?

374
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:55,993
Kyeong-do, wake up, will you?

375
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,163
Let's go home with Mommy, yes?

376
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,294
Kyeong-do.

377
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,632
You scared me. You…

378
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:16,013
Mom, still, when I used to drink a lot,

379
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,266
I never slept elsewhere.
I always slept here.

380
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,520
That is still praiseworthy, right?

381
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,150
How embarrassing. My goodness.

382
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,905
Were you waiting for me?
Were you on night duty?

383
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,864
Yes.

384
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:38,409
Mom, add a person to your prayer list.

385
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,246
Gosh.

386
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,043
PRAYER NOTE

387
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,420
Name.

388
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,717
Just put it down as my friend.

389
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,389
KYEONG-DO'S FRIEND

390
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,226
What should I pray for?

391
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,565
No, never mind.
There's nothing to pray for.

392
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,532
Mom.

393
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,953
What are you, a kid?
Why do you keep calling me?

394
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,037
Mom, Mom.

395
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,121
Yes?

396
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,793
The thing is,

397
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,590
my friend drinks too much.

398
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:38,178
But when you take a look at his life,
everything can be an excuse to drink.

399
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:42,391
He can't stop drinking
because of frustration. I know it well.

400
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:47,980
Sorry about that time.

401
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:58,574
But I'm not sure about how to help him.

402
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,828
He's going far away.

403
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,623
Where he doesn't know anyone.

404
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,166
He'll end up drinking more.

405
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,964
I'm worried from the bottom of my heart.

406
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,634
He might die in England.

407
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,178
How was it when you got treated?

408
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:22,681
Me?

409
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,933
You probably had something in mind.

410
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,644
"If this had happened,
I wouldn't have drank."

411
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:32,065
"If someone did this for me,
I wouldn't think about drinking."

412
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,483
Didn't you have one?

413
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:40,949
I did.

414
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:46,705
Now, it's annoying
that it's not me or Dad.

415
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:58,175
Seriously, I think you're the funniest mom
among all moms I know.

416
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,428
If I got a promotion for being funny,
I'd be a senior deaconess.

417
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,268
Cheer up, Mom.

418
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:16,276
Cheer up and look after Ji-woo.

419
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,738
You've never been a true mom to her.
You should do it now.

420
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,577
Hey, you've known everything, but why--

421
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:27,037
Mom.

422
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,208
I don't care about the choices you made
or the kind of life you lived.

423
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,335
That's between you and Dad.

424
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,253
What upsets me is,

425
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,590
what has Ji-woo done wrong?

426
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:42,844
Why do you hate her so much?
How come you never pay attention to her?

427
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:47,975
All I care about

428
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:53,605
is how to draw your attention to Ji-woo.
How to make you approve of her!

429
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,738
I should've just let her be.

430
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,866
I should've just let her live
the way she wanted.

431
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:08,078
I should've just let her be back then.

432
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,373
How could you never…

433
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,517
Call me when you leave the hospital.
I'll send Secretary Cha.

434
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,528
JARIM APPAREL

435
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,905
DIRECTOR
KANG MIN-WOO

436
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,451
What is it?

437
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,910
You have a quick delivery.

438
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,748
It doesn't say where it's from.

439
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,042
The delivery man said
he didn't know either.

440
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,252
Okay.

441
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:12,017
How's the treatment?

442
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,978
I was wondering
why you wanted the drug so secretly.

443
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,148
Why don't you answer your phone?

444
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,200
Kim Doo-jin?

445
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,410
What?

446
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,497
Is it good? You don't share.

447
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:37,667
Do you want one? It'll wake you up.

448
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,337
Did it wake you up? Come here.

449
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,008
Yes, sir.

450
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:48,512
Your article has a unique photo.

451
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,264
Where did you find such a sneaky photo?

452
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:52,808
I searched tenaciously.

453
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,278
It sounds a bit like
you want to chew me up…

454
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:07,906
I'm not even the department manager.
I just like these.

455
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,575
It's good, right?
You know what is good. Damn.

456
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:14,663
Yeah. Are you sure about this?
You might get a call from his agency.

457
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,915
It's perfect
for the tax evasion suspicion.

458
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,085
I'm glad you brought it up.
It's only a suspicion.

459
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,630
Sir, I've looked into it already
and an accurate fact check--

460
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:24,965
Hey, wait. Something's coming.

461
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,551
Something red is approaching us.

462
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,427
That's definitely a threat
from that distance.

463
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:32,222
Kiss my ass. What, a threat?

464
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,267
The real threat is you
harassing a junior over a photo.

465
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,184
Right, Kim Doo-jin?

466
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,395
You are absolutely correct.

467
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:40,981
Has it ever hit you in the nose?

468
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,317
No, does this nose look like that to you?
Look how straight it is.

469
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,320
It looks like you had it reconstructed.

470
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:50,323
It's so stressful, seriously.

471
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,742
Stop stressing out a hardworking junior
and go.

472
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,452
Go where?

473
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:55,745
The general manager's office.

474
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:57,956
You're in big trouble.

475
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,134
What's that look on your face?
Is everything okay?

476
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,512
I'm in good condition…

477
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:16,016
Hey, if you're going to Chicago
despite that competition,

478
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,268
you should look all cheerful and bright.

479
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:22,689
You're the first to get training abroad
in the Entertainment Team.

480
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:23,607
Thank you.

481
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,776
Don't say that.
You're going because you deserve it.

482
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,195
I have no power.

483
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:33,158
Anyway, thanks to you,
Dongwoon Daily has become

484
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,577
the go-to media outlet for actors.

485
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,997
I'm flattered by your compliment.

486
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,667
Hey, I'm not exaggerating. Think about it.

487
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:47,672
Thanks to your article,
all the unpaid actors got paid,

488
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:51,301
and that big, malicious company shut down.

489
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,179
Our company is the number one media

490
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,848
that the artists want to use these days.

491
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,060
I guess I did pretty well.

492
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:04,481
Keep this momentum going, okay?

493
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,734
When you come back after a year,
write another one like that.

494
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,283
-Where's Dong-won?
-At his friend's birthday party.

495
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,203
Hoengseong Korean beef
lost to a bunsik party.

496
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,412
Kids love fried chicken.

497
00:42:19,496 --> 00:42:20,580
Wait, it's gone.

498
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:24,292
Hey, I barely chewed it, and it's gone.
It really melts.

499
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:28,463
Gosh, while on a business trip,
you'd stop by Hoengseong

500
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,881
and get beef for us.

501
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:32,133
Our Jeong-min's growing up.

502
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:34,552
Kyeong-do, have some. Why are you so down?

503
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:38,890
You should've texted me ahead
so I wouldn't eat so much for lunch.

504
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,309
Are you complaining
when I get this for you?

505
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:43,311
Do you know
how bad the weekend traffic is?

506
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,647
Yet I did my best to feed you.

507
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,276
So while you were doing your best,
you could've texted me.

508
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,403
-Don't eat it then.
-Thank you for the food.

509
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,487
Enjoy.

510
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,201
Oh, right. What's your plan
with your house while you're in Chicago?

511
00:42:58,285 --> 00:42:59,244
Why?

512
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:02,539
Why bother to move out if you leave
only for a year. Why don't you sublet it?

513
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:03,456
Sublet?

514
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,377
A friend of mine works in Singapore.
And she's coming to Korea for a year.

515
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,754
She's looking for a place to stay,
you could sublet it to her.

516
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,675
A woman would keep the place tidy.
How much would you want?

517
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:20,932
Hey, someone gets to train abroad for free
and also receive rent.

518
00:43:21,016 --> 00:43:24,144
It's "the poor get poorer
and the rich get richer"?

519
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,353
Don't be silly.

520
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:27,897
When are you leaving?

521
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,446
I'm not sure yet. Eventually.

522
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:37,991
Why?

523
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,202
Now that Ji-woo's single,
you don't want to leave?

524
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:47,876
What are you talking about?
What does she have to do with Chicago?

525
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,629
Right. You should stop getting involved
with Seo Ji-woo.

526
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:52,922
She's fine on her own.

527
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,091
What do you mean she's fine?

528
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:57,761
She always gets drunk
and talks about running away.

529
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,929
And she needs to quit drinking.

530
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:04,476
Besides, there's no one to stop her,
so she'll only end up drinking more.

531
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,020
Admit it.

532
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:10,774
You don't care about Chicago
because of Seo Ji-woo. Am I right?

533
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:16,738
No, it's just that
she's having a hard time.

534
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:21,242
And if she leaves now, her family might…
Well, you don't need to know.

535
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:22,911
You need to stop!

536
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,746
No need to raise your voice.

537
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:28,750
Look at what this idiot's doing.
Because of Seo Ji-woo…

538
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,797
I don't care about
how much you love Seo Ji-woo, but we…

539
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,300
we also love you very much, okay?
You asshole.

540
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:46,851
Why, you...

541
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,771
Did water get you drunk?

542
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,189
Yes, we're drinking water.

543
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,734
With this fine food,
I can't believe we're drinking water.

544
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,029
Do you have any idea…

545
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:03,368
how much we were worried every single day
because we thought you'd die?

546
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,123
And now you're worried
about Seo Ji-woo drinking, you jackass?

547
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:26,224
WINTER, 2017

548
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,521
Jeez.

549
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,783
Gosh…

550
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:05,949
Let's do this for this week.

551
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,327
Okay.

552
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:14,123
Gosh.

553
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,542
-Wait, no.
-Leave it.

554
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,628
But this is mine.
You want me to get you coffee?

555
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,132
But it's just water.

556
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,384
It's water…

557
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:32,225
Did you request time off
just to keep drinking?

558
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,897
I can't cause trouble at work.

559
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:40,316
Hey, I'm glad you brought that up.

560
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,403
What happened to the Culture Team's ace
Lee Kyeong-do?

561
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:48,199
You worked on the forged painting scandal
for a year and shook up the art scene.

562
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,285
I became an assistant manager
thanks to you.

563
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,496
But why are you drinking alcohol
like water?

564
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:55,415
Why, Kyeong-do?

565
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:21,733
Hey, Lee Kyeong-do.

566
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:33,536
I'm sorry.

567
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,001
Han-kyeong, I'm sorry.

568
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,088
I'm sorry.

569
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,101
Let's go. You've had enough.

570
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,315
Jeong-min, let's drink.

571
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,151
Let's drink.

572
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:06,277
No.

573
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,156
-I'll pay for the chauffeur service.
-What?

574
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,372
I'll pay, here. Drink before you go.

575
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,707
Whatever. It's time to go now.

576
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,378
-But it's been a while since we've met.
-Come on. Stop it.

577
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,547
Oh, drink before you go.

578
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:29,175
Oh, okay. Okay, fine.

579
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,095
Just one bottle.

580
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:34,430
Only one bottle.

581
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:36,891
Only one. Okay?

582
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,060
-Kyeong-do.
-Okay?

583
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,396
-Hey…
-What the hell?

584
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:42,897
Jeez, seriously.

585
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,732
-Hey, I'll do it. Careful.
-Kyeong-do.

586
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,360
Oh, wait. Get up. Jeez.

587
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:51,489
Oh, seriously. Jeez, come on.

588
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:54,242
Oh, I'm okay. I'm fine.

589
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,120
Shit.

590
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,330
Man, I fell.

591
00:50:00,123 --> 00:50:01,374
I'll go pay.

592
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:04,794
Oh, I can get up on my own.

593
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,338
Come to your senses, will you?

594
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:10,174
-Jesus.
-I can get up.

595
00:50:20,727 --> 00:50:21,811
Kyeong-do!

596
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,527
Kyeong-do.

597
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:35,032
Kyeong-do, hold, hold onto me.

598
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,034
Kyeong-do, hold onto Mommy.

599
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:38,745
Oh, stop it!

600
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,868
Your mother got hurt.

601
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,039
Her arm's fractured.

602
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,173
Why?

603
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:35,510
She fell because her drunk son pushed her.

604
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,471
Jeez.

605
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,080
Kyeong-do.

606
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,062
Mom.

607
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:40,908
I'll come back after treatment.

608
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,414
Don't worry about us.

609
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:54,714
Mom.

610
00:52:57,049 --> 00:52:58,134
Yes.

611
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,182
Mom, I'm sorry.

612
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:09,604
I'm sorry.

613
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,511
Jeong-min.

614
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,554
What are you doing? This is disgusting.

615
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:28,140
I'm so touched today.

616
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,518
Speaking of which,

617
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,313
I'm full. Can you pack my share?

618
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:40,361
Se-yeong, do you have a scale?
Give him exactly 600 grams.

619
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,910
Kiss. Kiss.

620
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:56,502
I'm running an errand. Jeong-min's errand.

621
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,808
You know Jeong-min sells used cars.

622
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,811
He goes around the whole country.
It was Gangwon Province today.

623
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,856
And he bought this in Hoengseong
on his way back. You know?

624
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,941
I know he wouldn't buy enough for me.

625
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,367
Here.

626
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:32,913
Have a piece.

627
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:35,041
Are you here to watch me?

628
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,167
That too.

629
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,918
You don't even deny it.

630
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:20,711
Aren't you eating?

631
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:22,296
I already did.

632
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:26,801
I mean, shouldn't the one who ate
wash the dishes?

633
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:31,555
She has no sense of shame. This should go…

634
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,245
What?

635
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,498
I'm leaving.

636
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,544
I'll keep checking on you.
Don't even think about drinking, got it?

637
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,296
-Are you a gangster?
-I'm a foster carer.

638
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,175
Who asked you to foster me? Who?

639
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:10,636
The past me?

640
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,306
Wait.

641
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,892
That was so cool.

642
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:22,565
That's cool. "The past me." Ha.

643
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,869
So it's inefficient to separate the films
from the drama?

644
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,580
Yes, with the variety shows,
it separates into several parts.

645
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:41,458
Then some artists would overlap.
Then the articles may overlap too.

646
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:44,295
That's right. I had an interview with
actor Cho Seok-hyun for his drama,

647
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,338
but you ran his variety article first,
remember?

648
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,965
37°16'99.5"N 127°02'33.8"E
7:00 P.M.

649
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,216
Remember, Kyeong-do?

650
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,470
What's that? Latitude and longitude?

651
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:58,392
So, I think it's better to assign
the artists individually.

652
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,810
Instead of assigning by the type?

653
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:03,564
Yes, while keeping up with the shows,
we'll have someone in charge of big names.

654
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,069
Right, it's better to assign the work
in a more efficient way.

655
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:13,407
Okay. That means one person
will be in charge of many.

656
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,451
Intern, who's your favorite?

657
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:16,535
JUWON UNIVERSITY FIELD

658
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,829
Any idol is fine with me.

659
00:58:18,913 --> 00:58:20,206
Are you kidding me?

660
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:28,505
Oh, will you stop?

661
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:30,841
-What?
-Cut it out.

662
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:31,800
Continue.

663
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:32,718
Stop what?

664
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:37,640
Then let's decide on this again
next month.

665
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,391
Hey, block it.

666
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:40,851
-Over there.
-Pass it to me.

667
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,480
Move forward.

668
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,692
To the left.

669
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:02,706
You're late.

670
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,919
It's hell to come here during rush hour.
Why did you call me out here?

671
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,846
Honestly,
I wasn't sure about going to England.

672
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,684
Even back then,
I barely plucked up my courage.

673
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,854
When you stopped me,
I pretended to be stopped.

674
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:31,360
I think it might be better to stay.

675
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,535
But I really have to go now.

676
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,457
Why are you drawing the wrong conclusion?

677
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:47,042
Because of you.

678
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,586
You made it clear.

679
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,506
It's only right for me to go.

680
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:58,095
I keep imagining things.

681
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,975
All the things you say,
being sweet in a grumpy way,

682
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,937
your support in your harsh words,
the worried look in your eyes...

683
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:11,233
I can't stop giving meaning to all that.

684
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:16,071
I keep picturing myself as Seo Ji-woo

685
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,159
from Juwon University.

686
01:00:25,706 --> 01:00:27,958
I keep coming back here,

687
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,462
but you're not here anymore.

688
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:44,850
If you stop me again,
that means you're also confused.

689
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:46,912
SPARKLING WATER

690
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:47,913
ENERGY DRINK

691
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:06,140
You just asked me out.
You just called me pretty.

692
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:10,352
I said you had a pretty-ish face.
I didn't exactly say pretty.

693
01:02:10,436 --> 01:02:12,187
It was to encourage you to stop swearing.

694
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,942
If you say things like that
without meaning them, you're a bastard.

695
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,573
Don't be like that.

696
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,783
You're melting my heart.

697
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:26,869
I can't fall for you again.

698
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:30,747
If you stop me again,
that means you're also confused.

699
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:21,340
It's been a while.
You didn't change the door code?

700
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:26,053
Why are you so surprised?

701
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:29,097
Thought I'd still be
in the detention center?

702
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,142
Right…

703
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,523
Let's go outside. Let's talk outside.

704
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,900
Oh, I'm going to leave soon. Yeah.

705
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:41,735
I was just passing by,
and I thought about you.

706
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:46,240
Jin-eon,
you're making me feel uncomfortable.

707
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:57,543
Ji-woo, let's get back together, yes?

708
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:01,505
Fine. Yeah, I admit that I cheated on you
and gave you a hard time.

709
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,049
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about that.

710
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:06,426
I even quit doing drugs. Want to see it?

711
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:11,098
Once my probation is over,
I'll be working at my father's company.

712
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:15,310
I'm not even interested in JARIM.
I'm just going to start all over again.

713
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:17,312
Let's start together, yes?

714
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,023
I'm not interested either.

715
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:27,614
Oh, Ji-woo. Right, Ji-woo.

716
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:29,491
Yeah? Ji-woo.

717
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:34,705
Ji-woo, do you think
you can have this decent life

718
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:37,249
without me or my family?

719
01:04:39,668 --> 01:04:41,670
Ji-woo, you're…

720
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:46,258
Oh, you're Cinderella in rags
after midnight. Okay?

721
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,761
Who'd even bat an eye at you? The prince?

722
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,931
You'll only be surrounded by rats.

723
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,351
Okay, Ji-woo?

724
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:20,208
Hey, if you just leave after saying--

725
01:05:33,972 --> 01:05:35,057
What is this, Ji-woo?

726
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:41,313
A guest?
I only bought two servings of gimbap.

727
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,900
Ji-woo, are you okay?

728
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,693
Why are you standing there
like a soaked puppy?

729
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:05,003
You're that man in the picture. Shit.

730
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:08,465
Don't you think it's a little too late
to have a guest?

731
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:09,758
It seems you are the guest.

732
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:14,137
What's going on with luggage at this hour?
What's going on, Ji-woo?

733
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:17,974
You should look at me.
You were talking to me.

734
01:06:23,772 --> 01:06:25,440
What is going on?

735
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:40,664
I'm flirting with her.
And I'm doing my best.

736
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:57,639
SURELY TOMORROW

737
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:15,907
Jeez.

738
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:26,126
CLOTHING COLLECTION BOX

739
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:32,382
Shoot. What the heck? Why is it so deep?

740
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:45,020
Dad, can you overlock stitch this?

741
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,356
Hey, even your mom wouldn't wear this.

742
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,276
Jeez, throw it out.

743
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,111
Why mend it when it's already gone?

744
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,947
Mom, you've changed.
Being frugal is the key to wealth.

745
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:59,576
That's not being frugal.
That's pitiful. Throw it out already.

746
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,870
No! This is basically my security blanket.

747
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:02,954
Your security blanket?

748
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,207
That's crazy.

749
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:08,084
Then get married! You're getting weird.

750
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:10,420
Crazy?
I'm going to a different laundromat.

751
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:13,632
SOMANG LAUNDROMAT

752
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,009
Did I not breastfeed him enough?

753
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,303
How can he have a security blanket
at this age?

754
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,755
Let's sleep together. The bed is big.

755
01:08:54,256 --> 01:08:57,259
If you come here again after work,
you're a dead man.

756
01:08:58,009 --> 01:09:00,345
Are you crazy?

757
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:03,223
I went all the way there. Was she
flirting with me or threatening me?

758
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,432
Have you done it?

759
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,892
All right. Let's go.

760
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,104
Kyeong-do.

761
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,606
I'll leave when you become
a decent human being. Say no more.

762
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,904
I know this is shameless,
but it's good to be with you.

763
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:23,827
How long will I be in love with you?
