1
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,513
This isn't the classroom.

2
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:58,517
It's right around the corner.
Go on. Let's go. Come.

3
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,117
Isn't that Ms. Seo?

4
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:30,966
Let me help you.

5
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,012
Don't you steal mine…

6
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,895
Ji-yeon. What's wrong?

7
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,450
Let me carry them.

8
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:59,537
But I need to go to class.
I have the mock exam tomorrow.

9
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,957
I'll take you to your class.

10
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,542
Do you know where it is?

11
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,835
Yes, I do.

12
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,006
Honey!

13
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,261
What's wrong?
What is wrong with her? Honey?

14
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,930
Hospital first, Min-woo.
Let's take her to the hospital.

15
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,434
I'll call you. Let me take her.

16
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:24,854
Let's go.

17
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,025
Wait.

18
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,334
Let's go.

19
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,510
Are you okay?

20
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,513
Where are we going?

21
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,974
I called Dr. Kim. We will--

22
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,100
Go home.

23
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,479
Hospital first. Let's do that, will you?

24
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,482
I just want to go home and rest. Later.

25
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:05,913
Ms. Seo's doctor said so,
and I did some research too.

26
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,457
If she stops taking it, she'll be okay.

27
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,879
It might take some time,
but she'll recover.

28
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,839
How can a person…

29
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,927
do such a thing?

30
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,683
He is her husband and her family.

31
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,519
We have to pretend we don't know.

32
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,855
Ms. Seo is very careful about it too.

33
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,525
I'm also looking into this.
We need more time.

34
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,986
What should I do?

35
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,114
Run the company soundly?

36
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:54,962
I want to rest.

37
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,592
Will you be okay by yourself?
Do you want to go home?

38
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,138
I'll call you later.

39
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:09,852
Okay.

40
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,403
Back then…

41
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,992
when you came to see me at the airport,

42
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,120
did you know about this?

43
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,336
Yes.

44
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,384
Okay.

45
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,058
IN-COMPANY BULLETIN BOARD
WHAT'S GOING ON IN JARIM?

46
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,602
IS IT TRUE THAT JARIM CEO HAS DEMENTIA?
MY SHARES…

47
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,033
This isn't right.
Let's go to the hospital.

48
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,828
I should've told you in advance.

49
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,456
Sometimes, these symptoms appear.

50
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,292
Then why didn't you tell me?

51
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,753
You should've gone to the hospital first.

52
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,131
Why did you suffer alone? This upsets me.

53
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,258
I did go to the hospital.

54
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,640
What did the doctor say?
Why is it happening to you?

55
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,102
It's the side effect of a drug.

56
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,730
The medicine I stopped taking
is the issue.

57
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,867
Was Ji-woo there too?
Her shoes were on me…

58
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,328
Oh, right. I need to call Ji-woo.

59
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,331
- Everyone was shocked.
- I'll do it.

60
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,544
JI-WOO

61
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,882
Anyway, what was that reporter
doing in the company?

62
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,134
I called him.

63
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,011
Why did you?

64
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,347
I had to find some info.
Honey, let me make this call first.

65
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,277
I was almost in trouble, wasn't I?

66
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,321
Yes.

67
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:12,242
If it hadn't been for Kyeong-do,
I would've kept taking that drug.

68
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,995
I avoided the crisis thanks to him.

69
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:17,664
Yes.

70
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,544
Are you mad?

71
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,129
Yes.

72
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,051
No.

73
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,646
You must have been scared by yourself.

74
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:49,905
I had no idea
and insisted on going to England.

75
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,741
I tried to run away alone and save myself.

76
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,536
You must've been so frustrated back then.

77
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,540
Yes. I was so frustrated
that I threatened Kyeong-do.

78
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,294
Ji-yeon.

79
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,341
I'll be good. I'll do my best.

80
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,094
So don't be stressed.

81
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:16,765
You have to relax, sleep well,
and eat well to recover fast.

82
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,353
Trust me. You know what I'm capable of,
once I get into it.

83
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,315
I know. Dad used to say that.

84
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,569
<i>"If Ji-woo really puts her mind to it,</i>
<i>even ten guys couldn't take her down."</i>

85
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,205
- Ji-yeon.
- Yeah?

86
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,748
Divorce him.

87
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,501
Not yet.

88
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,420
How can you see that face every day?

89
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,506
I have no official reason
to divorce him yet.

90
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,343
He's such a diligent and sweet husband
on the outside.

91
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,595
So I'm waiting.

92
00:09:56,138 --> 00:10:00,225
If I continue to drive him
into a corner, he'll fall.

93
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,398
INCOMING CALL
LEE KYEONG-DO

94
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,575
Don't blame Kyeong-do too much.

95
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,161
It was me who insisted.

96
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,456
I asked him not to say anything to you
until I tell you first.

97
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,625
I'm sure he was stressed about it too.

98
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,722
INCOMING CALL
MR. KIM

99
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:39,973
Yes, Mr. Kim.

100
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,476
Ji-woo must be sleeping.
The lights are off.

101
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,895
Maybe she's drinking? Shall I go check?

102
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,148
Ji-yeon was already here,
so she'll be fine.

103
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,317
You can relax and get some sleep.

104
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,653
Okay. Thank you.

105
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,239
No, I was here because I was worried.

106
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,200
<i>- Bye now.</i>
- Bye.

107
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,755
EPISODE 10

108
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,012
- Assistant Manager Lee.
- Yes.

109
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,766
Are things not going well in your life?

110
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,685
Everything's fine.

111
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,105
- You look completely run-down.
- No, I don't.

112
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,231
Hey,

113
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,692
come try tarot reading with me.
I found a place.

114
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:33,985
Good. Enjoy.

115
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,487
I'm interested.

116
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,865
Forget it. What does a rich boy
have to worry about?

117
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,742
Come on…

118
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,746
Assistant Manager,

119
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,289
a coffee?

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,085
Sure. Yes.

121
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:54,548
Kyeong-do, I got a call from An Da-hye.

122
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,299
What did she say?

123
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,553
That she has a question and wants to meet.
I'm so nervous.

124
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,762
Schedule a visit. Let's go.

125
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,264
I'll do it, but you go in alone.

126
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,516
She'd be upset and say nothing.

127
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,017
But I'm scared.

128
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,355
Hey, I heard it was a mess. Right?
Damn it.

129
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:11,898
What are you doing here?

130
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:16,403
So bitter. Hey, add some sweeteners.
Jeez, how many shots did you add to it?

131
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,530
Pain, pain, pain in the ass you are.

132
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,532
Wait, what do you mean? What mess?

133
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,869
JARIM. Your girlfriend's company.

134
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,370
- Just drink this.
- Hey.

135
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,080
I'm only checking the facts.

136
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,250
Are you writing about it?

137
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,334
What is it?

138
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,086
What's going on?

139
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,796
Hey, get out and get back to work.

140
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,922
You always leave me out.

141
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,674
The elders are talking. Get out.

142
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,092
- What…
- Now!

143
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,095
Okay, jeez.

144
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,560
Okay.

145
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,439
Before you write about it,
interview CEO Seo's doctor first.

146
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,524
So it's dementia?

147
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,277
I'll schedule an interview for you.
Get your facts straight.

148
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:02,073
You're acting like their son-in-law,
arranging a meeting with their doctor?

149
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,783
Hey, I'm not joking.

150
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:04,910
Okay, I heard you.

151
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,873
If this turns out well,
get me a job in the JARIM PR Team.

152
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,958
I'd be good at writing press releases.

153
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,794
You're out of your freaking mind.

154
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,755
Hey. Look, Mr. Lee.

155
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:21,510
Wait for me. Aren't you temperamental.
Mr. Lee!

156
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:26,014
It's a relief that you're doing well
in the company after joining.

157
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,433
I still have a long way to go.

158
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,895
Did you talk to your sister yesterday?
What did she say?

159
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,357
Be careful.

160
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,902
Act like you don't know anything yet.

161
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,404
She told me not to worry about her

162
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,241
and focus on the company,
consulting you if needed.

163
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,370
I told her to rest.
What's so important about the company?

164
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,454
I know.

165
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,999
What about Lucas? How are things going?

166
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,710
It's noisy in the company.

167
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,214
It won't settle until we have good energy.

168
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,761
The executives are murmuring about her.

169
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,972
If JARIM becomes dirt cheap
even before we know it…

170
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:11,643
Kang Min-woo has been planning
to sell the company for a long time.

171
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,313
He was the one
who informed about Cho Jin-eon.

172
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,066
That's what I'm worried about too.

173
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:22,112
It's not like I have any power.

174
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,531
They give me looks
since I'm known as the troublemaker.

175
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,409
I need your help, Min-woo.

176
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,203
We need to protect the company.

177
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,664
No need to mention it.

178
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:37,002
Anyway, don't worry too much, Ji-woo.

179
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,336
Keep calm, okay?

180
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,213
Yes.

181
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:46,177
If we bring Ro-a back,
wouldn't that help Ji-yeon relax?

182
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,848
There are good international schools
here too.

183
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,018
If Ro-a stays close to her, Ji-yeon will--

184
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,185
You've matured.

185
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,193
If you'd been like this sooner,
your sister wouldn't have been so stressed

186
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:03,486
and felt supported.

187
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,701
Better late than never. It's a good thing.

188
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,751
Sunny days come indeed.

189
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,588
My father-in-law would be happy.

190
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,167
INCOMING CALL
LEE KYEONG-DO

191
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,007
MISSED CALL
LEE KYEONG-DO

192
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,901
INCOMING CALL
LEE KYEONG-DO

193
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,862
Yes.

194
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,741
What about dinner? Have you eaten?

195
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,119
Just a little.

196
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:36,788
What about you?

197
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,207
Me too.

198
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,341
Are you disappointed in me?

199
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,680
I can't describe what I'm feeling.

200
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,894
I'm thankful but frustrated.

201
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,650
Sorry.

202
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,744
Where are you?

203
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,249
Here.

204
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,402
You're getting skinny.
You're skipping meals.

205
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,071
How long have you been there?

206
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,699
For some time after I got off work.

207
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,748
Kyeong-do.

208
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:07,045
I don't know what this feeling is.

209
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:12,884
You protected my sister for me
when I was wandering.

210
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,723
But why did the incident at the airport
come to my mind, so selfishly?

211
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:25,271
"Maybe Kyeong-do didn't stop me for love."

212
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,067
"Was he forced because Ji-yeon asked him?"

213
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,405
This is no time to think about that.

214
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,202
Aren't I so selfish?

215
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,331
To have those thoughts?

216
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,752
You know what, Ji-woo?

217
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:53,258
When I went to meet you at the airport,
I was thinking,

218
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,471
"Ji-woo's sister's illness

219
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,224
is giving me an excuse."

220
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,019
Otherwise, I didn't have
any other excuse to stop you.

221
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,647
"I have no choice but to stop Seo Ji-woo."

222
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,901
Aren't I damn selfish
to have that thought?

223
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,572
But at the time, nothing mattered.

224
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,157
"Only if you don't leave."

225
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,911
"Now that you're single again..."

226
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,206
"Only if you stay close to me."

227
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,378
That's all I could think about.

228
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,884
If that's not love,

229
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,428
what is?

230
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,851
Hold me.

231
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,217
I was scared.

232
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,096
You have me.

233
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,808
I'm right here.

234
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,343
I'm only performing on weekdays.

235
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,512
It's a big theater.

236
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:07,684
My goodness.
Playing the lead role in such a big show?

237
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,145
My Cha Woo-sik is playing the lead role?

238
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:15,441
Three people are taking turns to perform,
and I just do once or twice a week.

239
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,361
Still, it's a lead role.

240
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,239
Being kind pays off.

241
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,658
You're finally getting paid.

242
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,329
That reminds me. The pay.

243
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,540
Playing Godot should pay a lot.

244
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,042
Let's get a new bed for Dong-won.

245
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,546
What about the money you got
for painting Ji-woo?

246
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,549
I bought your mother a necklace with that.
Ten don of pure gold.

247
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,927
Her friends are wearing something heavy
or whatever.

248
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,138
She even gave us a building.

249
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,182
I can do that for her.
That's the kind of daughter-in-law I am.

250
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,183
Right.

251
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,229
Why won't it come off?

252
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,610
Woo-sik. Cha Woo-sik?

253
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,071
Is it gone?

254
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:04,449
Did you spend it all?

255
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,870
When you're a father and a breadwinner?

256
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,747
Well…

257
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,793
Se-yeong, there was something
I really wanted.

258
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:16,711
So I bought it.

259
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,715
What did you buy?

260
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,176
Something on home shopping.

261
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,556
Did you buy the TV in the end?

262
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,642
Wait. No. Wait. That's not it. Wait.

263
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,020
Wait. Give me a second. Let me find it.

264
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,650
What is it?

265
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:42,779
DA NANG FAMILY PACKAGE TOUR
5 NIGHTS 7 DAYS SPECIAL PRICE

266
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,530
- Vietnam?
- It's just…

267
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:48,117
I mean, we should travel abroad too, no?

268
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:52,080
This building came with the loan,
so you had such a hard time paying it off.

269
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:56,125
I worked part-time doing delivery and all
and never brought a decent paycheck.

270
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,044
Our poor Dong-won.

271
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,130
Let's give him a chance
to take a passport photo this time.

272
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,141
Se-yeong?

273
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,104
I'm sorry. Don't cry.
This is all my fault.

274
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:19,398
I'll cancel it. I can get a refund.
I swear I can have my money back, okay?

275
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,152
Honey!

276
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,237
Yes.

277
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,781
Good job!

278
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,992
Thank you!

279
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:33,204
This is why I love you.

280
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,540
You're so cool.

281
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,750
Oh, gosh, Se-yeong. Thank you so much.

282
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:41,796
I mean, it's not refundable,
so I was so scared.

283
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:43,840
- I was worried to death.
- Dong-won.

284
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,092
Dong-won, come here.

285
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:49,178
- Dong-won.
- My baby.

286
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,973
- Let's go travel.
- Dong-won, the passport…

287
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,184
Why are you crying?

288
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,270
CORRECTIONAL CENTER
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

289
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,190
You followed along?

290
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,860
I have nothing to say to you, but…

291
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,653
I have some questions.

292
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:06,946
Like what?

293
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,115
Why did you want to meet
Reporter Kim Doo-jin?

294
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,992
Why do you want to know?

295
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,870
You know Kang Min-woo, right?

296
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,915
Of course.
He's Cho Jin-eon's brother-in-law.

297
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,834
I want to know what's between you two.

298
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,421
What does it look like to you?

299
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,841
Let me rephrase the question.

300
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,971
Why do you think he reported
what's between you and Cho Jin-eon?

301
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:39,562
Is it okay for a reporter
to reveal the informant?

302
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,816
I didn't know he was the informant.
I received it by mail--

303
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,194
I found out through another route.

304
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,987
Do you know him well?

305
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:49,447
No.

306
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,282
We've only said hi.

307
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,076
Maybe we met once or twice.
But that's funny.

308
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,954
Who the hell does that fucker think he is,
tipping off the press about me?

309
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,626
If you were just curious
about the informant,

310
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,628
then you don't need
Reporter Kim anymore, right?

311
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,089
Reporter Lee.

312
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,216
Yes.

313
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:11,260
All I'm asking for is one thing.

314
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,930
I can't wait to get out of here.

315
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,642
Why the hell am I stuck in here
when Cho Jin-eon is on probation?

316
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:19,185
I'm not the only one who did drugs.

317
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:24,440
Who's going to get me out of here?
Cho Jin-eon won't answer his phone.

318
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,944
So I thought I should find the informant
through the reporter and screw him up.

319
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,238
But then,

320
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,908
what could I possibly do
when I couldn't even reach him?

321
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,913
So you knew
Kang Min-woo was the informant,

322
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,665
and you needed Reporter Kim to confirm.

323
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,919
Oh my. Is that what I said?

324
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:53,010
The reporters always catch me so easily.
Even in my prime.

325
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:56,639
You already contacted Kang Min-woo,
but he's not answering.

326
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,519
What do you want to know?

327
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,982
Why would you want
to screw Kang Min-woo up?

328
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:11,320
The reason you chose him
as the rope to get you out of here,

329
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,199
the dangerous reason for him to do that...
That's what I want.

330
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,501
There is no dangerous reason to do that,
Reporter Lee.

331
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,503
Let's say there is.

332
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:32,008
Like a movie, let's say there is.

333
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,554
Then are you going to save me
instead of Kang Min-woo?

334
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,101
The court will sentence you
according to the law.

335
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,439
You have nothing.

336
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,775
You have no power. You have no backup.

337
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,070
Unless you have a good card, don't come.

338
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:56,407
I also have a routine.

339
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,994
It's hard to kill each day
of my sentence in here.

340
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,250
Didroxin.

341
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,589
Kang Min-woo will react to that.

342
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:18,804
Didroxin? So is that a button
that will trigger Kang Min-woo?

343
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,819
It began with the article I wrote.

344
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:35,863
"JARIM CEO's Alzheimer's…"

345
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,366
It's not Alzheimer's.

346
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:41,202
Kyeong-do, this is quite serious.

347
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,205
How far are you planning to go?

348
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:47,666
Where that asshole is going.
I have to be there first.

349
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:51,670
ECONOMICS TEAM

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,090

352
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:59,261
I was working. I'll read it soon.
Did you make it good?

353
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,598
<i>You're not even my department manager.</i>
<i>How dare you check--</i>

354
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,891
- Find the article.
- Okay.

355
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,020
JARIM CEO SEO JI-YEON

356
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:13,025
'DIDROXIN'S TEMPORARY SIDE EFFECT'
NO ISSUE IN MANAGEMENT

357
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:18,406
'DIDROXIN'S TEMPORARY SIDE EFFECT'
NO ISSUE IN MANAGEMENT

358
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,035
Dementia?

359
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,914
If you take Didroxin wrong,
you get dementia?

360
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,960
Yes. Right.

361
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,296
Seo Ji-yeon?

362
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,590
From JARIM Apparel?

363
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:41,679
No shit.

364
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,767
He's one hell of an asshole. Listen.

365
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,563
Send him one more quick delivery.
This time, put it as…

366
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,485
"Didroxin, a visit requested."

367
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:58,237
As simple as that.

368
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:12,793
Yoo Dan-bi didn't post it herself.
Her friend posted it, and she tagged her.

369
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,297
Compared to last year,
the budget on her posts is different.

370
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,798
She obviously has more money.

371
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,135
Anything else that stands out?

372
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:24,972
Well, it seems she's posting
less than before.

373
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,974
She's clearly aware of something.

374
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:28,893
How about her routine after work?

375
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,061
She's really into Pilates.

376
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,190
But she always has a drink
after her class.

377
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,317
Then what's the point of all that?

378
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,569
She goes to her regular places
on a random basis.

379
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,154
- By herself?
- No.

380
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,448
She's an insider.
With new faces almost every time.

381
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:17,608
Here.

382
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:21,320
Eat. When you have low sugar,
you have no energy.

383
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:27,284
But don't you think this is wrong
at ten o'clock at night?

384
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:30,871
Eat with a sense of duty
as if JARIM's future relies on your arms.

385
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,292
Here.

386
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,672
Good girl.

387
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:46,762
How's Ji-yeon doing?

388
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,141
Mother, you don't need to worry too much.

389
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:54,770
Ji-yeon is the same as usual.
You've read the article.

390
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,481
The illness doesn't get that serious.

391
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,527
How's the atmosphere at work?

392
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:06,824
The noise died down when we said
it was the side effect of a drug.

393
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,536
Only you're still sensitive about it.

394
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:13,372
It'll make you ill.

395
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:17,042
Excuse me. Let me make a quick call.

396
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,168
Yes, go ahead.

397
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,084
Hey. When did you get here?

398
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,253
Just now.

399
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,506
What were you doing in Mom's room?

400
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,719
Well, I was wondering
if we had to change her bathroom tiles.

401
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,971
She said they were slippery.

402
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,474
Did she?

403
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:17,186
How come you pay less attention than me
when you're her daughter? Let's go.

404
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,395
Go ahead.

405
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,897
I'm here with Ji-woo.

406
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,568
Ji-woo too? Hurry up.
I have a meeting, so I have to get going.

407
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:25,653
Okay.

408
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,226
I was going to keep it
between Ji-woo and me until I settle it.

409
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,106
What has this man done to you?

410
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,441
Before that…

411
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,653
I think he is going to...

412
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,699
disclose our mother-daughter story.

413
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:13,617
What story?

414
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,286
About Ji-woo?

415
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,289
That she's not Dad's biological child?

416
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,375
He's going to disclose that?

417
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:24,545
I think so.

418
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,300
We might as well get ready for it.

419
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,970
Why is he going that far?

420
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,683
I end up

421
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,770
tying you down.

422
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:58,245
How can you sue me? I'm hurt.

423
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,038
Min-woo,

424
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:04,752
buying and selling JARIM requires
a lot more than buying a corner store.

425
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,003
Right.

426
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,422
Nothing guarantees
that Aaron invests it in JARIM.

427
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:09,631
I know.

428
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,300
Then why do you keep putting it off?

429
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:14,970
You show no action.
I need to find a way to live as well.

430
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,557
You think 30 billion won is a joke?

431
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,977
The stock market's fluctuating
because Seo Ji-woo recruited Lucas.

432
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,687
JARIM will never be for sale.

433
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,148
You're right.

434
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,734
I never thought Seo Ji-woo would help.

435
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,361
- Min-woo.
- Jun-soo.

436
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,030
Bae Jun-soo.

437
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:39,745
The stock market is fluctuating.
JARIM's value went up.

438
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,831
So if it's on the market,
everyone will be eager to buy it.

439
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:45,667
Even without Aaron's fund,
people will bite it.

440
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,631
Then you need to butter me up,
not fucking sue me.

441
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,929
Are you sure it's even on the market?
Does Seo Ji-yeon agree to sell it?

442
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,847
She's not going to, obviously.

443
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,601
I'll have to make her agree to it!

444
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,520
I'm busy working on that,

445
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,481
that's why I'm having fucking raw fish
instead of a proper meal!

446
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,785
Seo Ji-woo,
she's not Chairman Seo's daughter.

447
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:24,248
I was busy
sending the DNA test today, buddy.

448
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:29,419
Seo Ji-yeon's dementia,
Seo Ji-woo being an illegitimate child...

449
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,672
That creates a management risk.

450
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,632
I talked to Executive Director Choi.

451
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,635
Once the article on Ji-woo is released,

452
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,805
Seo Ji-woo will be kicked out.
Then Seo Ji-yeon will stagger.

453
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,975
Whatever Seo Ji-yeon says,
you think people will listen?

454
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,694
But how can you do the DNA test
when your father's deceased? Are you sure?

455
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:59,324
I looked it up.
A DNA test of the sisters and the mother

456
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,243
shows that they have different fathers.

457
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:13,088
I'm okay, but I'm worried about Mom.

458
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,299
The company would come after me too.

459
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,636
Are you sure you'll be okay?

460
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,181
Yes. Well…

461
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,852
My phone will be on fire,
and I'll be bombarded with texts.

462
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,855
Like when my divorce news got out.

463
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,275
It'll get quiet after some time.

464
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,200
Kang Min-woo won't let this slide.

465
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:45,662
Let's get ahead of him.

466
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,457
I swear Kang Min-woo will play a game.

467
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,209
And if it's going to happen,
whoever plays it first wins.

468
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,755
But then you…

469
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,557
You're smart.

470
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,310
You did earn the Assistant Manager title.

471
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,326
Sit down.

472
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,871
Let me just borrow a pen.

473
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,581
- Hey, that's mine.
- Come on.

474
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:30,958
Let me use it just this once…

475
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,046
Hey, you're here.

476
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,174
Hello.

477
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,220
Have you had coffee yet?
We also have Job's tears tea.

478
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,598
Coffee, please. Iced.

479
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,476
Assistant Manager Lee.
Two iced Americanos.

480
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,478
Come with me.

481
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,231
- Three iced Americanos.
- What?

482
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,650
- First time visiting a press company?
- Yes, it's interesting.

483
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,653
The Entertainment Team
is at the end of the hall.

484
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:02,322
This is the Politics Team.
The Current Affairs Team's there.

485
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,907
This way.

486
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,541
- But…
- That means, "Know when to join."

487
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:13,834
Aren't you getting coffee?

488
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,335
Yes, sir.

489
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,921
But why…

490
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,883
Wait. What?

491
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,929
Gosh…

492
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:30,017
I'd like you to write the article.

493
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,226
Me?

494
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,188
The temperature of your words
would be different.

495
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,316
Being not so fond of me
is also a sign of interest.

496
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:49,077
In a way it would induce sympathy, please.

497
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,832
People wouldn't pity you for that.

498
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:59,713
Just show yourself as you are.

499
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,009
Just as I am?

500
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:05,677
Yes.

501
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,893
Sounds good.
Please write it as a special article.

502
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,979
A couple of photos on it would be better.

503
00:39:16,063 --> 00:39:18,607
Okay, sure. In terms of the photos…

504
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,693
You're not using random photos
on the internet…

505
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:24,321
are you?

506
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,995
What is he, a dog that needs to poop?
Damn it.

507
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,499
I'll find a photographer.

508
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:37,000
I can do it today.

509
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,961
Would you like to go to the salon?
It'll take some time.

510
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,171
Sure, thank you.

511
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,174
Thank you. For giving us an article.

512
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,594
You'll get explosive views for sure.

513
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,431
An illegitimate child out of wedlock.

514
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,142
It's a nice keyword.

515
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,396
I'll see you later.

516
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,065
Yes, sure.

517
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,152
Take care. I'll see you later.

518
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,113
Bye. Thank you for the coffee.

519
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,999
So you'd just meet her directly?

520
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,210
It's too big for a mere assistant manager.

521
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,381
Hey. I'm the legend
of Dongwoon Daily's Entertainment Team.

522
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,675
Says who?

523
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,397
Why is she smiling like that?

524
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,841
Wait, this is good. I like the third one.

525
00:41:09,176 --> 00:41:10,510
It's perfect with the breeze.

526
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,391
My goodness.

527
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:18,894
Even like that, she's pretty.

528
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,898
So brazenly pretty.

529
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,657
When did you first find out about that?

530
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,492
I was 28.

531
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:36,786
And you hadn't noticed it until then?

532
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:37,871
No.

533
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,874
That's how my father was.

534
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:45,795
Perhaps, he loved me more than my sister.

535
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:50,383
When you found out,
you must've had a lot on your mind.

536
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,928
A lot…

537
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,141
<i>I did have a lot on my mind.</i>

538
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:02,395
<i>How should I put it?</i>
<i>Should I say I seemed ridiculous?</i>

539
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,732
<i>I didn't deserve everything</i>
<i>I took for granted.</i>

540
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,068
<i>That sense of self-destruction.</i>

541
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:13,281
Everything around me,
the people and the environment...

542
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:16,534
I became ashamed toward them all.

543
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,665
So back then, I ran away.

544
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:23,875
From everything.

545
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:29,339
Ever since then, have you talked
to your father, mother, or your sister?

546
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,591
No.

547
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:34,469
When I was running away to the US,

548
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,597
my father and I talked
about this and that at the airport.

549
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:42,894
<i>Though we were talking about other things,</i>
<i>the message was "thank you",</i>

550
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,147
<i>"I love you" and "I appreciate you".</i>

551
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:51,820
It's only very recently
that I had the talk with my mother.

552
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,614
This interview,

553
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:59,077
it must have not been an easy decision,
not only for you, but for her as well.

554
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,996
Yet she still agreed to it.

555
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,043
If you say no, I won't do it.

556
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,754
It'll be out anyway.

557
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,550
Kang Min-woo, that man,

558
00:43:14,551 --> 00:43:16,219
even had the DNA test done.

559
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,432
Although this is my doing,

560
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,686
how can I live with that?

561
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,857
How am I going to live with my head up?

562
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,402
But…

563
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,740
it was hard on me.

564
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,785
I had such a hard time back then.

565
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:45,915
Your dad was so crazy about work
that I barely saw him.

566
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:50,378
I was stuck in a house as big as a palace.
I could barely eat.

567
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,964
I felt like dying.

568
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:57,218
I didn't run away to Paris to do that.

569
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,347
While I was living there, it just…

570
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:02,599
It happened…

571
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,160
You know what?

572
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,416
What tortured me was…

573
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,670
not your choice.

574
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:39,552
It was that you turned your guilt
into blame toward me.

575
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:45,266
I was completely in the dark.

576
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,063
And you hated me…

577
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:52,482
so much…

578
00:44:59,948 --> 00:45:01,908
That's what tortured me.

579
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,089
My life,

580
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,300
it's coming to a close.

581
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,055
But you…

582
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,307
Are you going to be okay?

583
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:29,644
Yes.

584
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:34,232
It won't be so effective.

585
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,612
Because I've never been okay.

586
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,704
Perhaps, you could've kept it a secret
within your family.

587
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:51,207
I'd like to ask you the reason
you accepted this interview.

588
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,335
Before my father passed away,

589
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,380
he always wanted me to help him
with the company work.

590
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:02,469
I thought it would be shameless of me,
so I kept running away from it.

591
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:07,515
But now, it's time to help my sister,
CEO Seo Ji-yeon.

592
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,480
And working hard for JARIM Apparel
is a way to repay his kindness.

593
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:19,319
Revealing and explaining my situation
would be the start of all that.

594
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,447
Very well.

595
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,415
HER FATHER
WHO RAISED HER WITH HEART

596
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,501
FOCUSING ON JARIM TO REPAY FATHER'S LOVE

597
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:36,211
LATE CHAIRMAN'S LOVE, JARIM'S ROOT

598
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,091
THIS IS A NEW SIDE OF SEO JI-WOO
BUT IT'S STILL SHOCKING!

599
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:52,560
SHE SOUNDS RELIABLE LOL - SHE'S HONEST
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEO JI-WOO'S PATH

600
00:46:58,316 --> 00:47:00,318
JARIM'S SECOND DAUGHTER
THE SECRET OF HER BIRTH

601
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:09,035
DNA EVALUATION - SUSPECTED
TO NOT SHARE A BIOLOGICAL FATHER

602
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,791
She's playing smart.

603
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,305
On vacation?

604
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,604
They went abroad when there's an incident?

605
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,109
Who am I supposed to have makgeolli with?

606
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,196
Damn it.

607
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,035
Hey, it's Kyeong-do.

608
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,370
What?

609
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,621
Hey, Kyeong-do,

610
00:47:53,705 --> 00:47:55,582
- what are you doing here?
- Hello.

611
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:04,090
What's that?

612
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,134
I knew it.

613
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,012
You're all down, ruining your beauty.

614
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:12,223
- What is that RV?
- What do you think?

615
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:15,727
It's the pumpkin carriage to pick you up.
Hey, hop in.

616
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:17,895
That's awesome.

617
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:19,439
Mr. Kim, good night.

618
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,941
- Ji-woo's not eaten yet. She needs to eat.
- Okay.

619
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,486
- Goodnight.
- Drive safe.

620
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:28,948
Come here.

621
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,045
Is it your first time?

622
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,757
Yes. Where did you get this? Whose is it?

623
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:50,219
Who cares? What matters is that
we're using it right now. Just enjoy.

624
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,767
Do you have a license for it?
Can you drive something this big?

625
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,226
I have a license.

626
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:03,941
Anyway, where are we going?
I'm dead tired.

627
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,193
You can rest.

628
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:09,238
We have a bed and a shower booth.
I'll cook. Nothing to stress about.

629
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,867
Why are you so excited?
You didn't even come.

630
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,787
I was busy.

631
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,164
I bought some light to hang outside.

632
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,876
I got stuff for the barbecue.
Tteokbokki, ramyeon, I got everything.

633
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,586
I was busy. So busy.

634
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,897
Can you even finish it today?

635
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,857
No, I connected it.

636
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:49,112
Maybe the light's broken.
I tested it at home, but I was in a rush.

637
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,906
I'm hungry. Let's have ramyeon.

638
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,743
Why have ramyeon when we have barbecue?
Ramyeon is for dessert.

639
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:59,997
Sit here and get some rest.
You'll see my fire-building skill. Sit.

640
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,632
Hey, it's burning.

641
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:12,969
Or not.

642
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:18,099
I feel like someone's watching me.
Maybe that's why.

643
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,064
We can have the meat for dessert.

644
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:29,318
Right. We shouldn't be so narrow-minded.

645
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,631
I think our ancestors
came up with good proverbs.

646
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,342
If it's to diss me, stop.

647
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:57,638
"Hunger is the best side dish."
A proverb like that is so fit.

648
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,768
"Hunger is the best side dish."
Don't you think that's poetic?

649
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,246
The tea smells nice.

650
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,917
It's from England. You like England.

651
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,846
I think it's getting a little chilly--

652
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,056
Here.

653
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,611
Wasn't it tough?

654
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:57,114
Well… It's just…

655
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,499
Just a little. It was a little tough.

656
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,547
You had a nice outfit.

657
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,049
Were you there?

658
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:18,469
Our Ji-woo looks great in anything.

659
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:22,014
I stopped by for a second.

660
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:24,976
To see how you were doing.

661
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:27,520
You should've come to say hi.

662
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,192
Because I felt bad.

663
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:36,195
For asking you to do that.

664
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,116
I felt bad, so I couldn't say hi.

665
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,161
Idiot, why would you feel bad?

666
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,251
I'm thankful.

667
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,174
Thank you, Kyeong-do.

668
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:04,765
I'm embarrassed.

669
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,185
Then…

670
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:10,313
how about a kiss?

671
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,695
Shall we?

672
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:55,274
Thank you.

673
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,698
Hey, this is crazy.

674
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:09,080
What would you do without me?

675
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:11,457
Here.

676
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,510
I'm still sleepy.

677
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:27,765
Give me a piggyback.
I think that will wake me up.

678
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:30,226
I can't do that on an empty stomach.

679
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:32,019
Why not? You carried Bella Jin.

680
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:34,730
That was for business.

681
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:36,440
You and I,

682
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,068
we need to cherish each other.

683
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:42,321
No strength training on an empty stomach.

684
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:54,875
Here we go.

685
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:00,256
Nice.

686
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:09,598
I think I need to stay like this
for ten more minutes.

687
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:10,683
Ten minutes?

688
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,601
Sure.

689
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:16,731
Gosh, do they think
they're filming a movie?

690
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:18,607
Who goes to work from here?

691
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:23,029
Mr. Kim!

692
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:24,321
Good morning!

693
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:26,407
You're laughing? How can you be laughing?

694
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,496
Still, Kyeong-do is the only one
who makes Ji-woo laugh.

695
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:36,709
Thank you.

696
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:38,461
It was nice. Thank you.

697
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,172
What is he getting out of?

698
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:56,270
Lee Kyeong-do, what's going on?
What is it?

699
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,689
What was that RV for?

700
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,775
Did you cover someone big?
To make me happy?

701
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:05,196
No. I was just trying to see
what it's like to come to work in an RV.

702
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,490
- You rode an RV for no reason?
- Yes.

703
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,742
What does an RV have to do
with covering someone big?

704
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,912
Once upon a time,
Lee Kyeong-do actually worked really hard.

705
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:19,126
When Actor Ha Min-su was in his prime, no
one could cover for him. He was so busy.

706
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,796
Then Lee Kyeong-do rented an RV.

707
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:26,092
He basically kidnapped him,
giving him a ride from Seoul to Busan.

708
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,139
Apparently, he was so touched
by Kyeong-do's effort that he said yes.

709
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,310
What do you think he did during that time?
He gave the actor beers to gather a scoop.

710
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:39,688
You and your petty tricks.

711
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,234
Petty? Come here, you asshole.

712
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,401
No…

713
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:48,489
You know what's more amazing?
Ha Min-su bought that RV.

714
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:49,615
- Exactly.
- Since then,

715
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:51,867
he drove the RV to the set.

716
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:55,287
Assistant Manager, you got good money
from the RV company?

717
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:56,997
I'm not like you.

718
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:01,001
Yet, you have nothing today?

719
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:08,175
I gathered news about myself. "Who am I?"

720
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,970
Are you shitting with your mouth?

721
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:15,391
We never get along. I do respect you,
but we don't get along at all.

722
00:57:15,474 --> 00:57:16,809
Think again. We do get along.

723
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,519
- We don't.
- We totally do.

724
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:19,728
We totally don't.

725
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:21,730
Gosh, I don't get along with any of you.

726
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:25,860
The maeuntang here
is your favorite, right?

727
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:28,487
My father told me.

728
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:32,283
He often offered to have soju here.

729
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,285
Give it to me.

730
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:43,294
Thank you.

731
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:47,965
Help yourself.

732
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,808
No wonder you're a regular here.

733
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,690
I assume you have something to say.

734
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,490
I think you already know.

735
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,871
Things are getting serious
between the executives.

736
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:22,666
The employees will talk about it
and stop eventually,

737
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,959
but the stockholders won't.

738
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:30,216
The executives and the stockholders,
I'm asking you to reassure them.

739
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:31,967
I know you can do that.

740
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,886
I can.

741
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,430
But, Ms. Seo,

742
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:39,516
I'm not exactly comfortable
with this situation either.

743
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:46,565
My father wouldn't have been
comfortable either

744
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:52,238
when you siphoned MANZAAR's designer
to launch a new brand.

745
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,280
I know about that too.

746
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:59,078
When my father was in the hospital,
he told me about that incident.

747
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:05,334
He buried it without letting executives
or stockholders know, you know?

748
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:15,427
He said,
"She'll help you out at least once."

749
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:21,308
It's time for that one chance.

750
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,144
Excuse me.

751
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:27,106
One soju, please.

752
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:33,988
At the time,

753
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,616
he didn't even say he was disappointed.

754
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,493
That's how he was.

755
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,121
Chairman Seo Won-seok.

756
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:44,999
Only this time.

757
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:49,753
If there is any issue
with Director Seo Ji-woo again,

758
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:52,923
your safety may not be guaranteed either.

759
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,093
That's the atmosphere right now.

760
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,598
Pour me a glass too.

761
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,609
Thank you.

762
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,875
I guess that's when.

763
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:28,959
What's when?

764
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,296
When you were hurt,

765
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:35,507
Ji-woo must've found out then.

766
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:37,051
Maybe that's why she left.

767
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:43,182
Still, she grew up to be a bright person.

768
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,516
Yes.

769
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,436
Should we invite her for dinner?

770
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:49,772
Kyeong-do will hate it.

771
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,275
- Right?
- Yeah.

772
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,627
You should've told me
that you were coming my house.

773
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,420
I didn't know they invited you too.

774
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:16,173
A son isn't a guest to invite.

775
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,008
A guest would come when they're invited.

776
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,677
You're normally at the laundromat.

777
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:23,138
Here. Eat.

778
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:27,142
Thank you. I absolutely love yukgaejang.

779
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:36,652
Enjoy.

780
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,612
Yes. Thank you for the food.

781
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:54,795
Craving soju?

782
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:59,091
People make that sound
when they have spicy food.

783
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:06,723
You see, this is the exact taste
that I expected when I first saw it.

784
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:09,935
You should have opened a restaurant
instead of a laundromat.

785
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:15,983
Thank you for the food.

786
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:21,947
Bulgogi too? Thank you.

787
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:27,536
Can I have this bulgogi too?

788
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,079
As much as you want.

789
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:34,793
So full. Gosh.

790
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,504
Here.

791
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:38,922
That was a nice meal.

792
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,518
ON MUTE

793
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:53,979
- Baseball now?
- Well,

794
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:55,314
I muted it.

795
01:02:56,023 --> 01:02:58,567
Stop watching baseball.
Now is so not the time.

796
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:01,195
You see…

797
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,321
What?

798
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:06,158
Well… in my opinion…

799
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:10,787
Quitting what you like, whatever it is…

800
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:15,667
Well… it's crazy tough.

801
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:23,217
Still, baseball isn't harmful.

802
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,384
That's nice.

803
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:29,056
It's healthy. It prevents dementia.

804
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:29,973
Really?

805
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:31,767
Better than Go-Stop?

806
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,145
Why, Go-Stop has a risk of gambling.

807
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:38,565
Yes. You're right.

808
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,152
- It's a hit.
- What, really?

809
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,489
What's the point of the other team's hit?

810
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:48,534
Are you a Hanyeong fan?

811
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:52,538
Have you seen them losing by 7-nil
then turning it around by 8 to 7?

812
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:55,290
No. Unfortunately, I missed it.

813
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:56,750
Do you like baseball?

814
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:57,668
Kind of.

815
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:03,006
- We have something in common.
- Of course.

816
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,550
Let me give you a piece of apple.

817
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:08,428
- I didn't peel it though.
- Thank you.

818
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,530
Maybe if Seo Ji-yeon
was born out of wedlock...

819
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,241
But Seo Ji-woo? And get rid of her?

820
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:33,203
That won't affect the management.

821
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,497
That's too weak. That won't do it.

822
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:39,167
A KO isn't the only way to win.
You can also win by decision.

823
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:44,047
Do you know
what Koreans are most sensitive about?

824
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:46,633
Affairs.

825
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:51,847
JARIM's dead Chairman Seo's wife
had an affair.

826
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:55,309
And her daughter also has an affair.

827
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,692
I think this alley is pretty. It's cozy.

828
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,574
Maybe it's true that a married couple
has similar taste.

829
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:11,617
You're copying me.

830
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,869
Don't go overboard.

831
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,370
Okay.

832
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,749
I like how it sounds.

833
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:19,958
Alley.

834
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,002
Alleyway.

835
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:24,129
Alley captain.

836
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:25,964
Alley entrance.

837
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,970
You should've stayed in the Culture Team.

838
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:39,728
You know what?

839
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:44,399
It feels weird
to have dinner together like this.

840
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:47,361
Why?

841
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,155
Is it like visiting your in-laws' house?

842
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:51,490
No.

843
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:53,742
I mean I like it.

844
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,744
It's nice.

845
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:59,956
It's like an alley. A cozy alley.

846
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:08,507
Let's live like this alley.

847
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:15,055
<i>JARIM's dead Chairman Seo's wife</i>
<i>had an affair.</i>

848
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:18,600
<i>And her daughter also has an affair.</i>

849
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,479
<i>There will be a boycott of JARIM.</i>

850
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:26,108
<i>It'll only be a matter of time</i>
<i>until the sisters get kicked out.</i>

851
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,153
<i>And the company will be sold.</i>

852
01:08:24,893 --> 01:08:28,104
<i>So, you are… going?</i>

853
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,608
<i>Don't you know what this field is like?</i>

854
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:34,069
<i>It's better to hide. We might as well die!</i>

855
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,905
<i>Just go live abroad.</i>

856
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:38,865
<i>- Director Seo Ji-woo.</i>
<i>- Director Seo,</i>

857
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,576
<i>don't you think that's irresponsible?</i>

858
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:45,956
<i>Then let her live as an adulteress!</i>

859
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:49,042
<i>I'm here</i>
<i>because the dog was barking too loud.</i>

860
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,002
Kang Min-woo,
you're out of bullets, right?

861
01:08:51,086 --> 01:08:54,256
<i>I'll go, and if I can't bear it,</i>
<i>I'll come back.</i>

862
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:58,176
<i>Ji-woo, let's…</i>

863
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:00,846
live well.
