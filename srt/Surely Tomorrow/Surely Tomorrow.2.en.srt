1
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:44,962
SURELY TOMORROW

2
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,882
DONGWOON DAILY

3
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,425
A MONTH LATER

4
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,801
I didn't know.

5
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,887
Oh, you didn't know?

6
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:54,638
Look.

7
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,809
It's been over a month
since Seo's divorce article was released.

8
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,603
Why are you bringing this up again?

9
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,063
I know. It was released a month ago…

10
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:05,816
by Jogyeong Daily's Entertainment Team
across the street.

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,401
- Right?
- Yes.

12
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:11,071
That article wasn't a hit
like it is right now.

13
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,159
Are they trying to scout you
by any chance?

14
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,244
What? Oh, no way.

15
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:20,790
Then why are their number
of views so explosively high…

16
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:23,959
Dongwoon Daily's Entertainment Team
Assistant Manager Lee Kyeong-do?

17
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,961
That article has nothing to do with me.

18
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,713
Nothing?

19
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,298
Did you just say that?

20
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,345
HER DIVORCE, WAS THERE ANOTHER REASON?

21
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:40,643
This cafe here.
It's the one nearby, right? Huh?

22
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,437
This is where you went on
about quitting your job

23
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,939
after I yelled at you once.

24
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,024
Is it?

25
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,237
Even though it's blurred,
it's clearly you.

26
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,824
We all know that it's you.
Right, Lee Kyeong-do?

27
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,327
Wait, don't call me by my name.
We're at work…

28
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,958
Okay, Assistant Manager Lee.

29
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,045
Okay, fine, Assistant Manager Lee.
Gosh, this is so annoying.

30
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,757
Hey! Will you look out there? Huh?

31
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:15,511
Your juniors are working their asses off
to find an exclusive today, but look...

32
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,054
Their assistant manager son of a…

33
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,224
Their assistant manager idiot is…

34
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,353
He provided articles for other media.
Look at this number of views, will you?

35
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,938
It's not about me.
It's about Seo Ji-woo.

36
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,774
Are you kidding me right now?

37
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,150
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,947
Did you really not hear from her
about her divorce

39
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,740
when this picture was taken?

40
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,951
- No.
- I'm serious.

41
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,079
I seriously didn't know.

42
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,042
Man, seriously.

43
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:53,507
If you're not busy,
help me pack, you jerk.

44
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:55,634
What? Are you traveling?

45
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,139
It's no point. It's no point, you see?

46
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:04,143
There's no point
in devoting my entire life to work.

47
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,104
No point in buying all my juniors food!
There's no point!

48
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,522
Jeez, what's the point?

49
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,192
What are you doing?

50
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,611
I'm packing because I'm quitting.

51
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,031
Oh, if you have time,
pack my stuff in my cabinet for me.

52
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,325
Why are you putting on a show
all of a sudden?

53
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,454
A show?
You think this situation is a joke?

54
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,789
I'm about to remove my desk
because of you.

55
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:29,793
You can go to Chicago for training,
and I can go home.

56
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,338
What do you think
of this ridiculous situation?

57
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:38,093
I'm tearing up, seriously.
Goddamn it, this is pissing me off.

58
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:47,019
Gosh, they were paid to do this,
but this picture is…

59
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,023
They couldn't capture Ji-woo's beauty.

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,611
Come in.

61
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,495
Don't we need to get rid
of the articles on Ji-woo?

62
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,665
What for? What does that
have to do with the company?

63
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,375
Who's that man?

64
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,169
Why?

65
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,879
I mean,

66
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:17,216
it's a scandal right after
all that trouble to get divorced.

67
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,759
It's not irrelevant to the company.

68
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,344
What does it have to do with the company?

69
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:26,934
Look. When she got caught in those photos
with kids doing weed at the club…

70
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,687
it left a bad impression on the company.
You know that.

71
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,439
But Ji-woo didn't do weed.

72
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:38,570
Ji-yeon, do you think
people care about the facts?

73
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,155
Before that…

74
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:48,372
About Jin-eon.
No, now that they're divorced…

75
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,750
That man, Jin-eon.
I know that report was your doing.

76
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,335
Me?

77
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,672
It must've been hard for you as well,
watching how Ji-woo turned out.

78
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,925
What are you talking about?

79
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,470
Or did I not hear that right?

80
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:06,724
Anyway, thanks to you,
Ji-woo was able to settle it.

81
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,980
Should I say
it's all thanks to An Da-hye then?

82
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,742
What a pop star.
You're Dongwoon Daily's celeb now.

83
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,286
If I buy you coffee, will you shut up?

84
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,370
Yes.

85
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,165
Hey, turn around. Just do it.

86
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,166
- Why?
- Turn.

87
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,250
Are you getting married?

88
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,170
That asshole, shit…

89
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,213
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

90
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,718
Hey, be honest with me, Kyeong-do, yeah?

91
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,803
Is Seo Ji-woo following you to Chicago?

92
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,848
Your Chicago training
was all planned, right?

93
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,600
Stop the nonsense. Watch the economy.

94
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,227
I'm just curious
about JARIM Apparel's future.

95
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,271
As an economics journalist.

96
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,814
This asshole…

97
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,442
Hey, then did you plan this out
with Doo-jin?

98
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,403
You got Seo Ji-woo to divorce first,
so when she became single, you--

99
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,282
Just pay me back what you owe, asshole.

100
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,742
Gosh, hey. You kicked me too hard.

101
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,453
Why blame him? Reflect on yourself.

102
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,413
Hit a jackpot or step in dung?
A thin line--

103
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:14,500
Want me write an article?
"Kim Doo-jin on a date with female idol--"

104
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,251
Kyeong-do!

105
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,755
The coffee's on me. We broke up last week.

106
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,381
- Be good.
- Yes!

107
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:24,927
Wait, you haven't had lunch yet?

108
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,806
Your brother-in-law wanted
to eat together. So I didn't eat.

109
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,393
If your relationship is that bad,
divorce like me.

110
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,772
It doesn't look good
for both sisters to get divorced.

111
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,691
Neither of us met a good husband, right?

112
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,696
MOM

113
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,454
Yes, Mom.

114
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:57,084
She never spends a day in peace.
Who's that man in the picture?

115
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,296
Mom, Ji-woo is old enough
not to explain every guy she meets.

116
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,382
It's not a big deal,
so you should go work out.

117
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,260
Don't call Ji-woo. Bye.

118
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,854
I'm not a celebrity.
Why are they taking that kind of picture?

119
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,523
I really don't get it. Do you?

120
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,277
You are a celeb.

121
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,363
People always comment
on the price and brand of what you wear.

122
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,116
You should become an ambassador.

123
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,494
I'd better leave soon. This is so hectic.

124
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:36,165
What did he say? The man in the picture.
Is his name Lee Kyeong-do?

125
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,584
He's probably complaining
that he stepped on poo.

126
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,002
Why did you meet him?

127
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,423
I just met him for no reason.
About the article and…

128
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,509
Hey, Kyeong-do's information
has all been released.

129
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,969
You can't run away alone.

130
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,055
I bet he's not affected by that.

131
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,810
He said he'd meet me
at one of our funerals.

132
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:01,899
Then the one who puts the incense in first
wins or loses?

133
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,361
You guys are so brutal even after aging.

134
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,613
He never grows up.

135
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,910
What's the point of going to England, huh?

136
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:17,289
Now that you're divorced,
let's work out together, go on a trip…

137
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,125
and learn the ropes here.

138
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,628
I'm going so you won't make me work.

139
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,963
Should I say...
I'm just sick of everything?

140
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:29,885
Go only after assessing the situation.
What did Kyeong-do do wrong?

141
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,262
He might die single because of you.

142
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,182
What's wrong with you?
Just go if you're done.

143
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,808
I'm not done eating yet.

144
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,354
Anyway, isn't this delicious?

145
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,855
Good job.

146
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,818
Who else would say that?
It was Deaconess Lee.

147
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,405
She's the neighborhood trumpet player.
She knows everything.

148
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:53,116
Once she hears it, she won't let it slide.

149
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,827
She'll tell everyone.

150
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,829
She's just a friend. An old friend.

151
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,415
I was happy for nothing.

152
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,502
What do you mean
you were happy for nothing?

153
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,254
Laundry delivery!

154
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,758
It's 12,000 won.

155
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:12,719
I'll pay you on my way to work tomorrow.
Must prep dinner.

156
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,346
Oh, sure, sure. Go ahead.

157
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,555
Please come again.

158
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,726
I heard she's the daughter
of a big corporation.

159
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,687
I thought you were marrying
into a rich family.

160
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:27,484
Mom, why are you so materialistic
when you're a deaconess?

161
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,280
Because I'm materialistic,
I haven't become a senior deaconess yet.

162
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,656
Oh, Lord.

163
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:39,204
I know you'll take care of yourself,
but don't make me pray for more. I'm busy.

164
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:43,667
It's not a big deal.
My company published an article about her.

165
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,003
She was upset about it.
Don't worry about it.

166
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,632
Laundry delivery!

167
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,103
Oh, gosh, oh…

168
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,857
Damn it, Seo Ji-woo, shit…

169
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,568
Seo Ji-woo!

170
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:14,781
Oh, my ankle…

171
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,550
You're going to Chicago for training.
Why do you care?

172
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,510
Even if I go, I can't go like this.

173
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,596
I'll be labeled for the rest of my life.

174
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,099
Work's bad too.
Feels like everyone's whispering about me.

175
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,601
Anyway, it's not nice.

176
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,729
It's only for a little while.
No one cares about you.

177
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,524
It even scratched my mom's social life.
My mom was shocked again.

178
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:54,279
Anyway, Ji-woo can fly off to England
or whatever, but what about me?

179
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,323
I'm just an ordinary, peaceful citizen.

180
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,616
So what are you going to do?

181
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,995
I've thought about it.

182
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,797
It's not exactly a bad idea, right?

183
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,634
Why should I do that?

184
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,970
Well, just a reunion after a long time?

185
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,722
Consider it something like that.

186
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,184
We all meet up for a cup of tea
and post a commemorative photo.

187
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,106
And it seems
Kyeong-do's in an awkward situation.

188
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,944
You know what's funny?
Why are you saying this to me?

189
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,446
What?

190
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,698
He needs it, so why make you say it?

191
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,368
Because he feels bad?

192
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,496
Probably because he's embarrassed.

193
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,957
Se-yeong, do you know what he said?

194
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,126
"See you at the funeral."

195
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,086
Whether you die or I die.

196
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,882
Sure, he wouldn't have the face to show up
after raising his voice like that.

197
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,469
Anyway, he can never see
what's ahead of him.

198
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,305
- Kyeong-do… Now…
- Oh, hot.

199
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,474
Why did he do that?

200
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,769
Show me the way.

201
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,770
To where?

202
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,022
Where is Kyeong-do, that asshole? At work?

203
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,066
But it's the weekend.

204
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,153
The weekend… Okay.

205
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,113
Who is it?

206
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,868
Oh, what the hell? Oh, gosh.

207
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,496
I thought you should talk to her
in person, Kyeong-do.

208
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,457
Aren't you going to invite me in?

209
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,958
But I have to get going.

210
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,334
- Se-yeong.
- See you.

211
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,129
This isn't right. No way. Se-yeong.

212
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,007
Talk to each other! Work things out!

213
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,342
Bye! See you!

214
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,888
Damn it…

215
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,232
Shit.

216
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,916
SURELY TOMORROW

217
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,167
"EPISODE 2"

218
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,426
How can Se-yeong bring a stranger
to my house without notice…

219
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,886
Don't be ridiculous.

220
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,263
You think I'm being ridiculous?

221
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:26,681
Don't you think you're too selfish?

222
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,725
What, what do you mean?

223
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,810
You did it first.

224
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:34,356
Taking a stranger to someone else's house
without notice.

225
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,819
SPRING, 2007

226
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,280
It's a relief
that you had your wallet with you.

227
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,532
Did the taxi cost a lot?

228
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,452
What? Oh, I had a nest egg.

229
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,581
Oh, you should've called me.
Then I would've gone to Seoul.

230
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,960
By taxi? Do you have any nest egg?

231
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:59,839
I would borrow it from other guys, well.

232
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,762
Where are we?

233
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,557
That's Se-yeong's house.

234
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,393
Am I sleeping here?

235
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,439
- The other guys sleep here too.
- The other guys too?

236
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,899
Yes, you don't need to worry.

237
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,278
But we have to walk up there quietly.

238
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,326
Come in.

239
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,589
- This? Are we going up here?
- Yes, go up.

240
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,048
- Be careful.
- Okay.

241
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,345
Come in.

242
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,074
Do you see the bed?
We have to go to the bed.

243
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,148
It's okay.

244
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:42,817
Be careful.

245
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,715
Let me send a text.

246
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,258
With mine?

247
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:17,852
To whom?

248
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:18,812
My uncle.

249
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,946
Go to bed.

250
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:32,992
Okay.

251
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,203
Hi, Ji-woo.

252
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,332
Hi, how are you?

253
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,711
How do you think I am?

254
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,047
You guys are hypocrites.

255
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,011
Anyway, don't you all have
your own places?

256
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,387
- Yes.
- Yes.

257
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,181
Then why do you sleep at Se-yeong's house?

258
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,807
That's my question.

259
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,392
Hey, the hangover food is not ready yet.

260
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,685
What about you?

261
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,187
I live with Woo-sik.

262
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,398
Now you're clinging to me too.
Stock up on cup noodles.

263
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,066
Thank you for the food.

264
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,818
You said you'd go home. Why return?

265
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,862
It's love, you jackass.

266
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,947
Being called a jackass
this early in the morning?

267
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,408
Imagine it's a replacement for kimchi.

268
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,578
How can a jackass be kimchi?
What kind of kimchi is that?

269
00:17:58,661 --> 00:17:59,621
Stop it. Jesus!

270
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,747
Wait until it's cooked.

271
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,125
What is wrong with you?
Seriously, gosh. I'm so sick of you.

272
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,754
- Are you not eating?
- Who said I'm not eating! Seriously…

273
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,881
Did you eat?

274
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,674
I had something delicious.

275
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,011
If your mom finds out you slept out,
you're in trouble.

276
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,181
If she's still quiet,
you probably covered it up.

277
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,476
Taking care of you
is harder than driving you around, jeez.

278
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,854
Here, get changed. Don't make it obvious
that you slept outside.

279
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,946
Oh, whatever. Everything pisses me off.

280
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,990
I think I was born at the wrong address.

281
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,201
Hey, don't say that.

282
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,787
Your mother's like that
because she's a cold fish.

283
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,456
But the chairman cherishes you so much.

284
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,042
But what's the point?
He sent me into exile in New York.

285
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,379
Why is that exile?
You were studying abroad.

286
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,631
It felt like exile to me.

287
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:59,097
Anyway, are you going to keep lying?

288
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,765
It's not like you go to this school.

289
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,394
Does anyone know
that you're JARIM's daughter?

290
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:11,860
Mr. Kim, if anyone finds out
that I am JARIM's daughter…

291
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:16,489
then they'll start introducing me
as JARIM's daughter instead of Seo Ji-woo.

292
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:19,117
I don't want that.

293
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,954
Still, if they're true friends...

294
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,582
If they become your friends,
you should tell them.

295
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,750
If they find out later,
they might take it wrong.

296
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,211
I was going to, but…

297
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,009
I missed my timing.

298
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,724
It's awkward to say it now. What do I do?

299
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,609
I have a top secret.

300
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,236
If it'd help you feel better,
I'll tell you.

301
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,821
I'm not curious at all.

302
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,990
No way. That's not true.
I'm sure you are curious.

303
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,285
Gosh, should I tell you or not?

304
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,828
Oh, what is it?

305
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:09,000
Next week, the chairman and your mother
are going on a trip.

306
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,503
- Is that it?
- That's it.

307
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,464
But how is that…

308
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,216
But it's not the first time
they're going on a trip.

309
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,218
You always make me
go up and down like this…

310
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,722
A cruise.
Six countries in Europe. Four weeks!

311
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,187
Really?

312
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,104
Really.

313
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,273
- Really?
- Really!

314
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,610
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim, I love it!

315
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,029
It's okay. Go get changed.

316
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,698
- Mr. Kim, really? Really, really?
- It's okay.

317
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:45,662
<i>"Waiting for Godot."</i>
How's your practice coming along?

318
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,122
As long as Woo-sik does his job,
we're fine.

319
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,832
You mess up the lines more.

320
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,585
I think you need a manager.

321
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:53,795
- Not necessarily.
- You do.

322
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,463
How will the manager take care of us?

323
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,801
Buy water and… prepare snacks.

324
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,927
Also buy cigarettes?

325
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,596
You really want a younger girl
to buy your cigarettes?

326
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,767
What if we run out of cigarettes
while practicing hard?

327
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,394
I'll have cartons ready.

328
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,605
Thank you.

329
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:17,193
From now on, I'll do my best for you
to focus only on the play practice.

330
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,611
But why would you?

331
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,659
So I'm going to provide intensive care
for the next 4 weeks…

332
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:29,580
and you'll have to provide me
with housing.

333
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,874
Wait, housing? Aren't you going home?

334
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,669
Even our house is not stable.
We have overdue rent.

335
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,671
I'll go to Se-yeong's house.

336
00:21:37,547 --> 00:21:38,715
I don't like that.

337
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,969
Kyeong-do needs to practice too,
but the commute will distract him.

338
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,721
You need to give him housing.

339
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,181
Ji-woo, Kyeong-do has only two lines.

340
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,064
But they're important lines.

341
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,984
They're very important.
They're the essence.

342
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,945
See? She's saying I'm not a hypocrite
for the first time.

343
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,114
That's the key to my house. Copy it.

344
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,323
Yes!

345
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,075
Then the key to your house…

346
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,078
You little… The door's open already, jeez.

347
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,664
Down for a drink?

348
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,794
<i>One shot, two shots…</i>

349
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,629
I love it!

350
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,757
Come along, hurry.

351
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,258
Hey, it's on you!

352
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,054
Is it necessary to live together
for four weeks for that?

353
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:29,515
What am I supposed to do
with your dad during that time, son?

354
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,144
Imagine I joined the army.

355
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,646
You're experiencing it in advance.

356
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,106
How about joining the army now?

357
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,486
Dad, spit three times.
I can't join the army now.

358
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:42,570
Spit, spit, spit!

359
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,783
Don't you two fight.

360
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,375
Why is that boy excited, honey?

361
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,336
He said he's going to focus on studying.

362
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,379
Do we have any choice but to trust him?

363
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,842
- You like books?
- Used to read that a lot.

364
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,470
- Comic books. It's your favorite.
- A biography like this…

365
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,140
Oh, that's what you read every morning?

366
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,312
- Hey, I think this is new.
- What?

367
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,314
Wait. Do you want to check it out?

368
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,943
Oh, but there's no reason to go in.
We might as well leave.

369
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,277
What?

370
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,363
- Hey, follow me.
- Vintage…

371
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,866
Well, do you want to come back here later?

372
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,201
Sure.

373
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:34,747
Oh, aren't your parents coming back soon?

374
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,499
Oh… Right.

375
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:41,295
These last few weeks
were the fastest time in my life.

376
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,755
They're coming back already.

377
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,965
Be careful of the car.

378
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,844
Didn't you say they went together?

379
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:49,971
Yes.

380
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,848
What do your parents do?

381
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,519
They sell clothes.

382
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,064
That's why you have a good sense of style.

383
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:03,317
I don't wear what my dad sells.
They don't look good on me.

384
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,989
Wait. Hey, that will look great on you.

385
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,866
I'll work part-time to get it for you.

386
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:12,493
It's okay.
I don't like that kind of style.

387
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,578
No?

388
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,957
I'm hungry. Let's get some tteokbokki.

389
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,375
Hey, Ji-woo.

390
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,752
Yes?

391
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,922
Let's skip tteokbokki today.
We had that twice yesterday.

392
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,634
But it's yummy.

393
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:35,474
Sure, if you like it,
I'll eat it even three times. Let's go.

394
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:36,559
Let's go.

395
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,032
<i>Waiting for Godot.</i>

396
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,535
Maybe it was made for you.
It sounds like "Waiting for Kyeong-do."

397
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:56,787
Right.

398
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:02,460
The two main characters
wait for Godot for fifty years.

399
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,299
"Mr. Godot told me to tell you…

400
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,801
he won't come this evening
but surely tomorrow."

401
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:14,972
Shit…

402
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,898
Godot never comes, but you will, right?

403
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,652
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll always stay next to you.

404
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,695
I'm saying what if.

405
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:33,991
If I said I would wait for you,
would you come?

406
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,202
Of course, I would.

407
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,042
You know what?

408
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,628
People say men shouldn't cry…

409
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,505
but I'm not going to hold it in.

410
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,090
Why not?

411
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:55,137
A line in the play says,
the amount of tears is set.

412
00:25:56,806 --> 00:26:01,519
If someone starts crying,
someone else will stop crying.

413
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,188
So…

414
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,984
If I cry a lot…

415
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,280
you won't be crying.

416
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,702
You're so fucking cool.

417
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,373
Oh, will you stop swearing?

418
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,458
Tell a dog to stop pooping.

419
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,252
Where did you learn that phrase?

420
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,962
From Se-yeong.

421
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,799
Hey, you need to leave that house.
You're becoming more and more weird.

422
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,092
Let's run.

423
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,051
What?

424
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,263
But…

425
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,195
Hey, get up.
Why are you lying on the ground?

426
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,615
Hey, Kyeong-do. Lie down.

427
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,161
Why in the schoolyard…

428
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,413
Jesus.

429
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,086
Isn't it beautiful?

430
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,097
Do you want to sleep with me?

431
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,433
If we sleep here,
your lips will get twisted.

432
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:27,396
You idiot. I didn't mean that sleep.
I meant sex.

433
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,078
Here…

434
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:45,956
Here?

435
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,879
There's no one here.

436
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:56,759
Do you mean it?

437
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,302
It'll be memorable.

438
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,557
You know you're a total maniac, right?

439
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:09,063
Let's do it, Kyeong-do.

440
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,947
Hey. Get up. Get out of my way. Let's go.

441
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:19,698
Let's do it, Kyeong-do.

442
00:28:19,782 --> 00:28:21,117
Are you crazy?

443
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,202
Let's do it. Today is the only chance.

444
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,037
Hey. Are you crazy? Why…

445
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,998
Let's do it, Kyeong-do!

446
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,878
- Let's do it, Kyeong-do. Come on.
- Stop.

447
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,004
Hey, get up.

448
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:38,050
Do it! Just do it!

449
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,264
Gosh, seriously…

450
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,104
Thanks!

451
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,496
Do you still want to wear that shirt?

452
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,374
It's that one, right?

453
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,044
It's a similar one.

454
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,796
So lame.

455
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,926
Eighteen years?
Hey, that should be in museum.

456
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,678
I began wearing it recently.

457
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,181
I couldn't throw it out for your sake.
I'm an F.

458
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,432
The neckline is stretched.

459
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,808
I'm just frugal. Hey.

460
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:31,145
Do you think saving enough
to lease a house like this is easy?

461
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,980
Just be honest with me.

462
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,232
You wore it stretched
because you missed me.

463
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,611
Hey. Forget it.

464
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,279
Why are you stripping?

465
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:46,327
Besides, I told you
to release an article on my divorce.

466
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,496
Then this wouldn't have happened.

467
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:51,624
I knew it since you were arguing
to buy pork cutlet…

468
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,963
Hey, whatever.
Settle it before you go to England.

469
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,215
Why do I have to settle it?

470
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,759
Not sure who took it,
but he wasn't trying to capture me.

471
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,844
He was capturing your chaos.

472
00:30:03,928 --> 00:30:05,262
And I'm the scapegoat.

473
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,598
Sure, let's say that.

474
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:12,061
Then you should've come and asked me.
Why did you send Se-yeong?

475
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,731
What, were you embarrassed
about that funeral statement?

476
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,070
If you're making ends meet as a reporter,
shouldn't you watch your words?

477
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,408
You think you got something on me?
You seem to enjoy this. Here to fight?

478
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,203
I'm not doing it.

479
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,793
Let me go.

480
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,130
Let's do it…

481
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,174
If you want to, act like you want to.

482
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,347
I'm sorry about the funeral statement.
Happy now?

483
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,433
I'm sorry about how you look right now.

484
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,903
PRESS RELEASE PLAN PROPOSAL

485
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,287
All right. Well, something like that.
What was I going to say?

486
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:16,041
With the other guys and Se-yeong,
you and I will take a natural picture.

487
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,920
It was an 18-year friendship.
Is that your concept?

488
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:22,548
- So don't make it look like it was love?
- Exactly.

489
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,383
Then what are these brands?

490
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,887
That is…

491
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,014
<i>It's nothing hard.</i>

492
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:34,727
While taking a picture,
bring me what Seo Ji-woo's wearing.

493
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:35,728
Why?

494
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,439
You know Kim Ga-eul, the editor-in-chief?
Of a fashion magazine?

495
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,732
Why?

496
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,191
Will you stop asking why?

497
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,237
Well, Kim Ga-eul called me.

498
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,741
She said the main brand
of this month is Louis.

499
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:52,536
If Seo Ji-woo wears Louis
from head to toe…

500
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,705
they'll take advantage of it.

501
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,792
Gosh, don't you think that's too much?

502
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,923
Didn't I tell you
that I'm about to resign?

503
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:08,510
Since we're on it already,
we might as well save you, save me,

504
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:12,598
save Dongwoon Daily's Entertainment Team,
and save the fashion magazine, yeah?

505
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,808
Let's all survive together!

506
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:18,729
Oh, why me…

507
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:27,237
All right. But if you don't have
any purses or shoes from this brand, then…

508
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:28,155
You think I don't?

509
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,199
I'm jealous.

510
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,785
Worry about yourself.

511
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,121
Oh, wear this.
It's perfect to bring back memories.

512
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,459
Hey, whatever. Don't do it.

513
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,753
Gosh, do you even know
who caused all this?

514
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:45,506
This will be fun.
Looking forward to seeing the guys.

515
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:46,632
Proceed with it.

516
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,552
Bye.

517
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,766
Oh, right. Don't you exercise?
You're getting a bit of a belly.

518
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,690
Damn it…

519
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:20,165
Hey. Forget it.

520
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:21,458
Why are you stripping?

521
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,506
<i>That's great.</i>

522
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,487
<i>Enjoy.</i>

523
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,660
<i>I'd like some too.</i>

524
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,629
<i>Just be honest with me.</i>

525
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,965
You wore it stretched
because you missed me.

526
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:19,183
You should've thrown it out, you dickhead…

527
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,190
Damn it…

528
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,537
Yes.

529
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,539
I'm on my way.

530
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,792
Oh, did you leave already?

531
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,544
Well, Father's suddenly scheduled
for a meeting.

532
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,174
He was worried
because of the ruckus in the foundation.

533
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:55,260
What do you want?
Do you want to eat by ourselves?

534
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,887
Where are you?

535
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,640
I'm here. Had some business nearby,
so I came early.

536
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,975
I'll be there soon. Let's eat together.

537
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:02,893
<i>Sure.</i>

538
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:03,894
Bye.

539
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,584
When's Ji-woo leaving?

540
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,925
Honey, you should eat.

541
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:37,761
What are you thinking about?

542
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:43,976
I don't plan to get married yet.

543
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:45,978
What?

544
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,648
What about you?

545
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,777
Are you doing this
because your family forced you?

546
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:58,156
That's what I want to know.

547
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,331
Seo Ji-yeon, are you okay?

548
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,251
You don't look good.

549
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:14,423
That doesn't mean I don't like you.

550
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:20,637
It's just everything's happening
all of a sudden. I guess I'm afraid.

551
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,017
So you're saying…

552
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,896
we're getting married soon, is that right?

553
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,984
What's your ideal type?

554
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,114
My ideal type?

555
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,743
That's new.

556
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,079
Here, eat.

557
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,876
The food tastes good today.

558
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,960
Here…

559
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:54,046
- Eat.
- Okay.

560
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,438
<i>They want to add your picture</i>
<i>in the article.</i>

561
00:37:20,364 --> 00:37:21,865
Why add my picture?

562
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:25,202
Hey, just one group photo
isn't enough for the article.

563
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,496
That's not enough for the story,
you know what I mean?

564
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,626
If it's too bothersome to find one,
we can use your photo on your employee ID.

565
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,337
Whatever. Oh, don't do that, seriously.

566
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,507
I'm going to immigrate. Don't do that.

567
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:52,062
Do you have a kimchi fridge in mind?
Get a new one this year.

568
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,731
Everything looks good.

569
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:58,318
But they're all too big
and take up too much space…

570
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,486
so I'm hesitating--

571
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:01,947
What? What brings you home?

572
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,991
Oh, just here to find something.

573
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,472
I'm sure I didn't throw it out.

574
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:34,688
Here…

575
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,817
Oh, here it is.

576
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,027
WAITING FOR GODOT

577
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,159
Let's put it here, honey.

578
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:48,910
Put what?

579
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:52,205
It's not like you're moving back.
Take all your stuff with you.

580
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,583
Mom, if you put the kimchi fridge
in my room…

581
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,501
it'd be too far away for you.

582
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,755
I'm going to remove the wall.
For the house to become brighter.

583
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,549
But we still need a room for him.

584
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:07,387
So when he gets married,
he'd bring his children. That's love.

585
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,181
When will he get married?

586
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,558
I thought he was marrying her,
but she's just a friend.

587
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,729
Lately, I've been thinking,

588
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:19,149
every time I give congratulatory money
at a wedding, I consider it a donation.

589
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:23,487
And I always get sick
when I try to eat as much as I paid.

590
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,203
Dad, I'll get going.

591
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,748
Hey. You started this,
and now you dare run off?

592
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,833
I don't think I can.

593
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,503
Hey, Kyeong-do!

594
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:53,266
You guys overdid it.

595
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,811
- It's not any different from usual.
- I'm the same.

596
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,313
Jeez, you hypocrites.

597
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:32,305
- Oh, Ji-woo. Come here.
- Oh, Ji-woo. You look so pretty.

598
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,432
- You got so pretty!
- Hi, guys.

599
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,184
Oh, Ji-woo!

600
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,562
Me too. I knew you'd come.

601
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,563
Hey, it's been ages.

602
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,982
- It's been too long, right?
- Yes.

603
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,068
Everyone's here.
Let's take a quick picture and leave.

604
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,613
Everyone gathered to save Lee Kyeong-do.
Right? We're so loyal.

605
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:52,993
Are you ready now?
All right. Let's take a picture.

606
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,077
Do you still have that?

607
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:55,453
Questions waste time.

608
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:58,039
Stay outside. Come back when we're ready.
Why're you in such a rush?

609
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,624
He's desperate.

610
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,460
"Desperate…" Ji-woo, you haven't changed.

611
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:03,837
I found this.

612
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,422
Wait, what's this?

613
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,970
I should've seen the Godot play
before I left.

614
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,555
That's what I regret the most.

615
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,516
I regret doing it.
You're lucky that you didn't see it.

616
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,559
Hey, this ass--

617
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,894
Woo-sik, don't.

618
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,562
He totally forgot his lines!

619
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,771
Stop it!

620
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,148
"Ji-woo isn't coming."

621
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,484
"No matter how long I wait,
Ji-woo won't come!"

622
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:30,864
That's what this idiot said on stage.
And then he kept sobbing.

623
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,658
- So, we, we just closed the curtains.
- Oh, stop it.

624
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:36,745
- Right, right, right.
- And from that moment, he began crying…

625
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,080
"Woo-sik, Ji-woo is not coming. Ji-woo…"

626
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,790
Stop it, you asshole!

627
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,506
Lee Kyeong-do, is that true?
Did you really do that?

628
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,305
I was young, immature, and vulnerable.
I was innocent and sincere.

629
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,977
Sincere, my ass. Do you know
how much we spent on the ticket refunds?

630
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,604
Why cling to the past?

631
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:07,234
It was your idea to gather
and bring back the past.

632
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,699
Well, is that Louis?

633
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:16,952
Why wear Louis when my sister has a brand?

634
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,286
The shoes and the bag will do.

635
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,537
I'm wearing Louis, Kyeong-do.

636
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:23,208
Jeong-min doesn't look like
he's wearing a luxury brand.

637
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,503
Cha Woo-sik, have you ever tried on
a luxury brand before? Yeah?

638
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,005
Woo-sik himself is a luxury brand.

639
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:29,923
I am the luxury!

640
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:33,385
I can't tell.
You shouldn't talk about fashion!

641
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,929
I didn't know
we were having a trot singer today here.

642
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,516
Wait, I can see through…

643
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,691
Look here. Dong-won, are you ready?

644
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:48,733
Yes.

645
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,694
He's handsome. Didn't take after his dad.

646
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,029
Ignore her
and focus on taking the picture.

647
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,864
- Focus on me, okay?
- Okay.

648
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:58,576
- Dong-won, is the academy sign in?
- Yes, it's in.

649
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,036
Okay, get ready.

650
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,497
All right.
Count before you take a picture.

651
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,040
One, two, three.

652
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,712
Dad, get closer.

653
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,588
- Let's all change the pose.
- Okay.

654
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,424
- Like the beauty pageant.
- One, two…

655
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,217
This is kind of a pressure.

656
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:46,791
If Woo-sik posts it on his social media,
is your company publishing it?

657
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,043
Yes.

658
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,880
Anyway, thanks.

659
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:59,763
I got to meet the guys before I leave.
Thanks for that.

660
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:05,685
When are you leaving?

661
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,063
Next week.

662
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,529
Eat well when you go to England.

663
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:19,574
I will.

664
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:24,746
Eat well, sleep well.

665
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,915
Poop well.

666
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,295
Hey, being too explicit isn't charming.

667
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:36,925
What? Eating and sleeping are elegant,
but pooping is vulgar?

668
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:43,306
Fine. Eat well, sleep well, poop well.

669
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:46,601
Be careful...

670
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:51,147
when you meet new people,
whoever they are.

671
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,657
As long as I don't meet someone like you.

672
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:05,537
Right.

673
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,872
It's a joke.

674
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,208
Exactly.

675
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,925
Will things calm down
when the article gets released?

676
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:24,013
It doesn't matter to me since I'm leaving,
but I'm worried about you.

677
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:26,975
You got dragged into my mess
and almost had your life messed up again.

678
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:42,782
Wait.

679
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:48,496
You're wrong.

680
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,500
You got two things wrong.

681
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:55,336
I never got dragged into it.

682
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,297
And my life
had never been messed up before.

683
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,054
What a fucking reporter.

684
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:19,027
She never stops swearing.

685
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,259
Why does he have to be so damn kind?

686
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:13,581
Woo-sik. I just got home.
There was no traffic.

687
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,458
- Hey, Kyeong-do.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

688
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:18,127
It was nice to be with Ji-woo again
after a while.

689
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:24,300
Well, there's nothing bad
or good about it…

690
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:30,056
Man, stop lying. Hey, your eyes
were so busy peeping on Ji-woo in secret.

691
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:33,643
Hey, I'm tired.
I have no energy to joke around.

692
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:38,648
You know what?
Well, you'll be at peace if you admit it.

693
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:44,195
Oh, right! Woo-sik,
did I leave that Godot brochure there?

694
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,698
No, I just…

695
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,660
Oh, hey. That was taken out of your bag.

696
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:51,744
By whom?

697
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,540
Which asshole?

698
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,462
WHAT IS YOUR GODOT?

699
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:02,547
<i>Hey, this ass--</i>

700
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,881
Woo-sik, don't.

701
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,425
He totally forgot his lines!

702
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,384
Stop it!

703
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,011
"Ji-woo isn't coming."

704
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:11,097
"No matter how long I wait,
Ji-woo won't come!"

705
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,934
Lee Kyeong-do, is that true?
Did you really do that?

706
00:48:15,018 --> 00:48:19,772
I was young, immature, and vulnerable.
I was innocent and sincere.

707
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,741
BOY LEE KYEONG-DO

708
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,626
<i>You got two things wrong.</i>

709
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,127
I never got dragged into it.

710
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,962
And my life
had never been messed up before.

711
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,146
"Only if one could entreat Elder Wolha…"

712
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,608
So he can…

713
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,621
It's over. That's it.

714
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,331
Fine, just keep it.

715
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:21,292
Now, it's over. The end.

716

<i>"The meeting was reportedly intended</i>
<i>as an opportunity</i>

718
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,981

HER DRESS TOPS THE SEARCH WORD

726
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:25,022
Lee Kyeong-do, nice defense.

727
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,704
Yes, can you look into...

728
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,205
Where's Secretary Cha?

729
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:43,291
She went to a meeting with the PR team.

730
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:45,668
Did she?

731
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,504
Okay.

732
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:01,601
Are you in a meeting?
I need to look something up.

733
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:05,229
Can you get me the contact number
of Reporter Lee Kyeong-do?

734

<i>Ms. Seo is moving alone.</i>

735
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:35,927
Yes, Director Kang.

736
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,305
She didn't say anything.

737
00:51:40,932 --> 00:51:42,099
She took the taxi.

738
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:43,226
Okay, got it.

739
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,648

744
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:46,914
- You must be worried.
- Yes.

745
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,249
Let me check the patient.

746
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:51,919
Here, here.

747
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:53,296
- Oh, my gosh.
- What, why?

748
00:52:56,048 --> 00:53:00,845
This place has a nice color.

749
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,616
- Enjoy.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

750
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:31,083
Wait, I'll eat on my own.
You never did that before.

751
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:34,545
But they grilled the meat for us.
I can't even grab it for you?

752
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:38,591
Oh, this is too much. Seriously.
You should've been nice to me sooner.

753
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:43,137
Then how am I supposed
to thank Assistant Manager Lee Kyeong-do?

754
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:45,890
Okay.

755
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,394
Is it good?

756
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:51,312
Totally.

757
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:05,159
So? Is Seo Ji-woo going to England
or something?

758
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:12,458
Oh, whatever. It's over now. The end.

759
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,085
Okay.

760
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,464
My forever rival Seo Ji-woo is out now.

761
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,466
It's up to me now.

762
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:26,555
Why is Seo Ji-woo Jin Han-kyeong's rival?

763
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,434
Hey, it's been 10 years
since I've been asking you out.

764
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,353
That's why she's my enemy.

765
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,939
You're cutting me off
because you couldn't move on.

766
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:39,694
"Date me and I'll buy you a car."
"Date me and I'll fund your lease."

767
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:44,824
"I got the Louis collaboration sneakers.
If you date me, they're yours."

768
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:46,450
You call that asking me out?

769
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,244
I was asking you out.

770
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,914
Good. I like how you're consistent.

771
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:54,375
Hold on. I have something to show you.

772
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:56,585
You sound determined.

773
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,671
Ta-da.

774
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:01,674
I bought a house in Oksu-dong.

775
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:08,222
Have you seen anyone
buying a house without a mortgage?

776
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,599
Look. That's me.

777
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:13,519
You're showing off.

778
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:16,897
Why do you think I'm showing off?
You should move in with me.

779
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,315
Oh, really?

780
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,528
Oh, don't call your mother already.

781
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:23,487
Come on.

782
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,156
Why are you so hasty?

783
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,699
Still, I should tell her.

784
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,535
- Here, press it.
- Already…

785
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:32,663
Did that not work?

786
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:36,375
Jeez, so cheap. Seriously, so cheap.

787
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,502
- Would you move in if it's Apgujeong?
- So call them.

788
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,212
Put that away. Damn it.

789
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:46,552
Good job. I know that was hard.

790
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,222
So don't say
you want to go for round two after this.

791
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,141
I'm having ice cream.

792
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,560
Seriously, enough with the ice cream.

793
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,981
Hello?

794
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:00,858
Yes.

795
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,528
What? Where?

796
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:23,923
That was fast.

797
00:56:24,465 --> 00:56:25,424
Nice to meet you.

798
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,301
This isn't the first time we've met.

799
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:32,098
We met when you were working
at a hotel buffet in college.

800
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,018
I see.

801
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,021
Anyway, what brings you here?

802
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,566
I wanted to meet you as soon as possible,

803
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:46,112
and if I came here,
I thought you'd come as fast as you could.

804
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,948
Is it about the article today?

805
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:52,493
That too, and I have a favor to ask you.

806
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,792
The article about Ji-woo's ex-husband.

807
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:04,255
Ji-woo already thanked me for that.
Why did you want to see me?

808
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,840
A picture of you two was taken.

809
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:08,300
Yes, to explain that--

810
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:09,593
I took it.

811
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:15,474
I didn't take it myself. I paid someone.

812
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:18,769
Anyway, I reported it.

813
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,115
Why?

814
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,535
To tie Ji-woo down.

815
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:35,494
What?

816
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:38,330
You heard
Ji-woo's going to England, right?

817
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:44,211
If she leaves now,
she'll have no standing.

818
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:46,964
If she leaves now,
she'll have no standing.

819
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:50,092
And you're the only person
who can stop her.

820
00:57:55,014 --> 00:57:58,934
I don't know what you're talking about.

821
00:57:59,018 --> 00:58:01,854
Ji-woo needs to return to the company.

822
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,693
Ji-woo will run JARIM Apparel
better than me.

823
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,653
You saw the article today, right?

824
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,573
The two-piece set that Ji-woo wore
sold out immediately.

825
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:18,078
Ji-woo is better at fashion than I am.

826
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,090
Well then. I had a long day today.

827
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:31,800
Stop Ji-woo.

828
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:39,099
Why are you doing this, really?
There's nothing between me and her.

829
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,645
Really?

830
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:51,028
Were you 28? You and Ji-woo.

831
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:51,946
Look.

832
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:55,449
After Ji-woo left
and your father's treatment was over,

833
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,243
you spent a year drunk.

834
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:05,751
There should be nothing between you two,
but you could still worry about her.

835
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:07,878
Jeez.

836
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,590
What are you pulling at? Huh?

837
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:14,009
Seo Ji-woo and Seo Ji-yeon.
What are you two women doing?

838
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:17,888
Our mom is not a good mom.

839
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,307
Not to mention that my husband is worse.

840
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,977
So what does that have to do with me?

841
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:28,607
Ji-woo will become penniless.

842
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:33,487
If she leaves now...
In a year or two years...

843
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:36,198
Ji-woo…

844
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:43,038
Ji-woo will be a beggar.

845
00:59:45,374 --> 00:59:48,961
My mom is powerless,
and my husband is not a good man.

846
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,588
I'm the only one who can protect Ji-woo.

847
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:55,467
But I'm…

848
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:00,222
I'm losing my memories.

849
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:07,604
I have Alzheimer's.

850
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:17,781
<i>Divorce isn't the best option.</i>

851
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:20,868
<i>It'll take a long time,</i>
<i>and my chances of winning aren't high.</i>

852
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:25,748
If I become blank before that,
my husband will sell the company.

853
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:32,796
<i>I can't explain everything,</i>
<i>why Ji-woo's likely to become penniless.</i>

854
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,718
JARIM APPAREL

855
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:46,602
The only way is for JARIM Apparel
to become Seo Ji-woo's company.

856
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:08,832
<i>My dad and I</i>
<i>are the first generation of JARIM.</i>

857
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:12,336
And Ji-woo has more than enough
to become the second generation of JARIM.

858
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:20,177
<i>Please stop Ji-woo.</i>

859
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,471
Next person in line.

860
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:27,309
<i>If you don't want to talk about old love,</i>
<i>can you do it for your friendship?</i>

861
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:32,147
Hello. Can you show me
your ticket and your passport? Okay.

862
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:36,777
Do you have any luggage?

863
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:37,694
Yes.

864
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:38,737
Can you put it up here?

865
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,782
Let's talk.

866
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:42,908
Are you crazy?

867
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:48,247
First of all, since you're here,
put it up here. It's heavy.

868
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,498
Let's talk.

869
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,916
I have to get on board.

870
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:51,834
Take the next one.

871
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:53,252
This isn't KTX.

872
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:59,133
Sorry about that.
Hey, put it up here first. No, put…

873
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:03,178
Can I have my passport back?
Sorry, I'll be right back.

874
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:04,680
That crazy bastard…

875
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:07,975
Hey, Lee Kyeong-do. Hey!

876
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:11,228
What the heck is wrong with him?
This is crazy.

877
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:19,361
Hey, Lee Kyeong-do. Stop right there. Hey!

878
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:23,532
Oh, seriously.

879
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:27,619
Jeez.

880
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:36,837
Oh, sir! Stop him. That guy.
Catch him. Hurry!

881
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,090
Sir, can we have a moment?

882
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,301
Yes. We know each other.

883
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:44,636
Mom?

884
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,096
Catch him.

885
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,932
- Wait, wait. I'm not a bad guy.
- Let's talk over there.

886
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,767
Come with us.

887
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,936
Wait.

888
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:04,239
SURELY TOMORROW

889
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,533
I thought it was a color film.

890
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,452
Black and white makes it look cool.

891
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,703
Say it again to Ji-woo's face.

892
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,872
Our matching items aren't visible.

893
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,415
It's not visible!

894
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:17,753
Why's this a big deal?
Shouldn't have brought the camera. Shit.

895
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,005
I feel black and white.
Let's grab a drink.

896
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,924
Sure, it's on, black and white Jeong-min.

897
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:25,260
I developed it too.
Don't you have a sense of shame?

898
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:29,223
Ji-woo.

899
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,060
You look pretty
because it's black and white.

900
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,645
You want a punch in the face?

901
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,438
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

902
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:39,441
Kyeong-do. Kyeong-do?

903
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:24,194
I turned off the gas valve. I ran out of
underwear, so I took one of yours.

904
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,197
No questions, please.

905
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,949
<i>Is running away your specialty?</i>

906
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,994
Did you get on top of him?

907
01:04:32,077 --> 01:04:35,455
<i>I just pulled a prank</i>
<i>to see what he's like.</i>

908
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,500
<i>Do you really like me?</i>

909
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:42,004
You never blame me even a little.
That pisses me off even more.

910
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,380
What do you want me to do then?

911
01:04:45,841 --> 01:04:48,760
<i>There should be a thesis about you two.</i>
<i>You guys are weird.</i>

912
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:53,390
<i>I went when I was 20</i>
<i>and when I was 28. I'm worried.</i>

913
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,391
Is it love?
