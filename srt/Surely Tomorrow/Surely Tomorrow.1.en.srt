- Hi.
- Hello.

00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,102
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

7
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,020
Hello.

8
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,106
<i>What do you mean I'm not at work</i>
<i>when I just clocked out?</i>

9
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,983
<i>You know I worked all night long.</i>

10
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,487
<i>I even put the cursor</i>
<i>on the submit button.</i>

11
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:55,074
<i>Tell that idiot department manager</i>
<i>to just click on that.</i>

12
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,494
And tell her that this idiot
assistant manager is at breakfast.

13
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:04,041
Has… the article been uploaded?

14
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,253
<i>However, it is questionable to say</i>
<i>whether they actually helped</i>

15
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,090
<i>in reducing damage</i>
<i>or showed any physical measures.</i>

16
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,009
<i>The level of fine dust is worrisome…</i>

17
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,135
Okay.

18
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,346
<i>Our government and the US NASA…</i>

19
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,477

<i>Assistant Manager,</i>
<i>the article on An Da-hye's been posted.</i>

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,440
<i>…up to 71%.</i>

22
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:32,403
<i>It was mostly influenced by Shandong,</i>
<i>which is in the same latitude.</i>

23
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,656
<i>Today, the Central Bank's</i>
<i>Monetary Policy Committee</i>

24
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,491
<i>set the fixed interest rate at 3.9%.</i>

25

<i>The economic growth rate</i>

26
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,831

30
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:58,512
It's hot!

31
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,389
Damn it!

<i>Actress An Da-hye's alleged affair</i>

33
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,396
<i>The man involved</i>

34
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,399
<i>The main issue</i>
<i>is the suspicion of An Da-hye's drug use.</i>

35
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,776
<i>I'll cooperate fully</i>
<i>with the investigation.</i>

36
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,738

<i>- An Da-hye did drugs.</i>

44
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,964
<i>It could become an owner-level risk</i>

46
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,968
<i>The public is paying attention.</i>

47
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,430
Now that I've lived long enough,

48
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,933
I wonder how one's life
can be that turbulent.

49
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,561
I mean, why can't she just live quietly?

50
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,607
Why did she have to marry
a jerk like him of all men? Jeez.

51
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,154
You know what?

52
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,781
I yelled at my manager

53
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,992
that this is a current affairs piece,
not entertainment.

54
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,995
He'll end up at his father-in-law's
JARIM Apparel anyway.

55
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,665
How is this entertainment?
Am I wrong, Se-yeong?

56
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,917
Are you seriously asking me?

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,504
You need a top actress to blow it up.

58
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,632
He's just upset.
You really think he doesn't know?

59
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,634
Why ask if he already knows?

60
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,928
He just wants comfort, got it?

61
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,682
"I did my best.
It wasn't me who ruined Ji-woo's life."

62
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,267
This isn't the first time
her life's been ruined.

63
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,852
And she's firm.

64
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,814
Meanwhile, unsteady Kyeong-do
is pouring a morning drink.

65
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,110
Se-yeong, you know
I quit drinking when I was 30.

66
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,530
Why did you call us
if you're only going to talk to Se-yeong?

67
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:43,242
Hey, punk, because Se-yeong is
the most reasonable among us, you idiot.

68
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,786
- Are you saying I'm…
- Hey, will you shut up?

69
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:48,831
Are you going to drink?

70
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,008
Kyeong-do.

71
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:00,968
- Are you scared?
- I am.

72
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,761
- You want me to call her?
- No.

73
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,972
Don't you do that, Se-yeong.

74
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,684
And by chance, if she calls you,
don't give her my number.

75
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:09,977
You know that, right--

76
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,276
What's up with this timing?

77
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,195
MANAGER JIN HAN-KYEONG

78
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,031
Oh, it's the department manager.

79
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:23,991
Hello?

80
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,326
What? Okay.

81
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:29,997
Bye.

82
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,957
- You're leaving?
- What?

83
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,668
- After calling us all here?
- My work is calling me back.

84
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,879
I turned back from a business trip
to see you.

85
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,507
Gosh.

86
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,809
What?

87
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:53,604
I heard you had soju with your breakfast.

88
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,690
- So?
- You won't even have a beer with us.

89
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,443
- I'm disappointed.
- Didn't you hear? It was just a bottle.

90
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,653
Why order it if you won't drink it?

91
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,655
- By the way--
- No personal questions.

92
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,785
Please go to a sauna,
or at least the shower room.

93
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,828
You smell like a widower. Okay?

94
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,707
What is this?

95
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,375
Return to your seat

96
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,545
and enjoy watching
the surprised emojis on your article.

97
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:19,755
Okay.

98
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:25,302
An article on An Da-hye
made him drink soju.

99
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,680
Did you date An Da-hye?

100
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,896
I've seen many stuck on their first love,

101
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,524
but you're the only one
who couldn't move on for 18 years.

102
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,234
Am I right, Lee Kyeong-do?

103
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,820
You're making up a story.

104
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,532
You're not worried
about An Da-hye or her affair.

105
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,533
Stop it, seriously.

106
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,077
Did you drink soju in the morning

107
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,497
because you were worried about
the wife of An Da-hye's man?

108
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,751
It's humanism.

109
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,046
Hey, did you date Seo Ji-woo?

110
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,214
Use my title, idiot.

111
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,758
Assistant Manager,
did you really date Seo Ji-woo?

112
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,886
Have you ever bitten this before?
Try it today.

113
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,429
You know what happens then?

114
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,431
He'll write an article with his fingers.

115
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,391
Go to a sauna.

116
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,353
What is that?

117
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,064
- Go away. Go. Seriously.
- Okay.

118
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,579
Intern, aren't you going home?

119
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,789
I'm about to.

120
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:36,707
Yeah?

121
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,974

00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,256
How do I wait for an hour?
There's nothing but buildings here.

126
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,468
Oh, I don't know.

127
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,555
Call me when you're off then. Bye.

128
00:08:58,622 --> 00:08:59,623
What the…

129
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:01,583
Where did it go?

130
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:09,967
What the heck?

131
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,178
What are you doing?

132
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,348
- I lost a 500-won coin.
- Just come already.

133
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,934
But I need that
for a banana-flavored milk.

134
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,103
Why did it have to be a 500-won coin?

135
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,521
Gosh.

136
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,191
Hurry up!

137
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,446
Damn it.

138
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,114

JUWON UNIVERSITY CLUB FESTIVAL

141
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:34,134
All students of Juwon,
join the comedy club!

142
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,606
You over there.

143
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,027
- Me?
- Decided which club to join yet?

144
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,696
I'm not joining any club.

145
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,573
Okay.

146
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,826
Then why don't you come
and have a seat here?

147
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,876
Oh, it's an acting club?

148
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,586
Once you hear the history of Chaos--

149
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,213
I'm not into acting.

150
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,090
Oh, actually, neither am I.

151
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,174
Have a good day.

152
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,259
Not so fast. You can't just leave.

153
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,261
What?

154
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,848
Will you sit here just for five minutes?

155
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,267
Me?

156
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,023
Because I have to go poop,
and I can't leave here unattended.

157
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,358
Can you stay here for a second?

158
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,860
Well, that is kind of…

159
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,071
Oh, my stomach.

160
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:40,367
You know if I end up pooping here,
I won't just let it slide, okay?

161
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,452
But I'm just a passerby…

162
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,163
If anyone comes,
give the application form to them.

163
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,248
- But…
- Thanks!

164
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,625
Oh, I almost pooped.

165
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,850
If it's an acting club,
do you put on a play too?

166
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:09,229
Don't tell me… A newbie?

167
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,024
What makes you say "Don't tell me"?

168
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,152
Do you need a mirror?

169
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,699
- Fill it out.
- What?

170
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,033
CHAOS CLUB APPLICATION FORM

171
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,494
You just told me to look in the mirror.

172
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,663
I meant you look old
for your age, not ugly.

173
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,540
You're perfect for the lead role.

174
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:37,883
You have a weird way of talking.

175
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,685
NAME - LEE KYEONG-DO

176
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:54,107
Your name is Lee Kyeong-do?
As in latitude and longitude?

177
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,447
Journalism and broadcasting major?
Want to be a producer?

178
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,035
Are you a senior? Why do you talk like--

179
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,163
I got you one.

180
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,081
Is it ultimately about beauty?

181
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,334
I sat here for two days,
but I got nothing.

182
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,544
Beauty? Who?

183
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,755
How rude when we just met.

184
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,924
You dropped the honorifics to me first.
Get a grip.

185
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:23,303
Hey, why raise voices between newbies?

186
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,221
A newbie?

187
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,681
What? Did I say I was a senior?

188
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,435
No.

189
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,648
Then why are you making a damn fuss?
Bye now.

190
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,405
All right. Write down your number.

191
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,698
Let me catch her first.

192
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:44,783
Hey.

193
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,409
What?

194
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,287
Are we done now?

195
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,290
- No, no. Your email as well.
- What? Email? Email…

196
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,253
- Are we done now? Bye.
- Yes, thanks.

197
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,630
Good luck. I'll call you!

198
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,923
A make-up class?

199
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,510
Gosh, why are you studying so hard?

200
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,304
Whatever, I'm leaving.

201
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,140
I'll just see you in Apgujeong.

202
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,267
Hey, newbie!

203
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,730
Hey, but your school is pretty fun.
I'm hanging up.

204
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,696
Hey, since you were rude to me,
you need to apologize.

205
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,199
Let's face it. You look old.
I bet you hear that a lot.

206
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,746
It's the first time.
And who are you to judge me?

207
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,084
I was only expressing
what I saw and what I felt.

208
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,670
You're getting unnecessarily angry.

209
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,092
You're living in your own world.
Do you seriously think that?

210
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,887
You're laughing?

211
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,475
I'm bored. Do you want to grab a drink?

212
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,396
Hey, don't you have common sense?

213
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:01,276
So let's decide over a drink
if I'm clueless or if you indeed look old.

214
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,487
Hey, the sun is still high up,
and I have a class.

215
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,572
You're that upright?

216
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,576
A student studying at school
isn't being upright, but it's a given.

217
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,328
Oh, whatever.

218
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,749
Latitude, longitude, Kyeong-do.
Let's make a globe together in peace.

219
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,585
Hey, what's your name then? What's yours?

220
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,296
After the first toast,
I'll show you my ID.

221
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,966
By any chance, are you a light drinker?

222
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,681
Hey. That's ridiculous.

223
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,643
I could line up empty bottles
all the way to your house.

224
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:35,560
Want to see?

225
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:36,811
But I live in Busan.

226
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,482
Your hometown?

227
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,277
It's a lie, you idiot.
Let's go. I'll line up the bottles.

228
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,200
Damn it.

229
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,329
Cheers.

230
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,507
I'm Ji-woo. Seo Ji-woo.

231
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,424
What major?

232
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,099
Cheers.

233
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,323
English literature.

234
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,826
Hey, did you retake the college exam
three times?

235
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,911
You definitely seem older than me.

236
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,288
I've looked like this since grade 7.

237
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,666
This isn't Yonsei or Korea U.
Why repeat three times?

238
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,795
Jeez, you sounded like my mom.
You're so fucking annoying.

239
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:44,921
A penalty shot for you.

240
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,471
Too much?

241
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,766
I'll play along, kid.

242
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,068
It's sweet.

243
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,988
Excuse me. One more soju, please.

244
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,823
It's so sweet.

245
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,041
It's no use.

246
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,256
The school shuttle
has stopped running for the night.

247
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,761
Kyeong-do can't go home.

248
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,389
Do you want me to sleep with you?

249
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,023
Were you excited?

250
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,067
See you.

251
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,783
Gosh, seriously…

252
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:01,331
Shit.

253
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,252
Shit. That maniac, seriously.

254
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,596
- Hey, Mr. Kim.
- Gosh.

255
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,308
Go easy on the drinking.

256
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,064
- Okay.
- Can you tell?

257
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,525
Your booze smell's getting me drunk.
I'd fail a breath test.

258
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,944
What about your car?

259
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,279
My friend took it.

260
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,700
Anyway, what were you doing here?

261
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,787
You know Ha-yeong, right?

262
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,331
- Your friend from the US?
- Yes, her.

263
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,041
She goes to this school.

264
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,710
I was here to meet her…

265
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,050
Oh, but this school is so fun.

266
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,387
- Should I go here instead?
- What about your school in the US?

267
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,932
Oh, whatever. I'm going to sleep.

268
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,572
Newbie. Hey.

269
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,451
Oh, thank you.

270
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,786
Let's go.

271
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,038
What? Where?

272
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,999
- Do you live on your own?
- No.

273
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,126
- Are you taking a taxi?
- No.

274
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,795
Then drink more!

275
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,090
Let's go!

276
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:38,428
Come with us. Let's go.

277
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,570
Just go home, Woo-sik.

278
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,906
Why crash in the club room? We have homes.

279
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,700
And leave Kyeong-do alone?
Didn't I sound cool?

280
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,038
Do I look old?

281
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,039
You're helpless.

282
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,457
That's why he's with us.

283
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,250
What? Did someone say you look old?

284
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,210
Was it a girl?

285
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,298
No…

286
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,177
Do you think she's interested in me?

287
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,387
- But she said you look old.
- Yes.

288
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,849
Can you tell a girl you're interested in
that she looks old?

289
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,267
No.

290
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,691
Were you excited?

291
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,276
Shit…

292
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,447
Hey, where are you going?
Senior, where are you going?

293
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,752
Did you take care of the hangover?

294
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,714
Get out of my sight.

295
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,382
Let's go.

296
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,927
Go… Hey, go where?
The class is about to start soon.

297
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,221
- That's why we have to go now.
- Go where?

298
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,307
Hey, hey, but…

299
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,535
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I said, see you.

300
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,996
This is too one-sided. What do you want?

301
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,873
- Where did you sleep last night?
- Why care?

302
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,499
- We're not strangers.
- Then what are we?

303
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,170
We almost slept together.

304
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,087
What?

305
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:26,304
No. That's not true.
Are you out of your mind?

306
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,016
Maybe I am. You look handsome to me.

307
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,434
What?

308
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,106
If you keep acting up, I'll get mad.

309
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,191
You're so fucking cute.

310
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,817
Oh, can't you speak without swearing?

311
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,486
Where did you sleep?

312
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,364
I slept in the club room with strangers
because of you.

313
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,700
Did you join Chaos? I should join too.

314
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,079
Don't, or I'm going to withdraw.

315
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,919
- How many classes do you have today?
- Why do you ask?

316
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,003
Mind your own business.

317
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,630
- Let's drink.
- Drink?

318
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,883
Hey, I feel like throwing up
whenever I see green because of you.

319
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,176
I'll see you later.

320
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,970
When your class is over,
is it 5 p.m.? 6 p.m.?

321
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,473
See you in the club room.

322
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,558
Gosh, get lost.

323
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,812
- Stop talking back.
- Talking back…

324
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,818
Jesus. That…

325
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,277
Oh, I'm sorry.

326
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,994
Damn it, she ordered two.

327
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:36,374
All right, today, we talked about
how media affects our consciousness

328
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:40,711
when we view it as a medium
and a technical ecology.

329
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:47,093
By next class,
make sure to read Chapter 3,

330
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,178
Authoritarian Media Theory.

331
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:50,555
Yes, sir.

332
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,809
It's over, you prick.
Have the candy and go home.

333
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,689
Thank you.

334
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,735
Oh, you're actually loyal.
You're pressuring us.

335
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,779
Oh, drinking friends?
That's hard to resist.

336
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:07,822
Are you down for a drink?

337
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,241
- What? No.
- Then why are you here?

338
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:11,659
Well…

339
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:13,870
To become friends.

340
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,580
Shit, that's so much pressure.

341
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,791
What if your name were Wi-do?

342
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,209
Kyeong-do is better.

343
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,800
Why bother me smoking
when you've got nothing to do here?

344
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,594
I'm okay. Feel free to smoke.

345
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,723
How can I feel free?
Why don't you stop your fake cough?

346
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,395
Well… Where are the other members?

347
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,439
The three of us will do.

348
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,398
Sorry?

349
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,026
We got to secure
the club room again this year.

350
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,029
We finally have a newbie.

351
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,615
If one door closes,
another door opens, right?

352
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,701
When we were just about to get kicked out,
we got a newbie.

353
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,287
- Who brought him in?
- Right.

354
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:01,542
So are you saying if I withdraw,
you're at risk of closing or something?

355
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,419
Don't ask. It breaks my heart.

356
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,925
Hey, this is awesome.
We'll get to put on a play.

357
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,969
Hey, stamp the application form now.

358
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,179
Stamp with your thumbprint.

359
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,889
You were good at acting earlier.

360
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,978
CURRENT AFFAIRS

361
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,453
YOU'VE GOT A CALL
MOM

362
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,422
Hello?

363
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:50,716
<i>Ji-woo, what have you been up to lately?</i>

364
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:55,179
Well, I'm out to meet a friend.

365
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,224
This is why I told you
to stay in New York.

366
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,893
Did you come back to waste your time?

367
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,566
If you're going to take care of yourself,
do it properly.

368
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,485
I'm hanging up.

369
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,304
What are you doing here?

370
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,518
What are you doing? It's dark.

371
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,521
I'm listening to music.

372
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,149
Aren't you going home?

373
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,734
I will.

374
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:58,821
Get up.

375
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:01,490
Go first.

376
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,746
Thought you were tough. What happened?
You sorry for breaking your promise?

377
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,667
Did you wait for me?

378
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,754
Am I crazy? Why would I wait for you?

379
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,423
Then how do you know I didn't show up?

380
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,135
Well…

381
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:26,557
I had a club meeting. I had to be there.

382
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,058
Got it?

383
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,363
What?

384
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,450
Do you want to listen to what I like?

385
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,872
Whatever.
If you're not going, I'll go first.

386
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:50,789
Okay.

387
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,631
Gosh.

388
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:02,885
It's dark here.

389
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,388
The last bus will leave soon.
There'll be no one around.

390
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:07,890
So?

391
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,141
Get up. It's dangerous.

392
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,143
Are you worried about me?

393
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,895
Are you emotionally deprived?

394
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,772
Why do you keep
giving meaning to everything?

395
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,173
Wait, I mean, I…

396
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,301
Well, I was just…

397
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,304
Isn't my acting good?

398
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,766
- Aren't I perfect for the acting club?
- Jeez…

399
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,398
Oh, get a grip. Just get up.
The bus will leave soon.

400
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:02,152
I'm good at swearing, right?

401
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:03,404
Don't be proud of it.

402
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,738
Don't I look strong?

403
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,240
You look dumb.

404
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,744
I only practiced it to look strong.
You're so fucking annoying.

405
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,997
"So fucking" is all you can say.

406
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,457
I mean, do you want to look strong?

407
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:16,792
Yes.

408
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,545
What for with that pretty-ish face?

409
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,180
Did you just ask me out?

410
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:31,807
What?

411
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,810
You just asked me out.

412
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,980
I… I did?

413
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,191
How?

414
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:42,526
You just called me pretty.

415
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:50,367
I said you had a pretty-ish face.
I didn't exactly say pretty.

416
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,202
I was only encouraging you
to stop swearing.

417
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,873
If you say things like that
without meaning them,

418
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:56,790
you're a real bastard.

419
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:03,839
Wait up.

420
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,425
If I miss the bus,
I'd be sleeping out for two days in a row.

421
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,264
Oh, hurry up. There's no time for texting.

422
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:13,724
Okay, okay.

423
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,065
- Let's run.
- What?

424
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,414
What were you listening to earlier?

425
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:35,973
SUNG SI-KYUNG

426
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,266
TWO PEOPLE

427
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,646
<i>After a long day</i>

428
00:33:43,272 --> 00:33:46,442
<i>Under the moonlight, two people</i>

429
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,778
<i>Become one shadow</i>

430
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,698
<i>If I close my eyes</i>

431
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:58,036
<i>Faint happiness that I could catch</i>

432
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,958
<i>Is still there</i>

433
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,631
<i>A broken heart</i>

434
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,676
<i>May cast a shadow</i>

435
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,972
<i>Over your dream</i>

436
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,683
<i>But remember</i>

437
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:26,440
<i>That someone who loves you until it hurts</i>

438
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:30,444
<i>Is still next to you</i>

439
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:35,407
<i>Although this road</i>

440
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:38,243
<i>Seems too far</i>

441
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:44,875
<i>Although the sad heart makes you cry</i>

442
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:51,548
<i>Until everything becomes a memory</i>

443
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,634
<i>The two of us…</i>

444
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,762
- Are you taking the subway?
- What about you?

445
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,306
I'm taking another bus.

446
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:03,769
Bye.

447
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,064
Bye.

448
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,611
Do you have a cell phone?

449
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,072
Why?

450
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,115
Your cell phone…

451
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,206
Give me your number.

452
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,349
Give me your phone.

453
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:15,507
<i>You don't look old. You look young.</i>

454
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,525
Shit.

455
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,074
INCOMING CALL
SE-YEONG

456
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,501
Hey, Se-yeong.

457
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:35,337
<i>- Hi, Kyeong-do. Where are you?</i>
- Oh, I'm home.

458
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,297
<i>What are you doing?</i>

459
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,382
I'm just chilling.

460
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,342
<i>Right, you should get some rest.</i>

461
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,426
Did you get home safely?

462
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,594
<i>Yes, sure.</i>

463
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:47,933
<i>You see, Ji-woo wants to talk to you.</i>

464
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,226
No, never.

465
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:56,066
I mean, what's there to talk about?
It's not like I published that article.

466
00:37:56,149 --> 00:38:00,237
I barely remember her face.
It has nothing to do with me.

467
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,948
<i>I know. Yeah, you have a point, but…</i>

468
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,533
Shit, I knew it.

469
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:07,119
I should've sent it
to the Current Affairs Team. Damn it.

470
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:13,250
Anyway, Se-yeong, that can't be done.

471
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,378
You also think that's wrong, right?

472
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,298
Yeah, I'm sorry,
but take care of it for me.

473
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,883
Yeah. Bye.

474
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:28,181
No, not me. What did I do wrong?

475
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:31,184
I did nothing. No!

476
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:33,562
Shit…

477
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,115
Hello, Dongwoon Daily Entertainment.

478
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,745
That's not our department.

479
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,165
I'm not sure. Maybe Current Affairs?

480
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,542
Yes, I'll connect you
to the person in charge.

481
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,924
Assistant Manager,
when did you go out with Seo Ji-woo?

482
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:09,139
What if she comes to see you?
How many years has it been?

483
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:10,057
Hey.

484
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,060
Well, I've heard that she visited you
when you were a newbie reporter.

485
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,314
Hey.

486
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,611
Hello, Dongwoon Daily Entertainment.

487
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:23,945
Yes.

488
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,616
Lee Kyeong-do?

489
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,328
Well, why are you looking for him?

490
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,081
Oh, you're his acquaintance…

491
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:37,125
But he's not available.

492
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,753
Business trip. Say I'm on a business trip.

493
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,671
He's on a business trip.

494
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,965
I'll let him know when he returns.
What's your name?

495
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,264
Jeez.

496
00:39:51,348 --> 00:39:52,599
It was a woman.

497
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,351
Will you shut up?

498
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:59,606
It was exactly the voice
of a woman of Seo Ji-woo's age.

499
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,108
Will you go back to your seat?

500
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,944
- Okay.
- Damn you.

501
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:11,326
Gosh, so annoying.

502
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,465
OVER A THOUSAND RI AWAY,
I WILL DIE AND YOU LIVE

503
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:36,560
BOOK CONCERT FOR THE PUBLICATION
OF CHUSA'S LETTERS WITH THE AUTHOR

504
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,984
You call this a concert?

505
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,777
It is. It's a book concert.

506
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,322
What?

507
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,452
It's not too late now. Let's go.

508
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,204
Oh, it's starting. It's starting.

509
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,259
When Chusa was seven, he wrote
a New Year's banner to hang on his gate.

510
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,220
And Beonam Chae Je-gong,
who was passing by,

511
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:15,473
saw his writing and said,
"What an excellent writing."

512
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,894
As you can see, Chusa had
an outstanding talent since he was little

513
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,812
and was renowned for his calligraphy.

514
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,648
He also left many poems.

515
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,820
Oh, if you know
any of Chusa Kim Jeong-hui's poems,

516
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:31,531
please raise your hand.

517
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,705
- Yes.
<i>- Domangsi.</i>

518
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,541
<i>Domangsi </i>by Chusa. Bravo!

519
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,419
- Come on up.
- Go there?

520
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,881
Come here. You deserve a gift certificate.

521
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,049
Oh, yes.

522
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,803
<i>Domangsi </i>is also my favorite poem.

523
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,224
I actually proposed to my wife with it.

524
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,601
Thank you.

525
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:11,613
Do you like books?

526
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,115
No.

527
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,326
You looked like a Korean literature major.

528
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,540
I only like Chusa.

529
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,878
That poem.

530
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,506
- Was it <i>Domangsi?</i>
- Yes.

531
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,049
Did you memorize it?

532
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:32,676
Yes.

533
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,095
- Recite it.
- What?

534
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:40,809
- Here?
- Yes.

535
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,813
I'm curious. The title sounds funny.

536
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:46,940
What kind of name is <i>Domangsi?</i>

537
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,069
That's what I thought too.

538
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,697
I thought the title was funny.

539
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,201
But <i>"domang" </i>doesn't mean to run away.

540
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:03,123
Chusa loved his wife so much,

541
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,668
but she died first.

542
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,297
That's when he wrote this poem.

543
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:24,352
"Only if one could entreat Elder Wolha

544
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,898
that we be born
with fates exchanged in the next life."

545
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:34,279
"Over a thousand ri away,
I will die and you live."

546
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:40,452
"Then you shall know
the depth of my sorrow."

547
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:03,433
Wait.

548
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,686
Are you crying?

549
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,064
But why…

550
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,233
It's so sad.

551
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,402
What?

552
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,245
Hey, he must have missed his wife so much
to write such a poem.

553
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,214
I know.

554
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,187
Hey, by the way,

555
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:54,484
I guess you're not that much of a maniac.

556
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,739
Hey…

557
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,493
You're so annoying.

558
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:01,069
You scare me when you smile.
Just cry or eat me up.

559
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,779
Don't you have pride?

560
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,073
- You never change.
- What do you mean?

561
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,867
How can you be wearing my brand?

562
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,959
I got this so you'd thrive.
Is that a problem?

563
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,294
I'm thriving even without your purchases.

564
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:19,504
Sure.

565
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,219
Well…

566
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:29,222
What was that? The article--

567
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:32,225
I disappeared ten years ago
and finally showed up now.

568
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,144
Why would you want
to talk about the article?

569
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:39,732
I can see that you haven't been well.
How's your health?

570
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:43,152
Still the same. I'm exhausted
from all the psychiatric medication.

571
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,825
You still make me speechless.

572
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:54,247
Is it good?

573
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,749
I drink it 'cause it's awkward,
not 'cause it's good.

574
00:47:56,833 --> 00:48:00,211
Or maybe because you're nervous?
Why don't you have a beer instead?

575
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,386
Ji-woo.

576
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,723
- Just say it.
- Are you sure?

577
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:15,602
- Want me to say what I want?
- Yeah, do it.

578
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,614
Godot never comes even if you wait,

579
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,283
but you'll come, won't you?

580
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,916
I've waited to see if you'd really come.

581
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,690
We're members of society now, right?

582
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:08,446
Why would you bring up a mere play
we did when we were 20?

583
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,992
A mere play?

584
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:25,380
Coward.

585
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,019
WAITING FOR GODOT

586
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,566
The name of the play is <i>Waiting for Godot?</i>

587
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,026
Yes.

588
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,070
Do you like plays?

589
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:52,115
I'm not sure yet.

590
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,659
Then why did you join the acting club?

591
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,995
- You're too pathetic to walk away from.
- You scared me.

592
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,580
Your arm is shaking so much.

593
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,082
Hey, hey.

594
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,212
You're the poop girl, right?

595
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:08,339
Poop? Did you poop somewhere again?

596
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:11,300
It's a misunderstanding.
Restrooms aren't just for pooping.

597
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:14,554
I know, but you said your stomach hurt,

598
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,181
and if you pooped there,
I wouldn't be able to get away with it,

599
00:50:17,265 --> 00:50:18,099
and you ran away.

600
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:21,477
That's poop. That was definitely poop.
You really pooped. You always poop…

601
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:22,437
Hey.

602
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,606
Hold on. Are you the one
who got Lee Kyeong-do to join the club…

603
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,816
Yes, that's me.

604
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,448
Kyeong-do, you two argued nonstop,
and now you're dating?

605
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,741
Yes.

606
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:37,994
Too busy dating to come to the club room?
Have you memorized the script?

607
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,454
Are you performing? The lead role?

608
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,165
He doesn't have the lead role's face.

609
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,459
Whatever. Let's go.
The drink is getting cold.

610
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,960
Why would the drink get cold?

611
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,796
- Are you off to drink?
- Yes.

612
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,423
- Oh, no.
- Why not?

613
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,133
- Want to join us?
- Her eyes have gone crazy.

614
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,969
- Why are you getting excited about this?
- Let's go!

615
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,053
No!

616
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:57,513
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

617
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,142
MOM

618
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,438
Kyeong-do.

619
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:06,439
He's over there.

620
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,191
Kyeong-do!

621
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:09,609
Yes?

622
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,571
Speak casually.
Honorifics? That's all hypocritical.

623
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,616
There you go again.
You're the biggest hypocrite.

624
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,618
Se-yeong, what's your major?

625
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:22,789
Fine arts. But it's all hypocritical.

626
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,583
Art? Shit, tell it to fuck off.

627
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:29,170
Cover your ears. She swears
every time she opens her mouth.

628
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:32,590
Se-yeong, you're so good at swearing.
You should teach me.

629
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:34,175
Kyeong-do, you should break up.

630
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,301
She has a kind heart.

631
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:38,805
Have you seen it?
Gosh, have you opened her up?

632
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,848
You can see it without opening it up.

633
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,976
This prick is a damn hypocrite too.

634
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,646
How can you see it?
That's the poop talking.

635
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,816
- See? Your life is all about poop.
- Seriously! I…

636
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,527
If you're poop, I'm fucked up. I really…

637
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,903
Oh, not again…

638
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:55,112
MOM

639
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:58,366
- Don't you have to go? Let's go.
- It's okay. I'm fine.

640
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,660
What? Where do you think you're going?
We've only started.

641
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,078
I think Ji-woo has to go.

642
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,872
Oh, aren't you all going home?

643
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,082
We all live on our own.

644
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,501
You do? I want to be independent too.

645
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,544
No, you can't. No, no.

646
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,254
Oh, no. You'll end up like her. Okay?

647
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:13,089
What do you mean, you prick?

648
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:16,384
No, sorry. My neck hurts.
Come down. No! Don't! Stop it!

649
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:21,222
Will you stop fighting for goodness' sake?
Oh, stop it, please.

650
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,515
Hello?

651
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:27,353
Is this why you took a leave of absence?
As soon as you enrolled?

652
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:32,149
Mom, I don't want
to go back to that school.

653
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,443
Ji-woo, please!

654
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,362
I can't get anything into my head.

655
00:52:37,697 --> 00:52:40,074
And I'm not interested
in Western art history at all.

656
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,911
You don't study because you like it.

657
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:47,248
You need a BA to get somewhere.
A proper degree.

658
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:51,752
So I'll go to a university here.

659
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:55,381
I'll prepare
for the college entrance exam.

660
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,258
Please?

661
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,805
Why can't you live with some pride?

662
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,725
What do you lack?

663
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:07,894
I got you everything you wanted,

664
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:09,896
but you can't stop taking
the depression medication.

665
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:10,897
Why…

666
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,402
Why is your life such a mess?

667
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:24,911
Read the room, please, Ji-woo.

668
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:59,505
Oh, my phone.

669
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,470
What's wrong? What happened?

670
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,559
I'm pathetic, aren't I?
For coming here with nothing…

671
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,105
I'm pathetic, aren't I, Kyeong-do?

672
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,024
No. Why would you be?

673
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:04,820
I'm happy that you came to see me.

674
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,170
I like you.

675
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:38,771
Ji-woo.

676
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:44,902
Do you know why I joined the acting club?

677
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,203
Because…

678
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,541
you were sitting at that table.

679
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:18,894
I actually joined the club
without knowing what it was for.

680
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:23,357
Because you were there.

681
00:58:45,064 --> 00:58:46,106
I'm going to England.

682
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:51,278
Thanks to you, I'm free now.
Thank you for the article.

683
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:55,366
Just punch me, will you?

684
00:58:56,659 --> 00:59:00,079
You still don't trust people.
Back then or even now.

685
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,792
I'm really thankful to you.
I got a divorce thanks to your article.

686
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,378
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

687
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,645
He's claiming
I was at fault for everything.

688
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,857
Although I was at a disadvantage
from the start…

689
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,735
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

690
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:35,489
My marriage was more like…
Should I say M&A?

691
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:40,494
But I was the unfavorable one
since my youth was pretty turbulent.

692
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,872
They said I should be grateful
that they'd accepted me.

693
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:48,669
My depression and panic disorders
were also my fault.

694
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,630
Being unable to get pregnant
was also my fault.

695
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:54,508
I even heard about the rumor
that says I'm sterile.

696
01:00:00,973 --> 01:00:02,891
We weren't in love anyway.

697
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:07,062
That asshole having an affair
wasn't shocking at all. But still…

698
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,359
I felt miserable.

699
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:14,903
Because he didn't even try to hide it.

700
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:17,573
Sometimes when he got drunk,

701
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:19,908
he swore at me.

702
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:22,786
Oh, that fucking son of a bitch.

703
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:29,710
Don't be like that.
You're melting my heart.

704
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,546
I can't fall for you again. Don't do that.

705
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,173
Will you get a grip?

706
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,217
How can you say that
in a situation like this?

707
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,053
That doesn't make you look strong at all.

708
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:47,936
I've been filing for a divorce nonstop.

709
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,439
And I finally got to end it this time.

710
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:54,568
Thank you so much. I mean it.

711
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:01,992
Okay.

712
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:06,330
If you say that, that's good.

713
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,875
- Bye then.
- Sit down.

714
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,960
What? Do you have anything else to say?

715
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:18,467
I don't know if this is exclusive enough,
but one more scoop so we're even.

716
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,551
No, thanks.

717
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:21,678
Oh, why do you have to fucking act up?

718
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,555
Why are you fucking acting up?

719
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,107
Write about my divorce.

720
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:36,193
I'll give it to you exclusively.

721
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:38,195
I want to look cool,

722
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,365
so make sure to say I've been filing
for a divorce for a long time.

723
01:01:58,465 --> 01:01:59,299
Ji-woo.

724
01:02:01,343 --> 01:02:04,555
When I had to confirm the article
about your hubby, I couldn't fall asleep.

725
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:06,890
Were you worried?

726
01:02:06,974 --> 01:02:09,643
Yes, about seeing you face-to-face
and listening to your gibberish.

727
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,979
- Gibberish?
- Yes, gibberish.

728
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:14,440
Crazy gibberish, you cruel asshole!

729
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:25,659
See you at the funeral.

730
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:28,954
Whether you die or I die.

731
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:28,323
Is there anyone who can't make it
to the group blind date?

732
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:29,408
Raise your hand.

733
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:32,327
Why aren't you raising your hand?

734
01:04:33,579 --> 01:04:34,746
Right.

735
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,333
You handsome ass must come.
Anyone else who can't come?

736
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:41,878
Oh, but I'm not…

737
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:05,527
Kyeong-do, it's this Saturday at 3 p.m.

738
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:09,865
I can't go.

739
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,992
You wanna end your school life, handsome?

740
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:17,289
I can't go because I look old.
I'd only ruin our major's impression.

741
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:19,041
I look too old. Sorry.

742
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:22,044
Hey, if you look old… Kyeong-do!

743
01:05:24,046 --> 01:05:27,466
SURELY TOMORROW

744
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:28,842
- No way.
- Talk to each other.

745
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,552
- I'm not doing it.
- Don't do it.

746
01:05:30,636 --> 01:05:32,304
- Work things out!
- Let's do it.

747
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:34,598
<i>Kyeong-do's information</i>
<i>has all been released.</i>

748
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:35,515
Seo Ji-woo!

749
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,518
The Assistant Manager idiot
provided articles for other media.

750
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,854
What do you think
of this ridiculous situation?

751
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:44,107
<i>I was young, immature, and vulnerable.</i>

752
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,778
I was innocent and sincere.

753
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:51,406
<i>It was an 18-year friendship.</i>
<i>So don't make it look like it was love?</i>

754
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:55,494
<i>You got dragged into my mess</i>
<i>and almost had your life messed up again.</i>

755
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:58,580
<i>You're wrong. You got two things wrong.</i>

756
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:00,957
<i>I never got dragged into it.</i>

757
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:04,169
<i>And my life</i>
<i>had never been messed up before.</i>
