1
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,468
Bye.

2
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,889
Don't cross the Yeongdongdaegyo Bridge.

3
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,518
Stay in Gangbuk today.

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,159
- You drive.
- Okay!

5
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,419
- The seat belt.
- Okay.

6
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:26,629
- Done?
- Not yet. Done.

7
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,546
Okay. I'm moving off.

8
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,631
- Go. Okay.
- Let's go.

9
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,127
What's wrong?

10
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,795
Wait, my foot.

11
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,047
Your foot?

12
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,307
EPISODE 7

13
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,115
- Someone's calling to move your car.
- Okay…

14
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:04,828
Hello?

15
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,250
Oh, okay.

16
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,469
Get some more sleep.

17
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,565
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

18
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,530
Did he get a new car?

19
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,573
I… Wait, no. Why… I can't breathe.

20
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,329
But I can't breathe… Oh, wait!

21
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,959
Why would you choke me?

22
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,128
You know the overwhelming force
of cuteness?

23
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,591
It makes you want to pinch it
and hold it until it can't breathe.

24
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,177
Like a puppy, a kitten, and a cub.

25
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,054
I know I'm as cute as they are.

26
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,055
Exactly.

27
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,852
Oh, my. Wait. I can't breathe.

28
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,065
Oh, right.

29
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,610
Shoot. I'm going to be late for work.

30
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,488
Hey, Kyeong-do.

31
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,242
Don't go to work. Stay with me. Please?

32
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,995
You're heavy.
You should prepare for the new job, too.

33
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,539
Just for today. Please?

34
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,541
Hey, I said you're heavy.

35
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,459
Please?

36
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:21,632
Intern.

37
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,760
Have you checked
this movie's release date?

38
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:25,928
Yes.

39
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,054
Send it to the manager.

40
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,932
She told me to upload it
if you confirm it.

41
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,268
"If the great assistant manager
approves it, just publish it."

42
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,228
That's what she said.

43
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,154
Still, let's show her one more time
before we upload it.

44
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,280
Okay.

45
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,074
Where's Kim Doo-jin?

46
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,035
He probably went
to the <i>Midlife Cop </i>press conference.

47
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,788
Did he have to go so early?

48
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,553
Fuck!

49
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,517
Gotcha, you brat. Wait right there.

50
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,439
Gosh, how did he know I was here?

51
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,779
The corporate card?

52
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,447
My personal card.

53
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,078
Did you think I'd give up
if you avoided me?

54
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,998
I wasn't avoiding you.
I came here to work.

55
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,749
Three hours before the press conference?

56
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,337
What are you doing here?
You're a little too high up to be here.

57
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,423
I'm here to catch you, you punk.

58
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,176
I even gave up on my lunch hour
to be here.

59
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,052
So why? Why is that?

60
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,597
An Da-hye. Why did you start covering her?

61
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,017
It's wrong for a reporter to demand
another reporter to reveal the informant.

62
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,769
It's suspicious.
Why is An Da-hye looking for you?

63
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,023
And why are you avoiding me?
That's because you're hiding something.

64
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,818
That's not it. I was covering it honestly.

65
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,321
And besides, you can't do this.

66
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,948
You're taking it personally
because she's your ex.

67
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,285
What do you mean, "No"?

68
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,495
My current girlfriend.

69
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,042
Oh, that day.

70
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,670
When Seo Ji-woo said in the lobby
she was wearing your underwear…

71
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,757
I knew there was something.

72
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,635
Same here.
I think there is something going on.

73
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:34,056
I'm personally very curious.
I'll keep it to myself. Who was it?

74
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:35,766
But--

75
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,227
INCOMING CALL
SEO JI-YEON

76
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,479
Answer your phone.

77
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,856
It's your sister-in-law.

78
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,360
Keep acting cheeky,
and you'll be in big trouble.

79
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,153
Yes, hello?

80
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,365
Yes.

81
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,244
Isn't Excel one of the basic skills?

82
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,829
I'm learning, but it's too hard.

83
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,081
You're learn…

84
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,877
If you keep doing this,
they won't stop calling you a free rider.

85
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,545
Okay.

86
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:06,755
"Okay"?

87
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,132
- It's not "okay." You--
- We have a guest.

88
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,350
Hello. Ms. Seo will be here shortly.

89
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,560
- I'll have you wait inside.
- Okay.

90
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,604
Bring tea.

91
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,278
What would you like to drink?

92
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,905
Well, a hot Americano will do.

93
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,215
Shit. How much longer
do I have to keep this up?

94
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,468
How long do I have to
put up with that old fossil?

95
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,396
Thank you.

96
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,608
Wait, why are you drinking that?

97
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,116
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking--

98
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,161
That's Ms. Seo's.
Why would you drink that?

99
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,375
I'm sorry about that,
but why would you get so upset over this?

100
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,880
Sorry about that. The meeting ran over.

101
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,465
No, I just got here too.

102
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,884
Ms. Seo, I'll bring you new coffee.

103
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,432
Kang Min-woo…

104
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,185
Your husband was the informant?

105
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:44,561
Yes.

106
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,607
But why…

107
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,195
But it only makes sense
if he can benefit from it.

108
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,906
What would he get
from getting rid of Cho Jin-eon?

109
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,076
With him present,
it's hard for him to sell the company.

110
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,996
The executives were complimenting Jin-eon
for his performance.

111
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:04,873
Sell the company?

112
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:09,336
That's the reason he's pretending
to ignore my illness as well.

113
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,839
He's not interested
in running the company.

114
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:17,427
He'll reveal my illness
at a crucial moment

115
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,597
and make people think that there's no one
to run the company.

116
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,809
Then he'll step forward
to sell the company.

117
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,438
Because once I lose all my memories,
he'll be my representative.

118
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,733
It seems he's already found a buyer.

119
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,653
My goodness. He's a real scary guy.

120
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,489
Then Ji-woo…

121
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,824
That's why I'm worried.

122
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:43,870
Ji-woo will have to go through all this.
I'm worried.

123
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,208
I even wonder if I'm being selfish.

124
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm worried
if Ji-woo could put up with all this.

125
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,300
I feel bad for her, and I pity her.

126
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,346
Is this why you haven't told her yet?

127
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,600
If she finds out that I have dementia,
Ji-woo will fall apart.

128
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,062
Now that I've talked to her in person,

129
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:13,859
it turns out she's relying on me so much
when I'm not so reliable.

130
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,949
If there's anything I can help you with,
I'll do my best.

131
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,055
About the secretary
who was just here earlier.

132
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,432
You mean Secretary Yoo?

133
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,643
Yes, did she join the company
through an open recruitment?

134
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:49,853
Why do you ask?

135
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,773
Because I think
I heard her being a free rider.

136
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,860
She graduated
from my father-in-law's school.

137
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,195
My husband recommended her.

138
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,076
Can you get me a change of clothes?

139
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,745
Yes, ma'am. I'll prepare it right away.

140
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,040
Wait, why are you drinking that?

141
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,168
That's Ms. Seo's.
Why would you drink that?

142
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,187
So I can drink it later.
This place makes good coffee.

143
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,897
I'll ask her to make a new one--

144
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,774
Oh, no. This will do.

145
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,735
What were you thinking to show up here?

146
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:40,737
I can't do this.

147
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:47,202
How long do I have to do this for?
The chief secretary is driving me crazy.

148
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,037
You didn't anticipate this?

149
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,083
That as well, but this is too dangerous.

150
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,587
What if Ms. Seo ends up dying?
What is that drug?

151
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,466
If this goes wrong,
I'll end up going to prison.

152
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,760
Lower your voice.

153
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:07,722
Why don't you be more direct?

154
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,140
You want more money.

155
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,273
Okay. Go back to work.

156
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,067
And...

157
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,112
don't you ever come here.

158
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,155
Because your second phone is off--

159
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,199
If you have anything to say, text me.

160
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,993
I'll check more often.

161
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,911
Thank you.

162
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,664
Have a good day.

163
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,381
Hey, Seong-sik.

164
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,677
When you did the article about juice,
where did you get the analysis done?

165
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,599
Oh, really? Can you send me the link?

166
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,809
Yeah, thanks.

167
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,816
Here.

168
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:04,487
Can you analyze any elements
that are harmful,

169
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,656
or would induce illnesses,

170
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,702
or anything that is not found
in ordinary coffee?

171
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,870
Sure, I'll do that.

172
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,122
Well, how long is it going to take?

173
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:16,416
Normally, it takes about
two to three weeks.

174
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,753
Okay, then...

175
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,716
I have to write an article.
So if you could rush a bit…

176
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:26,843
Please?

177
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,178
Okay, I'll try my best.

178
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,512
Okay, thank you.

179
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,183
SUBWAY EXIT

180
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,950
FLOWERS

181
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,035
Hello.

182
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:52,952
Hello.

183
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,834
Mom.

184
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:01,628
Well, thanks.

185
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,343
You've never done this before.

186
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,762
I told you a million times
that I like flowers,

187
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,472
but you only got me carnations.

188
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,183
I remembered it today.

189
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,146
- Next time, buy half of these.
- Okay.

190
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,315
Go.

191
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,192
Mom, where are you headed?

192
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,485
Tuesday service.

193
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,282
Why does she keep taking this route?

194
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,042
Where did you get the flowers?

195
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,211
- My son got them for me.
- You raised him well.

196
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,381
I fed him mostly rice,
and he grew up well.

197
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,927
Beer is the best with pizza.

198
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,137
SPARKLING WATER

199
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,555
That is impossible.

200
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,931
- Exactly.
- Right?

201
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,183
Here.

202
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,816
By the way, I found a flower shop
on my way home.

203
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,694
I've never noticed it,
but it's been there for four years.

204
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,405
What, you're hinting
that you've never been in a relationship?

205
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,785
Apparently, orange roses exist.

206
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:17,954
You should've bought one.

207
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,622
One? I bought 20.

208
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,540
What?

209
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:26,129
- They were taken away instantly.
- Damn it, by which jerk?

210
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,505
My mom.

211
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,385
Hey, come here.

212
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,679
Bring your face over here.

213
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,307
You're a reporter.
Don't leave out the subject when you talk.

214
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,683
Why are you so sensitive?

215
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,732
No, it's just…

216
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:47,984
You know...

217
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,612
- Listen to me.
- Okay.

218
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,657
I was told to take a photo
for the press release.

219
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,661
But what is this?

220
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,915
It's a good picture.

221
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,084
But it looks unnatural.
What is good about this typical pose?

222
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,211
What do you want then?

223
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,588
You know, like this, right?

224
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:13,468
I'm on my way to work, I turn around,
and snap. I turn around, and snap.

225
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,597
Just like that.
You know what I mean, right?

226
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,973
No? Right?

227
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:21,142
Yeah, you mean like,

228
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,355
the daughters-in-law of major corporations
attending a wedding?

229
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,482
Yes, exactly!

230
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:31,069
What is this boring picture? Gosh…

231
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,780
Shall we go out?
Let's take a few on Teheran-ro.

232
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,866
So I was thinking…

233
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,909
Yes?

234
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,788
I'm going to the company
to meet my sister before I start.

235
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,541
You should take a picture of me then.

236
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:49,128
Just keep taking candid pictures.
Then we might get a good one.

237
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,384
Me? The assistant manager
of Dongwoon Daily?

238
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,552
Yes, you.

239
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:07,730
Then how are you going to get there?
By taxi? That's weird.

240
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,234
Taxi? Oh, right. That's kind of unnatural.

241
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,862
But if I drive…

242
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,281
I can't get it valet-parked.

243
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,994
I should've listened to my sister
when she said she'd assign me a chauffeur.

244
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,372
Dang, a director even gets a chauffeur?

245
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,834
Why did you say no?
It's convenient to have a chauffeur.

246
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:32,380
Not convenient at all. It's suffocating
to be with a stranger in a car.

247
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,673
I'd get carsick.

248
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,099
Hey, just use this. It's a good picture.

249
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,560
You look like you'll work like a cow.

250
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:49,397
"Moo, the director is working. Moo."

251
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,608
"Give me work. Moo."

252
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,067
What?

253
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,236
You open your mouth.

254
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,488
You open first. You first.

255
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,866
Then… Oh, wait.

256
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,369
Hey, Jeong-min.

257
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,288
Me?

258
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,333
Well, I'm home. I'm chilling.

259
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,751
You're chilling with Ji-woo.

260
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,171
We're having dinner together.

261
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,381
Both of you, come to Woo-sik's place now.

262
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,299
Now?

263
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,259
Jeong-min, hello?

264
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,888
- What's that about?
- What?

265
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,056
He said to come now.

266
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,517
Who are you to fool me?

267
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:31,189
"Yes, Jeong-min. Yes. I'm chilling.
I'm home." That was too awkward.

268
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,316
You know Kyeong-do can't do method acting.

269
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,944
When he said, "Oh, Jeong-min,"

270
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,238
I knew right away that he was with Ji-woo.

271
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:42,909
Right. Why did you stutter? Do you feel
uncomfortable getting back together?

272
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,244
When did I talk like that?

273
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:48,331
Is Uncle Kyeong-do going out with you?

274
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,126
- Don't we look good together?
- Date for a long time without fighting.

275
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,045
Sure.

276
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,214
We will. Thanks.

277
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,969
We should have some soju, no?
This annoying little couple. Right?

278
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,638
This pairs well with whiskey too.

279
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,017
Just feel free to drink. I won't come here
if you keep doing this.

280
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,394
Still, you idiot.

281
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,647
If you say that,
I'll find this in my bag. Look…

282
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,278
Drink it alone at home.

283
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:22,031
Whiskey pairs well with solitude.

284
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,535
I knew Se-yeong was the only loyal friend.

285
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,372
When I was in the army,
she was the only one who visited me.

286
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,917
You guys never came. Only bought me drinks
when I was out on a break.

287
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,211
Hey, this is really good.

288
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,588
You went to meet him alone?

289
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,175
- Yes.
- Why?

290
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,846
Oh, well, just to see
if Kyeong-do was doing okay.

291
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,473
I was worried. That's why. Is it good?

292
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,642
But we didn't even get to meet, did we?

293
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:51,310
What? Yeah, right.

294
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,271
Because I had to drive the commander.

295
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,232
So, why were you curious
about Kyeong-do's condition?

296
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:01,029
Hey, what kind of question is that?
What are you trying to say?

297
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,576
Were you worried about him that much?

298
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,496
This is serious. When things get serious,
you become curious. Do you want this?

299
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,248
At the time,

300
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,752
he got wasted and returned to his base
early in the morning.

301
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,336
That's when. You eat it.

302
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,339
A day like that happened a lot.
It's normal to be curious.

303
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:24,010
No, oh, seriously.
It was the day of Ji-yeon's wedding!

304
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,845
Don't you remember?

305
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,772
WINTER, 2009

306
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,858
I never asked you for a favor.
Switch with me just once, please?

307
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,902
But I booked a concert ticket.

308
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,239
I'll pay for the ticket. And I'll take you
to another one when we're discharged.

309
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,284
No way. Never.

310
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,954
I'll take your driving shift next weekend.

311
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,500
Wait. I'll drive every weekend this month.
What do you say? Are you in?

312
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,709
- For real?
- For real.

313
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,047
Okay.

314
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,131
Okay.

315
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,721
After your sister's wedding,

316
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,516
we might as well visit Kyeong-do
while you're here.

317
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,810
Do you think he'd be happy to see me?

318
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,396
He'd get pissed off and desert the army.

319
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,652
Then by chance… by any chance,

320
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,987
if Kyeong-do's out on a break?

321
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,781
If he happens to be out

322
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,326
on the day of your sister's wedding,

323
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,829
let's meet him. Okay?

324
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:34,914
That's worth trying.

325
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,875
Did you tell him that I was coming?

326
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:39,877
No!

327
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,714
Se-yeong.

328
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,926
Don't look at me like that.
That gives me butterflies in the stomach.

329
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,306
Do you

330
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,227
want me to get back with Kyeong-do?

331
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:01,941
You know what?

332
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,778
I think everyone
should have a good breakup.

333
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:10,366
That way, they're either sad or relieved.

334
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,286
But you and Kyeong-do?

335
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,706
It's not a matter of
getting back together.

336
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,250
I want you to break up properly.

337
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,300
You're really eloquent, Se-yeong.

338
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,594
Like a teacher.
I don't understand a thing.

339
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,597
Focus.

340
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,570
Hello. Can you show me your invitation?

341
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,864
Oh, the invitation, sir?

342
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:51,782
You cannot enter without an invitation.

343
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,659
Oh, okay, sir.

344
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,877
Here, cheers!

345
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,087
Drink.

346
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:52,426
Are you sure Ji-woo's back in Korea?
How come she wasn't at the wedding?

347
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,389
Maybe there was a separate entrance
for the family. The hotel was huge.

348
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,557
Hey, how did you know

349
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,602
Ji-woo's sister was getting married?
Did you read the article?

350
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:04,438
No, Se-yeong told me
there was an article about it.

351
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,649
That Ji-woo might come.

352
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,655
I mean, there is no way to reach her.
It'd be nice to run into her like this.

353
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,741
Even from Ji-woo's point of view,
it'd be worth the long flight.

354
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,620
Right. It'd be nice to see him
while she's here.

355
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,414
Then, shall we call JARIM Apparel?

356
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,960
That we'd like to know
the second daughter's contact information?

357
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,253
What do you think?

358
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,089
I'm just saying because I feel for him.
Don't be so serious.

359
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,383
My goodness.

360
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,678
Anyway, when are you two joining the army?

361
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,973
When I'm discharged,
you should go right away.

362
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:41,726
I'll take care of her.

363
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,186
Who are you to take care of Se-yeong?

364
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,779
Do you like Park Se-yeong?

365
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,452
I ship it.

366
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:03,414
Hey, if you two start dating,

367
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,751
Chaos is doomed, you know?

368
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,796
It's enough with Lee Kyeong-do
and Seo Ji-woo. Right, Se-yeong? Yeah?

369
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,049
Then we shouldn't break up.

370
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:16,427
This asshole… He's serious.

371
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:19,972
Kyeong-do, get up.

372
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,951
See the look in his eyes?

373
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,954
I'm glad I'm out on a break.
This is so worth it.

374
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,832
Worth it, my ass!
This is harmful, Woo-sik.

375
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,918
Think about it carefully.

376
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,254
Hey! You asshole, you're too drunk.

377
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,590
What the hell is wrong with him? Hey.

378
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,638
If you drink this, we're going out.

379
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:09,105
Wait, what the hell?

380
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,065
Look at them. What are you…

381
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:14,485
Hey, we only met because of theater.
This club was only meant for theater.

382
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,112
This club wasn't for dating.

383
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,989
You idiot.
Why the hell are you snickering?

384
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,324
Congratulations, sir.

385
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:23,869
What? Don't be ridiculous.
Are you here to date?

386
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:28,165
You assholes… Just me alone…
What, is this a dating republic or what?

387
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,847
Cheers!

388
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,961
SE-YEONG

389
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,676
Hey, Se-yeong.

390
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,600
No, I was about to get up.

391
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:14,188
Yeah. Why didn't you come yesterday?
Everyone was waiting for you.

392
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,399
I was with my family until late.

393
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,278
I see. Are you in the hotel?

394
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,196
Yes.

395
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,368
<i>Now that Ji-yeon isn't home,</i>
<i>you're not going home at all?</i>

396
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,000
Did Kyeong-do get home safely last night?

397
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:38,629
I hope so? He was probably with
Woo-sik and Jeong-min last night.

398
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,256
I see.

399
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,554
Se-yeong.

400
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,892
Where is Kyeong-do stationed?

401
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,979
BAEKGEOM BASE
CHECKPOINT

402
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,898
VISITOR REQUEST
NAME: LEE KYEONG-DO

403
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:15,624
Wait. You cannot visit
Sergeant Lee Kyeong-do today, ma'am.

404
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,919
- Why not?
- He's on an off-base dispatch.

405
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:26,385
CHECKPOINT

406
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,772
MILITARY BASE ENTRANCE

407
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,971
Hey, Se-yeong. It's me, Kyeong-do.

408
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,391
Did you happen to visit me today?

409
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:20,022
<i>I was told that a girl my age visited,</i>
<i>but he doesn't know the name.</i>

410
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:22,650
Was it you?

411
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:27,446
Oh, yes. It was me.

412
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,449
Really? But we met yesterday.

413
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:34,662
Well, since you drank a lot.

414
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:35,788
I was worried.

415
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:41,001
<i>Worried if you were struggling</i>
<i>because you didn't see Ji-woo.</i>

416
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,003
<i>I just went to check on you.</i>

417
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:48,425
It's only your second day with Woo-sik.
I'm causing you trouble.

418
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:53,097
Right. Hey, speaking of which…

419
00:32:55,516 --> 00:32:56,934
I was too drunk.

420
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,730
Kyeong-do, do you think
I'm making the right choice?

421
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,149
What if my life is doomed?

422
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:06,235
Hey, that hurts.

423
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,488
Then explain that sweet look in your eyes
last night.

424
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,323
Woo-sik is kind of cute.

425
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,994
Yeah, right. You make a good couple.

426
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:34,096
Happy? That I went to the wedding
to see you and got kicked out?

427
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,181
Yes, I'm so damn happy.

428
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,225
I'm so damn happy too.

429
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,603
Because it was actually me
who visited you?

430
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,022
Yes.

431
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,316
Come here.

432
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,454
Artist Choi is in a relationship, right?

433
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,249
Gosh.

434
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:07,546
Why would you cut in without a blinker?
You startled me.

435
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:11,258
They already broke up, right?
It feels like this scandal is too late.

436
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,805
I don't know. I'd like to know as well.

437
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,601
If you cover it,
promise me to let me know, okay?

438
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,061
You're good.

439
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,939
With the CEO title and a bigger paycheck,
you're not feeling up to it?

440
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:31,028
Excuse me.

441
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:34,198
Hello?

442
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,701
Yeah, I'm eating right now.
Have you had lunch yet?

443
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:40,996
<i>I already have.</i>
<i>Do you want to come home tonight?</i>

444
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,333
I'll boil a whole Korean chicken,
but it's too much for us.

445
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,712
Leftovers always end up in the trash.
It's nice to eat together when it's hot.

446
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,923
I love <i>baeksuk.</i>

447
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,221
But I have to cover
a movie press conference tonight.

448
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,724
Leave some for me, Mom.
I'll eat it tomorrow.

449
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:03,185
<i>Baeksuk </i>is still tasty
even when it's reheated.

450
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,688
Yes. I'll call you. Yeah. Enjoy.

451
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,817
What movie press conference?

452
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,277
As far as I know, there's nothing tonight.

453
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,654
Eat.

454
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,989
Wait. I'm smelling something.

455
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,784
It's the <i>jjajangmyeon </i>smell.
Yeah, keep eating.

456
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,288
It's not this smell, though.

457
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:24,456
Does he have work?

458
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, I guess he's going somewhere
for an article.

459
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,796
Why are you worried about Kyeong-do
so much lately?

460
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,464
I'm not worried about him.

461
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,593
Not many sons buy their moms flowers.

462
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:42,140
Do you think he bought them for me?
He bought them for the person he likes.

463
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,435
Wait. If you knew, why did you take them?

464
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,272
What else? How was I supposed to ask him?

465
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:51,358
"Is someone at home?
Why are you buying flowers after work?"

466
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:53,277
Was I supposed to ask? And embarrass him?

467
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,572
Right, you have a point. My goodness.

468
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,699
If it withers again…

469
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:03,745
He'd be heartbroken.
I'm worried about that.

470
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:08,333
Back then, I was ill.
That probably made it worse.

471
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,013
ORGANIZATION CHART

472
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,849
She is our lead designer,
Department Manager Ji Yeon-soo.

473
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,101
She worked with Dad for a long time.

474
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,479
It's important
to make her your person first.

475
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,857
She will help you a lot.

476
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,860
She was born in 1974. Okay.

477
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,362
Don't just look at the pictures.

478
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,406
Next is…

479
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,619
Yes. Executive Director Choi.
You need to watch out for her a little.

480
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,662
- Is she a villain?
- No.

481
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,123
She's not like that.

482
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,458
Then why do I need to watch out?

483
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,920
Should I say she's on the border?

484
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:56,214
She doesn't care about loyalty
or comradeship.

485
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:59,843
Her priority is her own benefit.

486
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,596
So she's made contributions
to the company.

487
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,891
Between a villain and a helper. Okay.

488
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,690
I plan to release the press release
the day after tomorrow.

489
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,032
- Do you feel pressured?
- No, that's not it.

490
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,577
I just don't really like that picture.

491
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,246
Do you want me to get a new photographer?

492
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,499
No worries. It'll be the same anyway.

493
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,293
They'll make me turn slightly on the chair
and smile like this.

494
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,756
What is that?

495
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,800
Oh, gosh.

496
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,093
Is that how I look also?

497
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,512
- Is it from the same place?
- Yes.

498
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,598
Kind of.
I look like a cow who'd only work.

499
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,311
Right? Excuse me.

500
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:52,312
Sure.

501
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,273
LEE KYEONG-DO

502
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,609
Hey, I'm at work.

503
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:01,571
<i>Wow, so cool. "I'm at work." Dang.</i>

504
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,991
I'm busy, so I have to go.
I'll call you back.

505
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,496
I sounded pretty cool, right?

506
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,540
Director Seo.

507
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,341
Gosh.

508
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,679
What are you doing here?

509
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,806
Well… Because I missed you?

510
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,603
This feels so nice, Kyeong-do.

511
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,033
Are you coming from work?

512
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,535
No, I'm coming from your house.

513
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:33,997
What? Then you should've stayed home.
You must be tired.

514
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,835
There are days
I feel like I have to pick you up.

515
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,421
For example?

516
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:44,341
A day like today?

517
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,095
What is a day like today?

518
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:52,474
That prick who should be turned down
by all the door locks in the world.

519
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,226
What?

520
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:58,980
What the hell?

521
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,908
Shit. Hey! Fuck.

522
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:12,702
What are you doing?

523
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,960
So laid-back.
Some might think this is your house.

524
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:24,798
Because I'm done flirting.
What are you doing at other people's home?

525
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,092
The door code. Did you change it?

526
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:29,052
Why do you care who changed it?

527
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,930
What matters is
that you're violating the law.

528
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,142
- This is a crime.
- Hey! Fuck.

529
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:37,936
Will you press the button?

530
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:43,525
Hey, I know you set me up with An Da-hye
to get me divorced.

531
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,861
You got rid of me to approach Seo Ji-woo!

532
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:51,158
I want to show off that I was the one
who tried to stop the article.

533
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,993
Don't be ridiculous.

534
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,995
Why would I listen
to a trash reporter like you?

535
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:59,875
If I were you,
I'd look into the informant first.

536
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,628
Besides, let's use honorifics from now on.

537
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,298
We're not close.
Being casual with you gives me goosebumps.

538
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,425
Right. Yes. Right.

539
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,343
Yeah, the informant.

540
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:11,636
Jeez.

541
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,098
I get it. It was Seo Ji-woo.

542
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,183
Gosh.

543
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,853
I'm onto you two. I heard
Seo Ji-woo's working at the company now.

544
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:22,898
I'll send both of you to hell
as soon as I can. You hear me?

545
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,358
I said use honorifics.
You're not fucking listening.

546
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:27,277
You son of a--

547
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,030
I wouldn't even set up a blind date
for a dick like you.

548
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,115
Such a loser.

549
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,296
Fuck.

550
00:41:59,017 --> 00:41:59,976
What is this?

551
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,894
Give it to her.

552
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,115
You have to be
straightforward with him, okay?

553
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:18,203
He kept pressing the door code
as if this were his house. That jackass…

554
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:22,457
That was the real reason
you felt like you had to pick me up.

555
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,209
- Right?
- No!

556
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,127
You're yelling, so I'm right.

557
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:28,546
Probably not.

558
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:45,313
Is he out of his mind?

559
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,410
What is it? What did that lunatic say?

560
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,370
- Can I have any privacy?
- Not on this.

561
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:06,501
"My second proposal to you!"
That son of a bitch!

562
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,297
Wow, this guy's got no brain.

563
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,007
Is divorce a joke?

564
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,467
So cringe. A second proposal?

565
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:18,096
I should've punched that prick
in the throat, shit.

566
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:22,392
Hey, I can't let this slide.

567
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,853
Give me his number.
You won't be able to do it.

568
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,689
I'll meet him and draw the line clearly.

569
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,149
I'll meet him and return it.

570
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,151
Why? Just call a quick delivery service.

571
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:34,779
You can't find this in Korea.

572
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,406
Things will get worse if it got lost.

573
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,158
Wow.

574
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,661
This guy knew what he was doing. Right?

575
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:45,415
He knew if he got you something expensive,
he'd get to see you again.

576
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,875
He calculated it.

577
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,754
Have you ever seen a dog with rabies?

578
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:51,838
No!

579
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,381
I think I'm seeing one now.

580
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,138
This is how he is.

581
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,224
Once he's fixated on something,
he decides he's right.

582
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:07,520
Still, I feel a little bad
for my Kyeong-do.

583
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,065
You must've been upset to be given this.

584
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:14,235
Still, I got under his skin.

585
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,363
I covered it when I punched the door code.

586
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:17,530
I bet he was upset.

587
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:20,533
Come here.

588
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,038
Where can you buy that?

589
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,415
I don't know.

590
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:28,333
How much is it?

591
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:30,877
Come here.

592
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,214
Don't move for five minutes.
I need to recharge.

593
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:48,204
SUMMER, 2015

594
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:50,475
This design is popular for matching rings.

595
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,270
This has diamonds,
so the ladies prefer this.

596
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:56,189
Do you have anything simple?

597
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,733
If the jewels are too flashy…

598
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,614
How about this?

599
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:06,783
I'll take this.

600
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,076
Do you know her size?

601
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,918
Do you see the knot?

602
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,045
Excellent.

603
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,156
Aren't you tired? Do you want to go home?

604
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,661
I'm okay. Do you want me
to get something to drink?

605
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,746
No, I've already had enough.

606
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,916
Hey, how about a drive this weekend?

607
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,836
- No.
- Why not?

608
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,675
This Saturday…
we're going to a fancy restaurant.

609
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,760
Really? What? Where?

610
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,055
I found a nice Korean restaurant.

611
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,142
Why? Is it some kind of an anniversary?

612
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:17,478
A day to have great food.

613
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,065
Great food…

614
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:28,323
Hey, Mom.

615
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,035
Dad? How serious?

616
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:38,124
Which hospital? Okay. Bye.

617
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:12,784
FRAGILE

618
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:00,057
Maybe he's still high from the drugs.

619
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:03,686
What's this bullshit, a second proposal?

620
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,188
What does he take Ji-woo for?

621
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,231
You don't treat someone right
when they're with you.

622
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,484
Once they're gone, running after them
just makes you sweat.

623
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,737
If he was nice to her when he had her,
these two wouldn't be together.

624
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:17,200
Read the room, please.

625
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:18,951
What I'm saying is,

626
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:23,664
am I the only one who doesn't understand
that asshole's second proposal?

627
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:24,624
That is my question.

628
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,459
Reunited couples can be happy.

629
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,502
Damn it.

630
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,258
Get her a gift too.

631
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:36,803
- Something impactful.
- Out of nowhere? Like a loser?

632
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:39,889
Did you get her anything for the job?
That's a good reason.

633
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,141
I already did.
I got her acupressure slippers.

634
00:51:44,393 --> 00:51:46,145
- Wow.
- Acu… Acupressure, my ass.

635
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:47,897
Seriously, you're hopeless.

636
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,775
This isn't going to work.
I'll talk to my dad.

637
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:53,319
Get her an imported car or a sports car.

638
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,571
Okay? I'll give you
a long installment plan.

639
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:58,324
I won't attract her
with something expensive like him.

640
00:51:58,407 --> 00:51:59,992
Seriously. Damn it.

641
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:01,410
Is that right?

642
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:02,411
For how many months?

643
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,081
You little…

644
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:05,998
Hurry up.

645
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:08,292
You… wait. Okay, where's my phone?

646
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,002
SEO JI-WOO

647
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:11,420
Are you at work?

648
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:19,804
You said you might work overtime,
so I thought you might still be at work.

649
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,433
No, I'm on my way home.

650
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,814
Okay. Have fun. Bye.

651
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:34,110
Ms. Seo Ji-woo?

652
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:42,285
I'm Jin Han-kyeong.
I work with Assistant Manager Lee.

653
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:45,830
I've seen many pictures of you,
but we've never met in person.

654
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,083
Hello.

655
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,334
Assistant Manager Lee left.

656
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,420
Yes. I just talked to him on the phone.

657
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:54,964
Okay.

658
00:52:58,134 --> 00:53:00,386
If you don't mind, can we have some tea?

659
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,811
I've been working with him
since we were in the Culture Team.

660
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,190
Yes. I've heard.

661
00:53:13,733 --> 00:53:17,111
I've also heard that you go to
his mother's laundromat for her kimchi.

662
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,614
That's right.

663
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,340
With all due respect, let me say this.

664
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:42,553
I'm actually

665
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,097
a little disappointed.

666
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,935
Assistant Manager Lee… No, Kyeong-do.

667
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:54,941
Every time he makes a crucial decision
in his life, he is let down.

668
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,110
It turns out

669
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,113
you were the reason every time.

670
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,119
In the past, when you got back together
and broke up again,

671
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:10,206
he was waiting to be assigned
to the Current Affairs Team.

672
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:15,628
He really wanted it, and I also think
it was more suitable for him.

673
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,882
I don't know what happened exactly
between you two,

674
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:21,926
but Kyeong-do…

675
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:27,056
Well, he was in so much pain.

676
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,977
And as he was on leave,
the transfer was canceled.

677
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:35,564
Let me overstep a little more.

678
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,443
This time, it was a chance
to have training in Chicago.

679
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:44,240
The competition rate was 100 to 1,
but he was rewarded for his big exclusive.

680
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:47,410
And he turned it down
and gave the chance to another reporter.

681
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,798
I know I'm overstepping my boundary,

682
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,341
but there's something

683
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:06,470
you need to know, Ji-woo.

684
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:12,685
Kyeong-do has always had
the highest priority.

685
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:28,159
I'm sorry.

686
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:43,424
Thank you.

687
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:49,055
This is something I really needed to know.

688
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,688
Thank you for telling me.

689
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,610
Thank you…

690
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:05,821
for your understanding.

691
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,461
Does Jeong-min's father
import cars from abroad?

692
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:21,378
Yes.

693
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:25,883
I think he will later close
his used car shop and work for him.

694
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,887
So? Is he getting you a lot of discounts?

695
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:33,808
He said he'd get me
a long installment plan.

696
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:41,065
You know what he said when I told him
that I got you acupressure slippers?

697
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,317
He said I was hopeless.

698
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,617
Are you busy at work?

699
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,919
By the way, I returned the ring safely.

700
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:08,259
You were right.

701
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:11,679
There's nothing good in seeing him again.

702
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:24,984
You did the right thing.

703
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,612
Was that a limited edition or something?
I'll get you one.

704
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,364
Before I turn 80.

705
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:34,743
Kyeong-do.

706
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:40,875
Is something wrong?

707
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:48,048
I can't ask you why you didn't go.

708
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:53,387
I can't tell you
not to give up on good opportunities

709
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,514
because of me.

710
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,109
I'm dead happy that you're next to me.

711
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:10,279
I feel like I'm finally living my life.

712
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:13,866
So…

713
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,080
I'm happy…

714
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,293
that you're not…

715
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:31,550
going to Chicago.

716
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,848
Aren't I awful?

717
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,622
I feel so relieved

718
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:04,667
to hear that you're happy.

719
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,343
Let's go.

720
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,528
What's wrong with him?

721
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,545
Hey, Kyeong-do. Have you seen my car key?

722
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,046
I don't know.

723
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,174
What? Where did it go?

724
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:57,219
Where the heck is it?

725
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,055
Man, not here.

726
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:02,433
But it's got to be here.

727
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:03,726
Hey, come on. Let's go.

728
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,561
No, wait. Where?

729
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:06,687
Hurry. Come on.

730
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,565
But why? Where are we going?
Where is the car key?

731
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:12,693
It's way too early,
and I haven't even washed my face.

732
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:16,488
Where are you taking me?
Tell me where we're going at least.

733
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,923
Mr. Kim!

734
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:46,769
<i>Ji-woo, I want to get you imported cars</i>
<i>or limited edition luxury items,</i>

735
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,396
<i>but get them yourself.</i>

736
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,357
<i>You're rich.</i>

737
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:58,864
<i>But I'll find you a world</i>
<i>that you'll like.</i>

738
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,645
Ji-woo.

739
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,106
Are you okay?

740
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,315
The last bus has left.

741
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:35,192
Oh, that's okay.

742
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:39,363
Let's go, come on. Be careful. Let's go.

743
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:44,827
There.

744
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:09,786
The informant was Kang Min-woo.

745
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:13,749
<i>And you avoided me because you hated</i>
<i>the thought of me finding out?</i>

746
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:14,666
<i>Don't accuse me.</i>

747
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,586
<i>I didn't know that you, Seo Ji-woo,</i>
<i>and Cho Jin-eon were involved.</i>

748
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:22,925
<i>Her mom had her from an affair.</i>
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

749
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:25,344
<i>She needs our help,</i>
<i>so we should cooperate.</i>

750
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:31,350
<i>Kyeong-do is right before my eyes.</i>
<i>I can't tell my heart not to fall for him.</i>

751
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:34,144
<i>That's why couples elope at night.</i>

752
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:35,646
<i>Why do you need my passport?</i>

753
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,608
<i>I guess Dad wanted to see</i>
<i>this side of you, Ji-woo.</i>

754
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:40,943
<i>I can do it.</i>

755
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:42,861
<i>Let's get into trouble.</i>
