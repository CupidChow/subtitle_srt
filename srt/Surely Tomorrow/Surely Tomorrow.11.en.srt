1
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,592
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,135
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,845
- Director Seo, hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,472
- Hello.
<i>- The door's closing.</i>

5
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,682
Wait for me.

6
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,565
Do I smell like <i>jjajangmyeon?</i>

7
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:05,983
A little?

8
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,825
Have you ever tried the fabric freshener
on your hair before?

9
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:16,994
I wouldn't recommend it.

10
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:18,913
No?

11
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,787
EPISODE 11

12
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:10,673
- It's good.
- This is good.

13
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:14,343
Thank you. I wasn't going to have lunch.

14
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,764
Oh, right. How's your first article going?

15
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:22,643
I'm working on it, but I won't know
how it'll be until I finish it.

16
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,103
What are you working on?

17
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,730
The good and the bad cases
of idol group members

18
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:29,024
who later became actors.

19
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,030
You can just focus on the good ones.

20
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:38,200
That was my initial plan,
but the manager wanted the bad ones too.

21
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:40,536
Don't let her control your first article.

22
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,871
It was just an advice.

23
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,623
It'd actually help me
get more views as well.

24
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,751
She just had to taint an innocent kid.

25
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,170
Did you give her the flowers you made?

26
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,175
I didn't give them,
but I placed them near her.

27
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,927
Did you include something shiny?

28
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,389
I'm different from the department manager.

29
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,099
- Sure.
- Here. Have one more.

30
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,311
Keep up the good work.

31
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,271
Thank you.

32
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,912
DIDROXIN, SHALL WE MEET?
AN DA-HYE

33
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:27,207
Why do you keep sending me this?
Do you know me that well?

34
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,335
We're not strangers, either.

35
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,550
It's ridiculous that I came here,

36
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,428
but I did to make it clear for you.

37
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:43,349
Right. Things aren't clear
and I'm getting more and more questions.

38
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,978
I remember a conversation that
Dr. Kim Hae-chan was having on the phone.

39
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,232
He was talking to
a pharmaceutical salesman for a while.

40
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,984
Was it…

41
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,445
Didroxin?

42
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,407
I was wondering
if that had something to do with you.

43
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,993
Your wife.

44
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,331
I hear she got sick after taking that?

45
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:12,169
Why do I have a feeling
that you're hiding something?

46
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,343
It's not so bad staying here, is it?

47
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,929
Are you trying to stay for a long time?

48
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:27,351
When you see your actor colleagues

49
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,186
going to Cannes and Berlin,

50
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,356
doesn't it make you think
that you should work hard

51
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,274
or live a meaningful life?

52
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,569
You're here for doing drugs
with a married man,

53
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,904
and now this?

54
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,155
Watch your mouth.

55
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,532
You be careful.

56
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,118
Do you want to be sued for defamation?

57
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,038
I'm here because the dog
was barking too loud.

58
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,748
If you ever act up again,

59
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,460
you'll be here for a long time.

60
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,595
(DRAFT) STAR ON STAGE,
FAVORED ON SCREEN TOO?

61
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,181
Are you on duty tonight?

62
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,101
Isn't it Doo-jin?

63
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,812
He went out to buy something to eat.
Are you leaving now?

64
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,731
Yeah, I had dinner in the area.

65
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:15,566
What a surprise, you didn't drink?

66
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,527
I was with someone who ruins my appetite.

67
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,948
Right. The response to the article
was pretty mild.

68
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:24,825
Right.

69
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,453
It's raining. Get home safe.

70
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,415
Get back to work.

71
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,794
Seo Ji-woo and you make a good couple.
It's pissing me off.

72
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,172
Good night.

73
00:06:58,961 --> 00:06:59,920
What?

74
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,631
It woke me up.

75
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,217
It's pouring.

76
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,931
You should've called me. I would've come.

77
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,560
Waiting makes me anxious. I don't like it.

78
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:19,356
Okay. Here.

79
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,322
Now I'm getting sleepy.

80
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,409
I'm falling asleep.

81
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,996
Sleep. Sleep tight.

82
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,333
It's raining, Kyeong-do.

83
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,253
Yeah, it's raining.

84
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,188
- I'll drop you off, so don't say no.
- Okay.

85
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,651
The weather's good after the rain.

86
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,281
- Dry my umbrella.
- Yeah.

87
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,121
INCOMING CALL
JIN HAN-KYEONG

88
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,790
JI-YEON

89
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,590
- Hello?
- Hello?

90
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:31,303
JARIM APPAREL DIRECTOR SEO JI-WOO
PLANNED DIVORCE WITH HER ALLEGED LOVER?

91
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:36,058
SEO JI-WOO IS HAVING ANOTHER SCANDAL
FOR HAVING AN AFFAIR

92
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,771
JUST "ACQUAINTANCES FROM AN ACTING CLUB"
THE TWO DENIED THEIR SCANDAL

93
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,763
Did Cho Jin-eon do it?

94
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,432
Look at me.

95
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,644
Or Kang Min-woo?

96
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,020
Look at me, Ji-woo.

97
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,449
What are you going to do?

98
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,868
Listen.

99
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,580
We're going to work and do our job.

100
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,499
You see what I mean?

101
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,918
But people will…

102
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,463
Their gaze and their words.
Don't worry about them.

103
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,216
It sure won't be easy.

104
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,345
But still, you must do it
like your life depends on it.

105
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,974
You have to, okay?

106
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,102
You can do it.

107
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,730
You have to.

108
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,369
Ji-woo.

109
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,664
You can do that, right?

110
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:32,132
But it hasn't been confirmed yet.
Are there any other articles? Look it up.

111
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,260
Hey, is it true?

112
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,180
That's what I mean. You think it's true?

113
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,641
I'd be too embarrassed
to even come to work.

114
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,062
Assistant Manager Lee.

115
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,779
Haven't you noticed?

116
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,906
That a reporter was tailing you?

117
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:58,992
No.

118
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,370
What did Ji-woo say?

119
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,333
She's too shocked, so she's a mess.

120
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,752
Trouble never seems to end.

121
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,046
I'm worried.

122
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,714
I'm worried about you. You.

123
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,050
I'm okay.

124
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,676
Let's prepare a rebuttal.

125
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,264
What an absurd accusation. I can attest.
Do you want me to write it?

126
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:24,017
You don't need to do that.

127
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,066
Give me some time. To think.

128
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:49,793
Go ahead.

129
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,514
Tipping off is your thing, right?

130
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,891
You even involved Bae Jun-soo.

131
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,601
I had to do something.

132
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,354
Is this because you lost your chance
with the DNA test?

133
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:14,151
It looks like you've caught me
playing innocent.

134
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,493
They're divorce papers.

135
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:28,206
If you need any money, I'll help you.
You can talk to my lawyer.

136
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,544
- What's the reason?
- Don't you know?

137
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,383
Did I cheat on you?
Or did I do drugs like some asshole?

138
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,427
Or do I hit you?

139
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,763
I cherish my wife like my own body.

140
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,724
How can you demand a fucking divorce?

141
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,645
That's enough.
Just tell me if you need anything.

142
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,855
My family!

143
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,901
My family that I want to protect!
Don't you want to protect it?

144
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,157
Look, Ji-yeon.

145
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,117
You see,

146
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,537
I want an ordinary life.

147
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,540
My mother.

148
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,627
She's one wild woman, right?

149
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:19,132
I got married to avoid my wild mom,
and my wife turned out to be worse.

150
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,301
I just want…

151
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,597
an ordinary life.

152
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,475
Ji-yeon.

153
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,900
Don't touch me.
What the hell are you doing?

154
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,986
Seriously. Let me go.
Let go! It won't take long.

155
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,613
Seriously…

156
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:46,284
Don't they know who I am?
Didn't you tell them?

157
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:50,830
Ji-woo.

158
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,208
Why the long face?

159
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,794
- Are you embarrassed about the affair?
- Get out.

160
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:56,962
I can't.

161
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,589
I told you
I won't let you get away with it.

162
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:02,217
I'll see you hit rock bottom
by any means necessary.

163
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,595
You know it's not true.
Why are you wasting your energy?

164
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,181
So shameless. Are you out of your mind?

165
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,228
A setup for a divorce?
Are you even that stupid to fall for that?

166
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,229
Stupid?

167
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,233
Now you even… You're crossing the line.

168
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,401
Am I?

169
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,283
Cho Jin-eon, who do you think
reported you doing drugs?

170
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,452
Who do you think released those pictures?

171
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:33,039
Kang Min-woo set up our divorce.
I finally got to leave you thanks to him.

172
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,585
You got anything more to say?

173
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:43,842
<i>JARIM will close the menswear business</i>
<i>and focus on women's apparel.</i>

174
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,012
<i>Due to Director Seo Ji-woo's affair</i>

00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,639

00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,522
<i>On the other hand, JARIM's PR team said</i>

179
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,942
<i>that until her ex-husband Cho Jin-eon's</i>
<i>drug articles were released,</i>

180
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,445
<i>they weren't in touch. If necessary…</i>

181
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,035
The drama rerun isn't on.

182
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,538
It's a digestive medicine.
Take two tablets and drink this.

183
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,001
Did you go to the pharmacy?

184
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:45,570
Hey, Doo-jin. There's a rumor
Member A is leaving her group. Check.

185
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,614
Okay.

186
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,627
Why are you skipping dinner?

187
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,507
This isn't like you.

188
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,552
Assistant Manager,

189
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,597
why aren't you saying it's not true?

190
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,852
What should I say?

191
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,855
"We met after her divorce."

192
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,526
"I was the one who tried to
stop the article about her ex-husband."

193
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,905
If I say that, will people buy it?

194
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,665
It won't stop until someone's dead.

195
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,958
Kyeong-do!

196
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:45,130
Or smash it with an even bigger hammer.
Otherwise, it won't end.

197
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,092
This is delicious.

198
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,770
The stock price plummeted.

199
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,275
I mean, I've only heard about it.
What are you going to do, Ms. Seo?

200
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,945
The shares go up and down.

201
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,030
I consider it a temporal ruckus.

202
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,282
A ruckus?

203
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,494
Not only did the stock price plummet.
Have you seen the sales status?

204
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,749
Director Seo Ji-woo,
do you have any plans to resolve this?

205
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,002
No, I don't.

206
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,760
I responded that it's not true
to reports that aren't true.

207
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,219
I won't take any further action.

208
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,680
Don't you think that is irresponsible?

209
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,604
It's painful

210
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,024
to see the stock price drop
and the boycott…

211
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:49,736
due to my personal matters.

212
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,155
Director Seo Ji-woo, you need to resign.

213
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:55,492
That still won't extinguish this fire,

214
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,286
but we still need to stop the fire
from spreading.

215
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,955
I won't approve that.

216
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,793
She made a major contribution
to our beginning as a luxury brand.

217
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,713
And she'll be flying to Paris next week
to sign the contract.

218
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,258
How can we
let the person in charge resign?

219
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,136
What's the point
of creating a luxury brand?

220
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,430
Will it even sell?

221
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,812
As a member of the owner's family,

222
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,980
my apologies.

223
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,988
This is all our fault.

224
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,079
I dare to say

225
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,791
we should appoint a new management
specialist as CEO, and have me,

226
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,001
CEO Seo,

227
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:48,795
and Director Seo…

228
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,676
all resign from the management.

229
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:16,823
Are you holding back your words,
or agreeing with him by remaining silent?

230
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,366
Ms. Seo,

231
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,160
I made it very clear.

232
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,454
I said I'd let it slide once,

233
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,083
but if any negative news
on Director Seo breaks out again,

234
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,626
then I couldn't help it.

235
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,379
- Executive Director Choi--
- Also,

236
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,883
that your safety won't be guaranteed.

237
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,011
I made myself clear on that.

238
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,221
Bye.

239
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,526
I'm here to see Director Kang Min-woo.

240
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,361
One moment, please.

241
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,825
This is unexpected.

242
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:06,706
Is it?

243
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:19,177
It's not the best day to be here.
The executives just had a meeting.

244
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,597
The owner's family has to step down.

245
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,433
The ones that did this to the company.

246
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,478
We're ashamed, too.

247
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,067
You've got a lot to say, don't you?

248
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,988
You rattled? You have a long tongue.

249
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,200
You got one thing wrong.

250
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,161
It's not "the ones," but "the one."

251
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,997
It's just you alone, Kang Min-woo.

252
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,921
Do you even have time for this?
Why did you come to see me?

253
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:59,384
Kang Min-woo,
you're out of bullets, right?

254
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,471
I've only just started,

255
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,891
and you're only left to be fucked up.

256
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,645
Just so you know.

257
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,400
Yoo Dan-bi who quit.
Make sure to keep her hidden.

258
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,947
Did fear get to your head?

259
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,574
I don't get what you're saying.

260
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,330
You are indeed from an educated family,

261
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,251
you sound so fucking sophisticated.

262
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,472
Were you shocked? Were you scared, Ji-woo?

263
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,605
What about you? Isn't it hard?

264
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,565
Well…

265
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:42,862
It feels like I've become a celebrity.

266
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,493
Because everyone is looking at me,
I feel kind of proud.

267
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,995
How can you be joking now?

268
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,876
It'll be over soon.
Hang in there for just a little more.

269
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,254
I'm good at writing rebuttal articles.

270
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,678
I'm worried about you.

271
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,353
Thanks.

272
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,712
Are you closed?

273
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,888
I told you not to be on a diet.
Are you on a diet again?

274
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,185
I'm going through so much right now.
Do I look like I lost weight?

275
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,855
You… Don't you play with me again.

276
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:03,276
Mom, Dad, let's have a family meeting.
Have a seat.

277
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:08,030
All right. Sit down.

278
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:11,868
Did you buy cryptocurrency?

279
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,829
He doesn't do things like that.

280
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,665
Coins? I'm too busy for that.

281
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:25,798
Dad,

282
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:31,012
that thing that you and I both knew
but never checked.

283
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,557
It's about time to bring it up.

284
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,022
Mom, the thing is…

285
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:48,404
SOMANG LAUNDROMAT

286
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,189
Doesn't it get stuffy inside?

287
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,486
It feels like someone's watching me.
It's bothering me.

288
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:32,531
You should've been an actress.
Why'd anyone follow you and take pictures?

289
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,835
I can't believe it.

290
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,755
It's suffocating enough to kill someone.

291
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,007
Se-yeong,

292
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,552
you know what suffocates me the most?

293
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,141
I'm also worried about the company
and my sister, but…

294
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,396
Kyeong-do…

295
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,776
That you might break up with Kyeong-do?

296
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,449
That scares me the most.

297
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,380
You'll soon become famous with me around.

298
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,965
I don't care.

299
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:34,510
My article got rejected again.

300
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,931
- No impact, apparently.
- The first article is the hardest.

301
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,976
Are you buying me lunch to cheer me up?

302
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,020
- You're buying.
- I don't mind that either.

303
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:50,109
- Write about something else.
- On what?

304
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,070
Okay, this is the vibe.

305
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,115
The saddest "groundless rumor"

306
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,200
in the world.

307
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,538
If you say something is groundless,

308
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,709
do you think people will simply believe,
"It wasn't true. It was groundless"?

309
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,086
Its groundlessness
should be well-grounded.

310
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,882
I'm not writing about the most
outrageous groundlessness in the world.

311
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,303
You must not be desperate enough.

312
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,140
- I'll pay for this. Write it.
- Not interested.

313
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:25,478
The manager will freak out again.
We'd be done if another outlet gets it.

314
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,771
But why me?

315
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,154
This is something

316
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,782
a TJ has to write.

317
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,994
Let me start with the story
of our laundromat.

318
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,628
I'm recording it.

319
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:04,558
My father got into a serious accident.

320
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:09,271
And the company that was responsible
paid him a lot for the compensation.

321
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,149
So he opened the laundromat
with that money.

322
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,615
It's good that your daughter
got married in nice weather.

323
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,533
6 YEARS AGO

324
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,410
- His son-in-law seemed great.
- I see.

325
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,037
Kyeong-do, you should get married too.

326
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,914
Yeah, I should.

327
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:31,502
I guess the laundromat is doing well.

328
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,339
It's just enough to make ends meet.

329
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:37,758
Is this your first time here?

330
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:42,972
That's right. You live nearby.
You should come more often.

331
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,891
Because I was jealous,
I didn't want to come.

332
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:50,938
Why would you be jealous
about a small laundromat?

333
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:56,152
Han-soo runs his own business
with free money,

334
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,363
but I'm working on the construction site
whether it's hot or cold.

335
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,741
I was starting to get a little jealous.

336
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:06,662
My goodness.
How can you call that free money?

337
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:11,083
You know Han-soo almost died,
and his legs are still not well.

338
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,334
Hey.

339
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,338
But it's true.
How is the compensation free money?

340
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,756
Nam-sook, think.

341
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,636
Who'd pay him that much money
for working on the road?

342
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,640
Everyone else who got injured with him,
they only got the government compensation.

343
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:28,392
- Only Han-soo--
- Hey.

344
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,770
Manager Kim. You're drunk.

345
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,441
Right. Yes.

346
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,320
Oh, jeez. I drank too much.

347
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:43,866
I shouldn't have come drunk
when Kyeong-do quit drinking.

348
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,367
Sorry, Kyeong-do.

349
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,952
No. It's okay.

350
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,623
I should, well, get going.

351
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,458
Are you leaving?

352
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:56,545
Nam-sook, you see, next time,
I'll come back with a gift.

353
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,839
You don't have to get us anything.
Get home safe.

354
00:29:58,923 --> 00:29:59,924
Yeah, bye.

355
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,342
- Bye.
- Yeah.

356
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,968
- Bye.
- Bye.

357
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,014
What was that man saying, honey?

358
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:10,059
Who knows? It was the alcohol talking.

359
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,523
Manager Kim.

360
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,944
Did I forget something?

361
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,112
No, you didn't.

362
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:24,949
About what you said earlier.

363
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,162
I was just talking gibberish.
It was drunk talk, you know?

364
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,372
Just joking.

365
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,915
No, it's...

366
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:36,418
I knew there was something
questionable about it.

367
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:41,048
I heard that Mr. Park and Mr. Seo
didn't get compensated much.

368
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,718
But why only my dad…

369
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:49,557
Oh, whatever. It's all in the past.

370
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,060
Well, someone gave that money.

371
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,563
Someone gave that money for your father.

372
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,149
I also got paid a little
to keep my mouth closed.

373
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,067
Who?

374
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,278
I wouldn't know.

375
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:06,574
I saw the business card of the man
who came by at the time…

376
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,243
JARIM?

377
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:13,956
The name of his company was…
JARIM something…

378
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:16,834
Gosh, it was…

379
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:24,466
5 YEARS AGO

380
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:34,351
[OBITUARY] JARIM APPAREL CHAIRMAN

FUNERAL SERVICE IS HELD IN ROOM 2
AT YEONGSE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

382
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,864
You look like
you're over 190 cm in person.

383
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,157
3 YEARS AGO

384
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,283
I'm not that tall.

385
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,327
You have great proportion.

386
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,957
Can we take your pictures first
and proceed with the interview?

387
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,834
- Yeah, sounds good to me.
- Okay.

388
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:30,050
Okay, so, can you pose? Yeah, that's good.

389
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,390
DEATH ANNIVERSARY

390
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,360
- Welcome.
- Hello.

391
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,074
This one. I'll take this.

392
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,827
- Would you like this as a whole?
- Yes.

393
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,870
One moment, please.

00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,669

397
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,266
Hello.

398
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,352
I'll take what the mannequin's wearing.

399
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,230
- Okay. One moment, please.
- Thank you.

400
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,487
- Hello.
- Hi.

401

402
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,865
You're taking
what the mannequin's wearing?

403
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,159
- Yes.
- One moment, please.

MR. A'S SCANDAL WITH SEO JI-WOO
"GROUNDLESS" [OFFICIAL]

405
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,795
<i>Those four suits</i>

406
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,089
<i>were my way of paying tribute.</i>

407
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:15,656
What is this?

408
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:31,922
Thank you.

409
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,022
Do you want to come down?

410
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,817
It's an exclusive.

411
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,321
Dongwoon's Entertainment Team
knows how to do their job.

412
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,824
The assistant manager is releasing
his own exclusive.

413
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:05,539
Han-kyeong.
It's already hard for me. Stop nagging.

414
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,293
I'm saying thank you.

415
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:18,760
Just…

416
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,889
don't do anything.

417
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:29,938
If I don't do anything, Ji-woo
and CEO Seo will get kicked out.

418
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,690
That's none of your business.

419
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:35,777
Let's face it. They're rich,
so why don't you two just go live abroad?

420
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,824
What's the point of staying here?
You can't move on even after 18 years!

421
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,993
So she'd be an adulterer
for the rest of her life?

422
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,415
Han-kyeong, don't you know?

423
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,792
Don't you know this field?

424
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:57,007
Even if we report it hundreds of times
that it's not true, it changes nothing.

425
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,135
People believe what they want to believe.

426
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,679
Is it going to stop there?

427
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,099
There will be fake articles
all over the place for the views.

428
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:10,062
They'll reuse that video and that article
to make more videos and articles.

429
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:15,275
By then, even the people involved
are confused about what's true.

430
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:19,404
"It's better to hide. It's better to die!"

431
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,702
You know it's impossible.

432
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,756
Does she know?

433
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,716
This means a breakup.

434
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,139
Your love's doomed again.

435
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,725
Damn it.

436
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:43,905
Do you want me to sleep with you?

437
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:47,325
Were you excited?

438
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,210
So you've been keeping it.

439
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,712
You had it this whole time.

440
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,256
Make sure to keep it for a long time.

441
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:12,184
Godot never comes, but you will, right?

442
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,604
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll always stay next to you.

443
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,523
He must have missed his wife so much
to write such a poem.

444
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:26,698
Hold me.

445
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:38,251
If I said I would wait for you,
would you come?

446
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:40,378
Of course, I would.

447
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,881
I'm dead happy that you're next to me.

448
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,426
<i>I feel like I'm finally living my life.</i>

449
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,763
I love you, Kyeong-do.

450
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,306
Don't leave me now.

451
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:53,850
Or I'll die.

452
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:26,091
Is the assistant manager sick?
He looked okay yesterday.

453
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:32,973
What's going on?

454
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,433
Reporter Nam.

455
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,395
- Yes.
- When is it to be released?

456
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,647
It's scheduled for 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

457
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:42,190
Okay.

458
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:49,281
What? What is it?

459
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,763
Do you want to sleep with me?

460
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,267
Let's do it, Kyeong-do!

461
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,646
- Let's do it.
- My goodness…

462
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:01,186
Mr. Kim, in the past…

463
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:02,812
Yes?

464
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:07,442
I was happy to drive on this road.

465
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:11,321
Probably because I went to see
Kyeong-do, right?

466
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,659
I like this road.

467
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,126
So, well…

468
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,588
You have to come with her.

469
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,509
If Ji-woo drives on the way back,
it'll be too dangerous.

470
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,513
Kyeong-do.

471
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,348
I'm only worried about her. I'm okay.

472
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,227
I won't drink or be lost again.

473
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:44,646
I won't.

474
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,237
I thought you two
finally got to be happy together.

475
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,305
So…

476
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,602
you're leaving, aren't you?

477
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,275
I think...

478
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,487
I'll have to go.

479
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,626
If I start drinking again, you'll stay.

480
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,212
Don't do that.

481
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,547
If I get into trouble again, you won't go.

482
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,841
- I know you won't do that.
- If I!

483
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:42,305
If I…

484
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:49,062
I drink, take pills, get into trouble,
and become a mess again…

485
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:58,029
then what?
Are you still going to leave me?

486
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,700
I know you won't do that anymore.

487
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:09,833
No.

488
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,086
You are not going. You can't leave.

489
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,764
I can't even fathom it.

490
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,686
I can't even imagine…

491
00:45:33,106 --> 00:45:35,400
how I'm going to carry on from now.

492
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:42,157
When I woke up in the morning,
all I thought about was you.

493
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,204
I hadn't noticed
the flower shop in my neighborhood

494
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,665
until I met you.

495
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,382
I even bought sunscreen.

496
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:04,471
To look good in front of you.

497
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:07,849
I look in the mirror

498
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,894
and take care of my skin.

499
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,360
When a guy smells nice,

500
00:46:21,321 --> 00:46:23,239
I ask him about the cologne he uses.

501
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,995
I've never done that in my life before.

502
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,708
Because all I care about is you.

503
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:39,672
I'm also shocked
by how unfamiliar I am to myself.

504
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,052
Oh…

505
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:48,264
is this love?

506
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:53,228
I'm happy even when it rains…

507
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:56,814
or even when it's windy.

508
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,153
Exactly.

509
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,031
So you can't go.

510
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,701
You're not leaving.

511
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,337
I'm angry about those nights…

512
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,925
where I fell asleep with you in my arms.

513
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:31,641
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have fallen asleep.

514
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,564
I should've been just looking at you

515
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:40,233
and held you tight.

516
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,123
The time we started here...

517
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,673
I miss every second of it.

518
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,469
I miss it already, Ji-woo.

519
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,731
Don't do that, Kyeong-do.

520
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,485
Don't go, Kyeong-do.

521
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,827
You know it. Please?

522
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,541
I can't do it.

523
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,711
I can't.

524
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:46,799
Let's…

525
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,595
live well.

526
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,225
This time,

527
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,313
let's…

528
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,775
leave on a good note…

529
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,236
and be well-off.

530
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,202
With enough memories of our love,

531
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:18,039
let's carry on.

THE VOICES SUPPORTING JARIM APPAREL

538
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,361
<i>Don't you have pride?</i>

539
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,071
- You never change.
- What do you mean?

540
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,532
How can you be wearing my brand?

541
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,035
I got this so you'd thrive.
Is that a problem?

542

A BUYS FOUR SUITS…
TO HONOR THE LATE CHAIRMAN SEO WON-SEOK

543
00:52:55,298 --> 00:52:58,593
LATE SEO WON-SEOK

544
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,554
They're peonies that look like Mom.

545
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,516
You're the only person
who thinks that way, Dad.

546
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,477
They don't look like Mom at all.

547
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:20,531
You granted my request.

548
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:25,953
It's not too late. Let's go home.

549
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:27,997
I already sent my luggage.

550
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,167
We can take it out.

551
00:53:32,001 --> 00:53:32,919
That's a hassle.

552
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,922
Then will you come back
after taking some rest?

553
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:37,757
No.

554
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:41,636
I don't want to come back.

555
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:43,471
Why not?

556
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,807
Your mom, your dad and your sister,
everyone's here.

557
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,195
Dad, do you like me?

558
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,238
What kind of question is that?

559
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,909
Who wouldn't like their daughters?
You brat.

560
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:32,770
Don't go. Stay here, will you?

561
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,773
I'll go…

562
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,945
I'll go for now…

563
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,284
And if I can't bear it, I'll come back.

564
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,037
Why bother waiting
until you can't bear it?

565
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:56,752
Dad.

566
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:04,552
I owe you

567
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:07,013
so much.

568
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:10,016
Now you're all mature,
you're saying goodbye?

569
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:16,313
But I have one more favor.

570
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,155
I really…

571
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:34,165
I really, really love him so much, Dad.

572
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,293
But I can't stay next to him right now.

573
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:42,798
I can't be a burden to him too.

574
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:54,477
Kyeong-do is having…

575
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,189
a really hard time.

576
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:08,741
So…

577
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,328
please, Dad…

578
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:22,630
Will you protect Kyeong-do for me?

579
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:32,556
I'm shameless, aren't I?

580
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:36,644
Jeez, I don't know
why you're going to New York

581
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,397
when you can't even speak
your native language properly.

582
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:43,150
There's no shame
between parents and children.

583
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:00,626
Thank you, Dad.

584
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,171
I miss you.

585
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:14,431
If you do this, what does that make me?

586
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,520
I knew my father-in-law
was a good man, but…

587
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,564
The beautiful stories about him
never stop.

588
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:26,193
This isn't something to laugh off.
Don't you sense the atmosphere already?

589
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:30,322
"I'll bury myself in JARIM," "So proud,"
"I'm rooting for the Seo sisters."

590
00:57:30,406 --> 00:57:31,448
What now?

591
00:57:31,532 --> 00:57:34,493
There's no way to sell the company.
It can't be justified anymore.

592
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:38,539
That's all in the past.
How was I supposed to know?

593
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,166
Then tell me.

594
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:44,378
How come you, who stayed next to him
for your whole life, didn't know?

595
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:48,132
So,

596
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,802
you started this when this is all you had?

597
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:55,347
Since CEO Seo scheduled a meeting,
let's hear her first.

598
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,439
Let me just ask one thing.

599
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,109
Most of you here
worked with the late Chairman

600
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:10,362
since JARIM used to be JARIM Textile.

601
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,489
Do you still view these events

602
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:16,660
as owner-related risk?

603
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:23,709
So do you all agree to appoint a new CEO?

604
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,254
All my father ever wanted was

605
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:32,134
for everyone to be happy and find peace
in JARIM's clothes. That's all.

606
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,222
With his teaching deep down in my bones,

607
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:39,934
I worked hard for JARIM day and night.

608
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,186
I believe that good deeds

609
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:45,606
result in another good deed.

610
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:52,863
Do you think that is the only good story
about the late Chairman?

611
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:58,244
Someone has attempted
to own MANZAAR before.

612
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,666
And they even tried to launch a new brand
with MANZAAR's designers.

613
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,168
What? What do you mean?

614
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,379
Was it someone among us?

615
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:09,588
Yes, among you.

616
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:15,010
Here are the testimonies of the designers
who resigned because of that.

617
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:23,143
My father let it slide
as if it never happened.

618
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,728
TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE

619
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:28,190
The other day,
I met Executive Director Choi Jin-sook

620
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:32,069
to ask her to be someone JARIM can rely on
and filled her glass with soju.

621
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,571
Since past is only past.

622
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,616
But it's confirmed
that she met the executives one by one

623
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:41,954
with unconfirmed speculations
and instigated them to sell JARIM.

624
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:44,707
Show us.

625
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,546
This man, Bae Jun-soo,

626
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,216
receives commission
from buying and selling companies.

627
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,467
I wonder

628
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,264
why Director Kang
and Executive Director Choi met with him?

629
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:05,936
Executive Director Choi.

630
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:12,192
There is a slight misunderstanding.

631
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,069
I was only--

632
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:16,905
Oh, you were just following
Director Kang Min-woo?

633
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:18,949
Director Kang Min-woo,

634
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,744
what was that meeting about?

635
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:27,374
If we keep in touch,
it may lead to a good connection.

636
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,126
It was just a casual meal with no purpose.

637
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:31,170
Oh, I see.

638
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:37,343
Today,

639
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:44,558
I will not remain silent about the scandal
MANZAAR had in the past

640
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,936
and request the dismissal
of Executive Director Choi Jin-sook.

641
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:51,982
Let me remind you

642
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:56,653
that I have the right
to dismiss executives.

643
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:13,587
Shit!

644
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:26,058
Did you go see Dad?

645
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:35,150
Dad protects me even in heaven.

646
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:40,364
I guess a good man does good things
even after he dies.

647
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:42,533
Yes.

648
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,537
There is another good man.

649
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:51,375
Kyeong-do saved JARIM

650
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,877
and me as well.

651
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:03,053
Look how smart he is.

652
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:07,391
Just with four suits,
the affair and the divorce setup,

653
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:10,477
he covered them all up.

654
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:14,314
Because they weren't true.
It's a reporter's duty to reveal it.

655
01:02:14,398 --> 01:02:16,692
Does groundless mean the truth?

656
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:20,779
It's a false report.
It's just a world-shattering false report.

657
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:30,747
Is it tough?

658
01:02:36,879 --> 01:02:38,338
Actually, I'm barely carrying on.

659
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:43,886
Do you think you can go to Paris?
Or do you want me to go?

660
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:49,933
I'll go. Lucas said
he's curious about my love story.

661
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:51,685
I think he's noticed.

662
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:57,316
I heard he's a romanticist.
He'll like JARIM even more.

663
01:03:01,153 --> 01:03:04,114
You should tell Kyeong-do
about the company's situation.

664
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:06,909
He needs a hole to breathe through.

665
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:10,329
Okay.

666
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:26,345
Nam-sook, aren't you coming?

667
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:37,439
I'm not going because I'm upset.

668
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,692
I have a temper too.

669
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:45,531
Do I have two children or three?

670
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,325
I only have one son.

671
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,829
I only have one. Let him live happily.

672
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,582
Is that too much to ask?

673
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:04,258
You can't do that.
You should know better than that.

674
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,275
Mom, Dad.

675
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,192
My baby.

676
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:24,236
Why are you quiet?

677
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,196
Are you fighting?

678
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:28,365
No. Were you surprised?

679
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:31,034
- Do you want to go to bed?
- Yes.

680
01:04:31,577 --> 01:04:34,663
Let's go to bed.
Let's sleep with Mommy, my baby.

681
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:51,847
Good night.

682
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,475
I'm lucky.

683
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:01,398
To have married the person I love
and to have a child with her.

684
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:05,861
I'm lucky.

685
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:09,781
I'm off.

686
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:34,973
Here.

687
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:37,517
Good job.

688
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,813
Just like that?

689
01:05:43,649 --> 01:05:45,359
Just a meal would have been fine.

690
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,362
I'm just showing you that I'm fine.
I'm not craving alcohol.

691
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:51,823
First of all,
my first article is full of lies.

692
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:53,283
Hey.

693
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:54,701
It's not groundless.

694
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:58,664
Articles like that exist.
Often in the Entertainment Team.

695
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,124
Hey, don't you get on his nerves.

696
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,919
If you rub salt in his wound,
he'll go nuts.

697
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:08,340
- How can you leave us out?
- I'm disappointed.

698
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:10,092
- What the hell?
- We're joining you.

699
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,176
How did you know?

700
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:12,636
We tailed you.

701
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,057
How come you're the only ones watching me?
Aren't there any hot guys?

702
01:06:17,683 --> 01:06:18,809
Han-kyeong.

703
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:20,727
I'm right here.

704
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:23,814
Are you crazy?

705
01:06:23,897 --> 01:06:25,649
So obnoxious.

706
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,488
Assistant Manager,
are you drinking tonight?

707
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:35,826
Assistant Manager is soothing his pain
with filtered water.

708
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,744
He's on a different level from you.

709
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:38,787
You…

710
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,039
- What do you take me for? A loafer?
- Yes.

711
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,042
You are a loafer.

712
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:45,877
You are. You come to our team every day.

713
01:06:45,961 --> 01:06:47,629
Okay, everyone.

714
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,798
Let's toast.

715
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:52,467
Condolences to
Lee Kyeong-do's doomed love story.

716
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:53,510
Cheers.

717
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:02,102
Jeez, this is why
the Entertainment Team is annoying.

718
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:03,729
Sit down.

719
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:05,272
Pass me the chopsticks.

720
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,983
Reporter Nam. Let's go back to
the different level thing.

721
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,609
Enough!

722
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,659
You got something to say?
Why are you still here?

723
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,538
What do we do about Kang Min-woo?

724
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:23,790
He'd throw a tantrum.

725
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:26,460
He's more than capable of doing that.

726
01:07:26,543 --> 01:07:29,880
Jeez, I can't find evidence on him.
I need to bust his ass.

727
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,591
Do you want me to meet An Da-hye?

728
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:38,847
Would it be faster to find Yoo Dan-bi,
or make An Da-hye say something?

729
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:29,731
Good night.

730
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:41,219
Dongwoon Daily Entertainment Team.

731
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:42,137
Hello.

732
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:43,722
Yes.

733
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:46,016
Okay, one moment, please.

734
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,935
Assistant Manager, it's for you.

735
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:50,562
Okay.

736
01:09:54,316 --> 01:09:55,400
Lee Kyeong-do speaking.

737
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:56,693
<i>It's me, An Da-hye.</i>

738
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:00,322
Hi.

739
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:01,656
Didroxin.

740
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,409
I think I know something.

741
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:11,958
Come now.

742
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:47,369
FUNERAL HALL

743
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:56,062
<i>Only if one could entreat Elder Wolha…</i>

744
01:11:56,146 --> 01:12:00,150
<i>That we be born</i>
<i>with fates exchanged in the next life…</i>

745
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,902
<i>Lee Kyeong-do?</i>
<i>As in latitude and longitude?</i>

746
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,738
<i>- Latitude, longitude, Kyeong-do.</i>
<i>- Kyeong-do.</i>

747
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:05,780
<i>Kyeong-do.</i>

748
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,159
<i>Ji-woo.</i>

749
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:11,911
<i>- Over a thousand </i>ri <i>away…</i>
<i>- Over a thousand </i>ri <i>away…</i>

750
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:12,996
<i>I will die…</i>

751
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,080
<i>I will die…</i>

752
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,248
<i>And you live.</i>

753
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,166
<i>And you live.</i>

754
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:17,167
<i>Why?</i>

755
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:19,586
- Are you going to marry another woman?
- What?

756
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,756
<i>Then you shall know</i>

757
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:26,176
<i>the depth of my sorrow.</i>
