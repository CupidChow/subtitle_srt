1
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,925
It's way too early,
and I haven't even washed my face.

2
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,721
Where are you taking me?
Tell me where we're going at least.

3
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,276
Mr. Kim!

4
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:21,832
Is it really you?
Are you really, truly my Mr. Kim?

5
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,375
I really am your Mr. Kim.

6
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,254
- Mr. Kim!
- Oh, my.

7
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:30,800
Did you bring him here?

8
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:33,385
You need to know how much effort I made.

9
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:37,181
Then are you staying with me
from now on? Yeah?

10
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,684
Well, Kyeong-do begged me to do so.

11
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,522
But where's the highlight?

12
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,777
Hey… How can I wear that at this age?

13
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,363
You don't know how to throw a surprise.

14
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,280
Gosh…

15
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,244
How am I supposed to put this on?

16
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:02,706
You yourself are the gift.
It even matches your personal color.

17
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,624
Give it to me.

18
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,501
You want me to?

19
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,460
Just this once.

20
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,088
- Okay. Fine, do it.
- Do it?

21
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,382
Here…

22
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,551
- You look so pretty.
- Really?

23
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,885
It looks good on you, Mr. Kim.

24
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,303
- Really?
- Yeah, totally!

25
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,348
You… All right.

26
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,059
Now, where to?

27
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,572
Mr. Kim, did you read the articles
about my divorce?

28
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,741
Of course I did. Good job.
I'm proud of you.

29
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,202
You can just live freely
like the people these days,

30
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:42,788
and if it doesn't work,
just find a new one.

31
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:46,500
Honestly, you can get married
even three times with that beauty.

32
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,628
I agree with you.
It'd be a shame to waste my beauty.

33
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,047
But three times is too many.

34
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:58,053
Anyway, have you been keeping in touch
with Kyeong-do?

35
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,514
And together, you missed me?

36
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:12,568
WINTER, 2015

37
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,876
NAME: LEE HAN-SOO

38
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,767
WISHING YOU A FAST RECOVERY

39
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:23,138
INPATIENT WARD

40
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:25,224
- Mr. Kim!
- Hey.

41
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,186
I knew it was you.

42
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,314
I was in the area.

43
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,944
Mr. Kim, I appreciate this, but…

44
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,322
we don't need it.

45
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,158
Take it. I got a lot for my severance pay.

46
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:44,451
Severance pay?

47
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,623
I quit. It happened.

48
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,712
It's not much. Get something
for your parents to cheer them up.

49
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:04,388
Thank you.

50
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,101
Kyeong-do.

51
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:15,315
Life can be stifling
even when we're doing our best, right?

52
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,239
Still, cheer up. That's how you carry on.

53
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,745
Bye. Make sure to eat well.

54
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,829
Okay.

55
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,111
Kyeong-do.

56
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:04,615
Yeah?

57
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,702
Thank you so much
for bringing back Mr. Kim.

58
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,789
I've never even thought about it.

59
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,168
I did all of this for you--

60
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,628
Let's take my press release photo.

61
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:20,589
Please?

62
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,556
I feel like facing this side tonight.

63
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,891
Kyeong-do.

64
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,062
Kyeong-do?

65
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,818
If you do it after a punch,
it breaks both our hearts, doesn't it?

66
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,695
Do it when I'm still being nice, okay?

67
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:48,200
The cell phones these days
have really nice cameras, you know?

68
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,744
Let's take just a few, okay?

69
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,997
I love you, Kyeong-do, yeah?

70
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,749
Yeah? Yeah?

71
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,709
This love is twisted.

72
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,962
I love you, Kyeong-do. Yeah?

73
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,464
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

74
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,467
EPISODE 8

75
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,933
So, one more lap?

76
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,480
Didn't you learn about
saving energy when you were little?

77
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:23,527
I know how the first day at work
makes you tense,

78
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,613
but we've been going around
five times already.

79
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:32,286
Why don't you just take the bus next time?
Or you can take the subway.

80
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,414
Mr. Kim, hurry up.
I have to use the restroom.

81
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:39,168
My gosh, so why did you
gulp down all that coffee?

82
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,348
- Hello?
<i>- We're arriving soon. Focus.</i>

83
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,433
Hey, look--

84
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,477
My goodness.

85
00:07:58,979 --> 00:07:59,938
Okay.

86
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,068
Bye.

87
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:05,986
Good luck!

88
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,055
One more time.

89
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,708
But why is she making me do this?

90
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,921
She's pretty though.

JARIM Apparel's PR Team is working hard.

93
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:40,747
What is it?

94
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,127
"Director Seo Ji-woo
of JARIM Apparel's first step."

95
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:46,837
This one.

96
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,588
What a nice picture.

97
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,302
Someone in their PR Team must've worked
until their knees got worn out for this.

98
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:58,015
Who knows if it was their employee,
or someone in love with her?

99
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,892
What?

100
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,271
What?

101
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,940
What are you saying?

102
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:11,903
Hello?

103
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,906
<i>Hi. I'm calling you</i>
<i>regarding the results for the analysis</i>

104
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,992
<i>- you requested last time.</i>
- Okay.

105
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,660
Didroxin?

106
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,580
Yes, that's what was found.

107
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,876
Well… What is that used for?

108
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,545
It's prescribed
to the Stick Syndrome patients.

109
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,464
Stick Syndrome?

110
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,799
It's a type of chronic vascular disease.

DIDROXIN

113
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:44,186
<i>It's manageable</i>
<i>as long as they take the medicine,</i>

114
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,396
<i>and the drug doesn't have</i>
<i>any dangerous toxicity.</i>

115
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,441
However, in case of overdose,
it can cause side effects.

116
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,860
So they need to consult the doctor.

117
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,322
What kind of side effects?

118
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,450
Memory loss and cognitive disorder.

119
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,995

A SERIOUS COGNITIVE DISORDER
HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED

124
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:38,824
Hi, Ms. Seo. It's me.
Do you have time to meet?

125
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:40,951
Come in.

126
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,176
Thank you.

127
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:02,556
One second.

128
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,822
Don't drink
what the secretaries give you anymore.

129
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,161
The coffee I took last time.

130
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,833
So I can drink it later.

131
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,043
Oh, yes. That.

132
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,630
I actually had it analyzed.

133
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,008
Are you taking Didroxin by chance?

134
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,093
Didroxin…

135
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,514
I think I used to take it in the past.

136
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,392
But I'm taking something else right now.

137
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,186
But why do you ask…

138
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,729
Well…

139
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,691
Can I ask why you changed your medicine?

140
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:01,198
At the time,
I was on a business trip abroad.

141
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,285
I think my husband said
he was meeting my doctor.

142
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:09,372
He said the doctor wanted to
change my prescription

143
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,333
because better medicine was released.

144
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,377
But you didn't hear that
directly from your doctor?

145
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,421
No.

146
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,549
Is there a problem with that medicine?

147
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,511
The medicine itself isn't bad.

148
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,388
But it can cause side effects.

149
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:31,269
I looked up some papers
and consulted medical reporters as well.

150
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,399
And I think it's related
to your Alzheimer's symptoms.

151
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,528
Why is that in my coffee…

152
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,198
Who would…

153
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,496
I doubt it.

154
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,792
He wouldn't do such a…

155
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,672
Nothing is certain.
But you should still be careful.

156
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,096
Don't take any drinks or food
from Secretary Yoo.

157
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:10,183
Still, if you take nothing from her,
she might notice.

158
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,311
So you need to act naturally
until you have evidence.

159
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,442
You should set up a camera in the pantry.

160
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:21,861
Okay.

161
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,745
I owe you more and more.

162
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,040
How am I ever going to repay you?

163
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,671
It's just a reporter's hunch.
I didn't do much.

164
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,506
I didn't know you were ill.

165
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,136
All I have to do is just take medicine.

166
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,847
It doesn't affect my daily life.

167
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,391
It's not life-threatening.

168
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,692
How about we talk to Ji-woo about this?
She should know…

169
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,112
Right. I should talk to her.

170
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,783
Would you like to see her before you go?

171
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,370
She probably shouldn't know that I'm here.

172
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,849
You should've waited at home.

173
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,518
I just got here.
Mr. Kim, thank you for your work.

174
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,688
Fix her work fright.
As a more experienced office worker.

175
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,482
Director Seo, I'll see you tomorrow.

176
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,942
Good night, Mr. Kim.

177
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,069
Good night.

178
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,164
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

179
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,003
Did you have first-day jitters?

180
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,341
Don't even get me started.
I circled around, like, five times.

181
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,302
When there's no oil in this country?

182
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,887
You sound just like Mr. Kim.

183
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,265
He told me to take the bus next time.

184
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:18,728
Hey, you have to be smart
to take the public transit.

185
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,981
You're too clumsy.
You'd end up crying in the street.

186
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:25,443
"Waa, I got off at the wrong stop.
Come pick me up."

187
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:27,028
Hey, go home.

188
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,700
- Go. Go elsewhere.
- "Waa, how am I going to get home?"

189
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,576
Watch out for the stairs and the cars.

190
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,996
Jin-u, go straight to taekwondo.
If you skip it again, you're living here.

191
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,957
- Okay!
- Okay. Bye!

192
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,418
- Bye!
- Bye, guys. Hyo-bin, bye!

193
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,838
Yes, my mom is coming later.
She said she'll dine out with Dong-won.

194
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,089
Yay!

195
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,174
Did you finish it?

196
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,175
Yes, it's inside.

197
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,595
Inside. My wife said it's inside.

198
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,474
- Is that it?
- Yes.

199
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:01,646
I can't believe she asked for this.
Does Seo Ji-woo think she's a duchess?

200
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,690
Who asks for a portrait these days?

201
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,733
She paid me a lot.

202
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,819
The most I've ever gotten for my painting.

203
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,283
Well, I just sounded her out,
and she sent me the money.

204
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:15,785
Did you do your best?

205
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,537
I ground my bones.

206
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,873
You should've painted Kyeong-do
as a bonus.

207
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:21,958
I didn't think about that.

208
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,043
Jeez, you lack the service attitude.

209
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,546
You should've been a businessman.

210
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,014
Why are you acting like this?

211
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,098
Why do you think?

212
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,309
Honestly, asking about
the informant is too--

213
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,977
The informant was Kang Min-woo.

214
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,480
Kang Min-woo… Who is that?

215
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,149
Kang Min-woo gave you
the article about An Da-hye.

216
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,526
JARIM Apparel CEO Seo Ji-yeon's husband.

217
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,028
It was him?

218
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,363
What are you doing?

219
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,574
I didn't receive it from him.

220
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,492
Then who?

221
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,207
Jeez. Hey.

222
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:06,628
Don't you know me? Come clean,
or you can't walk out that door.

223
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,425
Quick delivery! It was a quick delivery.

224
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,428
I was too embarrassed to say it.
You could've just let it slide.

225
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,890
- Quick delivery?
- Yes! Quick! Quick delivery!

226
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:22,727
So Reporter Nam,
if you support Reporter Choi

227
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,230
with the interview and email it to me…

228
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,691
- Need any help?
- Where is the Entertainment Team?

229
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,985
You can give that to me. I'm on that team.

230
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,613
- Sign here.
- Okay.

231
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,243
- Thank you.
- Bye.

232
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,579
- Keep me posted, Reporter Choi.
- Okay.

233
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:06,104
So you gulped down the scoop
sent to the Entertainment Team.

234
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:10,191
And you avoided me because you hated
the thought of me finding out?

235
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,736
Why would I hate you?
You know I love you so much.

236
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:18,074
I didn't say anything
so the manager wouldn't be in trouble.

237
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:20,827
What do you mean?

238
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,413
I reported it to Department Manager.

239
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,584
And she told me not to publish it,
very seriously.

240
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,254
Don't accuse me.

241
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,382
I didn't know that you, Seo Ji-woo,
and Cho Jin-eon were involved.

242
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,718
She probably stopped me because she knew,

243
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,971
but if a reporter ignores a report,
that would be media corruption.

244
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,307
What did I do so wrong?
Taking the exclusive all to myself?

245
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,727
Let's be honest. If you received it,
you would've just killed it.

246
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,024
She told you not to write about it?

247
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,234
Happy now?

248
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,196
So stop harassing me. Can I go now?

249
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,116
Sit down. We've only started.
You can't go anywhere.

250
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,326
What is it now?

251
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,453
You need a follow-up article.

252
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:09,375
All right. Focus. If that report triggered

253
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:14,255
an even more vicious setup,
would you be free from it?

254
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,175
Why are you scaring me? Trigger what?

255
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:21,220
I can't explain right now.
First, go meet An Da-hye with me.

256
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,972
An is looking for you, so you request it.

257
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,725
Are you telling me to meet An?
Are you crazy?

258
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:33,066
- Why are you surprised?
- Doo-jin is following up on An Da-hye.

259
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,279
I don't know what it is, but don't.
Don't do it.

260
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,867
If you tell me not to do it, I won't.
Please excuse me.

261
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,077
Damn it.

262
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,164
What's he talking about?

263
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,166
Is that yours?

264
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,586
I will report it to you when ready.

265
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,718
- Did you tell him not to write about it?
- Write what?

266
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:04,389
You know, that article about Cho Jin-eon.

267
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,058
Get out of my way. I don't remember.

268
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,897
She's so loyal.

269
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,484
Department Manager is clearly an F.

270
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:19,445
There goes the big F.

271
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,367
I did it because you asked.

272
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,786
But you're not going to leave it here,
are you, Ji-woo?

273
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:30,540
Woo-sik. Did you know
Kyeong-do was the ace in the Culture Team?

274
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,418
I know he was in the Culture Team.

275
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:38,548
A masterpiece like this
should be in the ace's house.

276
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,174
Don't you think, Se-yeong?

277
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,052
For a masterpiece like this, I think so.

278
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,975
My blood sugar's dropping.
Is meat coming? Where's Kyeong-do?

279
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:51,936
I don't know.
Why don't you have that first?

280
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,937
It's for Dong-won.

281
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,274
If it's chosen by Ji-woo,
it must be luxurious and delicious.

282
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,528
The meat is coming. Wait for it.

283
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,863
- Yes, ma'am.
- So cute.

284
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,115
- Thank you.
- What is it?

285
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,867
Leave it for the dessert.

286
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,205
Jeong-min.

287
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,958
Mother. Give that to me. Here.

288
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,252
- It's not heavy.
- Give it to me.

289
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,713
Kyeong-do is late
when he's the one who invited everyone.

290
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,964
Is he not home yet?

291
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,842
He asked for kimchi
because you guys were coming.

292
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,094
He said he'd come pick it up,
but he's late.

293
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,972
So his old and busy mom had to bring it.

294
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:32,268
No. I think he's late on purpose
so he can invite you in too.

295
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,104
So you can see us after a long time.
He's so thoughtful.

296
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,023
Goodness.

297
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:41,444
Just have fun between you guys.
I don't want to make him a mama's boy.

298
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,530
Kyeong-do's dream is to be a mama's boy.
Come with me.

299
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,824
- No, nonsense.
- Come on.

300
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,534
You go and have fun.

301
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,078
- But--
- Bye.

302
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,245
But…

303
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,790
Thank you for this! Bye.

304
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:55,792
What's that?

305
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,586
Kyeong-do's mother gave it to me.
It's kimchi.

306
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:59,879
She said he isn't home yet.

307
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,964
- No.
- What are we doing here without…

308
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,969
Wait a minute. What is this?

309
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,180
Wait, Ji-woo, isn't that--

310
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,516
Isn't the top-tier painting different?

311
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,768
Why are you wasting your talent like this?

312
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,144
Why don't you paint me instead?

313
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,939
I only soak my brushes
when the money's wired to me.

314
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,023
That's right.

315
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,443
I wonder how much Ji-woo wired.

316
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,571
Where did she go?

317
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:26,489
What the…

318
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,324
- Where is she?
- Ji-woo.

319
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,493
Are you in the bathroom?

320
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,090
SOMANG LAUNDROMAT

321
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,814
Are you here for laundry pickup?

322
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,322
Hello.

323
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,134
The takeout food is still warm.
It looks good.

324
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,343
Where did Ji-woo go?

325
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,305
Over there. Looking elegant.

326
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,725
She'll be back soon. I guess she went out
to buy something. Just eat.

327
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,518
I'm hungry.

328
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:44,692
It's good.

329
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,485
I bet you bought it because it's good.

330
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:49,947
Why is he sour?

331
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,407
Stop it.

332
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,576
Hey, face it. Isn't that comedy?

333
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,912
Do you really want to keep that
in your house?

334
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:01,417
A person usually only looks better
in person or in a picture.

335
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,795
But she looks impeccable
both in person and in the picture.

336
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,341
And when she's painted, she becomes art.

337
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,551
Isn't that rare?

338
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,851
This is so good. Aren't you eating?
Then I'm eating it all.

339
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,686
A bastard like him is rare as well.

340
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,604
Whatever.

341
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,899
- Is it good?
- Let's eat.

342
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:26,901
This is good!

343
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,761
Well…

344
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,515
- In a department store…
- Yes, a department store.

345
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,141
On the basement floor there…

346
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,770
- The basement. You mean the food section?
- Yes.

347
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,773
There are so many pretty things to eat.

348
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,692
Yes, there are a lot.

349
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:12,738
Nowadays, I guess everyone has skills.
What looks good also tastes good.

350
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,867
I always wondered
if it'd taste as good as it looked.

351
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,453
When I tried one, it was delicious.

352
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,081
That's probably
why department stores sell them.

353
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,334
Yeah, the desserts are very nice
these days.

354
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:29,672
Some of them are as expensive
as a whole meal.

355
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,507
Some are more expensive than <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>

356
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,220
Things like these
also require a lot of work.

357
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,266
It's not easy to bake things.

358
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:45,563
When I was debating
between a laundromat and a bakery,

359
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:49,608
I tried to learn baking,
I couldn't do it. It was so hard.

360
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:54,322
I heard kneading the dough is very hard…

361
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,615
- That's what I've heard.
- Yes.

362
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:07,043
Kyeong-do is probably looking for you.
You should go now.

363
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,628
Oh, well, Mothe…

364
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,091
Well…

365
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:20,264
I'm not sure how to address you.

366
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,641
- Me?
- Yes.

367
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,936
Well, in a drama,

368
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,733
if someone they don't like
calls them "Mother,"

369
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,694
they go, "I'm not your Mother."

370
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,697
I've seen that before.

371
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,367
It'd be funny to call me Mrs. Jo.

372
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:48,793
Se-yeong and the other boys
all call me Mother.

373
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:52,588
Just feel free.
I'll drop the honorifics too.

374
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,299
Thank you.

375
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,553
It's not like I don't like you.

376
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:13,818
Goodness.

377
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,448
I should give the rest
to Kyeong-do's father.

378
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,450
I'll buy you more next time.

379
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:24,495
All the delicious stuff
on the department store basement floor.

380
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,455
The ones that look pretty.

381
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,379
Well… Mother.

382
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,468
Well, I…

383
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,888
happened to meet Kyeong-do again

384
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,349
after many events.

385
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:48,727
Well…

386
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:53,607
I do have a sense of shame.

387
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,735
But I can't help it.

388
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,616
Kyeong-do is right before my eyes.

389
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,455
I can't tell my heart

390
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,666
not to fall for him.

391
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,420
I'm sorry.

392
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,390
That's why couples elope at night.

393
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,018
They elope
because they have no other choice.

394
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,530
Let's go.

395
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:43,741
I know the shortcut. I'll take you there.

396
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:54,376
Sorry. I can't hold my laughter…

397
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,382
How are you two going to clean that up?
We'll help.

398
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:01,967
Not two. Only one idiot will do it.

399
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:04,929
Honey, paint Jeong-min too.
This will go on for ten years.

400
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,472
Send me the money. Bye.

401
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,474
- Congratulations on your first day.
- Congrats!

402
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,476
I thought we already celebrated
her first day.

403
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,355
Why don't you just sleep over?
Why don't you just get it off your chest?

404
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,441
- Hey, can't you read the room?
- Seriously.

405
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,818
Jeez, you idiot. Seriously.
Leave now. Bye.

406
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:20,945
He told me to stay.

407
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,988
- Forget it.
- Put your shoes on.

408
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:25,324
- You can sleep on the street. Now, go.
- This way.

409
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,284
Let's go. Good night!

410
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,663
The earth finally became quiet.

411
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:34,625
Oh, gosh…

412
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,252
Sit down and get some rest.

413
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,337
- Can I?
- Yeah.

414
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,804
What did you do with my mom?

415
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,848
Wait, how did you know?

416
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,561
Where else would you go
with Dong-won's cupcakes?

417
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:57,773
You are a reporter after all. What a pro.

418
00:30:58,732 --> 00:30:59,900
So what did you do?

419
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:06,156
We had the cupcakes, we talked a little,

420
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,825
and she walked me here.

421
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:08,993
Talked about what?

422
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,371
About the desserts
on the department store basement floor.

423
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,752
Your mother and I
have the same sense of humor.

424
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,561
I have a very important meeting tomorrow.

425
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:39,773
- All the scary executives will be there.
- What's on the agenda?

426
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,401
Getting rid of MANZAAR.

427
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:44,820
MANZAAR?

428
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:52,411
MANZAAR is the symbol of JARIM,
Director Seo.

429
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:55,664
You know the former chairman cherished it.

430
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,709
Yes, I'm well aware.

431
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:03,922
But we need to face
that the sales are declining every year.

432
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,592
Yet we're relying on the outlets.

433
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,346
And in the past couple of years,
we've been relying on the home shopping.

434
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,977
Do you also agree with it, Ms. Seo?

435
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,488
Does getting rid of MANZAAR…

436
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,992
sound like erasing Dad?

437
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,579
It's a little…

438
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,290
It kind of feels that way.

439
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,928
If you say it's wrong, I won't do it.

440
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:55,683
You are the one in charge of
JARIM's 2nd generation after all.

441
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,603
If… you're not comfortable with it,

442
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,022
I won't cause trouble.

443
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:12,157
I guess Dad wanted to see
this side of you, Ji-woo.

444
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:17,579
Not tied down, direct, and bold.

445
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,503
Let's get into trouble.

446
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,967
<i>I'm proposing that we launch</i>
<i>a fine-dining restaurant.</i>

447
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,387
Korea also should have
a homegrown high-end luxury brand,

448
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,099
and JARIM is in the position
to lead that initiative.

449
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,104
A high-end luxury brand?

450
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:46,024
That will require a lot of time
and budget.

451
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:47,818
That's right.

452
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:51,405
Even if we start now,

453
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,699
it won't be guaranteed until I turn 60.

454
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,453
But if we scout a renowned designer,
I think we have a chance.

455
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,914
Well,

456
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,085
you should suggest something realistic.

457
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,926
I understand it's unfamiliar
and that you feel anxious.

458
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,472
Because I've only started,
I might not be on track and make a fu…

459
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,352
My suggestions may sound unrealistic.

460
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,981
I'll come up with a detailed suggestion.

461
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,491
Detailed…

462
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,336
Good luck.

463
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:50,464
Thank you.

464
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:02,017
Nothing in particular.

465
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,603
If you take the medicine regularly,

466
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,856
you won't have to worry
even in the long run.

467
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:13,487
Is the new medicine more effective?

468
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:18,742
The Didroxin I'd prescribed before
wasn't less effective.

469
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:20,702
But there was a side-effect issue.

470
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:25,749
My husband told me about it,
but I wasn't paying attention.

471
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,670
What kind of side effects
were you worried about?

472
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,590
As it began to damage
the central nervous system,

473
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:35,634
I suggested changing the medicine.

474
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,261
I think

475
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,931
you were on a business trip abroad,
so you weren't able to come.

476
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,767
Yes. I remember.

477
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,772
Fortunately, it was noticed early enough
and it was still recoverable.

478
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:52,651
But if you had continued,
it would've led to Alzheimer's.

479
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,448
Fortunately…

480
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,786
Then I'll book you in
for six months later.

481
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,414
Thank you.

482
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,543
- Doctor.
- Yeah?

483
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,796
What if I kept taking
a lot more of that drug?

484
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,923
Is it impossible to recover?

485
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:20,596
If Alzheimer's disease is already ongoing,
is it recoverable?

486
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:25,976
If you're aware of it and stop taking it,
it won't get worse.

487
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,688
And it'd still be in the early stages,
so you don't need to worry.

488
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,734
Are you still anxious?

489
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,780
Then do you want me to book an exam?

490
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,657
No.

491
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,412
When I think about it, it's scary.

492
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:47,831
Thank you.

493
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:56,965
Hey, look at this.

494
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,385
This is a list of designers
who are currently in the business…

495
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,097
What is that attitude?

496
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:09,436
MANZAAR was your father's favorite line.
How can you get rid of MANZAAR?

497
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,314
Gosh, I hear that so much, seriously.

498
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,107
You bloodless, tearless jerk.

499
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,735
Whatever. Look at this.

500
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:19,363
DESIGNER PROFILE

501
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,282
This is Lucas. He's leaving this brand
after this S/S season.

502
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,160
So you're going to scout that grandpa?

503
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,788
This old man is too much of a big shot.
So instead,

504
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:28,830
this person.

505
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,083
His successor?

506
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:34,169
Lucas has two senior designers
and Bella Jin is one of them.

507
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,879
She's the successor nominee.

508
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:38,215
If she's a nominee,
then it's probably too late.

509
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:42,469
She's Korean.
Though she's an Australian citizen.

510
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,639
If we appeal to her with patriotism…

511
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,350
Don't induce patriotism in everything.

512
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:53,063
Besides, if a Korean designer
became a lead designer of Pirco,

513
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,064
that also means a lot.

514
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,697
Can you call yourself a reporter
with that attitude?

515
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,992
Dongwoon Daily is hopeless.
Their assistant manager is idle.

516
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,744
- How can you get an exclusive?
- Good point.

517
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:12,541
Bella Jin or Lucas, what does that have to
do with a Dongwoon Daily reporter?

518
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,042
Let's order some fried chicken.

519
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:18,255
You know, that article with Chaos
to prove our dating rumor was groundless…

520
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,632
You didn't read the article.

521
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,010
I never used any cowardly word
like "groundless."

522
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,177
Yeah, whatever.

523
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,057
Anyway, the editor-in-chief
at your fashion magazine. Do you know her?

524
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,270
Let's just order fried chicken.
I don't work for you.

525
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,397
Your discipline is slipping, soldier.

526
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,315
Ji-woo, have you ever served in the army?

527
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,154
All major fashion figures will be
in Samseong-dong next week.

528
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,698
I have to be there.
Bella Jin might be there.

529
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,160
Then say you're a resident and join them.
I'm hungry!

530
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:52,873
How can I say I'm a resident
and go in there? Jesus.

531
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,554
That's a relief.

532
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:12,267
It's not going to get any worse.
So I'm not going to tell Ji-woo.

533
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,604
Don't you think that's the reason
why you could tell Ji-woo--

534
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,231
Ji-woo is working on an important project.

535
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,943
This might be just in my head,
but I feel better these days.

536
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,698
<i>Maybe later, when Ji-woo's not too busy.</i>
<i>Maybe then.</i>

537
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:32,162
Good sleep will help you recover.
I read it in some paper.

538
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,916
<i>I know it sounds too obvious,</i>

539
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,418
but you need to recover perfectly soon.

540
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:42,714
You should have a good night's sleep.

541
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,217
Yes.

542
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,637
You're welcome. Bye.

543
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,979
- Is someone sick?
- My goodness. Damn it.

544
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,274
Quit it. You're going to get sick.

545
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:03,652
Hey, you know Kim Ga-eul,
the editor-in-chief?

546
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,612
I wouldn't know. I've never met her.

547
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,532
She collaborated with the manager, not me.
So I don't know her.

548
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:13,120
I knew that you wouldn't know.
Don't be so arrogant when you don't know.

549
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,372
I knew you were never helpful, jeez.

550
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,459
When the luxury brands staff gather,
you know?

551
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:23,463
It's best to follow Kim Ga-eul
for the luxury brand business prospect.

552
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:28,885
I have Han-kyeong.

553
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,972
I must've gone crazy.

554
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,391
Why am I discussing this with you
and not Han-Kyeong?

555
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:41,982
Lee Kyeong-do, did you pee your pants?

556
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,191
Stomachache?

557
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:45,777
Unbelievable.

558
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,697
The article on Louis went well
thanks to Ji-woo, no?

559
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,574
Yes. So what?

560
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:53,201
She needs our help,
so we should cooperate.

561
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,495
You mean you, not we.

562
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:59,624
I mean, is this how we work?

563
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,627
When we've received help,
we should at least return the favor.

564
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,131
Seriously, I'm so sick of it…

565
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,799
What do you want?

566
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,427
Well, first of all…

567
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,310
First of all, what?

568
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,438
Hey, check this out.

569
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,397
2025 NEW SCOOTER, WHITE

570
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,232
That one. Hey, that's pretty.

571
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:25,358
A whole different level.

572
00:41:25,442 --> 00:41:27,194
White is the safe color. Let's get this.

573
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:28,820
Are you really paying?

574
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:31,573
You barely make anything
after paying for the rental.

575
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,034
But still. This is too expensive.
Don't do it.

576
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,453
You need confidence
in the world of delivery.

577
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,455
With this, no one will dare to touch you.

578
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,664
No one comes at me even now.

579
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:43,251
For goodness' sake. So it's a no?
You don't want it?

580
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,128
White. White is pretty.

581
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:48,798
White is pretty, right?
It's an investment.

582
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,718
If you thrive later,
you have to hire me as a manager.

583
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:55,347
You're quite good
at the entertainment business.

584
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,390
It's a very good investment, CEO Lee.

585
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,517
It's all thanks to you, Actor Cha.

586
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,856
- You must do well, okay?
- Thank you, sir!

587
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:09,277
Why did you meet my corporate lawyers?

588
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,822
I met them for legal advice.

589
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,701
What for? All the noise has been settled.
Are you in trouble again?

590
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:20,956
Oh, no, that's not it.
I've only been exercising and staying low.

591
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,875
Then what's the problem?

592
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:28,880
You need to be honest with me
so I can help you settle it!

593
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,427
Father, I…

594
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,474
Father. I want to get back with Ji-woo.

595
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,184
You should've behaved then.

596
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:47,691
But why do you need legal advice for that?
Just go beg on your knees.

597
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,235
Well, I was…

598
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,697
I was asking
if I could cancel the divorce.

599
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,614
Cancel it?

600
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,450
Yes, Father, this is so unfair.

601
00:42:57,534 --> 00:43:00,287
She wanted a divorce,
and set me up with her affair partner…

602
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,125
An affair partner?

603
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,376
- No, it's--
- An affair?

604
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:07,836
No, Father.

605
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:14,301
Lucas's successor might not be Bella Jin?

606
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:18,179
All right. The designer whom Lucas trusts
is indeed Bella Jin.

607
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:22,684
But the rumor says the owner is eyeing
Judy Wong more than Bella Jin.

608
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:26,187
Only someone like me
can find information like this--

609
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:29,607
How is that possible?
I heard Bella Jin was more competent.

610
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,111
Then who's coming to the event?
Did you secure the list?

611
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,364
How can I do that?
I got this information because it's me--

612
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,449
Is Bella Jin coming?

613
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,578
- She's not coming for sure.
- Why not?

614
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,455
On vacation. She's in Málaga.

615
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,249
Málaga… Where is that?

616
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:50,378
In Spain. That's where she goes
for her vacation every year.

617
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:54,174
And she only stays in the same place.
My editor-in-chief went there once before.

618
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,633
Anyway, she's there.

619
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,719
Where in Málaga?

620
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,721
- I wouldn't know.
- You have to know.

621
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,604
The editor-in-chief doesn't know
the address either.

622
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,398
It's on the top floor
of a five-story building.

623
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:14,361
She walked up a spiraling staircase,
and the first floor was an ice cream shop.

624
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,154
Ice cream…

625
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,704
Why are you rolling your eyes?
You're scaring me.

626
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:29,959
- What are you doing?
- Don't talk to me. I can't multitask.

627
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,629
I found it. Give me your passport.

628
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,131
Why do you need my passport?

629
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:36,383
To meet Bella Jin.

630
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:41,012
Am I going alone?
That far? So lonely and forlorn?

631
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,475
What about my own schedule?

632
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,977
I'm the son of Dongwoon,
Assistant Manager Lee.

633
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:57,570
He's absent today,
and he took four days off.

634
00:44:57,654 --> 00:44:59,739
Shall I look up Seo Ji-woo's schedule?

635
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,659
Does he think he's a fashion person?

636
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,411
I am a fashion person, right?

637
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:08,081
He used his precious vacation days?
Has he left already?

638
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:10,708
If he's going away for six days,
he must be going abroad.

639
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,545
What?

640
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,422
Who am I talking to?

641
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:18,550
What are you having for lunch?
I want <i>malatang.</i>

642
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,093
You said you wanted pasta earlier.

643
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:23,805
Let's have Chinese food.
Sorry, all, let's have Chinese food.

644
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,890
Seriously, why did he have to leave…

645
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,936
Reporter Choi,
find a delicious Chinese restaurant

646
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:32,230
that makes good <i>malatang.</i>

647
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,068
Hey, think about quitting
and working as Ji-woo's secretary.

648
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,614
You know the saying,
"Saving turns things into poop"?

649
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:44,325
I saved my vacation days
only to waste them on this.

650
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,374
Have you heard the phrase,
"smiling bastard"?

651
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,209
That probably means her, right?

652
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,504
She's not that annoying.

653
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,215
You haven't met a real bastard yet.

654
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:01,593
Nothing.

655
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,304
Yeah, let's go.

656
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,181
Have a good trip.

657
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:15,773
DIRECTOR KANG MIN-WOO

658
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:19,110
Are they ever going to grow up?

659
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,155
Shouldn't a reporter know better?

660
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:06,991
I see why Bella Jin comes here
for vacation every year.

661
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:09,994
About Bella Jin,

662
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,665
since she's vacationing
in a beautiful place like this,

663
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,583
she'd fall for my offer, right?

664
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,602
Is someone coming from the hotel?

665
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,397
Wouldn't it be faster if we went?

666
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:39,274
I think she's nearby.

667
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,363
Here.

668
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,614
- Hello.
- Hello.

669
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:48,324
Hello.

670
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,451
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

671
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,828
Hello, nice to meet you.

672
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,215
If we're staying at the host's house…

673
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:05,967
There's no hotel around here.

674
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,512
I searched for a place to stay
near Bella Jin until my eyes were sore.

675
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:12,015
You know?
It's not easy to find accommodation.

676
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,852
But I don't have any good memories
with accommodations found like this.

677
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:19,272
Maybe when you booked it.
This is about discernment.

678
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:23,276
I'll let you have breakfast
on the sea-view terrace. It's awesome.

679
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:29,198
An alley like this wouldn't give an angle
for a sea view.

680
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,335
Honey, they are here.

681
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:44,380
Hello.

682
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,758
- Hello.
- Hello.

683
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:13,326
You can get ahead of yourself
internationally.

684
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:17,080
I'm not. You can see the sea.
What else I'm supposed to say?

685
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,916
Right. We're not here for the sea view.

686
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,000
We're here for Bella Jin.

687
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:34,806
Do you want to go here?

688
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,687
Where is it?

689
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,855
We're on this side.

690
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:46,526
"Amore Gelato…" That's down here…

691
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,403
- Do you see this?
- Around here?

692
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,320
Yeah.

693
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,379
Let's try that way.

694
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

695
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:15,471
It's a three-story.

696
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:17,557
- Do you want to get something? Come on.
- But…

697
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,733
It's a five-story.

698
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:33,531
Stay here. Your legs will get tired.

699
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,214
Is this the one?

700
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:52,550
It's just a house, not an accommodation.

701
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,930
Go wait at a cafe somewhere.
I'll look for it. It shouldn't take long.

702
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:00,016
I'd be dead from waiting.

703
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:02,894
You'll carry me if I got too tired.

704
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,353
That'd be too much.

705
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,661
- A gelato shop.
- What?

706
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,417
Five stories too.

707
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,336
I'm getting a good feeling about it.

708
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,629
Sit here. I'll go check.

709
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:46,729
Is this the one?

710
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,318
This is the one.

711
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:55,071
- Where is Bella Jin?
- Wait.

712
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,323
She went to Barcelona.
She'll be back tomorrow.

713
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:03,162
I gave my number to the landlord.
She'll call us when she's back.

714
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:04,080
Okay…

715
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:07,917
- She'll be back tomorrow, right?
- What?

716
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:09,627
- Holy shit.
- What is it?

717
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,128
This is the same as the play.

718
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:15,132
"Mr. Godot will surely come tomorrow."
But he never comes, and the play ends--

719
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,384
Calm down.

720
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,891
Bella Jin won't come tonight.
But surely tomorrow.

721
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,478
Let's believe it. Who knows?
She might come tonight.

722
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,693
Then what are we doing today?

723
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:36,821
We'll check out Málaga.
We're tourists today. Okay?

724
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,782
But what if she doesn't--

725
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,534
Seriously. Let's go.

726
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,453
We found this building. Okay?

727
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:45,454
That's true.

728
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:46,497
Shall we eat first?

729
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,874
- Yes.
- Let's go.

730
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:52,086
Let's come here again for vacation later.

731
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:54,755
Depending on where we're staying.

732
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,134
How many times did I tell you?
It was the closest to Bella Jin's--

733
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,052
I'm sure there was a better one.

734
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,682
You know my real intention.

735
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:08,769
Stop bullshitting.
So what is your real intention?

736
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:12,940
The place we're staying might feel tight.

737
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,817
But on the other hand, it's cozy.

738
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,071
Exotic coziness.
The bed is also big. It's a double bed.

739
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:21,824
If I fall while turning,
I'd get a fracture.

740
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:25,703
There was a time when a single bed
was enough for both of us, you woman.

741
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:51,437
What do we do now?

742
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:54,106
Picasso's birthplace is here.

743
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,399
Are we on a school trip?

744
00:53:56,442 --> 00:54:01,072
If we have a beer now… It'd be perfect.

745
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:06,369
- Eat this.
- I've had enough. Too sweet.

746
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,041
Don't you ever crave alcohol?

747
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:16,879
It's not that I don't think about it.
The taste you know is the scariest.

748
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,799
I'd just suppress it until I die.

749
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:27,473
I can do it.

750
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,062
Even if it is scary,
if you suppress it, I'll do it too.

751
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,114
Let's go.

752
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:46,784
What do you want to do?

753
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:48,703
There is Picasso's birthplace.

754
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:51,747
No, only high schoolers go there.

755
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,711
Those two assholes are having
a secret affair abroad?

756
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:02,049
And how did you know
and send me the pictures?

757
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,722
You know… I'm heartbroken.

758
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,266
I couldn't just ignore it.

759
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,271
You couldn't get over Ji-woo and wanted
to get back with her. You sounded sincere.

760
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:18,566
But she's living with someone?

761
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:21,652
I only dug into her to tell you

762
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,156
that you were mistaken, but…

763
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,366
I was right, wasn't I?

764
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,618
They fucked me up, right?

765
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,539
What are you going to do?

766
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:36,375
I can't take anyone's side. My goodness.

767
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,587
But, Min-woo, you know what?

768
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:43,424
I pity her. Get it?

769
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,510
When I think about Seo Ji-woo, I pity her.

770
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,306
My father said

771
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:54,769
if I ever mention Seo Ji-woo again,
he won't leave me anything, shit.

772
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:58,647
I even knelt down to get back with her.

773
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,400
Gosh, you are amazing.

774
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:06,530
"Why accept her again
when Chairman Seo is dead?"

775
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,993
"Who knows whose child she is?
I only accepted her for Chairman Seo."

776
00:56:11,077 --> 00:56:13,704
"Don't you dare bring her back,
you idiot!" He said.

777
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:17,500
What are you saying?

778
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,418
Gosh.

779
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,463
I guess I really loved her, Min-woo.

780
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,422
Who?

781
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,300
He doesn't know who is whose child?

782
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:31,013
Her! Seo Ji-woo!

783
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:35,434
She's not the daughter of
JARIM Apparel's Chairman Seo Won-seok.

784
00:56:36,102 --> 00:56:40,314
Her mom had her from an affair.
Can you believe that?

785
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,649
Shit.

786
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:45,778
That's nonsense. Shit.

787
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:15,808
Let's go.

788
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,937
That looks fun.

789
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,313
What?

790
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:25,109
A European flea market.
That looks romantic.

791
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,152
Let's check it out.

792
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,658
What is that? A ski?

793
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,252
The cookies look good.

794
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,087
- Hello.
- Hello.

795
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,881
I already had two ice creams.

796
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,048
Right.

797
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,301
Then go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

798
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,218
Okay.

799
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,442
SEO JI-WOO

800
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:14,491
It's five euro.

801
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:55,741
What?

802
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:57,952
What's wrong?

803
00:58:59,245 --> 00:59:02,164
No, I think I grabbed it first.

804
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:04,124
We kind of grabbed it at the same time.

805
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,042
Wait, this is…

806
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,186
Ji-woo.

807
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,646
You said you grabbed it first.

808
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:36,490
Ninety-eight limited scarves
according to the two-piece suit.

809
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,370
You know it.

810
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:45,249
I used to look down on JARIM,
but you're not bad.

811
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:47,668
Who are you?

812
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:54,383
Are you

813
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:55,926
Bella Jin?

814
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,620
Come on.

815
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,125
My ace is working his ass off in Málaga.

816
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,503
He's your ace. Not mine.

817
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:32,463
Seriously?

818
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:39,887
Your ace. What was his name again?

819
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,139
Wi-do?

820
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,640
He had a unique name.

821
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:45,225
Kyeong-do.

822
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,143
Not Wi-do. Kyeong-do.

823
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:50,064
Right. Kyeong-do. Kim Kyeong-do.
Which Kim clan?

824
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,857
It's not Kim. It's Lee.

825
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,527
Is that so? Is he a Lee? What a relief.

826
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,821
I get along with the Lees so much.

827
01:00:57,905 --> 01:01:01,116
I had the tarot card reading.
I was told I get along with the Lees.

828
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,743
He has no double eyelids, right?

829
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,579
A man with no double eyelids--

830
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,414
- Hey!
- What?

831
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,291
Where is Bella Jin?

832
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:15,339
Honey, how much more
do you expect me to do?

833
01:01:15,422 --> 01:01:17,257
I told you everything I found.

834
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,760
That Bella Jin's on vacation
and the location, everything.

835
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,180
An ice cream shop on the 1st floor
in a five-story building?

836
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:25,182
Can you find a person abroad with that?

837
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:26,100
You can't?

838
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:31,230
You're so brazen.
I told you so much already.

839
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:33,941
Hold on.

840
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,360
Right now, in Spain, it's…

841
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:42,032
Hey, Bella Jin can answer her phone.

842
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:46,954
Too musty. Stress.

843
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:51,291
Hey, do you think
that jacket goes with that shirt?

844
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:54,920
Just putting on whatever you grab,
you need to fix that first.

845
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:58,715
Hey! Stop changing the topic.
I'll make it clear for you.

846
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:02,636
Call Bella Jin now.
Give her my ace's number.

847
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,596
Tell Bella Jin to call him first.

848
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,559
I should go on with this color.

849
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,525
Seriously,

850
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:19,278
I'm a very pure person.

851
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,822
Getting Bella Jin's location
over a mere friendship.

852
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:29,621
If I ever get involved with you again,

853
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:33,333
I'll either quit this editor-in-chief job
or quit our friendship.

854
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,510
See? She's not answering.

855
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,263
How many times do I tell you
that we're not close?

856
01:02:46,346 --> 01:02:49,183
Oh, my Bella, where are you?

857
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,060
Did she pick up? Awesome. So shocking.

858
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,480
Oh, my. In Barcelona?

859
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,148
Hey, tell her to go to Málaga.

860
01:02:57,566 --> 01:03:01,820
My dear Bella, are you in Barcelona?
Isn't that nice?

861
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:05,032
Hey, cut to the chase.

862
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,578
When are you going to Málaga, honey?

863
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:44,363
<i>Holding back is a strategy.</i>

864
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:45,906
- Are you getting teary?
