1
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:44,962
SURELY TOMORROW

2
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,390
I went all the way there. Was she
flirting with me or threatening me?

3
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,103
She's the one who's confused, not me.

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,565
Why bring luggage when you're flirting?

5
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,859
That's my plan. Mind your own business.

6
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:13,157
If you have anything to say to Ji-woo,
do it later, during the daytime in a cafe.

7
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,247
Hey, Ji-woo,
don't you think this is outrageous?

8
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,500
- This man wrote about your husband--
- Ex-husband.

9
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,337
And you're with him
in the middle of the night--

10
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,254
The evening.

11
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,090
Jeez, hey… Look.

12
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,675
You're not speaking the facts.

13
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,595
Oh, so the fact is you're flirting
by living together?

14
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,139
I have no reason to explain it.

15
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:41,268
You need to leave.
Well, I need to eat <i>gimbap. </i>I'm busy.

16
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,604
Jesus…

17
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:47,316
Jin-eon, you need to leave.

18
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,401
- Hey.
- Don't "hey" her.

19
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,571
- Kyeong-do, you need to stop too.
- Okay.

20
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:54,907
I will not

21
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:59,870
let this situation slide.
Seo Ji-woo, this is wrong.

22
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,039
Understood?

23
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,819
Fine, sure, I'll leave. All right.

24
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:33,487
I'm leaving.

25
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,031
You haven't eaten, right? Eat.
Tuna <i>gimbap </i>is your favorite.

26
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,159
- Is it good?
- Do you want this?

27
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,164
You have ten minutes.
Chew fucking well and get the hell out.

28
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,879
I said, if you act like this,
you're confused too.

29
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,382
I'm not confused.

30
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:40,429
Going to the UK like this is not right.
It's irresponsible in this condition.

31
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,098
Besides, why cause harm
to the United Kingdom?

32
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,392
If you want to go,
quit drinking before you go.

33
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,021
What's with the luggage?

34
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,441
You were right.

35
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,569
To make you study, I should read with you.

36
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,905
To put you on a diet,
I should exercise with you.

37
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,784
Instead of yelling at you to quit,
I plan to take care of you by your side.

38
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,619
I've been in AA programs.

39
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,705
Are you going to live here?

40
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,504
You know how cunning one can be?

41
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,756
Now that this is where I'm going to live,

42
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,051
it's nice.

43
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,887
You have a very nice house.
How many rooms do you have?

44
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,847
I have no room for you.

45
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,267
That's the master bedroom.
And that's the bathroom.

46
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,228
This is the dressing room.

47
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,439
Is that your study?
But you don't study. Is it for show?

48
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:36,735
Your dressing room must be huge.
The daughter of a clothing store owner.

49
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,112
Hey!

50
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,615
Cut it out and get out.

51
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,327
Cut what out? Then I'll use...

52
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,579
the master bedroom.

53
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,789
Are you kidding me?

54
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,210
Well, when you slept on my bed,
where did I sleep?

55
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,921
The couch, the sauna,
the sleeping room at my work.

56
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:59,049
My L5 and L6 still feel stiff.
I can't sleep on the couch.

57
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,510
- Do you want me to align your spine?
- So childish.

58
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,928
You're the one being childish.

59
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:06,682
You need to take responsibility
for what you do. You're old enough.

60
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,350
What have I done?

61
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:12,604
Look. You barged into my house
and stayed a few days, right?

62
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:14,356
And what did you say back then?

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,446
"To come to a house with someone waiting,
isn't it nice? Doesn't it feel warm?"

64
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:25,284
I've learned from it.
My brain remembers it.

65
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,915
Having another person in the house
couldn't be more comfortable. It's warm.

66
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,668
So I can't live alone anymore.

67
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,342
Is there a bathroom in the master bedroom?

68
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,844
I'm going to kill you.

69
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,639
Let's sleep together. The bed is big.

70
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,315
Gosh. He's nuts.

71
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,868
<i>Get me some chamomile tea.</i>
<i>Make sure it's hot.</i>

72
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,871
Kiss my ass. Jesus.

73
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,046
JI-YEON

74
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,387
SE-YEONG

75
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,819
Shit, is he crazy?

76
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,284
Jeez…

77
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,290
- Open the door.
- Tell me the door code.

78
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,709
Shut up and open the door,
or I'll call the police.

79
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,836
You can wire transfer it to my account.

80
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,838
Are you going to keep acting like a kid?

81
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,301
I get it, so open the door.

82
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,594
Would you do it if you were me?

83
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,473
Give me your ear.

84
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,767
- Why?
- Are you expecting me to say it out loud?

85
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:05,777
Hey!

86
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,821
You think you can get away from this?

87
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,031
- Hey!
- Open the door.

88
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,200
- Open the door or lose your ear.
- Let go!

89
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,534
Let it go! Hey.

90
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,457
Jeez, do you want to sleep outside?

91
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,042
Jesus, that hurts.

92
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,004
0917. Open the door now.

93
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,048
Send me a video
of you punching the passcode in.

94
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,760
Seriously, you're so evil.
This is my house.

95
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,138
And that was my house, you woman.
Forget it if you don't want to.

96
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,934
Okay, fine. Okay, I get it.

97
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,810
I can't believe I'm doing this.

98
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:12,261
Be reasonable and take a shower
in the guest bathroom.

99
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,806
No. You took a shower in my house too.

100
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,933
Because there was only one.

101
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,395
So? Are you showing off
that you have a big house?

102
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,190
Well, let me take a shower then.

103
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,320
Don't you dare. You little…

104
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,037
Gosh...

105
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,698
SURELY TOMORROW

106
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,450
EPISODE 5

107
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,923
You don't even have cereal.

108
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:17,052
If you eat so little and drink that much,
you won't last long.

109
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,554
Your bones will be brittle,
and you won't be able to walk.

110
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,688
If you change the door code by chance,
things will get fun.

111
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,524
Look forward to getting humiliated.

112
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,527
You heard me.

113
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,196
I bet you heard me.

114
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,159
Bye.

115
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,293
Hello, building manager?

116
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,214
What do I do to change the door code?

117
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,425
I've never tried it before.

118
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,772
You've been leaving work on time.
Do you have a side job?

119
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,067
It's not like I have left on time
that often.

120
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:20,782
Maybe I'm tired
because you're in the office.

121
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,078
Since when did you care about me?

122
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,663
Dongwoon Daily Entertainment Team.

123
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,207
Can I talk to Reporter Kim Doo-jin?

124
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,625
May I ask who's calling?

125
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,919
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

126
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,005
I'm the Entertainment Team's
assistant manager.

127
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,010
Reporter Lee Kyeong-do? This is An Da-hye.

128
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,055
Hello.

129
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:48,101
It's the first time since the awards.
It's been years.

130
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,813
Right. Anyway, why do you want to talk
to Reporter Doo-jin?

131
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:57,277
I have something to ask,
but he won't answer his phone.

132
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,904
Is that so?

133
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,782
May I ask what it's about?

134
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:06,578
<i>I'm getting a lot of thoughts in here.</i>

135
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,663
<i>I have way too much time.</i>

136
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,418
I mean, as you know,
it's not like I'm a top celebrity

137
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,546
or a hot girl band member.

138
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:21,635
But following me for months
to release an article about my affair…

139
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,387
Isn't it unnatural?

140
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,766
<i>So I was just curious.</i>

141
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,685
Who on earth reported my private life?

142
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,982
We can't disclose the informant.

143
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,317
Right.

144
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,987
But it's strange.
I think there's more to this.

145
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,698
This wasn't even about me, but…

146
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,534
maybe…

147
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,411
I was the bait?

148
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,789
<i>That's what occurred to me.</i>

149
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,626
<i>If you meet Reporter Kim Doo-jin,</i>
<i>tell him to pick up the phone.</i>

150
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,710
Hey…

151
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,340
Who was it? Why look for Doo-jin?

152
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,761
I think it was Doo-jin's hater.

153
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,652
Just perfect.
Don't make <i>ramyeon. </i>Eat it with rice.

154
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,573
That looks good. Where's Dad?

155
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:28,076
We have more to dry clean than usual.
I have to go back, too.

156
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,786
I'll drop you off on the way then.

157
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,664
No, I'm going to vacuum the house
before I go.

158
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,042
Look.

159
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,921
An elder at church has a niece--

160
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,423
Mom,

161
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,676
do you think I can go on a blind date
when I'm going abroad?

162
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,305
His niece works in Chicago.

163
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,683
She's just old enough,
and she has a decent job.

164
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,518
Do you want me to live there forever?

165
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,021
I'm saying, his niece is dispatched there.

166
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:00,817
You can come back together later.
Do you want to see her picture?

167
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,611
I'll vacuum the house before I go.

168
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,657
My goodness…

169
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:21,838
OPEN

170
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,175
What? Really?

171
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,775
- Why are you filling the fridge?
- I need to eat.

172
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,945
I'm tired of talking to you.
When are you leaving?

173
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,072
Let's set the limit.

174
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,448
I'm making <i>ramyeon. </i>Want some?

175
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,200
I don't plan to eat with you.

176
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,117
Oh.

177
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,203
"Oh"?

178
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,331
Jeez.

179
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,802
Did I tell you that
my manager goes to my mom's laundromat

180
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,222
just to have her kimchi?

181
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:17,477
Was it 16 km? Gosh, 16 km from Seoul, wow…

182
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,896
Now you're even using kimchi to flirt?

183
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,961
<i>Power on.</i>

184
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,527
Gosh, are you crazy?

185
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,195
No, this kimchi is crazy.

186
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,493
When will you grow up?
Is this funny to you?

187
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,954
It is indeed. Do you want chopsticks?

188
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,335
When are you going to grow up?

189
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:27,922
Here.

190
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,447
Is it that good to eat in a rush?

191
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,868
- No.
- How's the kimchi?

192
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,621
Your mother made it?

193
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:36,991
All right. Let's go.

194
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,750
It's just you and me here.

195
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,881
- What are you doing?
- I tried to ignore it. But I just can't.

196
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,134
Hey, this is so sudden--

197
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,135
I can't do it alone.

198
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,931
Do what?

199
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,727
No, hey, no, what are you doing? No, hey!

200
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,443
I can't reach it.

201
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,361
What?

202
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,369
Shit. Oh, seriously!

203
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,454
Why are you getting nervous?

204
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,417
- Your face turned red.
- I'm not nervous, and it's not red.

205
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,377
Just sit down.

206
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,174
Oh, seriously.

207
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,768
Just breathe. You can't make abs
just by holding your breath.

208
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,479
Hey, this is pretty amazing.

209
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:49,397
Shut up.

210
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,319
Just to feed you,
I carried that kimchi container.

211
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,072
Jeez, hey, you got a muscle ache
just from carrying that?

212
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,158
Just get out.

213
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,993
Or is it the bed?

214
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,703
That 30 million won mattress?

215
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,413
Thirty million?

216
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,206
Okay, so where?

217
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,628
What? Oh, under the right shoulder joint.

218
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,380
Here?

219
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:18,343
No, go… higher.

220
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,644
Here?

221
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,856
A little more to the left.

222
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,282
Here?

223
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,494
What? Yes.

224
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,207
Your heart is fucking pounding.

225
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,879
Kyeong-do, are you turned on?

226
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,382
Yeah?

227
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,803
No. Shit.

228
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,933
Oh, this is hilarious.
You started it, but you fell for it.

229
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,062
Why is your heart beating so fast?

230
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,858
See? How dare you come at me?

231
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,570
Whatever. Let's go.

232
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,739
What?

233
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,701
I know exactly when you crave alcohol.

234
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:11,748
If you feel like drinking again,
let's take a walk outside. This is nice.

235
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,877
Tell a depressive
to take a walk 100 times.

236
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,047
If they have the will to walk outside,
they're not depressive.

237
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,176
You see how precious I am?

238
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,762
If someone like me tells you
to eat, rest, or walk,

239
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,972
you're at least forced to do it, you know?

240
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,975
I want to sit down. I'm tired.

241
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,269
We barely started.
How are you tired already?

242
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:39,442
Sit down.

243
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:42,653
Gosh.

244
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,031
Gosh.

245
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:55,792
Kyeong-do.

246
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:59,670
I'll leave when you become
a decent human being. Say no more.

247
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,839
If I'm not a human, am I an animal?

248
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,510
Alcohol.

249
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,554
Drinking...

250
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:11,057
is just too much.

251
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,061
I know it from experience.
It's very tough.

252
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,023
I don't drink that much.

253
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,568
That's how alcoholics begin.

254
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,738
They say they never drink enough
to be in danger.

255
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:30,451
To me, you're on the borderline.
If it gets any worse, you're in trouble.

256
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,036
It'll get ugly.

257
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,246
But I'm trying.

258
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,456
You need someone by your side
to stop drinking.

259
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,335
If you leave for England or anywhere,
what would you be doing by yourself?

260
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,505
Do you have family there or a friend?
You know you're running away.

261
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,595
About the alcoholism treatment…

262
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,888
Yes, ask away.

263
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:54,100
Do they tell you to be separated
from the person who upsets you?

264
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,938
Jeez, I'm craving alcohol.

265
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,360
No, they don't.

266
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,496
Hey, that 30 million won mattress
is not for me.

267
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,207
I'll sleep on the couch…

268
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,459
What?

269
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,841
Are you trying to put pressure on me?

270
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,718
Hold on.

271
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,345
Did you get breakfast for me?

272
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,765
My goodness.

273
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,811
I've never expected this
to happen in my life.

274
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,397
Thank you.

275
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:31,822
Is it good?

276
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,951
So good. This is delicious.

277
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:39,247
You see, I'm just leading you
down the garden path.

278
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,207
That's it.

279
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,627
Gosh, it's only the morning, but you…

280
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,465
If you come here again after work,
you're a dead man.

281
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,717
Keep that in mind.

282
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,554
Get me some milk tomorrow.
I prefer milk with my sandwich.

283
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:32,883
SEO JI-WOO

284
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,011
<i>I took your stuff back to your house.</i>

285
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,221
<i>If you bring it back,</i>
<i>I'm calling the police.</i>

286
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,618
She should've washed them
before packing up.

287
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,430
I said I'd meet you outside.
People here will see you--

288
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:22,391
Do you know what I received?

289
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,895
"Owen Kang" on this list is you, isn't it?

290
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,897
RYAN GOLD FOFS VIP INVESTMENT
LIST OF VICTIMS

291
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,943
Calm down. I'll explain it to you.

292
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,112
What's there to explain?

293
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,033
All those swindlers
vanished into thin air already.

294
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:47,875
I… I wondered
who'd fall for a fund like that.

295
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,253
How much did you invest?

296
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,802
Did you invest everything?

297
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,849
Don't worry. Once the company's sold,
I'll pay you first.

298
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,312
Hey, you think this tabloid
won't leak anytime soon?

299
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,690
How long do you think
you can hide it from your wife?

300
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:26,122
<i>I don't plan to get married yet.</i>

301
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,123
<i>What?</i>

302
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,291
<i>What about you?</i>

303
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,004
<i>Are you doing this</i>
<i>because your family forced you?</i>

304
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,925
<i>That's what I want to know.</i>

305
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:42,263
She's still my wife.
So I didn't want to show you this video.

306
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,475
I'm only revealing it to keep you calm.
I told you it'd be soon.

307
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,063
She wouldn't know if she's getting scammed
in that condition.

308
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:56,777
This is more torturous for me than you.
I lost that damn 30 billion won!

309
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,780
I've already talked to
Executive Director Choi.

310
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,576
When I told her to take MANZAAR,
she was happy about it.

311
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:05,744
Don't worry about the rest.

312
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,747
You just have to get a good price, okay?

313
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,253
Fine.

314
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,308
Gosh, this is crazy.

315
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,478
I said I'm calling the police
if you come back.

316
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,395
<i>It's an errand.</i>

317
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,606
What is it this time? Sashimi?

318
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,149
<i>Se-yeong sent me.</i>

319
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,444
Se-yeong?

320
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,369
Keep your shoes on. Just say it there.

321
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,163
Wait. There they are. My slippers.

322
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,624
Let's go.

323
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,585
Go where? Why?

324
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,880
Woo-sik's performing.
Se-yeong told me to bring you.

325
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,215
She hasn't told me.

326
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,425
So I'm here to tell you. Let's go.

327
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,135
Without a notice…

328
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:48,138
We have to leave now,
so we can eat before the play.

329
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,602
I'm sorry, but it's hard for me
to sit for a long time in a closed space.

330
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,189
I'll talk to Se-yeong later.

331
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,440
Have you had dinner?

332
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,944
Isn't it too early for dinner?

333
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,490
Since I'm here, we might as well go out.
For dinner and a walk.

334
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,828
That damn walk again… It's boring.

335
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,037
Boring?

336
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,250
How about an amusement park?

337
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,793
Crowded places exhaust me.

338
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,007
If it's a quiet one, would you go?

339
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,010
What? Are you going to rent
the whole place or something?

340
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,011
How did you know?

341
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,473
Are you really going nuts now?

342
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,309
You know what?

343
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,852
What if

344
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:39,398
I rent a whole amusement park
and take you there, what would you bet?

345
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,943
Oh… What should I bet?

346
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,572
Oh, you can start working at the company.

347
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,619
Fine. I'll start working at the company.

348
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,579
You will? Okay.

349
00:31:57,124 --> 00:32:01,128
You… When you said
you were going to meet that fortuneteller,

350
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:04,256
I should've stopped you!

351
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,886
How frustrating.

352
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,765
You still believe
what that fortuneteller said…

353
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:18,103
How long do you plan to stay deceived?

354
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:24,652
My heart! It's hell!

355
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:37,456
You're really good at emotional acting.
Even better than Park Bo-gum.

356
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,292
I should've been
more good-looking than him.

357
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:46,006
Gosh, not even plastic surgery can do it.

358
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,551
Dude, I was just pretending.

359
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:56,225
I get why Ji-woo didn't come,
but Kyeong-do should've come to watch.

360
00:32:57,184 --> 00:33:00,270
Anyway, Lee Kyeong-do's going nuts
after Seo Ji-woo appeared.

361
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,691
At least we get to drink <i>makgeolli</i>
because Kyeong-do isn't here.

362
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,610
Kyeong-do has come. Twice already.

363
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:11,490
Hey, by the way,

364
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,577
will it work out between Kyeong-do
and Ji-woo this time?

365
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,122
They should've worked it out
on your wedding day.

366
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:36,014
SUMMER, 2015

367
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,775
- Thank you.
- You look so pretty.

368
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,652
- Shall we go? We'll see you later.
- Yeah.

369
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:50,028
- Congratulations.
- Later.

370
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,280
Okay.

371
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,243
Ji-woo!

372
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,998
Come here. Sit.

373
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,961
When did you get back?

374
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,923
I can't believe I get to see you
get married. You look beautiful.

375
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,925
Are you here for my wedding? Really?

376
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,928
I thought you emailed me to invite me.

377
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,767
I had to see my family, too.

378
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,060
Welcome back. I'm so glad you're here.

379
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:26,023
You had to come. You're Chaos's manager.

380
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:28,817
Oh, my Ji-woo.

381
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,783
Everyone, please look behind.

382
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:40,454
The moment has arrived.
The bride and the groom will enter now.

383
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,790
Please celebrate
their bright future together

384
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,293
with your loudest cheers and applause.

385
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,295
Bride and groom, enter.

386
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:57,573
Seo Ji-woo.

387
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,796
Long time no see.

388
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,852
I heard you live in New York.

389
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:28,228
Yes.

390
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,523
Are you back for the wedding?

391
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,277
That and other stuff.

392
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:40,407
When are you going back?

393
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:42,784
Soon.

394
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,250
You've become a journalist.

395
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,045
Yes.

396
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,213
That's cool.

397
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:58,967
Bye.

398
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,888
Hey.

399
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,604
You should've told me.

400
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,816
You should've told me…

401
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,529
why you had to leave.

402
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,201
You should've said goodbye.

403
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,206
What was I supposed to say?

404
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:34,795
"I don't want to see you anymore.
Goodbye." Something like that?

405
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,423
Back then,

406
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,426
you were becoming sadder every day.

407
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,180
What more could I have done?

408
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,701
THANK YOU FOR MARRYING EACH OTHER
SORRY NOT SORRY

409
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,244
Bye!

410
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,955
Have fun! Call me when you get back!

411
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,419
Wait, Se-yeong.

412
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:18,005
Give me Seo Ji-woo's number.

413
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,924
Hey, you lunatic.

414
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,635
How can you seriously
stop me for this at my wedding?

415
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,095
Of course. Give me that.

416
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,265
Jesus.

417
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:33,395
Seriously, you two are hypocrites.
Why didn't you look for each other sooner?

418
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:34,980
Lee Kyeong-do, good luck.

419
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,315
Good luck.

420
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,652
- We're really leaving now.
- Bye!

421
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,823
Bye!

422
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,116
Have fun!

423
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:14,955
<i>Hey, Seo Ji-woo.</i>

424
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:23,672
Hey, Seo Ji-woo!

425
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,425
Yes.

426
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:28,927
Come out.

427
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,014
Fucking come out now!

428
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,166
What a drunkard.

429
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,432
Can a Dongwoon Daily journalist
be like this?

430
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,228
I'm an ace.

431
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,814
This wouldn't affect my position.

432
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,257
I already drank from that.

433
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,972
So what? Jesus fucking Christ.

434
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,058
You're…

435
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,353
good at swearing now.

436
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,441
Thanks to you.

437
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:55,782
Did you drink a lot? You're pretty drunk.

438
00:42:55,865 --> 00:43:00,036
Because I'd kill you
if I met you in my right mind.

439
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,379
Well, even if I die, I'd have no regrets.

440
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,463
Shit…

441
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,392
Who cares if you die?

442
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,396
Tell me before you go.

443
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,916
Say something!

444
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:54,299
Let me know why at least, fuck. Shit…

445
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:01,473
Jeez.

446
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:15,195
Back then…

447
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,033
how did you feel, Kyeong-do?

448
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:25,205
How your diligent parents

449
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,374
looked different.

450
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:32,837
Your mother made 320,000 won
on a side job.

451
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:37,092
From working a whole month.

452
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:41,471
How it was only worth one shirt for me.

453
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,308
I know it broke your heart.

454
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:46,684
Shit.

455
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:57,445
You didn't really
have to explain that to anyone.

456
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,576
Just because a 20-year-old Lee Kyeong-do…

457
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,166
loved Seo Ji-woo the liar.

458
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:25,140
I knew it wouldn't be a one-time thing.

459
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,689
Your feelings will continue to be hurt,
and you'll be sad.

460
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,609
That's what I thought.

461
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,532
The 20-year-old me…

462
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,912
Well, I didn't know what to do.

463
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:49,914
I just thought…

464
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,963
I should no longer be with you.

465
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,430
I didn't know what else to do.

466
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:18,943
Fuck.

467
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,167
Hey…

468
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:40,590
The Kyeong-do who insisted
that we eat pork cutlet.

469
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:46,638
And you thought it was all your fault.

470
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,394
We were…

471
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:58,816
only 20 back then.

472
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,675
I'm hungry.

473
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,719
Me too.

474
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:40,817
I never expected
Woo-sik and Se-yeong to get married.

475
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,489
They were always fighting.

476
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,122
That made them grow on each other.

477
00:48:16,853 --> 00:48:17,729
When are you leaving?

478
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:21,733
Today.

479
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:30,867
You'll have to go straight to work.

480
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:39,292
Come on. Let me get you a taxi.

481
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:46,341
Okay.

DONGWOON DAILY

483
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:33,448
Oh… I missed the flight.

484
00:50:39,996 --> 00:50:41,664
Did you miss it because you overslept?

485
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:44,751
I missed it because I couldn't sleep.

486
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,793
Well, it's not that spacious.

487
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,085
Yeah, I see that.

488
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:31,506
Hey, people have
what's called an attitude.

489
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:34,217
"It's perfect for living alone.
It's cozy." There are many ways.

490
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,384
Is this the bathroom?

491
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:37,970
You still never listen.

492
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,434
When was the last time you cleaned it?

493
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:47,814
Pretty recently?

494
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:52,235
Why does your bathroom
smell like a public restroom?

495
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:53,903
Get a hotel.

496
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:57,406
I can't. If my mom finds out,
she'll check every hotel there is.

497
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,449
Then don't complain.

498
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,828
I was too naive to believe
that you'd be nice to me.

499
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:05,998
Get some rest.

500
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:09,585
There's nothing but water in the fridge.
Call me if you need anything.

501
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,506
Where are you going?

502
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:17,093
Well… To a sauna or a <i>jjimjilbang.</i>

503
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,178
Are you telling me to stay alone?

504
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,897
I'll just go to a <i>jjimjilbang </i>instead.
Or get a motel…

505
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:32,859
You and your temper.

506
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,155
I'm going to the supermarket
to get some bathroom cleaner.

00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,751
Hello. Is this…

509
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,924
Here.

510
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,223
- How much is it?
- 25,000 won.

511
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:06,350
- 25,000 won? Bye.
- Bye.

512
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:14,650
Do you have a toothbrush…

Oh, wow.

516
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:14,645
That's new. The cursor has been blinking
for an hour now.

517
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,030
I think I'll need more information on it.

518
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,160
That's also new.

519
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,247
I've been too complacent lately.
Let me do some legwork.

I mean Yeonnam-dong, please.

524
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,021

00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:17,458

- The lau…

00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,009
WASHER

529
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:33,140
You're really early.

530
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:38,104
Are you doing the laundry?
But there's a washer at home.

531
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:41,857
Just to get some fresh air.
I have ten minutes left.

532
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:42,858
Okay.

533
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,112
Anyway, why are you back so early?

534
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:52,409
I was done early.
I thought you'd be bored, so I rushed.

535
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:55,871
Cool.

536
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,498
Yes.

537
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,751
I've been cool since 2007.
Only you didn't know.

538
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,844
Let's get to know each other.

539
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,150
What did you do in New York?

540
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:31,699
I've been going to school for too long.

541
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:34,201
I was already in a doctoral program
before I knew.

542
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,454
What's your major?

543
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:40,541
Aesthetics.

544
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,795
I had nothing else to do.
So I just studied.

545
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,931
You'll still get the degree, right?

546
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:02,730
Are you telling me to go back?

547
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:03,647
What?

548
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,818
Oh, no. I'm saying--

549
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:10,362
Fucking condescending
for letting me sleep for a night.

550
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:13,949
No, what I mean is--

551
00:58:14,033 --> 00:58:14,909
I'm not leaving.

552
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:19,371
When I went to your company with my stuff,
I'd made my decision.

553
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:20,831
At least I had.

554
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,002
It's your turn now.

555
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,606
Gosh.

556
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,441
Why did I leave too early?

557
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:52,863
What if I get fired?

558
00:58:56,867 --> 00:59:00,579
Let me… provide for you.

559
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,237
Let's listen to a song.

560
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:34,947
What song?

561
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:45,416
I just love this song so much.

562
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:03,434
What's wrong? What is it?

563
01:00:05,394 --> 01:00:06,603
Have you done it before?

564
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,897
Done what?

565
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:11,525
Well, it's not my first time.

566
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:13,694
So have you done it before?

567
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:16,655
What do you mean?

568
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,829
Oh… Jeez, just go to sleep.

569
01:00:37,593 --> 01:00:39,386
- What is it?
- Sleep.

570
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:40,596
What is it?

571
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,222
Oh, just go to sleep.

572
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,891
- What is it?
- I… Oh!

573
01:01:36,443 --> 01:01:37,277
Okay.

574
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:44,535
JI-WOO KYEONG-DO

575
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:58,006
PUBLIC BATHHOUSE

576
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:55,564
- Hey.
- Yeah?

577
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:56,899
- What's this?
- What?

578
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:58,775
- Why do you still--
- Give me that.

579
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:00,819
- Give it to me.
- Why did you take it out?

580
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:01,945
- Let me see.
- No.

581
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:07,451
Please, let me see. Oh, no! No. Let me--

582
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:09,661
- No.
- Oh, pick it up. That's…

583
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:14,810
Hey, let's just go home. What is this?

584
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:18,272
Just wait. Why are you so hasty?

585
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:24,486
Yes, sir. Yes.

586
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,199
FOO LAND

587
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:56,184
Well, did you think I couldn't do it?

588
01:04:56,685 --> 01:05:00,897
This amusement park looks like you.
It's bright and cute.

589
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,025
Bright?

590
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,445
You'd better get ready to go to work.

591
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:07,738
I want to work here.

592
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,582
Hey, Reporter Lee.

593
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,834
You never open at night.

594
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,003
Why do you charge me so much
when you don't open?

595
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:26,381
Who says I don't open at night?
Sometimes I do!

596
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,927
Normally, when I'm in good condition
and open at night like tonight,

597
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:33,722
I have at least 12 people. Always.

598
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,099
Based on my data so far.

599
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:40,729
But you're only paying for ten people.

600
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:44,274
What's in it for me then?
It's not even enough for the electricity.

601
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:46,193
I feel like you're ripping me off.

602
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,235
Never.

603
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:52,157
After I pay for the power,
I'm left with nothing.

604
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,911
This is basically
the culture contribution business.

605
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:59,081
Come on. Thanks to your article,

606
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,292
things worked out with the city hall,
and I get to run the business.

607
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:07,381
So I only get the money for the power
and contribute to the culture,

608
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:10,133
and your love business.

609
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:11,927
You're doing us a favor.

610
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,140
I lost count of
how many couples got married this way.

611
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:20,060
You probably lost count of
how much you ripped off. I sent it.

612
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,728
Watch your mouth.

613
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,981
All right. What do you want to ride first?

614
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:27,651
- That one.
- That one? Sounds good. Let's go.

615
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,033
- So? I rented the whole place.
- Oh, I love it.

616
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:36,660
- Enjoy it.
- Oh, yeah.

617
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,537
Thanks!

618
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,164
Sure!

619
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:56,221
Here we go.

620
01:06:57,097 --> 01:06:58,974
Wow. Oh. Hey, come here!

621
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,238
Sir! One more time!

622
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,740
Okay!

623
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:17,033
Sir, please stop!

624
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:19,870
What do you mean?

625
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:22,247
So, what I'm saying

626
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:27,335
is that you didn't defend me well
during my divorce suit.

627
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:30,881
You know what it's like
when drugs are involved.

628
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,257
I've explained it enough--

629
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,259
No, what I'm saying is…

630
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,637
Shit…

631
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,892
So what I'm saying is,

632
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:46,438
we fell for the trap. You know?

633
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,775
Seo Ji-woo and that asshole
had set it up all along.

634
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:53,028
So they can get rid of me
and fucking stay together.

635
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:55,781
So they leaked… my drug use.

636
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:57,073
Which asshole?

637
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:58,784
Oh, fuck!

638
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:02,788
Dongwoon Daily
Entertainment Team's Lee Kyeong-do.

639
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,498
The one who wrote the article.

640
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:05,916
They're living together now.

641
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:10,962
Lawyer Park,

642
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:15,884
so my request today is,

643
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,887
can you overturn this divorce?

644
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:27,771
You must overturn it, okay?

645
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:31,066
Bring Seo Ji-woo back.

646
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:40,033
Sir, get us a ladder at least
so we can get down.

647
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:46,456
I can fix it soon. Just wait. Jesus.

648
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:48,208
Shit.

649
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:51,086
Stop making a fuss.
Not even children would be scared.

650
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:55,298
How is he checking the facility?

651
01:08:58,093 --> 01:08:59,302
Aren't you scared?

652
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,721
No, it's relaxing.

653
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:03,390
It's rather comfortable.

654
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:05,809
I always knew you were weird.

655
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:09,521
It's not like I scheduled it.

656
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:14,067
No one is responsible for this time.

657
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,990
I'm tied down without a choice
in this moment and space.

658
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:25,245
It's not your fault or my fault.
So it's relaxing.

659
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,047
We're stuck anyway.

660
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,218
I rented the whole place.

661
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:43,221
You have to go to work now.
Keep your promise.

662
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:45,348
Okay.

663
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,860
Oh, the wind feels nice.

664
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,863
I mean, I think it's faster than expected.

665
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:02,532
It's nice because it's fast.

666
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:03,825
I think this is too fast.

667
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,745
You're so scared for real.

668
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,029
Wait. I know this song.

669
01:10:45,367 --> 01:10:48,119
This is similar to a movie soundtrack.

670
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,830
It's not similar. This is the soundtrack.

671
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,377
I liked the lyrics,
so I wrote a column about it.

672
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,753
Dang.

673
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:35,792
<i>How long</i>

674
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,420
<i>will I...</i>

675
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,172
<i>love you?</i>

676
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:13,575
SURELY TOMORROW

677
01:14:36,264 --> 01:14:37,098
Seo Ji-woo?

678
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,563
Long time no see…

679
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,190
Oh, hey.

680
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,484
Well, if you're here, why not go in?

681
01:14:48,568 --> 01:14:52,322
Oh, say hi for me. I don't feel like…

682
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:53,865
Meet Kyeong-do before you go.

683
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,664
You've become handsome.

684
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:03,958
Bye.

685
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:04,918
What?

686
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,545
No, see Se-yeong before you go, okay?

687
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:14,677
Go on.

688
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:22,018
Come on.

689
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,817
See you later.

690
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:36,532
Ji-woo!

691
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,245
Kyeong-do, where are you?

692
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:43,539
Why are you so late, you idiot? Hurry up.

693
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:45,291
Jesus, you're so late.

694
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:18,783
<i>- Kyeong-do's fatal first love…</i>
- Have you seen my clothes?

695
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:20,159
<i>- …stopped Seo Ji-woo.</i>
- Jeez.

696
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:21,160
You wear them.

697
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:24,080
<i>Are you friends</i>
<i>or are you in a relationship again?</i>

698
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:26,791
I don't want us to be just friends.

699
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:30,003
<i>What do you have to tell me?</i>
<i>Is it about that?</i>

700
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:31,713
<i>You're not going to Chicago?</i>

701
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:34,257
<i>What does she mean to you</i>
<i>that you surrender every time?</i>

702
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:37,593
<i>Good job, Seo Ji-woo.</i>
<i>Thank you for surviving.</i>

703
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:40,221
<i>I was doing just fine</i>
<i>and suddenly showed up divorced.</i>

704
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:42,640
Why are you still so stupid?

Did you cry a lot?

706
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:46,811
<i>There's something I have to do.</i>

<i>If I don't get this sorted out now,</i>

<i>I'll be messed up for the rest of my life.</i>
