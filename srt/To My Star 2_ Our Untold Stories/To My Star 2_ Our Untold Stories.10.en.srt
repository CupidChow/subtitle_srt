00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:12,800
[To My Star 2]

2
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,890
I'm sorry.

3
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,810
I didn't know the door would open.

4
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,410
I thought I stunk, so I took a shower.

5
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,660
We didn't get to eat.

6
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,060
- So I was going to cook for you with this.
- Who do you think you are?

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,630
Why would you cook?

8
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,600
I...

9
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
I went away so far away, but...

10
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,460
if I type in your name on the internet,

11
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,720
I could find out what you're up to right away.

12
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,590
I kept seeing you around Seoul, so I ran away.

13
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,620
But it was the same in the end.

14
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,470
I'll stop running away now.

15
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,670
As for me,

16
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,020
if you keep pushing me away,

17
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,260
I can't...

18
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,780
continue after you as you did.

19
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,490
To where you are.

20
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,940
What? Is this a threat?

21
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,400
No.

22
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,580
It's a request.

23
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,830
Please hug me.

24
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:07,960
♫ By my side, I hear the wind blow  ♫

25
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:16,410
♫ Close my eyes, I feel you there  ♫

26
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,890
When I'm having a hard time,

27
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,130
you said you would come to me.

28
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:00,460
♫  Just take my hand and then you'll find  ♫

29
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,120
Okay.

30
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,910
I'm here.

31
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:11,720
♫  A sky full of stars will light your way  ♫

32
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,850
♫  All of your days  ♫

33
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,010
I saw all the texts.

34
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,010
I was a coward. I'm sorry.

35
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,760
♫  Be your galaxy ♫

36
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,320
Are you going to hide like that again?

37
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,500
Are you going to make me anxious again?

38
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,770
You should've erased your old number.

39
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,880
Why did you keep it and see all the texts unnecessarily?

40
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,330
I'm sorry...

41
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,900
I wanted you to call me.

42
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,390
What was it...

43
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,810
Team Leader Jeong. What about her? I thought you didn't get over her yet.

44
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,670
I heard everything. You said you thought of her even when we were dating.

45
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,660
I'm sorry. At that time...

46
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,740
I just said it more meanly because I felt sorry for you.

47
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,820
I had never felt that way before, so I misunderstood.

48
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,080
You said you were lonely when you were with me.

49
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,930
Then it'll be the same if we start dating again.

50
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,430
After my parents passed away,

51
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,600
I think I was afraid to become happy by myself...

52
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,850
It's just...

53
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:43,770
I'm not used to it myself as well, so I was confused.

54
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,880
In front of you,

55
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,490
I really can't be arrogant even if I want to.

56
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,370
Please stop your habit of planning what to wear in advance.

57
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,090
That's a habit of Team Leader Jeong. So please don't do it.

58
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,410
Just erase every trace of her. Okay?

59
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,190
Okay.

60
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,020
Then, you, too...

61
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,080
Please stop talking on the phone with other people often, and don't smile at others.

62
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,460
I get jealous a lot. So please stop doing it.

63
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,470
What? You pretended you were fine.

64
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,140
I had been holding it down until now.

65
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,430
I thought it might harm your work if I said so.

66
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,080
Okay, I got it.

67
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,100
I won't do anything that you don't like me to do.

68
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,600
Are you a baby?

69
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,790
Why are you just crying without telling me?

70
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,840
I dug this up from where I buried it.

71
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,930
Don't you need to eat?

72
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,230
You didn't eat anything the whole day.

73
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,780
Is food important at this moment?

74
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,850
I missed you...

75
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,890
I missed you a lot.

76
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,190
I missed you more.

77
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,880
Even when I'm looking at you, I miss you.

78
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,050
I love you.

79
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,500
I love you, too.

80
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,540
I love you so much.

81
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,930
Did you sleep okay?

82
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,600
- We've been separated for a year. 
- Stop it.

83
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,270
- But it feels like I saw him yesterday. 
- Please stop it.

84
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,660
We just went around to come back.

85
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,100
Are you doing okay?

86
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,230
It's my first time, so it's not easy.

87
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,700
You have to work on social media. Everybody looks at stuff through that.

88
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,620
I will.

89
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,070
What about Yoo Ha? Did you call her?

90
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,350
Yes, I called her.

91
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,940
Is it not good?
 [Ti Aspetto]

92
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,310
- What if you add some emojis?
- Which one?

93
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:41,160
[We are taking a break.]
[Ti Aspetto (Mr. Han)]

94
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,590
What the heck is he doing? It's been a week.

95
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,620
I know! My goodness.

96
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,400
When is he going to come back?

97
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,140
Do you miss Mr. Han?

98
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,360
A little bit. But I only need you, Mom.

99
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,830
I'm the happiest person in the world, all thanks to you!

100
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,650
I love you, my baby!

101
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,000
Will you stop working and play with me?

102
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,390
Give me one second. I'm almost done.

103
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,630
Please stop working and play with me.

104
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,480
One second. I'll finish it right away.

105
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,470
Let's play!

106
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:45,560
I get it. I'll stop working right now.

107
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,290
Tell me you love me.

108
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,790
- Again?
- Yes.

109
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,840
I love you.

110
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,560
One more time.

111
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,470
- Again?
- Yes.

112
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,240
I love you.

113
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,090
Good job!

114
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,010
Please express your feelings a lot, okay?

115
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,980
Look at your chubby cheeks.

116
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,750
You are so cute.

117
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,670
Let me bite your cheek just once.

118
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,170
One more time.

119
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,260
You are ten minutes late!

120
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,270
Han Yoo Ha, how have you been?

121
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,150
Do you know how much I waited for you to come?

122
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,830
It seems like you didn't wait for me that long.

123
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,630
How was your grandmother's house?

124
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,940
That's not the point. I've got the news that I need to be complimented!

125
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,920
What to be complimented?

126
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,840
Oh, you are finally picking up your phone.

127
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,480
I guess you found your phone.

128
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,740
Yes, it's good to hear from you, CEO Kim.

129
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,310
Are you not going to do the interview?

130
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,190
Does it make a difference if I do the interview? It's a subjective matter anyway.

131
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,330
- Isn't it?
 - What?!

132
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,450
I'm sorry.

133
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,050
I just did it without any thoughts.

134
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,160
I'm so sorry.

135
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,670
I don't want to go to the police.

136
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:10,280
I don't want to go to jail and eat rice with beans.

137
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,810
I don't like beans!

138
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,480
Please don't report me.

139
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,290
Please don't cry.

140
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,790
I won't report you. Okay?

141
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,940
But what you did is bad, Chae Ho.

142
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,460
You just uploaded writing on the internet,

143
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,000
but that can make someone suffer for the rest of their lives.

144
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,820
- Understood?
- Yes.

145
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,140
I'm so sorry.

146
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,630
I'll go now. Don't be too harsh on him.

147
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,760
I saw you pooping on the street yesterday.

148
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,480
What? When?

149
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,180
I didn't do that.

150
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,090
Does that make you feel unfair?

151
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,510
Have this. Think of it as a deadly poison for the criminal.

152
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,590
You know what that poison means, right?

153
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh, goodness.

154
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,940
Don't tell your mom that I gave you a deadly poison.

155
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,730
Understood?!

156
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,630
Why did you design the movement flow like this?!

157
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,790
It's getting delayed all because of you!

158
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,830
How can you make schedules like this!

159
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm sorry, sir.

160
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
Take a five-minute break.

161
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,340
I said, take a five-minute break!

162
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,530
She's coming this way, now!

163
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,030
What is going on?!

164
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,120
You know me, right?

165
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,550
What is it?

166
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,370
When I worked as an entertainment reporter, I got a scandal about your show,

167
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,800
but you begged me to wait until the end of the show so much that I waited for you.

168
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,530
Yes, yes. You're right.

169
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,250
When Kang Seo Joon and your director were fighting,

170
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,230
not just Kang Seo Joon's manager here,

171
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,550
but there was more than 20 staff, including stylists and everybody.

172
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,030
Do you think every one of them will stay quiet about it?

173
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,290
I know that you worked the hardest to fix the complicated schedule.

174
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,490
Honestly, I don't know if the show will fail or not.

175
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,080
I'll do anything from now on.

176
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,060
But before I do so, I came here to tell you this.

177
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,270
There's an anonymous report.

178
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,360
Baby, since we are here,

179
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,120
there's a very delicious noodle place around here.

180
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,200
- Why don't we eat together before going?
- I'm sorry.

181
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,110
I have to go now for my next schedule.

182
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,010
I can have dinner tomorrow! How does that sound?

183
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,840
- You will cancel that again.
- I won't do it this time!

184
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,550
Yes, this is Reporter Lee Yoon Seul.

185

281
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,190
I'm telling you this because I knew you would say that.

282
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:21,410
The fact that we're opposites, I admit it.

283
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,060
You asked me.

284
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:31,390
Why I want to date you even if I knew we were such opposites.

285
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,340
To you, I was caught, when we had only met for two days

286
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,550
that my mind was hurting at one point.

287
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:52,100
But it was comfortable. Getting caught from the beginning.

288
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,900
And acting as if that was nothing,

289
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:02,060
and you being considerate of me and whether or not I would get hurt...

290
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,700
I guess that's why I like you so much.

291
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,410
If I said these words that I've never said to anyone else before to you,

292
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,790
then I thought I wouldn't be able to let you go and that's why I haven't been able to say them to you.

293
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,830
But now that won't happen.

294
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,940
When Kang Seo Joon first started acting and started his second drama,

295
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,530
he suffered from severe depression

296
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,870
and had to act like a boy who committed suicide.

297
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,370
In a busy filming environment and with the indifference of adults,

298
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,410
he was left alone.

299
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,720
And he gained a memory he could never forget in his life.

300
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:20,240
Back then, I should have just cried and gotten angry, maybe even resent at least one person.

301
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,150
It's okay.

302
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,830
Now you have me.

303
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,450
Instead of that, I like this better.

304
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,370
How is your cheek so squishy?

305
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,030
You are so cute, my baby.

306
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,910
Hey, Han Ji Woo!

307
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,640
You left your phone!

308
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,630
Oh, Yoo Ha's mom, what is she doing not watching Yoo Ha?

309
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,600
Now, it's my turn.

310
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,210
No, no. I want to do it.

311
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,190
Come here.

312
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,050
I'll do it for you.

313
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,660
I want to do it for you!

314
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,150
In this world, there are no perfect people

315
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:28,950
or even perfect love.

316
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,390
It's just going on with a loving heart

317
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,890
and making compromises with understanding.

318
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,760
So? Keep talking.

319
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:49,440
Instead of with my pride, I should honestly talk about my feelings and learn from them.

320
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:56,320
That's the method of love I've learned thanks to you.

What is it?

324
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,870
It came out.
 ["When the Gangster Loves" - Episode 15 -]

325
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,510
By the way, how's Ho Min doing?

326
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:15,960
I don't know. I guess his agency is not even giving him a cell phone.

327
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,100
We really don't know what's going to happen in our lives, right?

328
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,330
How can you laugh right now?

329
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,740
I can't help but laugh!

330
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,690
Cut! Okay!

331
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,420
Let's move on to the next setting!

332
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,920
How was it, Director?

333
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,820
It was wonderful.

334
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,100
- It was perfect!
- Can I see it?

335
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,200
Do you want to see it? Play it for him, please.

336
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,920
- Look at this part.
- Your acting is great, Jae Won!

337
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,090
It came out great!

338
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,580
I think Jae Won will get the best new actor award.

339
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,140
Oh, please.

340
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,200
Ji Woo.

341
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,330
How's your filming going?

342
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,360
It's going well. Did you eat today?

343
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,400
Yes, I did.

344
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,070
- What about you?
- I ate, too.

345
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,820
I had a tuna kimbap.

346
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,120
Good.

347
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,790
- Are you going to work?
- Yes, I have to go out now.

348
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,160
Aren't you cold?

349
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,750
No.

350
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,150
I miss you. I'll go to see you tomorrow.

351
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,230
I have a day-off tomorrow.

352
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,400
I'll see you soon.

353
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,060
[Welcome to Dacham Village, where it's always full of joy!]

354
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,080
I think I got good at cooking now.

355
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,820
Don't you think so?

356
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,150
You got better than before.

357
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,550
You are saying it as if it's not true.

358
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,720
No, you've gotten better.

359
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,510
You are doing great.

360
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,100
- You are good at cooking.
- There are people here.

361
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,680
Aren't you all hungry? What do you want to eat?

362
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,210
I'm happy with anything.

363
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,540
Please give me something delicious, something not like egg roll kimbap.

364
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,580
We've come out this far in a while.

365
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,870
You got so skinny, by the way!

366
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,980
You should eat more.

367
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,260
Is your agency making you starve?

368
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,070
A little bit for me to get in shape.

369
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,150
Who's making you starve? Who's your agency's CEO?

370
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,820
It's Jang Jae Eun, right? I'll call them, so eat as much as you want from now.

371
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,650
You should just focus on me.

372
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,510
There's no other actor taking care of you more than me.

373
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,520
- Exactly.
- You look pretty cool today. That coat is nice.

374
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,450
- It's good, isn't it?
- Yes, it's cool like a cheetah.

375
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,700
It's good.

376
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,910
Not a cheetah, but it has its own feeling. It's good.

377
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,000
Ho Min looks great, too. All of you look great.

378
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,120
You look more amazing.

379
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,630
Of course, I know about that.

380
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,620
You look the best.

381
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,450
That's correct, too.

382
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,170
But there's someone who looks more handsome these days.

383
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,470
Please don't.

384
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,710
Okay, okay.

385
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,230
Don't go overboard.

386
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,470
Is this all?

387
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,150
I know it's rural here, but you are not wearing a face mask again. Will you be okay?

388
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,160
I'll be fine.

389
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,140
I don't care if anybody notices me.

390
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,900
I mean...

391
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,930
This handsome face of Kang Seo Joon.

392
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,960
I'm worried that people all over the world will know about it.

393
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,330
You've become so shameless.

394
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,010
Why?

395
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,800
I love it.

396
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,970
I'm saying it because I love it.

397
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,860
I love it, too.

398
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,090
I'll go dump this.

399
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,300
No, give that trash bag to me. I'm used to dumping it.

400
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,620
Let me do it.

401
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,560
- Just one time.
- No, Kang Seo Joon!

402
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,480
Kang Seo Joon, you crossed the line.

403
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,540
Seo Joon, please.

404
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,740
I lack the American mindset, so I don't think I can wish you two to be happy.

405
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,760
And for your information, this is the next season's main product that I got inspired by you two.

406
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,320
Then I'll keep it short.

407
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,340
Without any last goodbyes,

408
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,950
Seong Yoon left for Seoul.

409
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,460
She only left behind the bracelets that she made for us.

410
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,700
How is it? Do you like the bracelet?

411
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,740
- Yes.
- Seong Yoon made this.

412
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,500
I think she made it amazingly.

413
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,040
Oh, you think she made it amazingly?

414
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,750
But where did you put that matching bracelet you had before?

415
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,850
Why are you coughing all of a sudden?

416
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,530
It's cold. Let's go inside.

417
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,230
I'm asking you. Where did that matching bracelet go?

418
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,320
Stop coughing! Don't play around with me.

419
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,560
Let's talk inside.

420
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,860
You buried it, didn't you? You buried it in the mountain like before, right?

421
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,710
No, I didn't.

422
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,100
Then, where is it?

423
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,640
- Let's go inside and talk.
- Wait, wait!

424
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,320
No, from now on, look at me.

425
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,660
This necklace. Right?

426
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,390
This necklace, and now wear this bracelet, too.

427
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,980
I have to work in the kitchen and get water on my hand a lot.

428
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,910
So it's not good for me to wear something on my hand.

429
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,930
No, you can just take it off when you are working!

430
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,060
I'll wear the bracelet on my day off,

431
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,990
and I'll wear the necklace when I'm working. Okay?

432
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,640
No, you should wear both of them.

433
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,360
- I can't...
- No, wear both of them.

434
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,890
Wear both of them, please!

435
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:52,740
Then, should I put this on your necklace as well?

436
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,680
No, no.

437
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,770
Let's try it on.

438
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,330
Let's try the bracelet that Jeong Seong Yoon made for us.

439
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,320
I don't want to.

440
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,340
Let's try it!

441
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,020
Did you gain some weight?

442
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,780
You are eating a lot while you are cooking, aren't you?

443
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,180
Are you okay?

444
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,420
Wait, my back...

445
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,360
Are you okay?

446
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,850
- My back is important.
- Does it hurt?

447
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,120
I'll massage you. Let's go inside.

448
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:35,270
A star has its own homeostasis to glow.

449
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:40,190
But if the universe disappears, the star wouldn't be able to exist anymore as well.

450
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,950
Seong Bin, good morning.

451
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,900
Did you sleep okay?

452
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,260
Yes, I slept fine.

453
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,700
What's going on?

454
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,660
It's a surprise.

455
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,630
Really?

456
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,720
- But...
- Why don't we get on the road?

457
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,020
I'll be your special road manager just for today.

458
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,180
Then I have to work hard and wrap it up quickly.

459
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,530
Be careful.

460
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,210
- Put your seatbelt on.
- Did you tell this to Pil Hyun?

461
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,000
I did. Here's your water.

462
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,110
- Okay, I'll start driving now.
- Okay.

463
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,470
Are you okay?

464
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,710
Yes, I'm okay.

465
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,870
I'm fine.

466
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,620
- Are you okay? I'll get on the road now.
- Can you drive it?

467
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,580
Of course.

468
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,620
Wait, one second.

469
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,810
It's difficult for anybody when you suddenly drive a big car.

470
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,180
That Jaguar didn't get hurt before, did it?

471
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,590
Isn't this cold for you?

472
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,720
I'm okay.

473
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,810
Wait, I saw this corny handkerchief a lot from somewhere.

474
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,510
It's an old one. I got it from Pil Hyun.

475
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,420
Pil Hyun gave it to you? When?

476
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,690
At my parents' funeral, somebody handed this to me,

477
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,920
saying he saw me crying.

478
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,690
Why did you ask?

479
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,550
I just didn't feel right throwing this out.

480
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,800
Wait.

481
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,550
What's wrong?

482
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,580
So that time when you had the funeral.

483
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,620
Then this is definitely mine!

484
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,170
What are you talking about?

485
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,850
Wow, I got goosebumps.

486
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,570
I guess we were really meant to be together.

487
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,130
What are you saying? Please explain it to me.

488
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,060
It's crazy.

489
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,540
I wanted to find my universe.

490
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,130
I gave this to you at that time.

491
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:00,910
What? Don't lie to me.

492
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:06,400
Inside my dark heart, a small star turned on its light.

493
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,470
I'm not lying.

494
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:13,730
At that time, I saw a boy in a school uniform crying, so I handed this handkerchief to him.

495
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,420
♫  Your cheeks are getting blushed  ♫

496

I found my own universe.

497
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:24,430
You heard it from Kim Pil Hyun, didn't you?

498
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,930
No. How can I hear something when I saw this handkerchief just now?

499
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,340
I'm really telling you the truth.

500
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,500
It doesn't make any sense. I can't trust you.

501
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,600
I really did give a handkerchief to you at that time.

502
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,640
Pil Hyun handed it to you, and that's how you got it. It's correct.

503
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,090
- Is it true?
- It's true!

504
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,690
- I'm driving right now!
- Look at me. Is it really true?

505
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,940
Yes, it's true!

506
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,530
It's true! Please, stop it!

507
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,740
Are you sure?

508
