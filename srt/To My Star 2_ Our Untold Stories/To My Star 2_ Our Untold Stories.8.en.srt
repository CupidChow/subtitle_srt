00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:11,480
[To My Star 2]

2
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,530
Please, have some.

3
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,120
As you know, there is a lot of talk internally.

4
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,650
We are also just salarymen.

5
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,620
You two, the producer and writer, are the ones to make the decision. I heard it hit the highest viewing rate.

6
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,690
We'll get ready for the article to be released.

7
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,270
Honestly, it's not like he committed a crime. It's a health issue.

8
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,740
That's right.

9
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,900
But the question is if that's true.

10
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,450
If there's a rumor of discord and our show gets in trouble before it airs, it'll be a problem.

11
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,060
Also, Actor Seo Joon doesn't have to come out on the solution episode.

12
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,030
You said you wanted him to be on it before!

13
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,390
We think it'll make a headline if he's on the show.

14
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,380
I'm TB Entertainment's CEO, Kim Pil Hyun.

15
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,990
I'll make sure there is no noise. Why don't you trust me and give it a try?

16
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,520
Okay?

17
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,920
Hello!

18
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,210
Welcome.

19
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,750
I think this was the seat where Kang Seo Joon sat.

20
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,870
Let's sit here, then.

21
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,590
It's your first time here, right?

22
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,330
We are—

23
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,450
Hello!

24
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,860
Welcome.

25
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,450
Our restaurant's recommendations are Rigatoni Ragu pasta,

26
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,280
squid ink risotto, sirloin steak, and Goulash.

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,310
- It's a spicy Hungarian stew—
- Table for two, please!

28
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,420
It's really good!

29
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,780
The taste is excellent!

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,130
Thank you for the food.

31
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,050
It's delicious!

32
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,650
Welcome. Table for two?

33
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,760
If you don't come out, I'll just barge in!

34
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,050
What is it again?

35
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,260
I said I'm fine.

36
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,570
What were you up to?

37
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,280
I was working out.

38
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,140
Why did you come? I don't have any schedule.

39
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,800
Don't worry. I sorted out everything.

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,930
The Countryside Restaurant's recent episode was a great hit.

41
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,480
You should go on the solution episode for that restaurant as well.

42
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,030
Are you asking me to go there again?

43
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,970
- Are you joking with me?
- Why?

44
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,360
You have to show that you are totally fine!

45
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,840
But it's true.

46
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,160
I did have a relapse. It's true, so why?

47
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,310
It says that's correct.

48
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Bro, that's not the reason why you are taking off from the show.

49
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,940
These broadcasting punks... Forget about it.

50
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,820
You can show that you overcame and are doing well.

51
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,840
Then it'll all pass as well. You told me this before.

52
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,900
This is the chance.

53
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm not going. I can't go.

54
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,730
Also, please don't barge into my place like this anymore.

55
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,440
I don't have time to be lonely because of you guys.

56
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,850
Isn't that a good thing?

57
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,050
Please go now.

58
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,310
Yes, Baby.

59
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,520
I wanted to call you just now—

60
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,210
About Han Ji Woo?

61
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,980
This time it's Han Ji Woo?

62
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,440
Village Chief!

63
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,930
- Village Chief.
- Village Chief!

64
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,310
Village Chief?

65
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,470
- What is it?
- What's wrong with you, seriously?

66
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,660
What about it? What are you saying from this early in the morning?

67
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,930
Chief, there's this commotion going on. Do you have any idea?

68
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,580
Of course, he has an idea. Didn't someone here spread a weird rumor?
[Countryside Restaurant's handsome Chef Han Ji Woo, the friend of Kang Seo Joon, turned out to be a conman's son?!]

69
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,050
What are you talking about it?

70
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,460
Who would do that in our village?

71
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,000
But, Chief, this article is a lie!

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,090
Yes! This is a lie!

73
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,790
Now that his business finally started to do well.

74
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,310
Village Chief.

75
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,480
I'll call the reporter right now. Is that okay with you?

76
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,540
Of course! Go ahead and call.

77
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,290
It wouldn't be someone from our village.

78
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,790
Somebody in Seoul might have leaked it.

79
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,310
Do you think that makes sense? Who in Seoul knows about this?

80
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,050
How do I know that?

81
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,270
Are you sure you didn't say anything?

82
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,100
There's nothing!

83
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,300
Yes, Reporter Kim!

84
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,910
I'm Jeong Seong Yoon. I did an interview with you before.

85
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,760
[Ti Aspetto]
[Open]

86
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,420
Mr. Han, I'll stay with my mom today.
[Yoo Ha]

87
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,190
Hang in there! The truth will come out.
[Yoo Ha]

88
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,180
Isn't this crazy? Out of the blue?

89
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,650
Why would they attack Han Ji Woo?

90
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,450
It's #1 on every search engine.

91
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,820
It's driving me nuts. Are they going to film the show as it was scheduled?

92
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,980
This is not true, though!

93
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,310
Baby!

94
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,980
It's been a while, Ho Min.

95
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,620
How are you?

96
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,210
Shall I leave you two alone?

97
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,570
Yes, bye!

98
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,750
Why was it so hard for me to see you until now, Baby?

99
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,550
When does that solution episode of Countryside Restaurant air?

100
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,240
The shooting is in three days.

101
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,030
The broadcasting will happen

102
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,360
two weeks after the filming.

103
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,610
Did you come here to help me when you are very busy?

104
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,220
Yes. Can you see my dark circles?

105
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,960
Then the show didn't get canceled yet.

106
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,670
No.

107
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,380
- Should I make you an espresso with three shots?
- I already drank one.

108
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:31,190
Kang Seo Joon also needs that show to be aired, right?

109
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,890
Right.

110
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,650
Didn't your parents also know Ji Woo's parents?

111
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,240
There's an entertainment reporter, Reporter Kim.

112
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,820
The one who did an interview with Ji Woo's friend, Ms. Jeong Seong Yoon, told me.

113
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,820
That reporter said that conman and Ji Woo's father

114
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,980
were colleagues who worked together in TB Group.

115
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,140
Tell me everything that you know.

116
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,270
Ji Woo moved to a rural village in Haseong when he became a high school student with his family.

117
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,600
- This is Mr. Yoon.
- Oh, you are Ji Woo.

118
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,850
- Hello.
- I heard a lot about you.

119
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,590
How is your life away from Seoul City? Is it comfortable?

120
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,370
You raised your son very well.

121
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,320
I don't know that well.

122
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,990
But he was a friend of Ji Woo's father.

123
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,080
I guess you didn't know about it!

124
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,910
- If you lose, you better buy Makgeolli for us.
- Of course, I should buy it!

125
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,680
You can't take that back!

126
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,620
I guess you went through a hard time.

127
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,090
It's okay now.

128
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,780
So for just ten years from now on,

129
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,030
if you put 300,000 every month, you'll get 500 million won.

130
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,910
Just trust me and put 300,000 every month. And on the date I told you,

131
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,480
put in all the big chunk of money you have.

132
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,330
Then it'll double the price. It's something like that.

133
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,010
Is it okay to trust that?

134
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,890
Mother! I can hear you.

135
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,560
You'll make this son sad if you don't trust me.

136
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,120
You can trust me. I'll make you all rich!

137
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,740
I heard then that one of his colleagues

138
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,440
started insurance work with their friend's recommendation.

139
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,080
What did I do wrong?

140
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,700
- As a result, Ji Woo's father indeed introduced him to the village.
- I can't do it!

141
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,420
What's wrong with you? Can't you trust me?

142
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,810
But taking the insurance was an individual's choice.

143
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,340
Hey, Yoon Jeong Hoon!

144
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,350
Jeong Hoon!

145
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,900
The culprit had already gotten arrested.

146
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,980
So it's a total rumor! There's no need to even respond to this.

147
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,000
It all comes out if you look up a little bit.

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,810
Who wants to know about the truth these days?

149
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,920
If it's fun on the surface, they just trust it and forget about it.

150
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,740
Baby, it makes me feel bad.

151
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,300
Before Ji Woo's parents passed away,

152
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,990
they came to my family and asked to lend money.

153
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,400
They wanted to pay back the debt of the Da Cham Village people.

154
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,270
But they passed away on that day in a car accident.

155
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,910
I don't know! It feels like everything is my fault.

156
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,890
Even the Countryside Restaurant show. Who would've known things would go this way?

157
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,100
What bastard said this, seriously?!

158
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,190
First, organize these previous materials and send them to the broadcasting station.

159
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,640
So that they don't cancel the show.

160
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,860
It's an important work for both Han Ji Woo and Kang Seo Joon.

161
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,160
- This must have hurt Ji Woo again.
- Do you think he would've not known about this?

162
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,310
- What?
- Han Ji Woo would've seen this coming.

163
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,750
What are you talking about?

164
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,110
I don't know, but I feel like it.

165
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,900
I don't know the reason.

166
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,380
But he always thinks about the worst possible thing first.

167
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:40,890
By the way, are you not keeping in touch with Ji Woo?

168
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,280
You guys were close to each other. Why don't you contact him again?

169
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,650
The relationship between him and I was over a long time ago.

170
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,880
If we don't keep in touch, that's it.

171
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,910
I'll get going. I have some news to cover.

172
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,410
I ordered some fried chicken, so eat first before returning to work.

173
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,690
- Thank you, Baby.
- You don't have to walk out with me!

174
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,720
It was so good to see you today. Bye!

175
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,990
Yes, Producer.

176
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,260
I was about to call you.

177
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,940
That is really not true.

178
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,000
If you look up a little bit, it all comes out.

179
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,300
[There was something ominous about his face.]

180
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,160
[A conman's son??]

181
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,160
[Didn't he open the restaurant with that money??]

182
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,160
[Don't stay close to Kang Seo Joon.]

183
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,100
[Why not? It's two peas in a pod.]

184
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,080
Ji Woo, we'll resolve it, so don't cancel the filming.
[Kim Pil Hyun]

185
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,620
It's a necessary work for Seo Joon Hyung as well.
[Kim Pil Hyun]

186
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,750
Hello.

187
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,130
Is this place up for business?

188
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,460
Why is it so dark in here?

189
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,390
- The thing is...
- First of all!

190
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,930
Why don't you make us something?

191
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,820
Bring us your most confident dish.

192
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,280
Let's go inside!

193
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,160
Can we also have something absolutely delicious?

194
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,200
Please give us the authentic Italian dish.

195
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,900
I want "Aglio e Olio"!

196
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,110
I'll have the same one as her.

197
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,600
But why did you make it so dark in here? Turn on the light. Otherwise, ghosts will come out!

198
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,070
- Why? It has a nice ambiance.
- What ambiance?

199
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,230
What are you waiting for?

200
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,090
We didn't make that article go out.

201
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,520
Whoever that bastard is, we won't stand still if we catch them.

202
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,130
What was that? False information—

203
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:47,060
- Spreading false information!
- Yes! With that accusation,

204
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,020
I'll make them go to jail.

205
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,500
Yes, let's find the culprit and send them to prison!

206
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Yes, so don't worry.

207
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,910
Let's enjoy the food first.

208
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,670
I had the food here with Seo Joon before.

209
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,560
It was delicious! What should I eat today?

210
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,620
- Do you want me to recommend you something?
- "Aglio e Olio" is delicious, Village Chief.

211
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,300
Is that so?

212
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,870
What if he doesn't come out?

213
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,780
You just have to drag him out!

214
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,200
Do you know how much I begged the producer?

215
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,390
We'll resolve the issue in time.

216
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,400
So go to Bro's place and check if he's awake.

217
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,510
I'll check and call you back.

218
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,090
Okay.

219
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,270
I have to pack my stuff.

220
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,830
And I have to bring back the camping car, too.

221
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,740
Bro.

222
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,990
I don't know if you know about this.

223
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,590
Actually, there's another issue that came out about Han Ji Woo.

224
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,340
I'm aware of it.

225
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,980
- It's here.
- Hello!

226
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,460
It took me some more time since it snowed.

227
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,370
It's okay.

228
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,540
Village Chief, my girlfriend is a very awesome reporter.

229
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,380
- Okay.
- I know it's a bit tight,

230
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,860
but we have something to do in collaboration.

231
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,650
- Coke?
- No, not the drink.

232
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,690
You and I have work to do together.

233
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,210
Okay.

234
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,720
Okay, the Countryside Restaurant solution team, let's go inside.

235
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,060
Did you practice a lot?

236
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,350
Hello!

237
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,370
Your face turned gaunt!

238
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,210
Let's see the menus you have developed during that time.

239
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:32,070
It's fusion menus. Why don't you have a seat here, Mr. Kang Seo Joon?

240
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,310
I'm very excited.

241
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,210
It's soybean paste pasta, Chamnamul risotto,

242
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,810
and potato pizza pancake.

243
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,760
The menu changed drastically!

244
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,810
[Seo Joon, please do the taste review first!]

245
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,820
How is it?

246
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,090
What about putting some cream in this dish?

247
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,150
The soybean paste taste is so strong right now.

248
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,180
So it feels like you put pasta noodles in soybean paste stew.

249
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,290
Kang Seo Joon, you are good at remarking!

250
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,180
Excuse me!

251
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,220
Hello.

252
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,080
I'm the Village Chief of this village.

253
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,200
I heard that our Ji Woo is shooting a show today.

254
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,850
So I brought some yogurt for everyone!

255
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,870
Thank you so much!

256
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,000
This is mine. Then, good luck with the filming!

257
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,680
Yes, have a nice day!

258
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,580
Ji Woo, fighting!

259
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,630
- Have a nice day!
- Good luck!

260
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,200
Wow, you are famous!

261
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,990
We got so many yogurts.

262
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,040
Excuse me, hello!

263
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,090
Our Ji Woo likes this dried persimmon.

264
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,750
- Thank you.
- Ji Woo, you picked all these persimmons, remember?

265
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,570
Why don't you share this with the staff?

266
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,660
And use some in your cooking, too. Okay?

267
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,120
Kim Sun Ja Persimmons, fighting!

268
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,650
It's funny.

269
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,680
I got an idea.

270
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,780
What if we make specific dishes using local produce?

271
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,290
For example,

272
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,420
using this, can be this Grandma's dried persimmon salad. That kind of way.

273
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,590
It suits well with our program's purpose.

274
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,400
Why don't you consider that?

275
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,920
Hello.

276
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,640
Why did you bring so much apple juice?

277
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,800
Also, aren't those peppers?

278
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,550
Are you okay?

279
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,000
Just do one thing.

280
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,970
Don't worry about me. Focus on yourself.

281
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,540
All right.

282
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,730
You said it puts you in danger if you stay by my side. You were right.

283
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,520
That's why my parents left me, too. Right?

284
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,100
You also experienced something you didn't have to, because of me.

285
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,940
But...

286
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,000
you shouldn't get hurt once you've left me.

287
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,840
You said it wasn't true.

288
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,820
Why are you sitting back when it wasn't true?

289
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,980
Stop crouching down. Live properly.

290
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,500
So, he really told you to leave?

291
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,740
Yes. He said he's got one last thing to do–

292
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,200
What's there for him to do?

293
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,350
Han Ji Woo and Seo Joon, both...

294
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,790
They didn't look good.

295
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,010
Whatever! I don't want to hear it!

296
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,480
CEO—

297
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,430
I have... I have something to say to you.

298
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,350
Want a drink?

299
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,220
TB Entertainment CEO went to the village chief and the villagers and told them everything.

300
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,810
Thanks.

301
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,160
I didn't do anything.

302
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,440
Kang Seo Joon made you feel lonely, huh?

303
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,490
After I went off the grid with you, I went to the States and started dating someone right away.

304
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,880
When I first went to the States, my situation felt so unstable.

305
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,550
I wondered if the guy would get sick of me because I was so obsessed.

306
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:47,090
I worried a lot about it.

307
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:52,310
But he's the one who started getting obsessive over me.

308
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:58,250
I had found what I wanted to study, so I was studying hard. I had so many places I wanted to go, too.

309
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,510
And I thought about you a lot then.

310
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:11,470
"Oh, it's not true that Han Ji Woo didn't love me."

311
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,220
They say you never know until you experience things yourself.

312
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:22,430
So, that's when I stopped praying for your misery.

313
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,550
I'm sorry...

314
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,510
for realizing too late.

315
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,430
I didn't say all this for you to feel bad.

316
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,660
It's a good thing.

317
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,560
It means there are more people you can understand.

318
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,020
Kang Seo Joon...

319
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,630
already feels it and knows it all.

320
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,000
He even expresses that through his acting.

321
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:29,170
So, do you still hope that he just gets it?

322
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,400
But this time, I think it would be too tough for Kang Seo Joon.

323
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:46,940
You came back here, so you can get back to Kang Seo Joon again.

324
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:54,810
If not... oh, if not...

325
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,150
you tried to end it all.

326
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,600
Did you go on TV knowing all this already?

327
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,010
See?

328
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:20,210
I dated you for five years. But I don't get this one this time.

329
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,790
I left my relationship with him to flow on its own.

330
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,320
As I have always done, I was being defensive.

331
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,540
Because a year with Kang Seo Joon was enough for me.

332
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:54,700
He would remain in my life forever even if I was together with him only for that long.

333
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,860
For him, I'd be someone who'd go away in a year.

334
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,680
Although I wished that weren't the case...

335
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,370
Perhaps I wished that Kang Seo Joon would suffer immensely...

336
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,990
I hid behind the wall once again.

337
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:58,320
Ji Woo, where are you? You turned your phone off.

338
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,630
Ji Woo, please don't go.

339
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,890
Han Ji Woo, where are you? What are you up to?

340
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,680
Did I really mess up?

341
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,850
Let's talk things out.

342
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,820
I really loved being with you.

343
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,900
Merry Christmas! It's Christmas day today. What are you doing?

344
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,140
I'm by myself.

345
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,190
I just heard a knock.

346
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,540
I ran out thinking it was you. But it wasn't.

347
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,770
I'm so bored and lonely being alone.

348
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,660
Should I move?

349
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,650
Would I feel better if I moved?

350
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,600
I wonder why you left me.

351
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,540
But I wonder if you're doing okay.

352
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,280
I really hope you're doing okay.

353
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,340
You're doing well, right?

354
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,010
Happy birthday, Ji Woo.

355
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:31,400
Eat lots of yummy food. Don't cook today. Eat out.

356
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:36,580
I wish I could hug you today. Just once.

357
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,840
