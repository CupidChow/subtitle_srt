Just forget that thought for a moment.

50

Well... It's not like your family becomes peaceful because of your efforts alone.

It was all good,

You seem to have a pretty interesting history.

For about five years ever since Ji Woo transferred to school.

Oh, five years...

243

You said you came to Seoul when you were 20 years old.

244
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,010
I went to school in Seoul.

245

We went together.

- Yes.

So, Seong Yoon, what type of person do you dislike?

People get embarrassed when you ask what their ideal types are.

249

I'm just curious.

250

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,920
So, what do you think about breaking up by lying low?

253

I'm sorry...

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,460
Don't be sorry. I said it's okay.

255
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,750
That's not it. I did it on purpose.

256
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,350
Well, I don't know all the details, but

257
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,060
you seem to have your story, but in any case...

258
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,710
Watch out by saying stuff like "lying low"...

259
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,460
Why? What's wrong with saying "lying low"?

260
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,240
I'm the one with a broken heart. Why?

261
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,100
Well, it's because... my goodness...

262
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,330
Well, Seong Yoon...

263
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,790
went "lying low" and that's why they broke up.

264
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,690
You got that?

265
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,960

268

Are you usually a good talker, nine-year-old?

269

Well, I'm not sure.

- I just read books...
- My goodness, my goodness...

278

Hey, we're fine if you don't do it.

But your restaurant could take off. Isn't it a good opportunity?

Really?

301
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,060
I was with him then, but...

302
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,540
now that I think about it, I might've been too immature.

303

Is Yoo Ha sleeping well?

She must've been tired. She's totally out.

307
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,430
I think being in a relationship is the hardest.

308
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,910
I guess so.

309
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:52,220
You must be having trouble in your relationship.

310
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,330
No, I'm not.

311
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,020
I'm happy.

312
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:03,380
If you're more in love with the person, you just hold it in and continue.

313
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,630
I can tell right away that you're just being loyal.

- Break up.
- Hey, hey.

Look how comfortable I am right now.

316
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,230
It's really comfortable.

317
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,350
Just don't think about anything and just do it. What about it?

318
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,580
Do you feel challenged? Am I going too far with this?

319
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,960
I haven't had a drink in a while.

If you have something to say, hurry up and say it here before we go back.

Are you still jealous of Pil Hyun?

You were jealous earlier.
