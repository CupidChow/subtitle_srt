Don't worry, I'm fine.

How can I not worry about you when you're sick?

This is nothing to me, so please don't worry.

Don't you know people will come at you crazy when there's an issue?

8

Can't you ask me if I ate anything—

He didn't say anything about that, but he asked me if I went hiking with you.

He asked if you went hiking with Han Ji Woo?

Yes. So I told him we usually went to Yongjin Mountain.

Please! Why are you saying it like that?

That's not it...

162
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,190
CEO, I'm sorry to say this in the middle of all this, but

163
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,660
I have something to say.

164
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,160
What? What's wrong now?

165
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,190
What is it?

166
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,620
I must tell you this by tomorrow.

167
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,840
Actually, I got an offer to be an idol.

168
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,720
Two months ago.

169
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,980
What?

170
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,740
D. C. H.

171
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,910
Could it be a person's initials?

172
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,690
Which last name starts with a "D"? Surname Do?

173
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,760
But no one in our village has the surname of Do.

174
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,650
Or CH could be one syllable.

175
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,920
Do Choon?

176
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,140
But I don't think the elders would've used the internet, though.

177
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,350
Isn't it like this?

178
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,510
DCH is Dacham Elementary ID.

179
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,680
My ID is also dch280102.

180
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,150
There are so many similar IDs, though.

181
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,230
Then what does this "28" mean?
(T/N: The way she said it sounded like a curse word)

182
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,360
2-8. What does 28 mean?

183
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,030
The year you enter the school.

184
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,150
The year you enter school?

185
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,590
Then what's this "shin-con-dot-con"?

186
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,840
Yoo Ha, you said there aren't that many classmates in your class, right?

187
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,900
There are five of us.

188
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,440
But none of my friends would do that.

189
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,730
But we should still let them know about this clue. You never know.

190
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,520
It could be someone who works at Dacham Elementary or someone connected to the school.

191
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,570
Give me a hair tie.

192
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,690
Well, fine. You're...

193
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,920
pretty handsome, and you look like an idol.

194
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,290
But did you always want to do it?

195
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,590
I was actually interested in it.

196
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,300
You were always clubbing. No wonder...

197
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,490
I see.

198
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,480
You were dancing your heart out at Seo Joon's birthday party. Your moves were different.

199
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,940
Fine. I see. That's what happened.

200
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,780
You've been missing a lot lately, saying you're busy with something.

201
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,860
That's right. That's what happened.

202
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,510
- I'm sorry–
- No, no, no.

203
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,080
Why should you be sorry?

204
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,740
It's fine.

205
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,380
I'll be fine. I'm just a little disappointed.

206
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,910
It's such an important matter.

207
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,210
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,950
It's okay.

209
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:47,180
Never mind. I feel bad that I couldn't pay more attention to you.

210
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,700
Right.

211

I'm just calling to discuss Ji Woo's incident.

213
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,230
Rather than us handling it on our own, you said you know people in the press.

214
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,640
Dot-con. What's sin-con-dot-con?

215
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,420
Sin-con-dot-con is...

216
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,720
So, you know sin-con-dot-con?

217
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,480
That's a phrase used in video games.

218
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,420
"Sin''s control, got control."

They think you went missing. They're all worried about you.

Yeah, yeah. I'm not bothering you, am I?

Yeah.

By chance, do you have time next week? No, huh?

No, huh?

I'd like you to leave.

I didn't toss the ring and the necklace.

255
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,600
I couldn't. I didn't toss them but buried them over there.

So...

257

And what else? Just because you came here,

262
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,760
you're not thinking that I'd take you back. Right?

263
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,270
There's got to be an end to being so pathetic, you know.

Well, people who put in their best don't have any regrets.

No. I should've done a better job.

325
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,460
Hey, you did a really great job.

326
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:45,370
Seo Joon's previous manager went home in three hours and 45 minutes.

327
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,850
Let's go.

328
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,980
Let's eat something yummy. I'm feeling down.

329
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,830
Good luck, Ho Min...

330
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,970
wherever you go.

331
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,930
Sorry.

332
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,650
I didn't know the door would open.

333
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:58,120
I think I stunk, so I went and took a shower.

334
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,070
We didn't get to eat, so I was going to cook for you with this.

335
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,980
Who do you think you are?

336
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,590
Why would you cook?

337
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:28,410
I went so far away, but...

338
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,650
if I typed in your name on the internet, I could find out what you were up to right away.

339
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,600
I kept seeing you around Seoul, so I ran away.

340
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,480
But it was the same in the end.

341
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,550
I'll stop running away now.

342
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,410
As for me,

343
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,010
if you keep pushing me away,

344
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,340
I can't...

345
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,590
continue after you as you did.

346
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,550
To where you are.

347
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,750
What? Is this a threat?

348
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,400
No.

349
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,470
It's a request.

350
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,890
Please hug me.

351
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:58,270
♫  The night has come. Still, like a habit  ♫

352
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,970
♫  I look up to the sky with a sigh  ♫

353
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,620
♫  The dark night sky that's like my heart  ♫

354
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,550
♫  And you are still there  ♫

355
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:20,370
♫ Are you looking at me? ♫

356
