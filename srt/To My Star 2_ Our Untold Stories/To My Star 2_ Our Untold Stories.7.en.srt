[To My Star 2]

2
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,350
I've been... thinking about you a lot, too.

3
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,420
Did you miss me, too?

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,720
I wanted to talk to you.

5
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,610
Then, can I wear this around?

6
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,050
It's a couple bracelet...

7
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:15,200
but for me, it keeps me motivated to work harder.

8
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,590
If I don't wear it, it wouldn't be a couple bracelet.

9
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,850
It would be okay then.

10
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,710
Right.

11
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,110
I agree.

12
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,810
I lose.

13
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,270
Take care of yourself.

14
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm sure you will. Don't get sick, either.

15
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,870
I'm sure you wouldn't be hurting anyway.

16
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,350
Yes. By chance, is there a taxi going to Seoul right now?

17
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,600
Sometimes I remembered that time and remembered that friend.

18
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,670
- Hey, Ji Woo.
- Yeah.

19
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,090
I finished my shoot.

20
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,140
It'll take about an hour and a half if I leave now.

21
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,780
Okay. Got it.

22
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,350
- I'm hanging up.
- Okay.

23
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,580
I didn't know what it was, but I struggled with guilt. I was confused.

24
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,350
What were you doing?

25
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,400
I was just here.

26
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
Aren't you hungry?

27
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,860
I'm okay. I have to leave in two hours.

28
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,720
I'll get some sleep.

29
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,680
The more I realized that Kang Seo Joon didn't do anything wrong, the more I got confused.

30
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,730
By chance, could you meet me in front of my place this evening?

31
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,990
Is something the matter?

32
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,850
I just feel a little down tonight.

33
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,460
Oh, sorry. Well...

34
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,700
I have to practice a little more tonight.

35
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,250
Is Da Kyeong busy?

36
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,220
How is it? Do you think it's fun?

37
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,400
It feels good now that it finally continues, right?

38
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,550
I have to go to the bathroom.

39

[Lee Yoo Rim, actress]

43
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,830
It was my problem all along.

[The two look at each other. Then they close their eyes slowly. Can't tell who made the first move. The two close in on each other and they kiss.]

46
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,520
Is it that difficult for you to be with me tonight?

47
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,510
What's the big deal about cooking?

48
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,430
Why are you working so hard at it?

49
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:45,840
Honestly, I don't understand why you're doing this.

50
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,710
Understand?

51
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,770
I live with my family, even attend university...

52
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,280
I have my friends. Yet why would I...

53
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,590
struggle like this, huh? You don't get it at all, right?

54
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,750
Is your knee okay? Let's sit down and talk.

55
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:19,050
That's right! I don't understand myself, either. How would you understand me?

56
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,200
Some might think it's perfectly right for you to be sad and be struggling.

57
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,360
But I'm the only one who feels this way. It's driving me nuts, too!

58
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,270
I had no idea I could experience the feelings

59
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,700
that I have never felt before, despite being close to 30.

60
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,120
Happy birthday!

61
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,510
Thank you!

62
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,170
Oppa, we ordered drinks and chicken. Eat before you go.

63
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,880
Eat before you go! We finished the shoot.

64
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,360
Oppa, we're livestreaming. Say hello.

65
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,500
They're livestreaming right now.

66
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,540
Happy birthday!

67
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:02,230
I was alone, but Kang Seo Joon was with everyone.

68
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,560
I hated feeling that way.

69
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,810
Feeling like I'd be gone if Kang Seo Joon was gone.

70
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,430
I didn't like the uneasy feeling of being alone.

71
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,110
I wanted to run away.

72
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,520
Coming up with nonsensical excuses nonstop.

73
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,630
It felt like that was the only way I could live.

74
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,030
Do you even know what it feels like to betray?

75
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,950
Because of that one person,

76
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,620
you turned us into the police? Huh?

77
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,690
You fucked us up. So I should fuck you up.

78
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,520
Whoa, are you okay?

79
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,500
- Why didn't you move?
- Are you okay?

80
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,560
- I'm okay. Let's continue.
- Cut!

81
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,370
What?

82
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,560
It's really bad.

83
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,010
Give me a moment. I'll bring him some water.

84
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,620
- Hey, is there a problem with your actor?
- Pardon?

85
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,210
His mental issues. I thought he got all better, didn't he?

86
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,730
It's not just today that he's spoiling the atmosphere on location.

87
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,430
How are you managing your actor?

88
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,310
I'm sorry.

89
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm not saying this to hear you apologize!

90
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,370
Why are you yelling, Director?

91
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,210
Can't you see that we're being delayed?

92
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,830
Pull yourself together quickly and prepare for the shoot!

93
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:50,470
I delayed less than you, Director. Didn't I?
(T/N: Speaking down at the director)

94
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,150
What? "Didn't I"?

95
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:57,810
You take twice the time shooting each episode. Where did you get all the production costs for it?

96
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,150
You, bastard!

97
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,810
Bro...

98
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,630
Jae Won, you speak.

99
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,250
Do you think that I take too long?

100
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,210
What the hell is wrong with all of you!

101
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,890
- Well...
- Jae Won's not the type to think that.

102
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,750
A rude bastard like me would think that, though.

103
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,500
Director, let's never see each other ever again.

104
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,970
But we still have to wrap this up. So, let's do that.

105
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,680
I don't think I should be here today.

106
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,380
So I'll finish up here. You're okay with that, right?

107
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,810
Do you want me to stay longer?

108
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,530
And, Director...

109
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,360
you're at the top of this project. You're the head.

110
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,720
From now on, if you want to talk, speak directly to me.

111
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,070
The top person to top star, as you know.

112
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,090
Please talk to me face-to-face. I request that of you.

113
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,730
And before the shoot starts,

114
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,580
come with a certain picture in mind.

115
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,200
Let's go.

116
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,970
Hey! Damn it!

117
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,020
I'll leave now.

118
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,970
Wait a minute.

119
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,570
Hello, this is Kang Seo Joon, as you know.

120
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,890
How have you been?

121
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,450
I'm livestreaming first time in a while.

122
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,830
I'm taking a break from my shoot.

123
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,710
I missed you all, so I decided to livestream.

124
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,690
As for this... Are you shocked, everyone?

125
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,360
This isn't real. Just makeup.

126
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,360
I won't tell you anymore. It could be a spoiler.

127
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,600
Did you all eat?

128
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,880
Of course, I ate. Today, I ate...

129
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:11,240
What are you doing? Do you want to come out for a second?

130
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,730
Do you remember when we were in high school?

131
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,630
I'm okay.

132
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,760
I don't think so...

133
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
I think we held hands after dating for 100 days.

134
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,340
That's how we were.

135
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,270
Did we?

136
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,760
Let me know if you're in pain.

137
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,900
Got it.

138
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,340
It's so nice to be out, Ji Woo. It's been too long.

139
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,400
Bro!

140
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,090
You drank again last night?

141
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,430
I told you not to barge in here without my permission.

142
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,640
Then, why don't you pick up the phone? Is it a prop?

143
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,950
Why don't you pick up?

144
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,730
Why? I don't have a shoot today.

145
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,000
Today?

146
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,640
That's not the problem! You may never have another shoot now!

147
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,270
You got killed.

148
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,130
Those thugs killed you off all of a sudden.

149
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,890
I'm sorry, sir. Are you still drunk? Do you still not get it?

150
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:51,980
They fired the main character! That bastard, Director Kim!

151
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,040
Are you okay?

152
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,090
Everyone out.

153
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,900
- Hey.
- Out.

154
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,350
Bro!

155
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,380
Bro, are you okay?

156
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,230
Bro, are you okay?

157
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,970
Bro...

158
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,860
Why are you trembling so much? It's okay.

159
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,030
It's my fault.

160
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,790
What?

161
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,340
Bro and the director argued because of me at the shoot.

162
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,630
It's okay. It's not your fault.

163
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,860
Pull yourself together. You can't fall apart, too.

164
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,160
You have to protect Seo Joon right now.

165
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,950
You're his manager. Right?

166
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,250
Yes. It's okay.

167
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,720
Bro, are you okay?

168
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,220
Should I call Dr. Yang to come over?

169
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,760
I'm okay. Just go.

170
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,790
I'll take care of everything.

171
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,340
Hello!

172
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,410
Let's go this way.

173
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,220
Oh, water! Water's dripping.

174
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,100
Wow!

175
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,420
So many people have come already.

176
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,410
Hello! Yoo Ha, say hello to everyone.

177
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,260
Hello! Hello!

178
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,650
- Where's Han Ji Woo?
- He hasn't come yet.

179
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,490
He does love to make the entrance.

180
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,540
It seems like the majority of people have arrived now.

181
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,970
Da Cham Village is about to get broadcast.

182
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,190
So there was an opinion that we should gather all and watch it beforehand.

183
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,350
As you all know, we have opposed it since the incident in the past.

184
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,490
But our top star Kang Seo Joon

185
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,910
spoke to the broadcasting station so that we could watch it before it gets aired to check if there are any issues with it.

186
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,630
That's why we can watch it today.

187
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,230
Then, I'll play it now.

188
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,950
But Ji Woo hasn't arrived yet.

189
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,610
I'll play it.

190
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,180
Wait, Village Chief. I said Ji Woo hasn't arrived yet.

191
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,390
I asked Ji Woo to come, so if you can please wait a bit—

192
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,800
I told him not to come.

193
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,090
- Why?
- If we watch and say something uncomfortable,

194
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,660
wouldn't the past stories come up?

195
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,870
If people speak ill about his parents, he shouldn't be here. I was being considerate to him.

196
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,690
Let me ask you this.

197
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:35,630
What are you still so mad about?

198
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,870
Is it because of that scam incident in the past?

199
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,630
Is that why you are all still treating him like now?

200
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,800
You guys don't know about it well since you were young at that time.

201
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,580
Do you know how many people got scammed? And how much money was involved in it?

202
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,750
That's a case that has already been adjudicated.

203
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,220
- But if you still act like this—
- Who brought that crook into our village?! Wasn't it Mr. Han?

204
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,570
I'm still infuriated if I think about that time.

205
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,870
How do we know if they planned the whole thing together?

206
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,340
I don't know it in detail.

207
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,840
But I heard Ji Woo's parents worked so hard to pay back all your money until they passed away.

208
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,830
But do you still want to act like this?

209
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,710
He's trying hard to live well!

210
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,760
What kind of resentment do you have in him?

211
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,580
Why do you keep acting like this to him?

212
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,820
- Are all adults adults?
- What?!

213
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,850
Your wound is the biggest, and you can't even see others' wounds.

214
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,320
Do you think anybody can take responsibility?

215
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:36,070
We, young people, have our own weight that we struggle to carry.

216
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,840
Da Kyeong.

217
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,350
I'm sorry.

218
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,440
I should've not asked you to come back here.

219
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,670
Why did I run into you in Seoul and bring you all the way here?

220
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:09,880
I made you hear things that you didn't have to.

221
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,070
I'm really sorry.

222
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,520
It's all thanks to you and Yoo Ha that

223
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,920
I could've held out until now, so don't say that.

224
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,030
I'm fine. So don't worry.

225
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,820
Please don't cry.

226
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,410
I love you, Bro.

00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,190

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,320
Let's just comb your hair today and go.

230
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,370
Okay.

231
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,490
Have a seat.

232
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,300
You have to go out soon. Why are you turning on the TV?

233
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,910
The Countryside Restaurant is on TV.

234
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,160
You're right. It'll air tonight.

235
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,020
The restaurant we will introduce to you today is run by a young chef.

236
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,170
It's an Italian restaurant he runs by himself in a rural village.

237
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,050
There's no hesitation in his move. He's a great chef!
[Perfec-tion]

238
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:41,660
Just looking at his skill, he's an excellent chef.

239

I heard Kang Seo Joon has a connection with the owner here.
 [Countryside Restaurant]

240
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,320
He came out on my V-log for a minute.
[Countryside Restaurant]

241
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,030
You two had great chemistry in that video.
 [Actually, he had a connection with Seo Joon?]

242
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,190
Yes, we did have great chemistry.

243

Hello, it has been a while.
[Countryside Restaurant]

244
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,370
Not only is this unfamiliar, but it also doesn't suit a countryside village where traditional Korean food is appropriate.

245
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,370
I wanted to keep the identity of an Italian restaurant.

246
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,790
The menu is too difficult. Have you thought of doing some fusion?

247
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,220
How about giving up some of your stubborness?

248
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,390
Or go work at a hotel and forget this place.

249
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,410
Kang Seo Joon, you're being pretty harsh.

250
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,150
[Furious Wok Movement]

251
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,150
It was fun.
[The Countryside Restaurant episode with Kang Seo Joon was so much fun!]

[He's very stubborn, but he's very handsome, too!]

[Finally, we figured out who he was.]

254
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,320
Is it a relief?

255
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,330
We have to film the solution episode of the Countryside Restaurant anyway.

256
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,740
So if he goes out and shoots that one, wouldn't his getting kicked out of that drama be covered?

257
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,910
Hello?

258
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,110
It's been a while, Baby.

259
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,570
I'm sorry.

260
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,620
What are you sorry for?

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,440
The article will come out soon.

Yes, it's TB Entertainment.

There's nothing we can tell you at the moment.

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,790
No, we also have to check.

267
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,390
We also have to check about it.
