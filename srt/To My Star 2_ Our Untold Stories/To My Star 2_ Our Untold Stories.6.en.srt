1
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:13,070
[To My Star 2]

2
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,760
If you have something to say,

3
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,930
hurry up and say it here before we go back.

4
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,550
Are you still jealous of Pil Hyun?

5
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,380
You were jealous earlier.

6
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,390
You looked at me when Da Kyeong spilled the drink earlier, too.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,800
You were afraid I'd react to the noise.

8
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,700
I told you.

9
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,910
You can think as you like.

10
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,550
My outfit is like this right now.

11
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,650
So I know it might sound funny,

12
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,270
but I'll fix everything you said to me.

13
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,410
Isn't that going to work for you?

14
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,080
What can you change?

15
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,970
I'll sleep and wake up regularly at the same time as you.

16
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,290
- Also—
- What about when you have a shoot?

17
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,840
When I have work as well. I'll try my best, so don't worry about it.

18
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,970
If I was too sensitive to you, I'm also sorry about that.

19
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,790
I thought about it, and I think it's all because my daily routine is too irregular.

20
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,920
So if I adjust to your lifestyle, it'll change naturally—

21
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,630
Ji Woo.

22
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,840
Now, for me...

23
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,730
I can only think of you when I think about a chef.

24
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,210
Pasta, Italy, and even the last name Han are all about you for me.

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,180
To fix that we can't go out on a date outside, let's go abroad more often.

26
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,020
Also...

27
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,410
I won't ask you to let me squeeze it when you get a blemish on your face.

28
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,390
I don't have to ask you that. I was just teasing you because you were cute.

29
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,610
Why are you acting like this? You are making me uncomfortable.

30
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,600
Do you act pathetic like this when you break up?

31
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,800
If it's not, are you having trouble believing that a guy like me doesn't like you?

32
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,400
- Han Ji Woo!
- To me!

33
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,230
I can't understand why you are acting like this now.

34
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,670
I can't understand you right now.

35
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,210
I guess you think...

36
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,600
I'm a total crazy narcissist who doesn't even think about others at all.

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,750
You do look like that.

38
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,780
You think you are the main character here as well, don't you?

39
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,770
Main character?

40
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,180
Aren't you the main character?

41
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,100
You hide away as if you are the only sad person in this world.

42
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,770
You don't think about facing the problem and solving it.

43
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,160
You have unnecessary great pride.

44
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,850
And you never tell your real feelings, making other people go crazy!

45
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,770
That's why!

46
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,590
I also know that.

47
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,570
I know that I'm that kind of person.

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,100
I am that kind of person.

49
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,750
But still...

50
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,620
- But still, I'm saying I like you.
- But I'm saying I don't like you.

51
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,450
You didn't do anything wrong to me when we were dating.

52
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,270
Am I wrong?

53
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,110
No matter how hard I think about it, I don't remember anything you did wrong to me.

54
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,800
Everything was my issue.

55
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,630
I was lonely.

56
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,410
What?

57
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,210
I was lonely at the time.

58
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,720
When I was in a relationship with you, I was lonelier than when I was single.

59
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,650
Then, why do I have to date you?

60
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,570
What's the good of it?

61
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,050
You never told me this.

62
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,150
Now you know exactly...

63
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,000
the reason why I don't want to date you again.

64
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,620
Ji Woo.

65
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,190
We did have a problem...

66
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,960
since today was the first time we have yelled and fought with each other.

67
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,530
That we...

68
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,580
Let's hurry up and go home.

69
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,050
Bro, your next schedule is not that far away from here.

70
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,920
Why don't you just get some rest in this area?

71
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,170
If you go home, you won't be able to rest for two hours.

72
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,000
It's okay. I'll go home and rest.

73
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,030
Yes, Ji Woo. I just finished my shoot.

74
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,080
If I head home now, it'll take about an hour and a half.

75
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,950
How is it? Do you think it's interesting?

76
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,090
The two are finally getting together, so it's a relief. Right?

77
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,330
Yes.

78
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,800
Now that I think about it, I did my best for him.

79
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,910
Happy birthday!

80
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,590
Happy birthday!

81
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you so much!

82
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,330
Oppa, we ordered fried chicken and drinks. Why don't you have some with us?

83
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,110
I'm really sorry.

84
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,000
But I have an important plan. You know, I'm dating someone.

85
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,450
That's right.

86
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,070
- Oppa, at least take this with you.
- Yes.

87
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,740
It's because I thought I met someone I'd share the rest of my life with.

88
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,310
- Order everything you want to eat with this!
- Really?

89
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,600
But if it's not working out this much,

90
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,840
we are really not meant to be.

91
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,340
I guess you went over there and fought again.

92
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,010
Bro.

93
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,010
From my perspective,

94
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,250
you were very devoted to that relationship.

95
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,240
You rarely joined in drinking with others. I mean, even after you broke up with him.

96
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,900
Even though I don't know why you two broke up.

97
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,150
I mean, you did more than your best.

98
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,590
But if he's not coming back to you,

99
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,050
then you are not meant to be.

100
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,170
I think it's time for you to stop trying.

101
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,720
Why does it make me feel sad all of a sudden?

102
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
CEO Kim...

103
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,040
What is it?

104
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,890
When is the schedule for the Countryside Restaurant shoot?

105
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,730
That show?

106
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,010
I think it is on Thursday, two weeks from now.

107
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,120
Why? Are you also not going to participate?

108
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,320
I'll do it. I have to do it.

109
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,990
You surprised me.

110
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,140
The appearance in the Countryside Restaurant,

111
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,570
it will be helpful to Han Ji Woo.

112
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,930
Da Kyeong.

113
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,560
What kind of person am I, from your perspective?

114
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,220
You?

115
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,760
You are a very consistent person to me.

116
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,050
You are always very put together.

117
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,740
And you are always competitive.

118
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,840
I wonder what Ji Woo will think about me.

119
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,790
Wouldn't he be thinking differently than me?

120
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,080
That time was a tough time for him and you.

121
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,850
You were going to go to college with a volleyball scholarship, but you got injured and couldn't go.

122
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,510
And Han Ji Woo lost his parents at that time.

123
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,920
It was a hard and challenging time.

124
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,440
So I want him to look at me differently now.

125
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,060
But because I'm different from that time,

126
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,460
I wonder if he feels foreign to me.

127
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,050
- Hey.
- Yes?

128
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:45,320
Yoo Ha called Han Ji Woo her dad the whole time until now.

129
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,400
- Really?
- Yes.

130
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,870
But I guess she thought his private life was promiscuous,

131
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,560
and she started to call him Mr. Han.

132
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,210
It's so funny.

133
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,500
I don't know.

134
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,300
I guess in this world, you can miss someone

135
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,300
even if you broke up with them.

136
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't want to see my ex at all. If anything, I want him to just die.

137
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,010
He didn't take any responsibility.

138
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,200
I mean, he was totally fine when his own daughter called him an uncle.

139
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
That's outrageous.

140
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,750
Should I say something to him?

141
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,930
It's fine.

142
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,080
My parents also gave up on him.

143
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,460
Let's go to sleep now.

144
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,810
How are your parents? Are they doing great?

145
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,790
Of course.

146
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,760
They didn't like it at first,

147
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,170
but now they miss Yoo Ha so much.

148
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,890
When my grandmother recovers, they'll come back to this town.

149
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,300
Then you'll be more comfortable, too.

150
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,830
It might make me more uncomfortable.

151
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:12,340
Now that I think about it, you and Ji Woo didn't change at all.

152
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,950
I feel like I'm the only one who changed so much.

153
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,700
To me, you didn't change at all as well.

154
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,520
- Really?
- Yes, you girl!

155
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,450
"You girl."

156
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,770
I haven't heard that in a while.

157
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,580
- I still can't get used to you speaking in a Seoul dialect. It makes me cringe.
- Why?

158
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,180
What do you mean "why"?

159
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,110
Let's get some sleep!

160
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,680
She said we needed to go to sleep.

161
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,280
Is anybody home?

162
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,210
- Who is it?
- Hello.

163
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,970
It's me, Kang Seo Joon.

164
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,080
How did you all get the good cards?

165
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,170
I lost, I lost.

166
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,910
You are so good at playing this game!

167
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,410
I think this town needs to change its name to Gamblers Village.

168
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,830
♫  Now, it's the beginning  ♫

169
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,300
It's ginger tea.

170
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,330
Sir, why don't you have some hot ginger tea?

171
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,610
You are such a handsome man!

172
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,960
You have a good eye for it!

173
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,580
Yes, please put that one on me.

174
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,350
Oh, it dropped. Can you put another one on for me?

175
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,060
Can I put one on you, Yoo Ha?

176
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,050
I'm wearing this one, so what about this one on you?

177
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,120
Yoo Ha.

178
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,910
Did your mom approve of you hanging out with Kang Seo Joon?

179
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,420
Yes. My mom and Seo Joon are friends now.

180
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,350
Now, Kang Seo Joon is close with all of the grandmas and grandpas in the town.

181
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,230
Now that you get groceries from the marketplace,

182
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,890
the price went down this much.

183
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,810
But if your business is still not doing well,

184
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,400
don't you think there's a problem?

185
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,860
Should I give out more coupons?

186
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,060
You didn't like that idea before.

187
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,990
- Be careful of the door when you're coming in.
- Don't worry. I got it!

188
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,780
Hello.

189
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,540
Did you refuse to go on that show or something?

190
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,910
I heard about it.

191
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:27,050
And if this restaurant goes on TV, this area's business will all get promoted.

192
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,860
We can sell more of our persimmons. That's what I heard.

193
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,340
The thing is...

194
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,240
You have to do the show.

195
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,580
Why are you not saying anything again?

196
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,250
Forget about it. Why don't you make us some food to recover from a hangover?

197
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,500
And don't forget to agree to go on the show. Okay?

198
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,760
Going on TV shows looks hard, but I heard it's nothing.

199
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,530
I went on a show when I was young.

200
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,770
That went well and...

201
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,180
Yes, Ho Min.

202
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,360
You need to get on the road now. Don't you?

203
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,060
I'm on my way. Don't worry about me.

204
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,450
Are you already at the filming site?

205
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Now, finally!

206
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,580
A countryside restaurant that no one knows, let's make a hit project!

207
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,670
It's the 100th episode of the Countryside Restaurant!

208
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,040
Finally, that time came! It's the 100th episode.

209
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,410
Yes, that's right.

210
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,640
So to celebrate this special day,

211
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,480
we invited a very special guest.

212
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,610
It wasn't easy to have this guest with us today.

213
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,340
I'm also a big fan of his.

214
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,160
I'm really looking forward to today's guest.

215
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,620
Then we'll introduce him right away!

216
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,120
- When he does, everything hits the jackpot.
- Jackpot!

217
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,550
He's very handsome.

218
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,720
- And he's good at acting!
- Method acting.

219
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,830
And his personality is great, too!

220
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,000
Actor Kang Seo Joon!

221
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,650
It's nice to meet you.

222
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,840
- You brighten up the studio!
- Thank you! But the studio was bright already.

223
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,090
- He's really handsome! A total celebrity!
- He's very humble, too!

224
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,380
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you for having me.

225
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,980
- Let me say hello to the viewers.
- Yes! Please say hello.

226
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,000
Hello, everyone. As you know, I'm Kang Seo Joon. I'm happy to meet you!

227
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,180
Welcome!

228
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,190
Thank you so much.

229
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,600
The restaurant we are going to introduce to you today

230
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,020
is an Italian restaurant that a young owner runs by himself in the countryside.

231
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,120
I heard Kang Seo Joon has a connection with the owner here.

232
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,650
Yes. Two years ago,

233
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,740
he came out on my V-log for a minute.

234
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,180
I watched that! The egg roll kimbap!

235
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,390
Yes, you're right. The egg roll kimbap.

236
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,180
You two had great chemistry in that video.

237
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,440
Yes, we did have great chemistry.

238
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,310
It's so good to see him again.

239
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,550
Then, shall we go together right now and try the food?

240
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,450
- Shall we?
- Yes, let's go.

241
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,600
Enjoy!

242
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,970
Hello!

243
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,390
- Hello.
- Wow, this restaurant!

244
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,610
It's so pretty!

245
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,890
- I think it's a renovated Hanok.
- It's very trendy these days!

246
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,410
Shall we sit here?

247
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,730
Hello, it has been a while. Hasn't it?

248
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,050
You look very stiff. Don't be too nervous.

249
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,150
I guess he got nervous since it's been a while for him to be in front of a camera.

250
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,310
- Please relax.
- Yes, please relax.

251
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,610
And please make two dishes that you are most confident about.

252
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,990
It's nice here. I'm surprised to see this kind of restaurant in the countryside.

253
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,250
We can see a green field out from here.

254
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,980
- It's quiet and nice.
- The view is beautiful.

255
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,800
The field view.

256
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,250
You're making carbonara right now, right?

257
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,040
I really love carbonara.

258
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,810
It looks good.

259
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,620
He doesn't hesitate.

260
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,130
He's an expert.

261
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,260
And he's...

262
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,780
- a good cook.
- Is he?

263
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,370
He's got high quality if you look at his skill.

264
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,380
Carbonara and osso buco.

265
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,000
Osso buco?

266
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,640
What's osso buco?

267
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,470
What do you think, Kang Seo Joon?

268
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,830
I knew he was a good cook, but it's much better than I thought.

269
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,370
Tastes like a high-end restaurant.

270
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,540
It's delicious.

271
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,100
The food tastes perfect, but it's not marketable.

272
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:45,650
I think so, too. The menu is too difficult.

273
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,820
Have you thought of doing some fusion?

274
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,590
Like putting cheese on potato pancakes?

275
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,340
I wanted to keep the identity of an Italian restaurant.

276
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,100
An identity of an Italian restaurant?

277
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,980
First of all, the restaurant name is too hard.

278
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,440
People don't look up meanings diligently.

279
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,660
- That's right.
- I mean...

280
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,130
People have to remember it to come back. You don't know what it means, either. Right?

281
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,110
Why did you name it like that?

282
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,580
It means that I'm waiting for a guest.

283
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,600
That's right! Ti Aspetto.

284
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,980
It means waiting for someone.

285
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,940
Even though it has a good meaning, you don't remember it. It's too hard.

286
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,460
And you have to have profit in business.

287
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:46,000
As for this osso buco, it's braised veal shanks.

288
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:52,870
Not only is this unfamiliar, but it also doesn't suit a countryside village where traditional Korean food is appropriate.

289
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,340
How about giving up some of your stubborness?

290
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,390
Or go work at a hotel and forget this place.

291
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,000
Kang Seo Joon, you're being pretty harsh.

292
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,020
First, rather than ingredients that are too expensive

293
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,680
or the best-grade ingredients...

294
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,940
I wonder if it's going to be a repeat of what it was like before.

295
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,480
It's not the same as then. We're not losing anything.

296
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,790
You're right. As Se-Seo Joon said,

297
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,510
- it should help stimulate the economy in this area.
- Right.

298
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,040
But if we could help it, they shouldn't show the faces of the people in the area.

299
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,660
Just like it happened before, the cameras are here

300
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,820
and they're saying some strange things.

301
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,410
I said I'd take a look at the whole thing before it's aired. So don't worry.

302
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,800
It's not his fault, though.

303
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,050
His parents are the problem. Isn't that right?

304
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,200
I don't know about this. Geez...

305
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,780
Let's go.

306
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,590
Are you okay with today's shoot, Director?

307
00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:00,830
Yes. The shoot was fun and it went well, but...

308
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,580
Yes...

309
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:07,440
By chance, does Kang Seo Joon and Han Ji Woo not get along?

310
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,230
Why do you ask? Did something happen?

311
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,160
No. It's not that. I was just wondering...

312
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,730
I just felt it in the air.

313
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,030
Excuse me for a moment.

314
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,660
Yes?

315
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,410
Pardon? Passed the first level?

316
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,040
Mr. Han!

317
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,640
Yoo Ha, be careful! Ji Woo!

318
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,770
Hello.

319
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,840
Look at this.

320
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,100
Hey, we were going to look at it only by ourselves.

321
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,520
Who cares?

322
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,620
Look at it.

323
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,640
Seong Yoon is amazing.

324
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,250
I made this bracelet when I was 20.

325
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,400
It's very meaningful to me.

326
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,740
It's like a treasure box that stores my life from back then.

327
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,270
The shoot went well, right? You were busy today, so I spent the day with Yoo Ha.

328
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,340
I had fun!

329
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,380
We'll go now.

330
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,190
Don't get too close to the villagers.

331
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,810
You have nothing to lose by being careful.

332
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,160
No, I do.

333
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,420
- It's your mom!
- Mom!

334
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,640
Thank you so much!

335
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,220
I got so worried because Han Ji Woo was shooting today.

336
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,580
Don't mention it.

337
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,760
I had so much fun thanks to her. Right, Yoo Ha?

338
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,960
Yeah. I got to see various perspectives from various people.

339
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,750
Good night, Seong Yoon.

340
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,100
Good night.

341
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,890
Gosh, look at her acting all cutesy.

342
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:39,270
She's just like you.

343
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,380
Your interview got released today.

344
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,370
The Village Chief was telling everyone about your interview.

345
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,120
Here.

346
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,050
Do you still like that?

347
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,570
Of course. There are no better cookies than these.

348
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,370
Han Ji Woo doesn't like those. Did you know that?

349
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,410
He doesn't like sweets.

350
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,950
His taste in food could've changed, too.

351
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,840
I'll recommend you a route to your home.

352
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,120
Do you remember this?

353
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,250
It used to be our favorite cookie.

354
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,790
The kids used to tease us.

355
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,050
But I heard you don't like sweets.

356
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:09,280
It's not that I don't like them, I just...

357
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,810
You can be honest with me. We're not in a relationship now.

358
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,510
Unlike when we were in high school, now that we're grownups,

359
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,050
I couldn't meet people unless I reached out to them.

360
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,360
Actually, I wanted to talk to you a lot after I got here, too.

361
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,700
I asked you to meet me using my interview as an excuse.

362
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,580
I thought I should tell you about the bracelet.

363
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,400
By chance...

364
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,480
do you remember what I told you right before we broke up?

365
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,000
The last text you sent me?

366
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,350
Yeah.

367
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,190
Yeah.

368
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,360
I remember.

369
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,200
You said not to forget you until I was happy.

370
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,160
You said you'd wish for my misery for the rest of my life.

371
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,750
You do remember everything.

372
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,160
I'm really sorry about that. I must've been crazy.

373
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,020
I regretted that right away. I'm so sorry.

374
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:31,420
I said so many terrible things. That, too...

375
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,580
I'm sorry.

376
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,760
I'll sincerely apologize at this time.

377
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,700
It's okay.

378
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,060
That could happen. I understand.

379
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:55,600
Even though someone is by my side, there are times I need someone else.

380
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,100
Back then, you know...

381
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:13,420
because you were always by my side,

382
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,080
I wasn't lonely, I felt warmth...

383
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,370
I was well.

384
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:25,990
While I was dating you, I was able to focus on cooking.

385
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,800
I think I owe it all to you.

386
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,360
Thanks.

387
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,390
And...

388
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,940
I couldn't be like that for you.

389
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,070
I'm sorry.

390
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:53,300
Sorry.

391
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:06,140
I guess my heart was breaking back then.

392
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,420
You know how it is sometimes.

393
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,800
I didn't do anything right.

394
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,270
It's been bothering me all along.

395
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,720
Thanks for being understanding.

396
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,460
We're talking nine years?

397
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,390
We're just talking about something that happened more than nine years.

398
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,130
I know.

399
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,110
I've been thinking about you a lot all this time.

400
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,140
I've been...

401
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,930
thinking about you a lot, too.

402
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,210
Did you miss me, too?

403
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,080
Ji Woo also had a special love.

404
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,750
He had more heartrending love...

405
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,650
than me.

406
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:30,490
