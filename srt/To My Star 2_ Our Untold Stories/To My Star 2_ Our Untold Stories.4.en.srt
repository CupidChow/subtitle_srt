00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,120
Also, there's another thing to celebrate big time!

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,670
Everyone, don't be too surprised.

4
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,840
Okay, please come in!

5
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,820
Hello, it's nice to meet you all!

6
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,160
Kang Seo Joon came to the Dacham Village!

29
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,160
It's so weird to see someone I thought I'd never get to see in my life so often.

30
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,120
Me or Han Ji Woo?

31
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,710
Both of you.

32
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,490
This must be your hometown. Are you taking a break and going back to the States?

33
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,110
No.

34
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,580
I won't be going there again.

35
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,140
I'll stay in Korea. For the rest of my life.

36
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,150
For the rest of your life.

37
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,210
Where's your bracelet? It should be fixed by now.

38
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,920
I put it aside for a moment. Why?

39
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,010
I was wondering where I saw that bracelet.

40
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,980
I had seen it in Han Ji Woo's old picture.

41
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,880
Is it like a couple bracelet?

42
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,060
It was the first jewelry I'd ever made.

43
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,030
So, it's quite meaningful to me.

44
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,280
- I took that picture for him.
- Gosh...

45
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,000
You don't seem too talented at taking photos.

46
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,400
I'm sure there were other good pictures.

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,570
Oh, I guess you didn't see them?

48
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,690
Yes.

49
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,120
The TV commercial you mentioned last time. I heard they're highly satisfied internally.

50
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,470
Of course, I'd have to confirm the last one.

51
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,160
So, if you guys broke up,

52
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,420
isn't it a proper manner not to wear anything that's couple related?

53
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,100
As for that manner, it matters when people know it's a couple bracelet.

54
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,650
That's why I don't wear it.

55
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,660
- Kind of sort of thanks to you.
- I see.

56
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,590
It was so perfect. So I broke it at such perfect timing!

57
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,870
As expected of Kang Seo Joon. It broke just in time– Gosh...

58
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,790
Are you all right?

59
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,360
Gosh. Are you okay?

60
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,650
- If you're comfortable in English, you should continue in English with me...
- No thanks.

61
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,150
I'm perfectly comfortable right now.

62
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,420
All right then.

63
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,780
She's not easy.

64
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,320
She's a tough one.

65
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,750
I'm not following you. I'm just going my way.

66
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,510
Don't worry.

67
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,170
What a nice spacious car!

68
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,900
I feel sorry for him. He looks rich, too.

69
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,520
What the heck is that?

70
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,340
As you said,

71
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,500
I asked him to prepare some food for the party. He did a good job.

72
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,590
Right? His problem is that he gives way above and beyond when given a task.

73
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,300
Everyone here said that it was delicious.

74
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,420
You're walking too slow. We'll go ahead.

75
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,470
Please move aside.

76
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,730
Please step aside.

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,320
They should move over when there's a car coming. Geez...

78
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,180
Okay. Wow...

79
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,540
What is it now? Is he playing around in someone else's front yard?

80
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,990
Hey, you're here.

81
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,430
Chief says this is the perfect spot.

82
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,120
That's right. He's your friend.

83
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,080
I already talked to Mr. Lee at the real estate office and the owner.

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,810
Go in and do what you need to do. Let's respect each other's privacy.

85
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,260
- Top Star, show me around.
- Oh, shall we?

86
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,630
- If you look inside, it's the latest model.
- Okay.

87
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,920
Let's go in, Yoo Ha.

88
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,050
The SBC variety show, "I Want to Take a Break."

89
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,500
We'll look into why restaurants in the countryside have gone out of business.

90
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,750
- So what neighborhood are we in today?
- Actually, I wanted to go inside of that, too.

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,100
- It looked nice.
- My goodness...

92
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,560
Is it because he's rich?

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,390
Anyway, Han Ji Woo... he must have a headache.

94
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,370
No. Did he save the nation in his previous life?

95
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,150
What are you saying? What are you going to wear tomorrow, Mom?

96
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,560
You know...

97
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,950
The pink blouse I bought last time and a black skirt. What do you think?

98
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,540
Dressed up subtly.

99
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,430
Fine. Wear whatever you want.

100
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,180
You know, it'd be bad if I'm too pretty. Don't you think?

101
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,320
Come on. Just come on time.

102
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,050
It's at 1:00 p.m. Tie my hair up for me tomorrow, too.

103
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,800
I got it. I already set it all up.

104
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,920
They'll let me go even if I don't take the afternoon off. Isn't that good?

105
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,960
Really?

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,700
That's right, my daughter!

107
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,000
What are you watching?

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,360
I have to watch my drama now.

109
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:14,100
Give me the remote control! The remote!

110
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,000
So cold.

111
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,530
What? Is something the matter?

112
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,490
Open the door.

113
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,870
What?

114
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,720
Are you really going to stay here like this?

115
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,870
As you can see, it's pleasant.

116
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,880
If you can't sleep out of worry for me, I'll oblige and sleep in your house.

117
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm going to live here for the rest of my life.

118
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,390
I'll be fine here alone without any worries.

119
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,130
So, don't interfere.

120
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm just borrowing your front yard. What do you mean interfere? Don't overreact.

121
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,880
Okay.

122
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
Do everything you want to do before you go.

123
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,090
Though I don't know how long you'll last.

124
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,580
Yeah, right! Like you'll live a good life like this!

125
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:45,250
♫ Are you ready to face all the things we regret ♫

126

135
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,850
- Mom!
- I'll be back! See you later!

136
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,570
Split your hair in three parts.

137
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,970
It's better if they're the same amount.

138
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,900
Calmly, the part that is furthest to the right...

139
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,830
Something simple. Give me something like Caprese salad.

140
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,770
We're neighbors. You can afford to give me a meal.

141
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,810
Did you get in trouble?

142
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,490
What are you talking about?

143
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,130
It's not just once or twice.

144
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:40,390
You're not working and you continue to stay here.

145
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,510
I was wondering if there were more articles to be published.

146
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,240
I slept so well last night. First time in a year.

147
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,930
Make me some food. I want to enjoy food for the first time in a year, too.

148
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,710
I don't want to. I'm out of ingredients.

149
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,210
You don't even have customers. What do you mean, out of ingredients?

150
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,360
I guess you had no problem eating, sleeping, and living well.

151
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,180
But not me.

152
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,920
I came here so I can live. So what?

153
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,100
Give me some time. That's not hard to do.

154
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,950
He drove four hours in the middle of the night and drove another four hours back?

155
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,210
What kind of joke is that? How can he act in that condition?

156
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,300
Hey, Baek Ho Min, tell me. Can he act well?

157
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,050
Can he act with the right feelings?

158
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,060
His acting was good.

159
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,210
- His condition looked great.
- What?

160
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,950
How was his mood?

161
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:39,750
He seemed better than before.

162
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,010
What a pervert. Right? He has to be a pervert.

163
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,650
Why does he like being treated badly?

164
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,250
You know how he has to get something out of his system if he's curious about it.

165
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,230
- Is it because Han Ji Woo is by his side?

I just wonder if his illness is going to get worse at this rate.

168
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,590
He doesn't take medicine anymore and is better now.

169
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,050
So, why are you so cold with me?

170
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:25,800
I'm your ex just like her. So why are you cold with me, but not her?

171
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,300
Do you still have lingering feelings for me or for her?

172

You keep bringing up uncomfortable converstion like this all the time.

Okay, then I won't.

Okay?

175

It's a day for parents to observe class today, but I couldn't make it because the county mayor came by out of the blue.

181
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,960
I was wondering if Yoo Ha is upset. Could you go to the school to get her, by chance?

I heard something about Ongshimi (sushi) here.

Correct. This place is famous for Ongshimi and gnocchi.

What do you want, really?

Nothing, but what school like this has no students?

198

Because it's in a rural area.

00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,960
- What?
- I just got a text that they found Yoo Ha.

320
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,460
She was at home the whole time.

321
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,920
That's a relief.

322
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,730
How can you have no emotions at a moment like this, too?

323
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,240
You're amazing, indeed.

324
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,510
Everything is relative.

325
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:30,020
If you didn't act like that, I would've been like you.

326
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,830
You are good at words.

327
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,170
Let's sit here for a bit.

328
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,210
I'm tired.

329
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,610
How can you be...

330
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,360
so honest with everything?

331
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,050
Because of it, I can't ignore you.

334
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,690
♫  The dark night sky that's like my heart  ♫

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:55,670
♫  And you are still there  ♫

♫  The reason why I am waiting for you  ♫

♫  Even if the morning comes  ♫

Should I stay like this?

344
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,910
Do you want it?

345
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,080
♫  How can I express everything in words?  ♫

346
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,980
What kind of twist of fate is this?

347
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,280
Hello.

348
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,940
Are you the Owner Han Ji Woo?

349
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,560
Good luck with your work, and I'll hang up now.

350
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,550
Let's say you have an American mindset.

351
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,350
But what about Han Ji Woo? Did he learn the Italian mindset while learning how to cook?

352
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,580
Then what do you think about ghosting and breakup?

353
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,820
Why? What's wrong with ghosting? I should be the heartbroken one.

354
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,050
The one who loves more endures more

355
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,430
and adjusts more.

356
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:41,360
♫  I want to have a sweet and deep dream with you  ♫

♫  Can I love you?  ♫
