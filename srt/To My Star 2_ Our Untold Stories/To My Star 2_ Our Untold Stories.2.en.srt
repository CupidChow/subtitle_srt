1
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:11,100
[To My Star 2]

2
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,960
Who are you? Why are you calling him dad?

3
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,510
Are you really his daughter?

4
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,270
- Mister, who are you?
- Mister...

5
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,120
We live next door. But we are friends with Han Ji Woo.

6
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,250
We just stay close to each other.

7
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,090
You don't have to explain it to him.

8
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
I think I can't come over tonight.

9
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,730
You two should hang out without me.

10
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,520
Okay.

11
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,970
You shouldn't call anybody a dad.

12
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,890
Somebody can be shocked when they hear it.

13
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,860
I don't have a dad. Also, we have the same last name.

14
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,190
Han Yoo Ha, stop it!

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,180
It's nice meeting you.

16
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,520
I'm leaving.

17
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,700
It's cold. Let's go inside.

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,120
- Let's eat first and talk. I didn't eat anything today.
- Don't do this.

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,780
We are not in any relationship to do so.

20
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,840
We are not in any relationship to do so?

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,630
Who says?

22
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,530
You left me by leaving a note.

23
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,880
But how can you decide that we are not in any relationship to do so?

24
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,850
Dad had a strange expression on his face.

25
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,760
Come on. I told you not to call him "dad."

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,150
I can't find anyone better than him. That's why.

27
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,140
Seriously, who do you take after, huh?

28
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,360
But it's fascinating. I wonder how they know each other.

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,290
How do you know him? You said you're not classmates.

30
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,640
Don't you know top star Kang Seo Joon? One of his lines is...

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,020
"If you struggle, I'll be there."

32
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,990
Don't you know this?

33
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,320
If there was someone like him among our countryside neighborhood...

34
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,190
It would've been crazy!

35
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,830
I would've just...

36
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,280
I would've just, you know?

37
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,850
I'm saying it would've been something to boast about all over town, you know.

38
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,060
Eat this.

39
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,730
You are living very well.

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,650
If you have something to say, say it quickly and go.

41
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,220
How can you do this to me?

42
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,250
How can you just disappear after leaving a note saying, "Let's end it here?"

43
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,270
It was even on my birthday.

44
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,220
Do you know how frustrated I was all this time?

45
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,570
I almost reported you missing.

46
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,700
And in the house we moved into because of you,

47
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,320
- without you, alone for a year–
- So...

48
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,880
do you want to hear an apology from me?

49
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,310
You could be mindful of proper manners with me, at the least.

50
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,240
I don't think I did anything wrong to you

51
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,700
so as to be treated by you like this.

52
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,630
You woke me up in the early morning hours because you came home, then.

53
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,260
Once you start shooting a drama, you become overly sensitive in everything from your food to sleeping habits.

54
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,710
We can't even take a walk outside just because you're a celebrity. I don't like that, either.

55
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,050
If you ever got a blemish on your face, it was such a hassle for me to squeeze it out.

56
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,640
Especially...

57
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:42,050
the sound of you grinding your teeth in your sleep. That was unbearable.

58
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,600
Got it? Had I kindly written down all the reasons,

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I guess you wouldn't have come looking for me.

60
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,460
I didn't learn manners. So I made a mistake.

61
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,180
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,640
You sure hit a blow.

63
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,990
As if you were all prepared.

64
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,120
So did you come this far because you didn't like all those things?

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,130
Don't be mistaken.

66
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,300
I just returned.

67
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,670
Fine.

68
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,790
I'm glad you came back.

69
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,180
What's this?

70
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,190
What about it?

71
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,680
It's mine. Why didn't you toss it?

72
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,480
Why should I toss it?

73
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,900
You don't care, do you?

74
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,370
That's right. Then you don't care if it's gone. Right?

75
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,940
I'll take it.

76
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
Since it was mine, to begin with.

77
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,340
All right.

78
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,580
How about your ring?

79
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,340
Did you throw it away?

80
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,700
Yeah.

81
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,400
Do you know how much...

82
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,150
You should've sold it. Why throw it away?

83
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,180
Where did you toss it?

84
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,860
In the mountain.

85
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,970
♫ Winter wind, it blows across my face ♫

86
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,010
♫ And I'm so lonely ♫

87
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,280
♫ It's been this way for an eternity ♫

88
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,550
♫ You see ♫

89
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,890
Oh, this restaurant?

90
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,060
They open pretty early every morning.

91
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,210
Hey, good morning!

92
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,180
You should've told me sooner if you had such a great friend like him.

93
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,220
Well, he's not so well-mannered...

94
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,170
- Village Chief, what would you like to eat?
- Oh, yes...

95
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,500
But I have no idea what this is talking about.

96
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,420
I need something for my hangover.

97
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,340
That sounds great. Something for a hangover.

98
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,950
We drank some makgeolli last night.
(T/N: raw rice wine)

99
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,830
I was starving last night, and you gave me some makgeolli and pancakes.

100
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,660
See, see, see? There are reasons why some people succeed.

101
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,130
- You have a great personality.
- Gosh.

102
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,580
I had so much fun last night, thanks to you.

103
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,390
I feel so refreshed after going to the spa this morning, too.

104
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,610
I thought you were friends. Why did you let him go in the middle of the night?

105
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,070
Do you know how far Seoul is from here?

106
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,100
What are you doing? Hangover soup.

107
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,880
Make it two hangover soups.

108
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
- It was fun last night, huh?
- I had so much fun.

109
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,430
Wow, it must be ready.

110
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,950
I smell it. I smell it.

111
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,520
Let's see.

112
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,910
It's called Goulash. It's spicy Hungarian stew. It's soup.

113
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,380
I don't see oysters.
(T/N: Sounds like Goulash in Korean)

114
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,350
- Oh, there are no oysters. There's beef, onions, wine–
- Wine?

115
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,440
I told you I want something to relieve my hangover.

116
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,950
Chief, I've had this before. It's similar to our hangover soup. It's good.

117
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,300
Try it.

118
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,620
And is there anything else you want?

119
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,190
Order whatever you want. I'm indebted to you, so I'll pay you back.

120
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,070
Gosh! No, no, it's okay.

121
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,170
Shall I try it then?

122
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,570
It's delicious. How neat.

123
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,070
Right? It's refreshing, isn't it? He's not all that friendly, but

124
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,820
he's a good cook. Please come here often.

125
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,390
All right. All right. Since he's our top star Seo Joon's friend.

126
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,270
Let's eat.

127
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,360
What are you doing? Was it for free?

128
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,150
I was exhausted yesterday after my shoot,

129
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,850
so I couldn't drive all night to go home.

130
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,660
No matter how much you hate me, you wouldn't want me to get into an accident.

131
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,890
How about you change the name of your restaurant?

132
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,490
I don't think anyone would know what it's saying.

133
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,400
- My top star, thank you for the meal.
- Gosh...

134
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,300
I'm the one who enjoyed the meal, thanks to you. You liked it, right?

135
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,630
We really broke up now.

136
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,940
Hi!

137
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,410
Han Yoo Ha.

138
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,290
- How was school?
- Good.

139
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,700
By chance, did you sell goulash today?

140
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Yeah. How did you know?

141
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,650
There's a rumor all over the place. That you served him something weird without oysters.

142
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,090
Really?

143
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,700
But he said it was good.

144
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,490
Chief said that Kang Seo Joon was here

145
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,200
and the villagers were going crazy asking if it was true.

146
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,500
She scared me. The granny is back.

147
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,630
It's the end of the world.

148
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,560
Everyone is busy taking care of their own stuff.

149
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,250
No one cares...

150
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,580
And no one is around here.

151
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,190
A phone call?

152
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,700
Ti Aspetto.

153
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,510
It's me.

154
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:02,740
I didn't have a chance to ask you this because I was so stunned.

155
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,500
Do you still stay in touch with Kim Hyung Ki?

156
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,110
Never mind.

157
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,210
I guess it's none of my business. Forget it.

158
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,010
We broke up, you know.

159
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,900
So take all your things with you.

160
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,930
So I don't see any trace of you.

161
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,040
Throw it away.

162
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm Kang Seo Joon.

163
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,510
What if someone sees me throwing out my ex-boyfriend's things?

164
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,410
- Take them as soon as you can.
- I don't care what you do.

165
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,440
It's me. Hurry up and take it.

166
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,420
Oh, thank you! Goodbye!

167
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:44,270
Take it. You have so many things, now that I've packed them up.

168
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,520
Stop...

169
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,910
Stop it already!

170
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,240
Please don't be so clingy.

171
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,630
Don't you have a pride?

172
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,900
Cut! Okay!

173
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,400
Take them right now.

174
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,150
I heard he kept calling you.

175
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,130
I don't keep secrets from my mom.

176
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,580
Did something happen in Seoul?

177
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,990
The fact that you came here so suddenly means...

178
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,630
Nothing.

179
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,490
It's nothing.

180
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,380
Dad, you tend to avoid things.

181
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,460
You little thing. You're such a know-it-all!

182
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,580
Come on.

183
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,680
The village elders were so excited, saying a top star had stopped by.

184
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,790
It could be a good thing, you know.

185
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,750
They might be nicer to you, thanks to the top star.

186
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,590
Our friend Seo Joon...

187
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,660
said to have you come to Seoul to take care of things.

188
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,960
I guess he couldn't reach you?

189
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,860
I've never seen you answer satisfactorily!

190
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,850
Gosh, so frustrating. So frustrating.

191
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,530
You see that? I'm right.

192
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,240
- I'm sure he borrowed money from that celebrity.
- Don't make excuses

193
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,000
go to Seoul tomorrow. Got it?

194
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,630
Cut, okay!

195
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,230
Let's do the next setting.

196
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,990
Have some water.

197
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,790
You worked so hard.

198
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,900
Really, thank you so much.

199
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,390
I'll change my clothes. You can go out first.

200
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,720
Let's go outside.

201
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,590
Let's go.

202
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,080
Since you are here, why don't you watch my shoot, too?

203
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,670
It's okay. I should go.

204
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:49,370
It'll be my time to express my charm.

205
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,460
I see you all the time at home.

206
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,930
That's true.

207
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,540
But...

208
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,760
There's nobody here. Shall we kiss just once?

209
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,410
Stop it.

210
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,480
Wait, be quiet.

211
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,770
We can do it quietly.

212
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,280
Come over here!

213
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,420
There's a surveillance camera here. This is dangerous.

214
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,710
I'm fine with it.

215
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,690
I don't have any energy right now.

216
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,650
Hurry up.

217
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,970
And give me some energy.

218
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,540
Can't we do this at home?

219
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,560
You must be tired.

220
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,730
But where's Ho Min?

221
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,410
He went to abduct someone.

222
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,020
I wasn't going to tell you.

223
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,630
I'm sorry.

224
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,550
It's okay.

225
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,820
I was going to wire transfer it, but I wanted to apologize for the last time as well.

226
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,600
Don't ever do that again.

227
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,650
But did everyone come out just to receive this?

228
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,830
I thought it would be good enough for me to apologize to Han Ji Woo and Kang Seo Joon.

229
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,350
We came out instead of Seo Joon!

230
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,190
I don't know if you know about this.

231
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,670
But Ji Woo and Seo Joon are not in a relationship to be here together.

232
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:46,500
By the way, Ji Woo, how can you cut off all contact and leave so far away?

233
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,290
Do you know how hard it was for me to find you?

234
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,010
It's just because...

235
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,620
that was where I used to live when my parents were alive.

236
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,210
How's your restaurant?

237
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,570
What are you going to do now?

238
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,610
I'm now back to the rich life.

239
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,590
I should enjoy it.

240
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,640
You are making us, non-rich people, feel bad.

241
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,600
I'll go back to Italy and try new things while resting.

242
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:33,610
I'll get going. We are not in a relationship to chat about our lives.

243
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,350
I'll get going.

244
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,240
Finally, I'm seeing your face. I was wondering about you.

245
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,740
You two can go, right? I have work to do.

246
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,150
I can go by myself to pick up my stuff.

247
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,410
Bro told me a strange man shouldn't go into his place when he's not at home.

248
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,810
So he told me to bring you to him first.

249
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,110
- Team Leader, I wore it like you today.
- What?

250
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,310
Setting up some sets and wearing them. I think it's a great idea.

251
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,940
Right? It saves you time and is convenient.

252
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,030
Exactly.

253
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:15,130
I'm going to buy a couple of good clothes and wear them only.

254
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,750
We'll start shooting in five minutes. Get ready, please!

255
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,660
Team Leader.

256
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,030
Come inside.

257
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,460
- Ho Min!
- Excuse me one second.

258
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,340
Ji Woo.

259
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,160
Do you know each other?

260
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,430
Yes.

261
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,890
Since when?

262
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,680
Didn't you come from America? That's what I heard.

263
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,550
I studied abroad in America.

264
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,170
I'll wait until you finish.

265
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,830
You said let's go together.

266
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:25,000
[Epilogue]

267
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,430
When you are angry or embarrassed and don't want to talk, you start organizing.

268
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,210
Do I?

269
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,360
Yes, you do.

270
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,350
I'm not mad.

271
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:17,390
Don't lie to me. You are angry right now.

272
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,140
I mean...

273
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,790
I-Is it so hard to hang...

274
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:42,180
your clothes in the same direction?

275
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,480
I'm not angry about that. I can fix it, too!

276
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,600
But... I'm saying this because it's not just once.

277
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,910
You can adjust that on your own.

278
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,270
What is it?

279
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,070
I'm saying I'm sorry.

280
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,080
Stop it.

281
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,550
I'm sorry!

282
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,660
- Stop.
- Oh, please!

283
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,610
Stop it.

284
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,520
Please feel better.

285
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,940
- I said, stop it.
- You feel better now, don't you?

286
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,140
- I don't know.
- You just smiled, didn't you?

287
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,260
- So are you going to do that or not?
- I won't do that again.

288
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,220
- Really?
- I won't do it again!

289
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,870
If you do it again, I won't stand it.

290
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,210
I won't do it.

[To My Star 2]

292
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,610
[NEXT EPISODE]
Have you been well?

293
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,700
The village is small, but a lot of different occupations came out of it.

294
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,560
You said you guys already saw each other. Then I don't have to say much, right?

295
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,410
What's their relationship?

296
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,590
I think they knew each other from childhood in Haseong. And they...

297
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,060
- Okay, don't tell me more.
- Throw that out.

298
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,440
If that's the case, you take it and throw it out on your own.

299
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,810
Do it professionally.

300
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,450
I'm going to just work from now on. Get all the work for me.

301
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,620
I'm only going to work. I'm a worker ant!

302
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,380
Bring the tear stick!

303
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,780
I said bring the tear stick. You heard it, right, Ho Min?

304
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,170
You look like you couldn't sleep.

305
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:18,950
Are you really going to leave like this?
