Do you know each other?

3
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,810
Yes.

4
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,210
Since when?

5
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,350
Didn't you say you saw him in America?

6
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,950
I studied abroad in America—

I'll wait for you to finish.

8
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,040
You said for us to go together.

9
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,060
You've been well, right?

10
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,110
I heard about you from Da Kyung sometimes.

11
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,960
I still stay in touch with Da Kyung.

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,790
I don't know if you were curious, but I told her not to tell you about me.

13
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,980
It's not like we broke up peacefully or anything.

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,340
You don't speak in dialect anymore.

15
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,510
English is comfortable for me now.

16
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,470
I heard you're close to Yoo Ha.

17
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,380
I'll finally meet her. We had just called each other a lot.

18
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,390
Yoo Ha will like to see you.

19
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,590
Really?

20
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,820
It's a relief I saw you first.

21
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,430
Even though it was a bit abrupt.

22
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,350
It might have been more awkward if we met again in Haseong.

23
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,370
Once I move to the Korean headquarters, I can take two months' leave.

24
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,300
I'm planning to spend it in Haseong.

25
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,110
The chief asked me to tutor his kids, and you, Yoo Ha, and Da Kyung are there, too.

26
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,000
It's the place where I have the most memories.

What's their relationship?

29
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,240
From what I've heard, they've been close since they were in Haseong.

30

- And they—
- Don't say any more.

Thank you.

35
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,310

37

See you again. I'll text you.

Why? Do you not like it?

This is a bit burdensome for me to accept.

That's right. I don't think either of us was wrong.

For the village's harmony and unification,

167
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,350
why don't you prepare the village festival this time?

168
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,810
That's right.

169
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:12,100
People will throw a feast to celebrate Seong Yoon return.

170
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,850
Why? Do you not want to do it?

171
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,110
No, I'll do my best.

172
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,520
All right.

173
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,980
Here. This is the money for ingredients.

174
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,610
- Thank you.
- Sure.

175
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,240
Do they think this joke of money will be enough?

176
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,980
It's okay.

177
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,250
Grandma Kim likes potato pancakes.

178
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,770
Shall I make potato pancakes as well?

179
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,050
Of course!

180
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,750
Okay.

181
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,850
Did you come home late last night after going to Seoul?

182
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,280
You look tired.

183
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,540
I didn't come home late.

184
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,460
But you look like you didn't sleep enough.

185
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,690
My daughter!

186
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,780
Your mom is here!

187
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,760
That town office work,

188
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,050
are you the only one who works over there?

189
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,640
The overtime pay is great!

190
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,170
Also, I must work harder beforehand if I want to attend your open class.

191
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,930
Did she do her homework?

192
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,740
I heard you two already met!

193
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,170
Then I don't have to say much, right?

194
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,440
Hello, Auntie. It's our first time seeing you in person after only seeing on video calls.

195
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,530
Hello! It's so good to see you, Yoo Ha!

196
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,940
Ta-da! This is a present for you.

197
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,460
I don't know if you'll like it.

198
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,030
It's so cute!

199
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,030
Should we have dinner all together after closing the shop? She's staying over at my place tonight and leaving tomorrow.

200
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,150
I have to prepare the food for the feast.

201
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,320
But that's next week.

202
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,350
I have to prepare it in advance, still.

203
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,930
Do you want me to help you with that? I have nothing to do now.

204
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,030
Both of you are making everyone awkward as well.

205
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,570
Why don't you wear your backpack? Let's go home, Yoo Ha.

206
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,390
Let's go, let's go.

207
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,420
Are you not coming with us? Come.

208
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,700
Open the door carefully!

209
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,560
Bye. I'll see you tomorrow!

210
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,080
I'm here!

211
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,340
Unni!

212
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,460
Why do you have something on your face already?

213
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,710
But are they really throwing this for me?

214
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:18,210
I think so. When my dad came to town, they didn't do anything for him.

215
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,940
He always gets scolded.

216
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,550
But am I doing this right?

217
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,540
Oh, shit!

218
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,600
I'll do this.

219
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,680
Why don't you go and grind some potatoes for me?

220
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,480
Okay. Yoo Ha, please pretend you didn't hear what I said earlier.

221
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,760
Don't worry.

222
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,940
I'm pretty good at cooking, though.

223
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,910
You didn't like cooking before.

224
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,760
No, I like it a lot now. I cook every meal at home.

225
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,860
But is it okay to put cheese on top of potato pancakes?

226
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,560
You are so stubborn!

227
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,810
Also, Dad, why don't you do it kindly to people with this opportunity?

228
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,620
"Hello, sir. You are so awesome!"

229
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,760
Repeat after me.

230
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,380
No, it's okay.

231
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,100
"Hello, sir. You are so awesome."

232
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,750
Just focus on cooking.

233
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,080
That's why I said I wouldn't do it.

234
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,810
Why? You were pretty good at it.

235

What is this? Is this a pizza?

237
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,120
I put some cheese and pepperonis on top of potato pancakes.

238
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,490
But if you try this, it'll be tasty...

239
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,790
I should just take off the potato pancake part and eat it.

240
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,870
Why did you play around with food so much?

241
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,480
This has some of my work in it, too!

242

Yoo Ha, you worked hard.

246
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,450
Okay, everyone!

247
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,240
Today, we have a lot to celebrate, so I asked all of you to gather.

248
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,540
Our ancestors looked after our village,

249
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,800
so every rice paddy and field was harvested great evenly.

250
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,040
Also, as you all know well,

251
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,800
the eldest grandchild of the Jeong family who made a great contribution to our village,

Ms. Jeong Seong Yoon.

256
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,070
And she came to have some rest and teach our children.

257
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,620
She came back to do a lot of great work. Please have a round of applause!

258
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,390
Yes, yes.

259
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,990
Also, there's another thing to celebrate big time!

260
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,510
Everyone, don't be too surprised.
