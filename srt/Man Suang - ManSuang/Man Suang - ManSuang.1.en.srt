1
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,416
Towards the end of King Rama III's reign,

2
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:23,416
Siamese trades with other countries
were on the rise.

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,291
Many Chinese arrived
and settled down in Siam.

4
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:29,666
The Chinese settlers formed
a community called "Tua Hia"

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,250
to help each other, but they were
usually associated with crimes

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,000
because of their conflict
with Siamese officials.

7
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,625
Three months before the end of this reign,

8
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,083
the elites formed fractions,

9
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,000
each supported their own prince.

10
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,791
Their attempts to get arms from Europe
was considered high treason.

11
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,416
This movie is
from the creators' imagination.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,416
All names, incidents,
and places are fictional

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,500
No identification with actual persons.

14
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,000
PAET RIU, SIAM, 1851

15
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,666
LAST YEAR OF KING RAMA III'S REIGN

16
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,333
Here, your reward.

17
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,958
Such a beautiful dance.

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,041
Khem, your moves caught my eyes.

19
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,583
If you serve me well,

20
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:08,708
I'll let you perform for my uncle,

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,708
His Lordship Phraya Bodisorn.

22
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,416
What say you,

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,208
handsome Paet Riu fella?

24
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,166
Hey!

25
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,250
Wan!

26
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,708
Muen!

27
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,791
Oh, no!

28
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,875
Khem!

29
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:39,833
Muen! Sir!

30
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,416
-Help me!
-Muen! Sir!

31
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,166
Hey!

32
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,291
Wan!

33
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,333
We're buggered!

34
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,916
What the hell did you do?

35
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,333
I tried to stop the bleeding.

36
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,250
Bloody idiot!

37
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:17,625
MANSUANG

38
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,500
SAM PHENG, BANGKOK

39
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,041
Your mission is to approach
Cheng and Wichien.

40
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,791
But if you make a mistake

41
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,791
and get caught,

42
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,958
just give up you life.

43
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,916
Because even if you can escape,

44
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,625
you will be killed anyway.

45
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,750
No citizen number tattoos.

46
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,333
You thought you wouldn't be arrested?

47
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,500
You were caught red-handed
next to my nephew's body.

48
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,541
We were just trying to help him.

49
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,833
Should we be arrested for that?

50
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,166
No one saw us

51
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,166
kill him with their own eyes.

52
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,708
You have no eyewitness.

53
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,625
How can you prove that?

54
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,833
I believe in the truth.

55
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,291
The truth?

56
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:47,958
Whose truth?

57
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,041
Your truth?

58
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,625
Who would believe you?

59
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:03,000
But a good deed
can be exchanged for a full pardon.

60
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,250
I will give you a chance

61
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,250
to carry out an important mission
for the country.

62
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,500
But if it's not successful,

63
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,583
you will be punished

64
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,750
for murdering Muen Kijraksa.

65
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,291
The mission is to find evidence

66
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,541
to convict the rebels at ManSuang.

67
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,375
Hello!

68
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,291
If you're finished, come down.
Other groups are waiting.

69
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,208
Hey!

70
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,208
Hey!

71
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,875
Don't get distracted, keep going!

72
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,125
Khem!

73
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,541
Khem!

74
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,291
Aunt Joo,

75
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,333
take these two to Thongmak.

76
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,416
Then take them to Madam Phikul.

77
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,041
Jaeng,

78
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,458
go eat something before you leave.

79
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,916
Yes, Young Master Hong.

80
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,958
Take this.

81
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,666
Scrub your body with it.

82
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,208
Let me see your teeth.

83
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,333
Take this twig and brush
the betel nut stains off your teeth.

84
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,458
-Let him finish scrubbing first.
-Fine.

85
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,500
Are my teeth white already?

86
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,041
Not yet. Right there.

87
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,416
Here?

88
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,166
Here?

89
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,000
Higher.

90
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,791
Wan!

91
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,208
Wan!

92
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,083
Wan!

93
00:11:58,791 --> 00:11:59,625
Hey!

94
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,041
Wan!

95
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,583
Wan!

96
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,625
Wan!

97
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,708
Do you feel better now?

98
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:16,750
An immense change is about
to happen in this reign.

99
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:20,833
Phraya Wichiendej of the Harbor Department

100
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,833
has joined hands with Master Cheng,

101
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,458
the owner of ManSuang.

102
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,958
They traffic weapons from Europe

103
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,500
in preparation for the revolt.

104
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,583
Khun Suthinborirak,
the Harbor Department's registrar,

105
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,875
is a broker negotiating
on behalf of the arms dealers.

106
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,000
They have weapons

107
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,875
and the Chinese gangsters
"Tua Hia" as backup.

108
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,333
The rebels can take action soon,
at any time.

109
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,708
And last month

110
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,000
Khun Suthin, European dealers' henchman,

111
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,750
was found dead near ManSuang.

112
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,000
I sent my men to search his residence,

113
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,250
but found no document.

114
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,791
It's possible Master Cheng

115
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,708
and Phraya Wichiendej

116
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,500
lured him out

117
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,500
to deliver the document
before getting rid of him.

118
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,000
I want you to infiltrate ManSuang

119
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,750
and find the contract document they stole

120
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,000
to expose those rebels
before it's too late.

121
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,708
When you get to work at ManSuang,

122
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,125
you can access all areas.

123
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,291
No one would be concerned.

124
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,041
But don't forget that people in ManSuang

125
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,000
who betray our country,

126
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,166
are hiding themselves there too.

127
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,583
You need to be careful.

128
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,708
Don't get caught.

129
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,291
We have done nothing wrong.

130
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,416
Why do we need to risk our lives?

131
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,625
Or you will look for that Chinaman
who you claimed killed my nephew?

132
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,083
If you choose to go to ManSuang,

133
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,875
I'll have you disguised

134
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,083
as a part of the dance troupe.

135
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,541
You can continue to dance on stage

136
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,041
without having to sacrifice yourselves.

137
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,208
And if successful,

138
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,166
you'll be rewarded with money

139
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,458
and a position
in the Royal Performing Arts Department.

140
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,250
What say you?

141
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,708
-Who?
-I don't know.

142
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,750
Bugger off!

143
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,041
Go bugger yourself!

144
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,250
Ungrateful dunce. Go back to China.

145
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,458
This is the last time I help you.

146
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,708
Never again.

147
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,625
Bow to Master Cheng now, you bastard!

148
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,666
Or get your throat slit!

149
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,166
Thank you, Master!

150
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,208
Go!

151
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,166
Go!

152
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,458
Your sleeping quarters are over there.

153
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,916
I'm Khem.

154
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,791
What's your name?

155
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,375
Chatra.

156
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:34,916
Want some?

157
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,000
Do the curved arm.

158
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,833
Not good. Practice all over again.

159
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,166
Who's your teacher?

160
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,125
I'm my own teacher, ma'am.

161
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,666
Train him to dance the male lead part.

162
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,875
Grovel and pay respect.

163
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,666
Get yourself something to drink.

164
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,875
The water jar is at the back.

165
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,458
Clean this place before getting your meal.

166
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,125
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

167
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,208
Take care of it. It's your job.

168
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,666
Fine.

169
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,166
But you see, I can take care of you too!

170
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,666
Khem!

171
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,750
Watch you mouth!

172
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,208
Thiang!

173
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,083
Go get the water.

174
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,625
As handsome as my Chatra?

175
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,416
Chatra,

176
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,333
he is a bona fide.

177
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,666
You can't tell he's in a lower class.

178
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,625
As for my handsome Khem,

179
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,791
he looks charming like Prince Inao.

180
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,791
Wan, the one who came with Khem,

181
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,000
looks cute too.

182
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,375
Look at you, Joo!

183
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,750
I want them all to myself,
Chatra, Khem and Wan.

184
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,583
Know your place.

185
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:05,500
Why?

186
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,208
You decommissioned harlot!

187
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,250
Watch your words, old hag dancer!

188
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,875
Can you spare us some of your food?

189
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:19,833
Of course! You can join us.

190
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,708
Here.

191
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,875
You two come sit and eat here.

192
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,208
Master Cheng doesn't like fishy smell.

193
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,541
Betel nut either.

194
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,708
Those things are forbidden here.

195
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:32,291
Except for Madam Phikul,

196
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,083
he allows only her to have it.

197
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,833
One more thing,

198
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,708
those girls in the whorehouse,

199
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:42,083
don't even think about
getting anywhere near them.

200
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,125
But you can always be near me.

201
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,041
Hey!

202
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,708
You rookies,

203
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,833
why are you here cajoling my wife?

204
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,625
Finish eating and hurry back
to where you belong. Go!

205
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:56,833
I agree.

206
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,958
Them?

207
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,375
I mean you!

208
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:01,833
Here.

209
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,000
Here.

210
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,291
Thanks.

211
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,208
Remember she's my wife.

212
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,083
Okay, I'm going.

213
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,333
Take heed of the geezer's warning.

214
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,208
You two living here,

215
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,250
you need to be careful.

216
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,000
If you see something, keep it to yourself.

217
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,541
ManSuang isn't like other places.

218
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,916
Madam Phikul said to take them in.

219
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Where did they come from?

220
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,541
The butcher from Sampeng
brought them here.

221
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,708
They look capable.

222
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,666
But I don't know what to do with them,

223
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,625
so I sent them to Madam Phikul.

224
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:43,500
Hong, a European merchant
came here this morning.

225
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,083
What's his business?

226
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,041
He was just selling wine.

227
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,125
But this time,

228
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,125
he brought a lot of gifts for us.

229
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,333
I'll let you handle them.

230
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,875
Here.

231
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,833
Take this too.

232
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,708
Don't open it!

233
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,041
There are some nutty snacks.

234
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,125
They will give me rash.

235
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,791
Hong, learn to handle things on your own.

236
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,875
If you keep depending on him,

237
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,875
when will you stand on your own feet?

238
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,125
Is this the right one?

239
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,041
Come!

240
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,541
Whore! Come with me!

241
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,500
Why?

242
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,166
Why can't I touch you?

243
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,083
Bloody slut!

244
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,708
I'm a person like you!

245
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,750
-What?
-Stop!

246
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:38,291
A whore like you
doesn't have any rights to stop me.

247
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,958
Or you want me to teach you how to behave!

248
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,458
Hey!

249
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,916
Nosy bastard!

250
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,916
Stop!

251
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,041
Young Master Hong,

252
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,916
this lowly lad picked a fight with me.

253
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,791
I saw it all from up there.

254
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,291
Jun, I saw you
harassing my underling first.

255
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,250
What you said can be taken

256
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,000
as a disrespect to my master.

257
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,291
You're the one

258
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:17,833
disrespecting me, Jun.

259
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,125
I apologize to you, Hong and Tiang.

260
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,458
My servant harassed your underling.

261
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:34,833
You don't need to apologize, my Lord.

262
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,083
I have never seen these two before.

263
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,625
They're our new dancers.

264
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:53,041
I promise you
they won't cause any trouble again.

265
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,125
Pay respect to Phraya Wichiendej now.

266
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,125
He is kind to you.

267
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,208
There's no need. I don't mind.

268
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,791
I'm not an arrogant person.

269
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:14,375
What's your name?

270
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:16,375
Khem, my Lord.

271
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,083
I dance the male lead part.

272
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,708
Gorgeous like Prince Inao.

273
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,583
Would I be fortunate enough

274
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:30,041
to see you dance as Prince Inao for once?

275
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:33,875
The fortune is rather mine, my Lord.

276
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:41,458
My Lord, I need a month
to train them first.

277
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,583
Of course.

278
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,291
Then next month,

279
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:52,125
I want to reserve
the whole place for a night

280
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:57,083
to see the performance
to my heart's content.

281
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:00,041
You're always welcome here.

282
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:12,875
You two, practice hard for the show.

283
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,583
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:32,875
Try to maintain this level.

285
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,333
I'm sorry!

286
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,166
My Lord,

287
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,958
we didn't find anything
at Khun Suthin's house.

288
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,750
This is the royal dance,

289
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:36,750
not some low class dance.
You mustn't improvise just as you like!

290
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,291
If you want to keep changing it,

291
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:41,458
just go and dance at the market.

292
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:47,000
And if you want
to seduce someone so badly,

293
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:50,958
you should work at Tubtim's brothel.

294
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:54,250
Don't sow your filth here,

295
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:57,166
and taint our maestros' good names.

296
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:07,250
Ma'am, you gave me a new life.

297
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,458
It was never my intention to do so.

298
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,791
I swear.

299
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,166
Remember this,

300
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:23,375
the royal dance is a high level art form.

301
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,000
You must not take it lightly.

302
00:31:27,208 --> 00:31:29,666
If you wrong the maestros,

303
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,375
your life will face endless calamities.

304
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,125
Where are you going?

305
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,333
We're home, pal.

306
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,125
Are you thirsty?

307
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,041
You did a good job today.

308
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,125
Thanks to your drumming.

309
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,708
But I got an earful from Madam Phikul.

310
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,291
Your teacher used to be the dancer

311
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,708
in the royal court of the middle reign.

312
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:36,541
You're lucky
she didn't have a heart attack

313
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:38,125
while watching you dance.

314
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,250
I'm just a lowly worthless person

315
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:46,458
who stupidly defiles the high art form
descending from Ayutthaya.

316
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,333
The old kingdom collapsed
so long ago though.

317
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,291
I must go now.

318
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,250
Thanks for today, Chatra.

319
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,375
"You did a good job today."

320
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:55,541
So Phraya Wichiendej
doesn't have that document either.

321
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,333
I believe so, my Lord.

322
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,791
Then it must be somewhere in ManSuang.

323
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,458
You need to find it fast.

324
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:08,458
Front-Palace Vice King
hasn't been appointed yet.

325
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,666
We don't know
when the new reign will begin.

326
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:16,000
If that happens before
we get the document,

327
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:19,083
it would be too late for us.

328
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:21,250
Why? It's the truth.

329
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,291
You're a disgrace.

330
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:28,125
You made pledges to
maestros' spirits to practice the art.

331
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
A man copulating with another man

332
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,416
is worse than those disgusting harlots.

333
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,583
Can you prove that?

334
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,500
Who?

335
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:43,708
Who told you I copulated with him?

336
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,541
I dare you to show yourself!

337
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,791
Only you! You bloody schmuck!

338
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,041
Khem!

339
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:02,166
You said those women are disgusting,

340
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,208
but they just try to earn a living.

341
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,791
You know what's disgusting?

342
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,916
A dickhead who has countless affairs,

343
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,458
a braggart who keeps belittling
other people!

344
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:11,375
Bugger off!

345
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:38,666
Hold him!

346
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,416
Stop!

347
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,666
Stay out of this!

348
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,208
How come you all turn into mad dogs?

349
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,958
All you do is fight.

350
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,041
You didn't even bother to think.

351
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,625
See? Now you destroyed everything.

352
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,083
If you can't give up your lowly manners,

353
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,708
then leave,

354
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:14,250
and sow your filth elsewhere.

355
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,833
And those seniors,

356
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:20,541
why do you keep picking a fight
with the rookies?

357
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,625
If you are not satisfied with living here,

358
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,708
just leave.

359
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,208
Who ripped the curtain?

360
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,750
Come forward now.

361
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,666
There are a lot of goods here.

362
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:48,791
Feel free to browse.
You can buy now and eat later.

363
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,916
You are beautiful!

364
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,333
Thank you, thank you.

365
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,333
Thank you, thank you.

366
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,291
Thank you, thank you.

367
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,166
She said thank you.

368
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,041
You say "Bo Xiang Gang" to her.

369
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,791
You're welcome.

370
00:38:18,875 --> 00:38:20,958
I will give you something.

371
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:29,208
You are a very good lad.

372
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,333
Thank you.

373
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,125
You're quite charming.

374
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:45,375
Thanks and sorry that
you have to fix the curtain with me.

375
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:48,083
I have something to tell you.

376
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,000
What?

377
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:53,583
I ripped the curtain,

378
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,708
not you.

379
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,250
Bollocks.

380
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,541
Why didn't you tell
Madam Phikul you did it?

381
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:05,041
So you could come to
the market with me like this.

382
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,500
Why did you come to ManSuang?

383
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,458
I'm from Paet Riu.

384
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,083
I'm an orphan.

385
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,708
My parents left only a piece
of cloth that wrapped me.

386
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,083
The old monk raised me.

387
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:28,583
I love dancing.

388
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:31,875
So when I was told that
I can be trained here,

389
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,958
I jumped at the chance.

390
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:35,583
And you?

391
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,791
What's your story?

392
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,750
My hometown is Songkhla.

393
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,791
My father is Chinese,
but he was born in Siam.

394
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:50,125
He was a bird nest tax collector,

395
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,458
but I didn't want to be a merchant.

396
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:57,083
I always have the beating
of the Taphon drum in my heart.

397
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:00,666
In the year of the Rooster,
the town was plagued with cholera,

398
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:03,250
and my parents died.

399
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,875
I didn't know
how to continue doing my father's job,

400
00:40:05,958 --> 00:40:08,083
so I came to ManSuang to find work.

401
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,000
You and me,

402
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,541
we're both orphans.

403
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,833
Is this all right?

404
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,166
Thanks.

405
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,958
I have a secret I want to tell you.

406
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,791
What is it this time?

407
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:50,625
This is a very important secret.

408
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,500
Can you promise me

409
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,250
that you will keep it between us?

410
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,791
Yes, I promise.

411
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,541
I came to ManSuang

412
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,500
because my father said

413
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:15,083
that there's a clue
to our ancestors' treasure trove.

414
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,500
Ancestors' treasure trove?

415
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:24,083
The treasure they carried with them
in the ship from the mainland.

416
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:26,166
Think about it.

417
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:28,166
If we find it…

418
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,125
Why are you laughing?

419
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,541
You're a dreamer.

420
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:39,458
It's a true story.

421
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,333
I didn't say it isn't true.

422
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:44,208
I understand.

423
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:48,083
Lowborns like us need to have a dream.

424
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:01,291
Have you ever flown a kite?

425
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:02,833
What?

426
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:10,250
Too much to the right. Pull to the left.

427
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,541
-Yeah. That's right.
-Yeah?

428
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,041
Right, further right.

429
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:18,583
I don't understand.

430
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:21,375
You lived in a big city,
but have never flown a kite?

431
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,125
Stop nagging.

432
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:26,875
Help.

433
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:30,833
Come on.

434
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,500
Those boys, I will teach them a lesson.

435
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,916
Help me pull it back.

436
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:37,375
Go get it!

437
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,666
Damn it!

438
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,250
We won.

439
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,833
Next time you won't win.

440
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,416
Oh, no!

441
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:08,750
I didn't think you'd know
how to climb a tree.

442
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,583
I don't know how to fly a kite,

443
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,625
but I sure know other things.

444
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:22,000
Besides Chinese,

445
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,208
what languages can you speak?

446
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,916
English.

447
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,541
Since when?

448
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,833
Since I was a child,

449
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:35,416
my family did some business
with Europeans.

450
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,208
I also have a secret.

451
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,541
The truth is…

452
00:43:56,625 --> 00:44:00,083
Phraya Bodisorn sent me to ManSuang

453
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,125
to find a secret document,

454
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,708
evidence that will help arrest the rebels.

455
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,791
Are you serious?

456
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:13,208
Yes, I am.

457
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:16,375
Even more serious than your treasure map.

458
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,000
What secret document?

459
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:20,666
A weapon dealing contract

460
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,791
written in English.

461
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:24,625
It used to be with Khun Suthinborirak,

462
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,208
but it disappeared when he was killed.

463
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,000
Don't tell me you're a servant

464
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:34,833
of Phraya Bodisorn?

465
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:35,958
No.

466
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,750
Wan and I were framed
for his nephew's death.

467
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,416
If I don't or can't find the document,

468
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,958
I'll be sent to court.

469
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:49,916
Then what's the truth?

470
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,375
You didn't kill him, right?

471
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,416
He said I didn't have the evidence.

472
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,833
Who would believe me?

473
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:57,750
If that's so,

474
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:59,916
then why don't you escape?

475
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,666
I might be able to,

476
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,833
but Wan wouldn't make it.

477
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:05,958
I can't leave him.

478
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,916
Even if I manage to escape,

479
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,208
I still can't rid myself
of being a lowborn.

480
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,583
I love dancing.

481
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,708
Every time I dance,
I feel the elegant aura exuding from me.

482
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:28,375
I feel proud of myself.

483
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,083
But no matter how good I am,

484
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:37,750
how much hard work I put in,

485
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:44,166
what people want from me is just my body.

486
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:47,541
My pretty outer shell.

487
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:48,833
That's it.

488
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:53,291
If this mission is successful,

489
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:55,125
I will be given a title

490
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:58,125
and honor.

491
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
No longer a bloody lowborn
everyone looks down upon.

492
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,583
But if I give up now,

493
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,541
nothing will be better.

494
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,208
Why are you telling me all this?

495
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,625
I want you to help me

496
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,916
find the secret document

497
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,875
of Khun Suthinborirak.

498
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,583
And I'll help you

499
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,416
find your treasure map in return.

500
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,500
Deal.

501
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,833
I have something to tell you.

502
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,666
I invited Chatra to join our mission.

503
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,333
-Are you crazy?
-Why do you have to shout?

504
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,250
That Tapone drummer?

505
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:16,291
He is clearly a Chink. Look at his face.

506
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,541
He might be one of
the Chinese Tua Hia gangsters.

507
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:20,791
That doesn't make him a bad person.

508
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:23,166
-Maybe he killed Khun Suthin.
-Hey.

509
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,000
Nonsense.

510
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:36,791
He studied with European missionaries.

511
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:38,541
He knows English very well.

512
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:44,083
Can't we do this,

513
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:46,083
just the two of us?

514
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,375
It's almost a month
and we still have nothing.

515
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:56,666
If Phraya Wichien finds it first,

516
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,583
you and me,

517
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:01,416
we're doomed.

518
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:05,125
-I still don't trust him.
-Shut up.

519
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,708
I got it from the market today.

520
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:37,166
I will take care of him myself.

521
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,958
I felt like it was only yesterday

522
00:48:57,291 --> 00:49:00,416
that your father invited me
to run a brewery together.

523
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:03,750
We took a blood oath

524
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:09,708
that we will be brothers
and be faithful to each other forever.

525
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,791
If he's still alive,

526
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:18,083
he would be very proud of you.

527
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,208
I hope Hong will learn
as much as he can from you.

528
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:27,458
Hong is already so much better than me.

529
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:34,541
I think it's time for him
to inherit "that."

530
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:42,833
If he has you and others help him,

531
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,875
I don't need to worry anymore.

532
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,041
Don't worry, Uncle.

533
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:50,208
You know I'd do anything for ManSuang.

534
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:52,541
Good.

535
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,375
The last time Khun Suthin was seen alive

536
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:02,000
was when the ManSuang people gathered here

537
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,708
for the Chinese acrobatic opera.

538
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:06,208
Look at the stage.

539
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:11,541
We'll use this as our starting point

540
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,375
to find out who was the last person
to meet Khun Suthin.

541
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:16,458
That night,

542
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:19,291
so many people
came to see the acrobatic opera.

543
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:22,750
I was backstage.

544
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:25,000
My cue was to hand them the halberd.

545
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:27,750
Then I heard a loud bang.

546
00:50:27,833 --> 00:50:29,625
But I saw nothing.

547
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:31,291
I decided to look above

548
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:33,791
and saw the reflection on the halberd.

549
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:36,541
That's how I got to see everything.

550
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:39,375
What did Uncle Thongmak see?

551
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:41,291
Wan,

552
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,125
I think I know.

553
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,875
Looking at the reflection
from a high angle,

554
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:52,416
I saw Khun Suthin bump into a lad
holding a tray full of chips.

555
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:56,291
The chips scattered on the floor.

556
00:50:56,375 --> 00:51:01,166
Gamblers scrambled to grab them.

557
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:06,875
Khun Suthin had to avoid them

558
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:11,000
and stood there awkwardly
beside the stairs.

559
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,458
If that's so,

560
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,541
Khun Suthin would've been around there.

561
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:18,750
Hey!

562
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:20,625
Then what about Aunt Yuean?

563
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,791
It's not a human.

564
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,958
It's a ghost.

565
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,958
The ghost of a courtesan wearing
a red breast cloth staring at him.

566
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:31,458
She must have come
for Khun Suthin's spirit.

567
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,166
I didn't see the face,

568
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,333
but that night,

569
00:51:34,416 --> 00:51:38,000
none of the courtesans in ManSuang
wore a red breast cloth.

570
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,291
Wan, scoot over.

571
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:43,000
If she was there,

572
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,541
Yuean would have seen her face.

573
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,166
Are you sure

574
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,791
it's not a ghost?

575
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,791
Whether it's a person or a ghost

576
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,625
if it stood next to Khun Suthin,

577
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,083
it must have been here.

578
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,750
What about Aunt Phit?

579
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,666
She said Khun Suthin
was talking to a child?

580
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,083
What do you have to say about that?

581
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:02,375
Khun Suthin bent down.

582
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:04,375
He must have talked to
one of the servants' children.

583
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:07,250
They love to watch
the Chinese do somersaults.

584
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,458
Or maybe that night

585
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:13,250
both Khun Suthin and the lady in red
bent over to collect the chips?

586
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,041
I'm so confused right now.

587
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:17,958
Is it the ghost in the red breast cloth

588
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:19,375
or a child?

589
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:22,166
What about the tall lad
Aunt Erb told us about?

590
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:23,625
What was it?

591
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,833
I was pounding chili paste in the kitchen.

592
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,250
I briefly saw

593
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,375
Khun Suthin talking to someone.

594
00:52:29,958 --> 00:52:31,791
A tall person,

595
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,291
very tall.

596
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:39,625
Can't sleep?

597
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:40,916
What are you doing here?

598
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,583
I can't sleep

599
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:44,375
so I came out for a walk.

600
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,000
What the hell is this?

601
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,291
It's puzzling.

602
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:01,541
Khun Suthin talked to the lady in red

603
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:02,625
and a child?

604
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:03,791
He collected the chips

605
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,416
and talked to a very tall lad?

606
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:07,708
Or who was it?

607
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:10,458
All of this might be true.

608
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,458
They just saw it from different angles

609
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:14,875
at different times.

610
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:17,166
I don't think it's a ghost.

611
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:21,583
And it's unlikely that he
would bend over to collect the chips.

612
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,708
And if the man was that tall,

613
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:26,458
Uncle Thongmak would have noticed him.

614
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,791
We're only left with the lady in red.

615
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,291
She's our best shot.

616
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,750
There might be someone else who wore red

617
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:35,291
that Yuean didn't know about.

618
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:39,000
Nobody wore red that night.

619
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:43,000
Master Cheng allows us to wear red

620
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:46,416
only on auspicious days.

621
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:53,333
That night all courtesans
wore purple breast cloths,

622
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:55,291
except Tubtim.

623
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,250
She wore beige-white.

624
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,250
Just wait and see.

625
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,541
White.

626
00:54:15,875 --> 00:54:17,166
Tubtim.

627
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,833
Deeper, deeper, deeper!

628
00:54:24,166 --> 00:54:25,750
Pass me the drink.

629
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:29,958
Gently hand it over
and look into the client's eyes.

630
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,500
Good job.

631
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,708
Did you meet Khun Suthin?

632
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,041
Yes,

633
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:47,375
I met with him before he left.

634
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:49,625
What do you want to know?

635
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,583
Did he tell you something?

636
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,875
No.

637
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:56,250
Were you close with Khun Suthin?

638
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,833
You mean,

639
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,875
did I serve him in bed?

640
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,583
Khun Suthin often came to ManSuang,

641
00:55:07,666 --> 00:55:09,541
but he just wanted to chat.

642
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:11,750
He lived by himself.

643
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:14,916
He just wanted someone to talk to.

644
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,458
Did he leave you any documents?

645
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:21,416
No

646
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:27,208
If my words carry no weight,

647
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:29,041
feel free to search my room.

648
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:31,500
I don't think that's necessary.

649
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,833
With your permission.

650
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:01,750
If it's not enough,

651
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,541
you're allowed to search me.

652
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:04,833
I'll undress myself.

653
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:06,416
No need.

654
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:14,208
Thank you, Tubtim.
That's more than enough.

655
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:25,833
Wait.

656
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,166
What are you fellas trying to find?

657
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:32,083
It's an ancestral treasure map.

658
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:34,500
Chatra's grandfather
told him it's hidden here.

659
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,541
When I heard Khun Suthin
was robbed and killed here,

660
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:41,458
I thought
he might've known something about it.

661
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,458
By the way,

662
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,791
which courtesan served him that night?

663
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:53,416
If you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

664
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,625
On the night Khun Suthin was killed,

665
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,458
did you get to meet him before he died?

666
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,083
Yes,

667
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:08,125
I was the one who brought him tea.

668
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:12,000
He asked to see Master Cheng.

669
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:14,291
I told him Master Cheng wasn't there,

670
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:17,291
so he asked to see
Young Master Hong instead.

671
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:19,791
Did you inform Master Hong?

672
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:22,291
He wasn't in his room.

673
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:24,291
When I returned,

674
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:25,916
Khun Suthin was gone.

675
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:33,083
I don't know if they met or not.

676
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:37,958
I won't teach them.

677
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,833
All-female dance is a sacred art.

678
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,916
It's meant to be performed in
front of His Majesty in the palace only.

679
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,166
If I break the rules,

680
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,041
it will be a disgrace
to our spiritual maestros.

681
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:48,166
I'm unable to.

682
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,666
They secretly have this going
on everywhere these days.

683
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,541
Madam Phikul, I know you knew.

684
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,666
In that case,

685
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,500
you can go over my dead body.

686
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:27,166
What are you looking for?

687
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,666
Think carefully, Master Cheng.

688
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,583
Let's be honest with ourselves.

689
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,583
It won't be long before the new reign.

690
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:45,333
If that side wins,

691
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:48,750
those Europeans will take over our country

692
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,083
just like
how they invaded Burma right now.

693
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,833
If we don't come together and fight,

694
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:11,125
your very own people

695
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:13,291
will end up suffering.

696
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,541
I fled wars to find peace,

697
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:24,916
and to live happily on this land.

698
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,458
I built ManSuang

699
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:33,166
to be a paradise for everyone.

700
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,625
My Lord,

701
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:37,541
you can't expect me

702
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:39,416
to come up with the plan

703
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,708
that will set the whole country on fire.

704
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:45,000
I can't do that.

705
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,250
I took care of your belongings

706
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:52,125
as one friend would do for another.

707
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:57,875
Tomorrow I will return them to you.

708
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:04,166
Khem!

709
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,875
Answer me!

710
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:10,000
The truth is

711
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,250
Phraya Bodisorn…

712
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:19,500
sent me to find
Khun Suthin's secret document.

713
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:22,750
Why on earth do you think I'd have it?

714
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:26,125
Because that night,
Khun Suthin asked to meet you.

715
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:27,666
But I didn't meet him.

716
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:30,791
That night

717
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,625
I went to see Madam Phikul
prepare for the performance.

718
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:40,333
Who are you actually?

719
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:44,416
We are just lowborns.

720
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:46,500
Do you think I'm stupid?

721
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,250
Phraya Bodisorn

722
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,958
sent you two here

723
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,916
not just to spy on Phraya Wichien?

724
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:03,250
He suspects…

725
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:07,291
that weapons are being kept here,

726
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,916
where the Chinese Tua Hia gang

727
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,125
are secretly building their armed force.

728
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:16,083
How is that possible?

729
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:20,416
My father won't do such thing.

730
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,625
Master Cheng!

731
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:11,458
From now on,

732
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,000
Hong would probably be the one

733
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,583
We are just lowborns.

734
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:18,541
You're still young.

735
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:22,750
Tiang,

736
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:24,916
you should help him.

737
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:41,083
Master Cheng didn't prepare
his son to take over.

738
01:02:42,958 --> 01:02:45,625
He must have thought
he still had more time.

739
01:02:47,833 --> 01:02:49,125
Tubtim.

740
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:53,125
Have you ever thought of
leaving this place?

741
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:57,708
Why should I,
especially when you're still here?

742
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,583
I have nowhere to go.

743
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:01,583
As for you,

744
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:04,125
you're still young and beautiful.

745
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:10,333
You earned a fortune
from your late husband when he died.

746
01:03:13,708 --> 01:03:15,083
I used to believe so.

747
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:19,958
But after I was sold off
to be Khun Phra's mistress,

748
01:03:20,583 --> 01:03:21,791
I stopped believing.

749
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:27,583
Staying here is more dignified

750
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,541
than wandering outside.

751
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:35,166
Out there, whores have no dignity,
let alone be virtuous.

752
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:40,708
You're the person
who should understand me the best.

753
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:52,750
Be careful, Joo.

754
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,541
It bit me.

755
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:56,166
What a picky eater.

756
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,375
What are you doing?

757
01:03:58,458 --> 01:04:01,041
I'm trying to feed the parrot,
but it won't eat.

758
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,833
Brother.

759
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:05,875
That bird kept crying for food.

760
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:07,750
I told Joo to feed it banana,

761
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:09,375
but it kept biting her.

762
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:12,083
It seems only Uncle Cheng and I

763
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:14,250
can feed it without getting bitten.

764
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,708
It won't cry if it's not hungry.

765
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,041
Normally, it only makes noise

766
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:25,500
at 4:00.

767
01:04:26,708 --> 01:04:29,000
Uncle strictly fed it banana

768
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:31,458
at the same time every day.

769
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:37,875
My father couldn't discipline me

770
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,000
so he disciplined the parrot instead.

771
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,166
Why do you think you are in danger,
Young Master Hong?

772
01:04:47,833 --> 01:04:49,291
I don't believe

773
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,083
that my father's death was an accident.

774
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:54,166
Why?

775
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,916
The parrot didn't make any sound.

776
01:04:57,708 --> 01:04:59,000
What?

777
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:03,958
It cries at the same time everyday,

778
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,333
exactly at 4:00.

779
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:08,916
Then my father would feed it.

780
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
That day, after Master Cheng fell,

781
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:12,958
we heard the 4:00 gong.

782
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:16,291
Someone fed it before the gong went off.

783
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:19,875
To keep it quiet
when Master Cheng was murdered.

784
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,000
Had he already fed it?

785
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:23,458
No way.

786
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,375
My father was very strict about it.

787
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:30,250
There's another person

788
01:05:30,333 --> 01:05:32,166
who can feed it by hand

789
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,500
and not get bitten.

790
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,541
It's Tiang.

791
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:41,958
You think he killed your dad?

792
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:47,750
I'm not sure.

793
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
There are so many things I don't know.

794
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:55,083
I just found out
about that Chinese Tua Hia.

795
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:58,375
Their base is here, just like you said.

796
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:13,625
I got a letter saying
I have to meet them tonight at 2:00

797
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:15,625
in the secret meeting room.

798
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,458
I want you three to sneak in

799
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:27,583
to watch my back.

800
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:06,416
Let us make a pledge
to be faithful to each other.

801
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:07,958
If not, we will die,

802
01:08:08,166 --> 01:08:10,000
throat slit, like that chicken.

803
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:13,083
Let us make a pledge

804
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,375
to be faithful to each other.

805
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,291
If not, we will die,

806
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,250
throat slit, like that chicken.

807
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:51,958
You don't have to go there anymore.

808
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,500
Just keep an eye out for us
and report to me.

809
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,625
Every Chink here

810
01:08:59,791 --> 01:09:01,916
belongs to the Tua Hia gang.

811
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:03,875
Evil bastards!

812
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,166
That's fine.

813
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:07,875
Before you know it,

814
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:10,708
they will all be wiped out.

815
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,208
When the sun is out,
we should leave at once.

816
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:15,291
Where?

817
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,750
To meet Phraya Bodisorn

818
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:18,333
so he can take them down.

819
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:19,791
Calm down!

820
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,791
I'll take care of this myself.

821
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,208
Phraya Wichien didn't ask for anything
beyond your effort.

822
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,833
He just needs his people

823
01:09:40,916 --> 01:09:43,416
to infiltrate and spy
on those suspects in ManSuang.

824
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,875
If it's just only a few people,

825
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,708
I don't mind.

826
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:51,000
But he sent a dozen of them,
as if he wants to besiege this place.

827
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,958
Don't you think that's strange?

828
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:54,916
I feel like

829
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,458
we should do it for ManSuang's sake

830
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,291
and our Tua Hia brothers.

831
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,333
Phraya Wichien's prince

832
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:08,208
is about to lay claim
to this country's fortune.

833
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:10,083
If we are to side with him,

834
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:14,041
he will find a way
to support us and ManSuang.

835
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,125
Is this for ManSuang

836
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,333
or for yourself?

837
01:10:24,458 --> 01:10:27,750
They say if you don't bend,
you'll break, Hong.

838
01:10:30,333 --> 01:10:32,208
You don't understand.

839
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,708
I can bend, if I need to.

840
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,041
But I'm not stupid.

841
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,750
The Chinese Tua Hia,

842
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:57,500
they've gathered to perform a ceremony.

843
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,333
They will cause chaos soon,
I'm sure of that.

844
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:01,541
Are you going to wipe them out, my Lord?

845
01:11:02,916 --> 01:11:05,041
Have you found the document yet?

846
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:07,708
Not yet.

847
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:11,375
And what about the weapons they keep?

848
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,833
Did you find them?

849
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:16,333
Not yet.

850
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,291
You can leave now.

851
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:00,791
What does that mean?

852
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:04,041
It means "Reason."

853
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:10,416
This character,

854
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:14,083
If reversed, it means "Armor."

855
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:17,291
Father once said

856
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,833
ManSuang's leader must protect

857
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:23,625
Chinese brothers and sisters
from danger like a shield.

858
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:48,166
He's here, sir.

859
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:58,500
If I get killed,

860
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,875
my Master won't let this slide.

861
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:03,750
I'm just worried about you
and your friends.

862
01:13:03,916 --> 01:13:05,875
I want to warn you.

863
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:08,875
You could be tricked
into becoming a rebel yourself.

864
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:10,875
You're plotting the rebellion
with the Chinese

865
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,416
and collecting weapons!

866
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:19,958
Phraya Bodisorn told you that?

867
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:25,750
Wan, you're a good person.

868
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:28,875
I don't want you to be deceived.

869
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,375
Phraya Bodisorn isn't
the person you think he is.

870
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,916
True, you saw me at ManSuang,

871
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:39,416
but that's just my mission

872
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,208
to help the country defeat the Chinese.

873
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:45,208
Now, Wan,

874
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:47,041
only you

875
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:48,500
can help me.

876
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:57,458
You and your friends

877
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,250
will be safe.

878
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,750
What do you want me to do?

879
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,541
Whatever you think needs to be done.

880
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:27,458
I really don't know the true ManSuang.

881
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,375
Just like what Phraya Bodisorn said.

882
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:40,208
My father never wanted to commit treason.

883
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:43,458
But the evidence screams otherwise,
Master Hong.

884
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:45,791
It might be those things
Phraya Wichien asked him to keep.

885
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:50,250
If my father dared to commit high treason,

886
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:53,166
as his son, how wouldn't I have known?

887
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,250
I don't think you know everything.

888
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,666
This is getting worse.

889
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:00,375
I must report this to Phraya Bodisorn.

890
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:01,625
No!

891
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:06,250
We should think carefully.

892
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,208
Now that the people
involved in the incident,

893
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,750
both Khun Suthin

894
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,875
and Master Cheng, are dead.

895
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:16,250
Only Phraya Wichien is left.

896
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:20,250
I think we should investigate him first.

897
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:21,958
And who's going to do that?

898
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,666
Hong,

899
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,041
you know me so well.

900
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:43,916
Chinese food at ManSuang is unmatched.

901
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:49,791
It's an honor to serve you, my Lord.

902
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:56,041
Here, the jujube pancake.

903
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,041
It's considered a fortune dessert

904
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:01,333
as it represents wealth.

905
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:06,666
Joo.

906
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:11,625
Thank you.

907
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,083
Let's dig in, you two.

908
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:16,750
Yes, my Lord.

909
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,666
I've just worshipped
father's ancestral tablet.

910
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,625
Now I understand everything.

911
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:40,458
I thank the heavens and you, my Lord,

912
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:43,791
who will lead us Tua Hia
to greatness again.

913
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,625
The Tua Hia is lucky

914
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,416
to have you as their new leader, Hong.

915
01:16:51,916 --> 01:16:53,500
It's a shame

916
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,625
that my father never told me anything.

917
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:01,250
He might've thought
I was just an ignorant child.

918
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,666
Tiang too.

919
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:08,416
Are you going to keep it a secret
until the Europeans rule our land?

920
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,750
I heard it everywhere

921
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:13,375
that this kingdom is
sailing close to the wind.

922
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:16,083
We have both manpower

923
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,833
and weapons.

924
01:17:20,625 --> 01:17:21,916
I think

925
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,541
we should make the first move.

926
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,041
Tell me the date, we're ready.

927
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:32,833
We've been hiding in the shadows
for far too long.

928
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,458
I'm glad

929
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:47,041
that you see what your father didn't see.

930
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:50,875
When the timing is right,

931
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,625
Tua Hia will certainly help
to protect this kingdom.

932
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:00,291
In fact,

933
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:04,041
if you help Tiang

934
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:08,333
find the document on weapons dealing
before our enemy does,

935
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:12,083
it'll help us complete
our mission more easily.

936
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:17,083
Yes, my Lord.

937
01:18:18,708 --> 01:18:19,875
I…

938
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:31,208
Master Hong!

939
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,375
Hong!

940
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:34,333
Hong!

941
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:35,875
Hong!

942
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,666
Call the doctor!

943
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:39,708
Doctor Guang!

944
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:42,541
Doctor Guang, please help my brother.

945
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:44,333
Hong! Hong! Hong!

946
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:50,250
Hong!

947
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,875
Master Hong is dead.

948
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,375
Which bastard poisoned my brother?

949
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:01,250
It's not poison.

950
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:03,666
His mouth and nails didn't turn purple.

951
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,958
It's an allergy.

952
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,041
It's the nuts! He is allergic to nuts.

953
01:19:08,625 --> 01:19:11,583
ManSuang never uses nuts in our food.

954
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,375
Go get the chef!

955
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:25,708
What is this flour?

956
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:29,375
Flour made from peanuts, sir.

957
01:19:36,208 --> 01:19:38,125
Tiang, isn't that too much?

958
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:44,458
Nothing is too much for Hong.

959
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:13,666
My father

960
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:17,500
was a sworn brother with Uncle Cheng.

961
01:20:19,833 --> 01:20:21,666
When my dad became ill

962
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:23,583
and died,

963
01:20:24,458 --> 01:20:28,041
Uncle Cheng adopted me

964
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,541
and taught me how to do business

965
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:35,000
like I was his own son.

966
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:37,958
Uncle Cheng and Hong are dead now.

967
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:42,375
I feel like I've lost the will
to keep on living,

968
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:44,500
but I've told myself

969
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,125
I can't give up

970
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,208
because I have everyone here

971
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:54,375
that I have to take good care of,

972
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:56,375
just like Uncle Cheng

973
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:58,291
had taken good care of you.

974
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:01,708
After the mourning period,

975
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,458
I want everyone

976
01:21:04,541 --> 01:21:07,416
to help prepare
a grand Chinese New Year feast

977
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:10,583
for ManSuang to show our solidarity,

978
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,416
just like what my father,

979
01:21:12,625 --> 01:21:14,458
Uncle Cheng and Hong

980
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:17,041
wanted to see.

981
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:29,458
Is this what you are looking for?

982
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:34,083
Do you like the show?

983
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:14,250
The person who brought you
and Wan to ManSuang

984
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,875
was the one chasing Khun Suthin
that night.

985
01:22:18,291 --> 01:22:21,041
Last time you asked me about the document,

986
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:23,000
I lied because I was afraid.

987
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:26,416
But now,

988
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,875
two people I'm indebted to are dead.

989
01:22:30,125 --> 01:22:33,583
If this document
can help you catch the culprit,

990
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:35,333
I'm willing to risk my life.

991
01:22:40,958 --> 01:22:42,333
Help me read this.

992
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,583
Is this the weapons dealing document?

993
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:49,375
This one has
the signature of Phraya Bodisorn.

994
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:53,375
Another one has Phraya Wichien's.

995
01:22:54,791 --> 01:22:56,333
But both copies have

996
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,666
Khun Suthinborirak's signature on it.

997
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:02,750
Yes.

998
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:09,875
Khun Suthin is a two-faced traitor.

999
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:12,791
He sold weapons to both sides.

1000
01:23:17,791 --> 01:23:19,916
I must give this to Phraya Bodisorn.

1001
01:23:35,708 --> 01:23:37,541
Give it to me.

1002
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,333
I won't it give to you.

1003
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:56,791
Let me explain.

1004
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:57,833
No!

1005
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:01,041
And I won't give it to you.

1006
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:02,916
I beg you.

1007
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:07,083
Don't give it to Phraya Bodisorn just yet.

1008
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:12,250
I need more time to find out
who killed my father.

1009
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:39,166
When elephants fight,

1010
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:41,458
the grass is inevitably crushed.

1011
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,791
It's inevitable for us.

1012
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:46,791
Serving the royal court is dangerous.

1013
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,875
People will do anything for power.

1014
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:54,000
Come back here
and live peacefully with us.

1015
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:57,291
If I keep fighting,

1016
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,083
I may win.

1017
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:04,333
But if I give up now,

1018
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,000
I will have nothing.

1019
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,666
I beg you, Father.

1020
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:15,750
Please don't go back to the capital.

1021
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:19,375
I need to go back.

1022
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,875
Or else,

1023
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,625
I will put our whole family in danger,

1024
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,333
especially you.

1025
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:44,125
You are Khun Suthin's son?

1026
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:48,083
Yes.

1027
01:25:49,458 --> 01:25:51,791
This document contains my father's name

1028
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:53,708
as those Europeans' henchman.

1029
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:57,583
It means he had illegally
sold weapons to both sides

1030
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:01,125
without the seal of the royal treasury.

1031
01:26:01,208 --> 01:26:02,916
You understand now?

1032
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:06,916
He wasn't just
an interpreter as I thought.

1033
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:10,083
This document says

1034
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:12,833
my father was a corrupt official

1035
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:16,125
who made a deal with the Europeans…

1036
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:20,333
and joined the rebels.

1037
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:23,833
You know the punishment
for high treason, right?

1038
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:26,250
It's all right if it's just me.

1039
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:28,708
But my family would never survive this.

1040
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:31,875
I'd rather die

1041
01:26:33,125 --> 01:26:34,333
than let them suffer

1042
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:36,041
for my father's wrongdoing.

1043
01:26:46,791 --> 01:26:48,500
I'll give you two days.

1044
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:53,750
Thank you.

1045
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:05,000
It's good that you don't want
to be a civil servant.

1046
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:09,291
But you must remember my words.

1047
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:13,916
It's ill striving against the stream.

1048
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,750
You will be ruined.

1049
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,416
I may disagree

1050
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:21,791
with them on certain matters,

1051
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:23,875
but it's unwise to oppose them.

1052
01:28:31,916 --> 01:28:33,208
Wan!

1053
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:34,708
Wan!

1054
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:38,041
Wan, are you all right?

1055
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:41,125
Hey! Take the injured to the nursing home!

1056
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:52,083
That firecracker is an insult to me.

1057
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:55,541
As if to say I don't deserve
to be the Master of ManSuang!

1058
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:56,833
Tiang,

1059
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,416
don't worry.

1060
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:05,791
You just need the power of some higher-ups

1061
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:07,583
to support you.

1062
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,166
If those buggers see

1063
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:14,500
that my people are here to support you,

1064
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:17,083
they won't even dare to disagree with you.

1065
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:22,916
It's time for us to use those weapons.

1066
01:29:23,958 --> 01:29:25,583
Calm down, Tiang.

1067
01:29:26,125 --> 01:29:27,625
Think of the big picture.

1068
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:29,375
We can't afford to be reckless.

1069
01:29:29,916 --> 01:29:33,625
My Lord, I risk my life doing dirty work
as you command.

1070
01:29:36,333 --> 01:29:39,958
Now it's time for you to share the risks.

1071
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:46,916
I never told you to do anything.

1072
01:29:49,125 --> 01:29:51,125
You did them yourself.

1073
01:29:55,708 --> 01:29:57,541
How could you say such a thing?

1074
01:29:57,916 --> 01:30:00,708
You said that you want me to help.

1075
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,708
My Lord,

1076
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:04,875
if you aren't going to be reliable,

1077
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:08,458
I may not be able to wait any longer.

1078
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:27,041
The current situation is dire
and it is still unpredictable.

1079
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,208
We don't know
who will be in power in the future.

1080
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:33,375
Weapons are kept here.

1081
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:35,041
Making a single wrong move

1082
01:30:35,125 --> 01:30:37,625
can turn us into rebels overnight.

1083
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:39,083
Tiang,

1084
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:40,500
trust me.

1085
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,000
I'll take ManSuang

1086
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:44,750
and the Chinese Tua Hia

1087
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:47,458
to the highest place for sure.

1088
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:50,458
Don't think about threatening me.

1089
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:54,333
You should be careful.

1090
01:30:54,875 --> 01:30:56,750
If someone suspects

1091
01:30:57,125 --> 01:30:59,583
the death of Master Cheng

1092
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:00,750
and Hong,

1093
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:07,041
what will happen to you?

1094
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:22,041
Drink it.

1095
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:39,916
Where's Cheng?

1096
01:31:40,125 --> 01:31:41,875
Uncle Cheng went out.

1097
01:31:43,583 --> 01:31:45,291
Anything I can help you with?

1098
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:54,208
I have something important

1099
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:55,875
for Master Cheng.

1100
01:31:57,541 --> 01:32:00,083
And I need to travel
to China as soon as possible.

1101
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:02,083
Can you arrange that for me?

1102
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:04,500
Tomorrow at dawn

1103
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:08,416
there will be a ship from Pak Nam
going to Guangdong Province.

1104
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:13,791
If you want, my servant can take you
to Pak Nam right now.

1105
01:32:14,041 --> 01:32:15,541
Thank you, Tiang.

1106
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:17,541
I want to go right now.

1107
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,166
As for the important documents
for Uncle Cheng,

1108
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,125
please leave them with me.

1109
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,666
I just realized

1110
01:32:36,625 --> 01:32:38,416
I forgot something downstairs.

1111
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:58,875
Where are the documents?

1112
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:01,041
Hey!

1113
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:03,708
Don't come near me!

1114
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:04,916
Don't come near me!

1115
01:33:06,166 --> 01:33:07,958
You'll only
unnecessarily exhaust yourself.

1116
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,458
Where are the documents?

1117
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:17,750
In hell.

1118
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:19,250
Go and get them in hell!

1119
01:33:34,291 --> 01:33:36,333
Dump him outside ManSuang.

1120
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:39,083
Make it look like he was robbed.

1121
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:07,458
Who lit the firecracker?

1122
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:10,666
It's hard to tell.

1123
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:13,166
What we know for sure is that

1124
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,875
Tiang is the one behind
the death of Khun Suthin

1125
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:17,375
and Master Cheng.

1126
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:20,291
And mine.

1127
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:26,333
I can bend,

1128
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,291
but I'm not stupid.

1129
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,833
Now I understand

1130
01:34:54,916 --> 01:34:56,958
that he's never been faithful.

1131
01:34:57,583 --> 01:34:59,000
Tell me

1132
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:00,583
what do you want me

1133
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:03,500
and our Tua Hia brothers to do?

1134
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:26,291
Tell the chef

1135
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:28,708
to use peanut flour in the jujube pancake.

1136
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:31,541
This tonic was brewed according
to the Persians' formula.

1137
01:35:32,541 --> 01:35:34,458
You'll look like you're dead.

1138
01:35:35,416 --> 01:35:39,333
It is extracted
from the blue fruit of a Persian tree

1139
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:42,750
called the nocturnal macabre.

1140
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Anyone consuming it
will look like they are dead.

1141
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:00,875
My head hurts.

1142
01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:02,666
Help me.

1143
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:03,958
Help with what?

1144
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:05,125
Are you all right?

1145
01:36:06,916 --> 01:36:09,833
The drug will start
to take effect within minutes.

1146
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:14,416
But it usually takes four hours
for the affected person to wake up.

1147
01:36:14,708 --> 01:36:16,000
I know

1148
01:36:16,916 --> 01:36:18,916
that Tiang is very ambitious.

1149
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:21,541
But I never thought

1150
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,541
he'd cooperate with Phraya Wichien

1151
01:36:25,166 --> 01:36:27,916
to deceive my father and make him
store their weapons here,

1152
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,916
then order the Tua Hia to rebel.

1153
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:35,125
When my father disagreed,

1154
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,125
he killed him.

1155
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,125
Then,

1156
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:47,458
the firecracker explosion was probably
Phraya Bodisorn's doing.

1157
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:50,000
I'm not sure.

1158
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:52,833
Tiang is overambitious.

1159
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:56,333
Phraya Wichien might
want to teach him a lesson.

1160
01:36:57,416 --> 01:36:59,791
They want to use secret documents

1161
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:01,875
as a weapon to destroy each other.

1162
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:05,291
We must not let any of them
get the documents.

1163
01:37:07,416 --> 01:37:09,791
What do you think
we should do with the documents?

1164
01:37:12,375 --> 01:37:13,875
Burn it?

1165
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:16,875
Better than leaving them
in the wrong hands.

1166
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:21,125
I got it now.

1167
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,708
If we burn them,

1168
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:29,291
you and your family will be safe.

1169
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:31,500
That's right.

1170
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:34,208
Aren't you a bit selfish?

1171
01:37:34,958 --> 01:37:36,375
Calm down.

1172
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:38,416
I don't see how I'm in the wrong.

1173
01:37:38,750 --> 01:37:40,000
My family will be punished

1174
01:37:40,083 --> 01:37:41,500
for a crime they didn't commit.

1175
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:43,000
But your father did it.

1176
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:44,875
Are you any different?

1177
01:37:45,458 --> 01:37:47,458
You're afraid of being punished too.

1178
01:37:48,041 --> 01:37:49,750
That's why you blindly serve

1179
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:53,416
the elites who have no morals.

1180
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:54,666
You don't even care.

1181
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:58,250
Yes, I'm just like a dog
that does whatever the master orders.

1182
01:37:58,333 --> 01:37:59,833
I'm just a servant.

1183
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:01,291
I have no choice.

1184
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:03,708
I'm not from a noble family like yours!

1185
01:38:07,791 --> 01:38:09,666
Can you stop wasting our time?

1186
01:38:16,708 --> 01:38:18,500
Tiang and Phraya Wichien

1187
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,958
will frame the Tua Hia as rebels.

1188
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,833
They'll be arrested

1189
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:28,875
even if they're innocent.

1190
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:33,166
I need to prove

1191
01:38:33,583 --> 01:38:35,166
that those weapons

1192
01:38:35,666 --> 01:38:37,583
aren't connected to the Tua Hia.

1193
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,875
I want you two to help me,

1194
01:38:46,333 --> 01:38:48,083
and I will return the favor.

1195
01:38:50,541 --> 01:38:52,083
What do you think?

1196
01:38:58,833 --> 01:39:00,416
When elephants fight,

1197
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:03,833
the grass is inevitably crushed.

1198
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:07,208
It's just like that.

1199
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,416
Before I make any move,

1200
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,958
Phraya Bodisorn will put me in jail

1201
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,958
and claim that I murdered Muen Kijraksa.

1202
01:39:42,833 --> 01:39:43,916
Then,

1203
01:39:45,416 --> 01:39:47,250
we must act fast

1204
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,791
to get rid of them all at once

1205
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:52,958
and not leave any time
for them to prepare.

1206
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:08,333
Thank you, thank you.

1207
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:10,791
May Master Tiang and ManSuang

1208
01:40:10,875 --> 01:40:13,416
be blessed with fortune
and wealth this new year.

1209
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,791
Wait and see, Wan.

1210
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:19,500
This will be
the biggest fireworks in Siam.

1211
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:26,125
Wan.

1212
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:30,416
Here.

1213
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:36,041
I want to give you this.

1214
01:40:36,666 --> 01:40:38,291
Imported cigarettes?

1215
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:41,041
Where did you steal them from?

1216
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:42,750
I bought them.

1217
01:40:42,958 --> 01:40:44,750
It must've cost you a fortune.

1218
01:40:45,541 --> 01:40:46,958
That's fine.

1219
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:49,000
I know you'll like them.

1220
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:52,541
I did a lot of things
that made you feel uncomfortable.

1221
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:01,458
Thank you,

1222
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:05,916
Khem.

1223
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:53,583
Have a sip, my Lord.

1224
01:42:05,625 --> 01:42:07,416
How does it taste?

1225
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:34,375
Disguised as a loyal pet

1226
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,791
But upon closely looking

1227
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:42,833
Cunning viper disguises itself
As a dog no less

1228
01:42:42,916 --> 01:42:47,708
Wait until thy master is killed
Next usurp

1229
01:42:47,791 --> 01:42:51,708
Joining hands with the enemy
For the plan undeserved

1230
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:56,291
How ungrateful!
Thy sin can find no match!

1231
01:42:56,375 --> 01:43:00,416
Weapons fill thy abode
How dare thee!

1232
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:06,875
May the hideous gambit fail
And the wrongs be righted with glee

1233
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:51,750
I,

1234
01:43:52,625 --> 01:43:53,916
Master Hong,

1235
01:43:54,833 --> 01:43:56,458
son of Master Cheng

1236
01:43:57,041 --> 01:43:59,041
humbly request you all

1237
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:02,250
to be my judge!

1238
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:06,166
Tiang

1239
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:09,750
killed my father…

1240
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:14,500
and tried to kill me.

1241
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:18,833
Tiang

1242
01:44:20,166 --> 01:44:21,875
is a traitor

1243
01:44:22,083 --> 01:44:23,833
who is very ambitious.

1244
01:44:25,375 --> 01:44:27,250
He conspired with the officials

1245
01:44:29,041 --> 01:44:30,625
to keep weapons,

1246
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:34,208
which are bought illegally
from the Europeans, at ManSuang.

1247
01:44:39,208 --> 01:44:42,000
I'm going to return those weapons

1248
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:45,208
to the government

1249
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:47,875
to show that…

1250
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,083
I,

1251
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:54,041
my father,

1252
01:44:55,166 --> 01:44:57,125
and all the Chinese Tua Hia…

1253
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:03,083
aren't involved with his act in any way.

1254
01:45:03,208 --> 01:45:04,416
No, you are the traitor!

1255
01:45:04,916 --> 01:45:07,208
You betrayed us!

1256
01:45:10,833 --> 01:45:12,500
Brothers!

1257
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:16,291
Stand up and fight

1258
01:45:16,583 --> 01:45:18,458
to protect our people!

1259
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:19,541
You!

1260
01:45:19,625 --> 01:45:21,291
You! Bloody bastard!

1261
01:45:32,458 --> 01:45:33,833
One more thing

1262
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:37,250
that I want to expose today.

1263
01:45:43,166 --> 01:45:44,916
It's them, the Tua Hia.

1264
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,750
They raped and killed girls.

1265
01:45:46,833 --> 01:45:48,041
You're a liar.

1266
01:45:48,125 --> 01:45:49,750
Just do what needs to be done,

1267
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:50,916
Wan.

1268
01:45:54,125 --> 01:45:55,750
I will ask

1269
01:45:57,666 --> 01:45:59,250
my people

1270
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:03,000
to tell the truth

1271
01:46:03,625 --> 01:46:05,458
to all of you here

1272
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:07,708
about

1273
01:46:08,375 --> 01:46:11,041
the real rebel who betrays Siam!

1274
01:46:11,916 --> 01:46:12,916
Master Hong!

1275
01:47:01,083 --> 01:47:02,583
You bastard!

1276
01:47:29,708 --> 01:47:31,958
Did you kill my father, Khun Suthin?

1277
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:40,375
Are you his son?

1278
01:47:45,916 --> 01:47:47,208
I didn't kill him.

1279
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:50,666
You father was deceived,

1280
01:47:51,416 --> 01:47:52,958
and he was stupid enough

1281
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:56,083
to kill himself.

1282
01:48:01,333 --> 01:48:02,166
Chatra!

1283
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:04,458
Chatra!

1284
01:48:12,916 --> 01:48:17,916
ManSuang will be
as great as my father wanted it to be.

1285
01:48:19,583 --> 01:48:23,916
Both your father
and you betrayed our brothers

1286
01:48:24,875 --> 01:48:27,291
and the motherland.

1287
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:30,833
It's only right that your father died.

1288
01:48:32,125 --> 01:48:34,208
Being a patriot doesn't give you the right

1289
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:35,583
to commit evil deeds!

1290
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:51,500
Let us make a pledge

1291
01:48:53,416 --> 01:48:55,041
to be faithful to each other.

1292
01:48:56,416 --> 01:48:57,916
If not, we will die,

1293
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,416
throat slit,

1294
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,291
like that chicken.

1295
01:49:16,125 --> 01:49:16,958
Wan!

1296
01:49:19,875 --> 01:49:21,291
Don't do it, Wan!

1297
01:49:23,333 --> 01:49:24,875
Put the gun down.

1298
01:49:26,708 --> 01:49:27,541
Trust me.

1299
01:49:27,625 --> 01:49:29,333
Trust you?

1300
01:49:31,125 --> 01:49:33,041
You side with the Chinks.

1301
01:49:34,625 --> 01:49:35,958
What about me?

1302
01:49:40,333 --> 01:49:41,916
Those Chinks…

1303
01:49:45,333 --> 01:49:46,708
raped my sister, Waen.

1304
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:49,541
It left my parents totally devastated.

1305
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:51,750
You,

1306
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,791
my only friend,

1307
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,791
also betrayed me

1308
01:49:58,333 --> 01:49:59,625
and sided with them.

1309
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,625
But the Chinese people here
don't know anything about that.

1310
01:50:09,916 --> 01:50:11,166
See?

1311
01:50:13,625 --> 01:50:15,125
Even now

1312
01:50:16,416 --> 01:50:18,666
you still take their side!

1313
01:50:36,958 --> 01:50:38,458
You decide

1314
01:50:39,333 --> 01:50:40,833
what to do with him.

1315
01:50:47,916 --> 01:50:49,750
Master Hong, please let him go.

1316
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:55,166
Wan.

1317
01:50:57,458 --> 01:50:59,250
Just leave.

1318
01:51:00,291 --> 01:51:02,291
Go live the life you want to live…

1319
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:08,708
and don't ever come back here.

1320
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:34,666
I'll leave.

1321
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:45,083
But you all will leave with me.

1322
01:51:45,333 --> 01:51:47,958
If I had known there was
a stockpile of gunpowder here,

1323
01:51:49,166 --> 01:51:51,166
I wouldn't have wasted my time

1324
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:53,708
with those useless firecrackers.

1325
01:53:21,583 --> 01:53:23,250
Keep this.

1326
01:53:26,166 --> 01:53:28,666
It's a guarantee for your safety.

1327
01:54:01,291 --> 01:54:02,750
My name is Chatra.

1328
01:54:03,541 --> 01:54:05,833
I'm Khun Suthinborirak's son.

1329
01:54:06,708 --> 01:54:10,791
I have the important documents
that you wanted, my Lord.

1330
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:21,791
Although the sky has not changed,

1331
01:54:22,416 --> 01:54:26,375
it's already clear, which direction
the ship is steering towards.

1332
01:54:27,833 --> 01:54:31,541
Therefore, the document
is not important anymore

1333
01:54:32,375 --> 01:54:33,541
to any parties.

1334
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:46,791
I think you know

1335
01:54:46,875 --> 01:54:49,250
why I wanted to meet you.

1336
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:53,125
My mission failed.

1337
01:54:56,541 --> 01:54:59,500
I'll accept the punishment
as you see fit, my Lord.

1338
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:02,166
In fact,

1339
01:55:02,708 --> 01:55:05,208
people who plotted
the rebellion like Tiang

1340
01:55:05,291 --> 01:55:06,666
are already dead.

1341
01:55:07,416 --> 01:55:09,083
The weapons kept at ManSuang

1342
01:55:09,166 --> 01:55:11,500
were handed over to the government.

1343
01:55:12,208 --> 01:55:15,708
I think you've done some good work.

1344
01:55:16,958 --> 01:55:19,000
But no one knows

1345
01:55:19,583 --> 01:55:22,666
when it will come in handy.

1346
01:55:32,916 --> 01:55:34,833
Tell me

1347
01:55:34,916 --> 01:55:38,000
what you want in return, Chatra.

1348
01:55:39,791 --> 01:55:42,708
I never thought I would be so lucky

1349
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:47,458
to have the lord director of the
Harbor Department pouring liquor for me.

1350
01:55:49,875 --> 01:55:51,333
For our country,

1351
01:55:51,416 --> 01:55:54,000
my master is ready to compromise.

1352
01:55:57,125 --> 01:56:00,250
If it's not meant to be,
you will never be in power.

1353
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:02,375
Don't you agree?

1354
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,541
But,

1355
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:07,750
if you don't have the support

1356
01:56:07,833 --> 01:56:09,875
from friends in foreign countries,

1357
01:56:10,375 --> 01:56:12,458
it would be quite a struggle.

1358
01:56:13,875 --> 01:56:16,750
So my master is very pleased

1359
01:56:16,833 --> 01:56:20,916
that we can finally work together
for the country.

1360
01:56:22,583 --> 01:56:23,708
Actually,

1361
01:56:24,166 --> 01:56:26,083
it's not you or me anymore.

1362
01:56:26,916 --> 01:56:28,958
We are on the same team now

1363
01:56:29,541 --> 01:56:31,625
for Siam.

1364
01:56:35,708 --> 01:56:36,708
Cheers.

1365
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:40,458
My Lord,

1366
01:56:41,041 --> 01:56:43,291
I want Khem to be a free man.

1367
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:48,041
And for yourself?

1368
01:56:49,250 --> 01:56:52,041
My father committed
a crime against the country.

1369
01:56:52,416 --> 01:56:55,291
If you think this puts me in the wrong,

1370
01:56:56,291 --> 01:56:58,791
I will accept
my punishment as you see fit.

1371
01:57:02,708 --> 01:57:06,083
I agree with Phraya Wichien.

1372
01:57:06,708 --> 01:57:07,750
That's why

1373
01:57:08,458 --> 01:57:10,208
I'll give you the opportunity

1374
01:57:10,291 --> 01:57:12,083
to be a civil servant.

1375
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:14,750
You will be given
the title and the fiefdom.

1376
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:17,500
You will no longer need
a Phrai number tattoo.

1377
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:19,083
What say you?

1378
01:57:20,625 --> 01:57:22,125
I've heard the good news.

1379
01:57:23,166 --> 01:57:24,958
Can I call you Khun Luang now?

1380
01:57:25,916 --> 01:57:28,708
And can I call you Than Khun?

1381
01:57:29,916 --> 01:57:32,000
I told Phraya Bodisorn that

1382
01:57:33,541 --> 01:57:35,625
I want to continue
working here as a dancer.

1383
01:57:36,833 --> 01:57:37,958
Why?

1384
01:57:40,333 --> 01:57:43,166
I once wanted to rise to the top
and get rid of the Phrai status.

1385
01:57:44,958 --> 01:57:46,791
But it doesn't matter anymore.

1386
01:57:47,916 --> 01:57:49,250
For the person I am now, a phrai,

1387
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:52,958
can make changes too.

1388
01:57:54,291 --> 01:57:56,375
For you, it suits you better there.

1389
01:57:56,458 --> 01:57:58,000
As for you,

1390
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:01,625
you have the knowledge

1391
01:58:01,708 --> 01:58:03,416
and talent,

1392
01:58:03,791 --> 01:58:06,125
you should serve in the government

1393
01:58:06,375 --> 01:58:09,333
and serve the country.

1394
01:58:10,541 --> 01:58:12,583
Khun Suthin would be proud

1395
01:58:12,666 --> 01:58:15,083
to see his son become a civil servant too.

1396
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:18,166
A steamboat is made for the sea.

1397
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,041
A sailboat follows the wind.

1398
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,666
And a row boat

1399
01:58:25,458 --> 01:58:27,250
can plough through every canal

1400
01:58:27,708 --> 01:58:29,708
and river.

1401
01:58:33,458 --> 01:58:35,666
My father always told me

1402
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:38,625
that it's ill striving against the stream.

1403
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:47,916
But I don't think so.

1404
01:58:49,333 --> 01:58:51,583
Now Siam has steamboats

1405
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,333
that can strike against the stream,

1406
01:58:55,375 --> 01:58:57,833
wave, and wind,

1407
01:58:57,916 --> 01:58:59,791
right?

1408
01:59:08,625 --> 01:59:10,166
Do the curved arm.

1409
01:59:10,625 --> 01:59:11,916
Lower curved arm.

1410
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:14,750
Upper curved arm.

1411
01:59:14,833 --> 01:59:16,000
Khem!

1412
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:20,666
I leave Ruang in your care,

1413
01:59:21,333 --> 01:59:22,666
Maestro.

1414
01:59:28,875 --> 01:59:31,083
And I leave the country in your care,

1415
01:59:32,708 --> 01:59:34,166
Khun Luang.
