1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:04,320
So you and Gunam
weren’t a thing?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,860
Of course! You know
he’s not my type.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,700
Wait, why do you keep
speaking informally to me?

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,920
What are you guys doing?

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,920
An eyelash went into her eye.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
But why were you guys kissing?!

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,740
Oh, you didn’t know?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,480
It’s a quick fix.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,340
You can safely lick
the eyelash out.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,100
It works like magic.

11
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,600
But why are you two blushing?

12
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,840
Seriously?!

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,060
I uhh, how do I word this, uhhh.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,720
My eye was like that you know, and um, now I
know that um, you can take it out like that.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,560
She’s talking like the president
again because she’s flustered.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,740
You idiot!

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,200
What kind of answer do you want?

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,920
It’s only logical that when two charming people
look at each other, their hearts flutter.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,540
You do as you please.

20
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,060
Really, as you please.

21
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,460
Kyungju, are you, by any
chance, jealous right now?

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,840
No, it’s just, she’s too much
Yesterday she was... you know like…

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,300
What are you, my boyfriend?

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,060
Dear, what are you talking about..
You don’t even like boys!

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,500
You called me dear!

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,360
That’s not what I meant.

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,180
Okay, good. Just keep
calling me dear.

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,200
Dear, you really…

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,820
I mean Serang…

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,780
I don’t know when you’re speaking
the truth or joking around.

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,780
It all just seems like
a big joke to you.

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,100
Why is she so old-fashioned?

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,520
Serang. Serang!

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,640
Before you leave, can
I get an autograph?

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,200
I’m gonna put it up
here in the store.

36
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,680
Sure.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
You’re really pretty.

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,600
I.. I just… I left the room and she’s
still in there signing an autograph?

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,640
She didn’t even debut.

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,340
They’re all too much.

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,400
All of them really are…

42
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,520
What the!

43
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,160
Are you Kyungju?

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,640
Are you the student
named Kyungju Kim?

45
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,040
Yes. I am.

46
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,340
But, who are you?

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:20,120
I am Mr. Park and I come with an order from
Serang Jang’s father to take you both to him.

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,580
An order from her father?

49
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,420
Mr. Park, what are
you doing here?

50
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,640
Ma’am.

51
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,160
Why is he calling her ma’am?

52
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,180
Is he a servant like the ones in
the royal English households?

53
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,320
How much power does your father
have that you guys have a servant?

54
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
He’s a representative
from the city of Bukgajwa.

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,940
The city’s representative?

56
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,280
What kind of representative
has a servant in their house?

57
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,900
Not saying that representatives
aren’t important people.

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,820
Mr. Park is a servant…
of God at our church.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,900
Church?

60
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,640
I am a servant of God
at Eunpyeong Church.

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,100
He really was from a church?

62
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,180
I don’t know, I don’t
know anything!

63
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,320
About this guy, about Serang Jang, or
about what’s going to happen next!

64
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,420
I tend to speak like the
president when I’m uncomfortable.

65
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,860
Then you must be comfortable now.

66
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,460
No I... I uhh am having
a great, no good time.

67
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:58,280
I think, I uh should um, upgrade that a
bit and uhh, try to have a great time…
