1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Don’t be too upset and
come again next time.

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,440
I hope I didn’t affect
your restaurant’s regulars.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,760
It’s not like you said
anything wrong.

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,479
There’s no place like this so I can
guarantee those guys will return.

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,359
NA: I feel like I’m watching Captain Jack Sparrow
speak to his crewmen in 'Pirates of the Caribbean'.

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,639
Then, that’s a relief.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,960
Can I get another goblet of
wine here?

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,280
But Serang, I heard many people
were looking forward to your debut.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
What happened? Kyungju couldn’t
even if she wants to.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,840
Hey..!!

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,760
To be honest… I wanted
to form an idol union.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,020
But everyone considered
us to be crazy radicals.

13
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,039
Union?!

14
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,399
An idol union.

15
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,459
Idols need a labor
union as well!

16
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,560
We don’t have steady incomes and

17
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,620
our bones are constantly aching because of
the high heels we’re forced to dance in.

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,120
But uh, do you have any pickles here..? 
Wine and pickles are the perfect match.

19
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,379
I see you were the ‘Norma
Rae’ of the idol world.

20
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,659
NA: Then I guess I'm Peter
Parker of the idol world.

21
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,439
If you really wanted to make a union,
then you should have debuted first.

22
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,159
That’s the sad thing I couldn’t get any
support from the members around me.

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,820
But what was that story you were telling
before? The story you told those men.

24
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,719
Oh I just modified the story
that you told me last time…

25
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,000
What?! Are you saying you
used my story as a joke?!

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,939
No, not a joke but a remix…  You know stories
of people are similar here and there.

27
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,500
What are you talking
about here and there?

28
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,859
Do you know me?
You don’t even know me.

29
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,260
I don’t… The answer, my sister, is blowin' in
the wind. The answer is blowin' in the wind.

30
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,219
What is that…?

31
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,539
Bob Marley's
'Blowin’ in the Wind.

32
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:37,959
Those aren’t the lyrics.

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,219
And it’s not Bob
Marley but Bob Dylan.

34
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,099
NA: Wait, why do I know this?

35
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,859
Exactly!  I may not know the lyrics of this
song, but we’re communicating just fine.

36
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,219
You understand as if we were peanut butter and
jelly, why are you like this all of a sudden?

37
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:52,060
What are you talking about?

38
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,020
Do you know me?

39
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,300
You don’t!

40
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,219
I do.

41
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,759
Why wouldn’t I?

42
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,759
I know you so well!

43
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,719
I like you so much!

44
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,180
We just met.

45
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,439
We’re Facebook friends.

46
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,139
You guys are Facebook friends?!

47
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,219
We became friends on
Facebook yesterday.

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,879
Exactly. Yesterday!
We went all the way!

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Wha..what?!

50
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,740
Touched here, licked there.

51
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,939
We did a bunch of
erotic things together!

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,060
Shit.

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,280
Wow…
