1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,230
Please let me talk to Gunam
just once. It’s about my things.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,380
Alright, I’ll give him the phone.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,160
Hey Kyungju (Gunam (22) idol,
Kyungju’s ex-boyfriend)

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:09,660
You!

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,010
I know, I know. You’re having a hard time

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,740
but even though there may be some feelings
left over, I think we should try not to contact one another.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,780
That’s not it!

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,960
I’m on tour right now, starting in Indonesia. If you keep
calling, then the phone bill will get really expensive.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Indonesia?

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,740
That’s right, I’m on a
Southeast Asian tour.

11
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,050
You can go to Indonesia because you have your
passport. But what about mine? Give me my passport!

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,600
Let’s be honest here, why
would you need your passport?

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
I got booked for
an event in Japan!

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,540
Alright, sure let’s say you did. But why
are you looking for your passport from me…

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,420
That’s right! Your passport!
I left that with Eunsook!

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,280
What?!

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,740
Why would he leave that
with the girl he’s seeing.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That surprised me.

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
How stupid.

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
I came all the way here.
I can’t back out now.

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,800
Her electricity bill is… $100?!

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
I came to get what’s mine!
What’s wrong with that?

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Should I just get it reissued?

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
No, that makes no sense!

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Are you scared? No!

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
Then why do you have to go pee?

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
Kyungju Kim?

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Huh?

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
You’re Kyungju Kim, right?

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,600
I’m Eunsook.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,680
She’s pretty.
She’s pretty.

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
She’s freaking pretty.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Do you know me?

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
You know the entertainment
industry is small.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,480
I was a trainee at your
company for a bit too.

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
Well, there are a lot of
trainees that come and go.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Well, I finally got to meet you.

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
I’ve heard a lot about you.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Heard about me?
What did you hear?

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
No, no.

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Can I just have my passport?

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,600
I couldn’t bring it out
because I was in a rush,

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
but it’s on the shelf.
Can you go get it?

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Make sure you don’t
touch anything else.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
What would I touch?

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
That’s not what I mean.

47
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
A friend is at home and
she’s kind of sensitive,

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
so it’s best if you don’t
cross paths with her.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,880
You can do that for me, right?

50
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Sure, sure.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Then, I’ll see you again.

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,200
Hey!

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Do you like your job?

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
I was going to quit but we started
getting busy in Southeast Asia.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,500
Southeast Asia?

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh, Kyungju, I’m running
late so I’ll be going.

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Where are you going?

58
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Indonesia.

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Make sure you get your
passport and leave right away.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Don’t cross paths with
my friend and be quiet!

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
Alright.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
These two…

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,840
They’re just being public about
their relationship, huh?

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Pardon me.

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
What is this.
Is no one home?

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
It’s broad daylight and
they have all the lights on.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,760
No wonder their electricity
bill comes out to be $100.

68
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,920
But, where’s my passport?

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Hello?

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
I’m came into the house.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,100
I’m here to find my passport.

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
I got permission to
come into this house

73
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
so don’t think I’m
a weird person.

74
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,920
I’m going to use your
bathroom really quick

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
so don’t get scared if
you see a random person.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
That was close.

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
But what’s so spooky.

78
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,760
There’s an eerie
feeling in here.

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,200
I feel like something bad
is going to happen.

80
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,000
What the heck? What was that?

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,200
A ghost?

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,640
But why is a ghost naked?

83
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
A person?

84
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
But why is she quiet?

85
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Hello?

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,300
Aren’t you going to come out.

87
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Wait, I’m not saying to
come out all naked but

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,240
I came to find my passport.

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
I’m not a bad person.

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
No way... did she faint?

91
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,520
That can’t be… then,
heart attack?!

92
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,500
Serang Jang?

93
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
No! No! No!

94
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
You can’t die!

95
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Don’t die, please don’t die.

96
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
I can’t be known as a
murderer before I debut.

97
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,500
I can’t go down like this!

98
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Who died?
