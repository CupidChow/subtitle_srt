1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:06,060
Yes, that’s why I’m here to
find my passport in this house.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,040
Why is your passport
here in the first place?

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,740
But uh, more importantly...

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
why are you making
me lie on your arm?

5
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,100
You have freckles here.

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:29,840
What?!

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,120
It’s been hard these
past few days, huh?

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,860
Let’s sleep together.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,800
After we wake up, I’ll find
your passport for you too.

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,560
I’ll just come back when
Eunsook comes back.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
Once she leaves Korea this time, she’s
not going to come back for a few weeks.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,580
Why is a stewardess
leaving for so long?

13
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,860
Being a stewardess is hard too.

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,240
Did Eunsook tell you
she was a stewardess?

15
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,980
What? Just by looking at her...
she looks like a stewardess.

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,360
NA: ‘Flying Girls’ Girl group
debut with a fresh concept?!

17
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,420
NA: Wow... there are all
types of concepts nowadays.

18
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,460
Anyhow... Eunsook is an
idol that debuted too.

19
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,920
I’ve been training for seven
years and got kicked out.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,680
Have I been dreaming
a hopeless dream?

21
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,780
Your dream is to be an idol?

22
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,240
Can you hear my thoughts again?

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,720
That’s petty.

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,340
What?

25
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,880
What do you mean it’s petty?

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,720
It might be easy for you but!

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,380
What are you saying?

28
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,380
Do you think it was easy for me?

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,040
I said it was petty, not easy.

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,440
Then what is your dream?

31
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,520
A granny!

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,600
What??

33
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,380
How is that a dream.

34
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,820
Not just any grandma
but a goofy granny!

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,400
Okay... What a bizarre dream.

36
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,060
You have to be healthy.

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,080
If you want to be a goofball
even when you’re old.

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
It’s really not an easy thing!

39
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,340
That’s true but...

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,860
What I mean by when I say I
want to be a goofy granny is...

41
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,200
I want to be someone that can
actually hear very well but...

42
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,320
Grandma, are you going to
the mineral water springs?

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,660
No, I’m not a rock
star that sings.

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,960
No, are you going to the
mineral water spring?

45
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,320
What?

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,780
Are you asking me if I’m a girl that
likes the rock star that sings?

47
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,900
I’m not a groupie.

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,980
How did she know
what a groupie was?

49
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,180
Are you going to get mineral water?
Mineral water?

50
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,020
What?!

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,500
Did you ask me if I’m the
rock star’s son’s mother?

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,220
No, no!

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,340
How dare you say such a thing!

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,680
How dare you!

55
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,940
Grandma!

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,220
NA: I actually
understood everything~

57
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,160
NA: Ah, you really can’t
stop this goofy grandma~

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,060
Do you know how President
Park made this country?

59
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,660
Now his daughter is doing a good
job at governing our country!

60
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,540
How dare you!

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,520
Let’s grow old together.

62
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,540
What?

63
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,180
Let’s live a long, long
life as goofballs.

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,360
We can take a walk around
the village holding hands.

65
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,420
And by then, the yellow dust
will have gotten worse so

66
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,040
we can make sure we
both have our masks.

67
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,180
We barely met.

68
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
What do you like to eat?

69
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,520
Mackerel.

70
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,880
I can grill you
mackerel everyday.

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,880
It’s kind of greasy if
you eat it every day.

72
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,640
I mean I’m just saying you
need to clean the fish

73
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,320
and getting rid of all the
grease is annoying too.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,080
I’ll just eat
everything you give me.

75
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,600
If you look at me
that blatantly...

76
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,680
I- I don’t know where to look.

77
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,080
NA: But.... I...

78
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,680
I think this trip has
already started.
