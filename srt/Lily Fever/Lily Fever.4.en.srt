1
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,300
She sounds like she just wants to
be weird Acting four-dimensional?

2
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:19,500
Buchi Jaegal (33) wine bar owner

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,820
Naw, I don’t think
that’s the case.

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,519
Anyways, I still can’t believe you slept
at the house of someone you just met.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,920
It’s not my first
time seeing her.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,420
I’ve known her since
she was a trainee.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,219
She was really popular.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,439
Serang Jang..?

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,019
Serang Jang? Have you
heard of Serang Jang?

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:37,859
Jisang Heo (36) producer
Changjo Baek (40) intellectual

11
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:40,240
You’re a so-called producer of
a major broadcasting company.

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,000
Hyung, stop it.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,060
She didn’t actually debut. She
just was a hot topic for a while.

14
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:45,719
Did something happen?

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,560
I can smell it already. There
was something fishy going on.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,760
Something fishy?

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,099
You know, like she got pregnant or
her sponsor stopped supporting her.

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,560
I heard a lot from him and I also
read the rumor mills constantly.

19
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,119
He’s a producer of a major
broadcasting company.

20
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,280
Hyung, I told you to stop.

21
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,800
Then what? Where do
you work as a PD?

22
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:06,920
Hyung, major broadcasting companies are nothing
these days. Entertainment companies are the best.

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,200
Trainees know too. Look at
her face, how cold it got.

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,680
It’s not because
of what you said.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,540
Then what? Do I need to start
an entertainment company?

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,799
How much could it be?

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,700
Isn’t it petty compared
to the IT capital?

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,740
It is petty but…

29
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:25,959
Here!

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,440
Hey! Can I have a
cold goblet of wine?

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,160
None of that petty stuff,
but the best one you have!

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,880
How did you know
I would be here?

33
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,739
You left this at my house.

34
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,140
NA: Oh, I left my box
of matches there.

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,320
Kyungju, you started smoking?

36
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:58,979
That’s not it. Our house gas range stops
working every now and then so I bought one.

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,320
This is a non-smoking area.

38
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,399
It’s an electric cigarette.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,120
Is she Serang Jang?

40
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,120
Aside from that, you seemed
to know quite a bit about me.

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,060
Are you a fortune-teller?

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:29,280
No… I… I’m just saying that it seemed so obvious because you
were about to debut but suddenly disappeared... you know…

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,200
Why… did you… have
to say…it like that?

44
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,079
No. I’m just…

45
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,039
As a major broadcasting company
producer, I apologize on his behalf.

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:12,879
I… I… did feel bad… when I first met you… but now you
come off so strong smoking your cigarette like that.

47
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,099
Why do you think I’m trying
to come off as strong?

48
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,659
Because I’m weak.

49
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,759
Because I want to protect the only
thing I have left, my weak confidence.

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,480
Oh… I.. your confidence…

51
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:37,500
To be honest, there was
an oppa I once loved.

52
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,759
He was an oppa that
was a trainee with me.

53
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,259
Oh no.

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,340
Under the justification that they were
protecting us, our company caged us up.

55
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,680
There are still such
old-fashioned rules?

56
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,020
Up to there was fine.

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:01,540
But that oppa joined a hip hop program and he started getting
popular because they said he was good at rapping for an idol…

58
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:03,500
and then he... dumped me.

59
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,560
There will always
be jerks like that!

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,460
NA: Wait, I’ve heard
this story before.

61
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,400
Guys these days…
He’s not even a man.

62
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,379
And guys these days don’t
have an eye for girls…

63
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,219
That’s right!

64
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,799
Right.. I have these fortune-teller-like
uncles that are looking after for me as well.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,040
Fortune-teller…

66
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,319
You can just call us oppa.

67
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,680
Yeah, yeah. Just
comfortably call us oppa.

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,180
Oppa!

69
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,399
Oh my. Yes, what is it?

70
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,620
I’m sorry, I said so much in
front of people I don’t know…

71
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,300
No, no, no, no we’re just…

72
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,980
No really, he’s a major
broadcasting company producer.

73
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,020
Hyung, really!

74
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,659
Hey, take out your business card.

75
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,480
I told you to stop
telling people.

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,379
Hey, let’s just make our
own entertainment company.

77
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,480
It’s not like we don’t have honor, we just don’t
have money. Isn’t this a line from a drama?

78
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,139
If money is what you need, I have connections
to the biggest progressive political party.

79
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:01,379
Even if it’s the biggest political party,
it’s not like they have any political power…

80
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:07,439
That’s just him. I’m part
of the conservative party.

81
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,639
I have connections with
the conservative party.

82
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,860
We’re the people that are
running this country.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,120
This is where we differ but you
know he’s not a bad conservative.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,259
He knows some people with
the Angel Investors…

85
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,240
Oh, really?

86
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,759
And we’re also not the type to overlook
people that are having a hard time.

87
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,060
(that’s right, that’s right)

88
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,920
We have the tendency
to act like Samaritans.

89
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,939
We are the Samaritans.

90
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,139
Wow, I’m so thankful
to have met you guys…

91
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,219
It’s nothing.

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,040
IS THAT WHAT YOU
THOUGHT I WOULD SAY?!

93
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,660
You guys like these cliché
tear-jerker stories, huh?

94
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,600
Wait..

95
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,660
what?

96
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:51,480
What are you…what is going on?
Are you acting?

97
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,240
No, no Is this a hidden camera?

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,500
What do you man a hidden camera? There’s no
celebrity for this to be a hidden camera.

99
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,620
I don’t think she’s acting strange..
She’s really four-dimensional.

100
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,000
F*ck, that’s really rude of you.
