1
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,260
What are you doing?

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Oh, you got bit here too.

3
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
I said, what are you doing?

4
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,340
I’m treating your bites.

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,340
Treating my bites?

6
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:53,640
How was that erotic?

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,539
It was all because I got
bitten by ants. What a quack.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,439
Acting as if she’s a real doctor.

9
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,379
It’s love.

10
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,519
It’s love.

11
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,079
What?

12
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,079
You?!

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Where did you come
from all of a sudden?

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Why of all people this girl…

15
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,060
Ugh, so frustrating.

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,299
Our event in Shanghai ended early. Serang
called me here to have a glass of wine.

17
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,299
Anyway…

18
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,299
Serang has an ant allergy.

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,539
What?

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
If she licked your ant bites,
that means she risked her life.

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,700
An ant allergy can’t
be that bad.

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,140
Haven’t you heard of the man who sucked the venom out of a
snake bite but ended up dying because his tongue swelled up?!!

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
I- I might have...

24
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,280
It’s love.

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,880
A love she is willing
to risk her life for.

26
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,979
It’s a bit farfetched
to call it love.

27
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,119
That’s why she talked
about you so often.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,400
She talked about me?

29
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,260
What did she say?

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,920
You don’t know?

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,620
Yeah.

32
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:06,599
You really don’t know?

33
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,020
What do I not know?

34
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,720
Then, you don’t have to know.

35
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:12,319
Really now?

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,820
Her fated first love appeared in front of her eyes
after so long but she doesn’t remember anything!

37
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,599
Wow, how romantic.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
I really don’t know anything!

39
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,319
About this girl! Or Serang Jang!

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,440
I first met Kyungju through that
long and tedious audition program.

41
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,539
Although Kyungju
may not remember…

42
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,959
People fated to meet
will meet no matter what.

43
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,639
Another round of
wine between us?

44
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:00,959
Sure.

45
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,159
I think something’s in my eye.

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,719
Is it an eyelash?

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,640
Stay still.

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,640
Oh no.

49
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:32,919
It’s gone.

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,880
That’s cool.

51
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,560
How cute.
