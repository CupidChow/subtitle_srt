1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:02,179
Exactly.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,240
You understand as if we were milk and cereal,
why are you like this all of a sudden?

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,599
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,320
Do you know me?

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,620
You don’t!

6
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,320
What in the world? This script is oddly
different from the last episode’s.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,820
What’s different?

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:17,739
NA: It is different…

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,040
Do you know me?

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:19,699
I do.

11
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:20,199
You don’t!

12
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,120
I do I know you so well.
Why wouldn’t I?

13
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,960
I like you so much.

14
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,679
We just met.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,899
We follow each other on Twitter.

16
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,619
You guys still use Twitter?

17
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,219
We followed each other yesterday.

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,100
Exactly, yesterday!

19
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,060
We went all the way!

20
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,420
Wha..what?!

21
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:41,780
Touched here, licked there.

22
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,900
We did a bunch of
erotic things together!

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,179
Shit.

24
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,259
Wow.

25
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,859
How was that erotic?

26
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:53,859
It was all because I
got bitten by ants.

27
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,780
What are you doing?

28
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,280
Oh my God!

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,920
I asked, what are you doing?

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,480
I- I think you have ants in your
house I have an ant allergy…

31
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,439
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to get
the shoehorn all gross...

32
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:53,859
I’m not a weird person. I
just can’t handle being itchy.

33
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,960
I thought you were running away.

34
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,300
Oh, that’s right.

35
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,060
I… I think it’s time
for me to go home.

36
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,020
You were sleeping on my
shoulder so I couldn’t go home.

37
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,520
Where?

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,020
Huh?

39
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,640
Where did you get bitten?

40
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:09,819
No, not there I got
bitten on my ankle.

41
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,219
What are you doing?

42
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,039
Oh, you got bitten here too.

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
I said, what are you doing?

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,520
I’m treating your bites.

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,240
Treating my bites?

46
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,759
NA: My thigh.
There, right there.

47
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,379
What is this?

48
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,560
My heart’s fluttering
and becoming all warm.

49
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:59,859
Almost as if…. This is
the ‘Elixer of Love’.
