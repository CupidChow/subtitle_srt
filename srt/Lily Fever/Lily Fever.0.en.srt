00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:16,160
I once thought that happy times were
waiting for me. However… however...

2
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,400
It’s lame.

3
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,320
How much longer do you think you can last by
posting those petty little videos on Youtube?

4
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,320
You need to find your own swag.
Like me.

5
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
I’m leaving now.

6
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Also, stop spreading your legs
when you’re wearing a skirt.

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,500
You can still be an idol
without spreading your legs.

8
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
But still, it’s a new one I made.
Is it that bad?

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,600
Stop here. Paparazzi
may be outside.

10
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
They always take photos when
we enter or leave a place.

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
After you got big off
that one TV show

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
you’re starting to act
like a celebrity to me too.

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,000
I didn’t get big off the...

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
People are just now starting
to notice my swag TV show.

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,300
So, I was gonna say.

16
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,800
No, let’s end it here.

17
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,300
End what?

18
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,800
I changed my phone number.

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Again? Your fans found it, huh?

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Tell me your new number.

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
I’m not going to give
it to you. My new number.

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
What do you mean?

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,200
I changed my phone number but
I’m not going to give it to you.

24
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,400
Farewell, Kyungju!

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,400
Hey, Gunam! Gunam!

26
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
Hyung, hurry and
start the engine!

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Okay.

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,500
Your manager was waiting here?

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
You guys are too much!

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,960
As a major broadcasting company
producer, I apologize on his behalf.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,960
That’s really rude of you.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,000
You little!

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Are you the student
named Kyungju Kim?
