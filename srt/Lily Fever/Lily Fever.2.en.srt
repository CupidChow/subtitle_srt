1
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,460
Thank you.

2
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,000
That’s not yours.

3
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:54,980
Oh...

4
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,680
But, why do you keep speaking informally to me?

5
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,920
How old are you?

6
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,840
961030

7
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,900
What?

8
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,840
961030

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,740
Oh, then we’re the same age! 96…

10
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,760
1030

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,540
Then today is… today’s your birthday?

12
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,740
Oh, happy birthday!

13
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,280
Present.

14
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,500
What?

15
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
You came empty-handed?

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,200
Oh, well it’s not like I came knowing.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,800
But now you know.

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,160
You can’t force that.

19
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,920
Present!

20
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,260
Okay, wait a moment…

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,400
Look, I don’t have anything.

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,920
hiccup!

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,860
There’s a pressure point here 
If you press it, your hiccups will stop.

24
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,920
Where is she coming up with this bogus stuff?

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840
You’re quite good at demanding things.

26
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,100
Kyungju, you seem to be good at talking to yourself.

27
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,520
What? But I thought that in my head...

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,720
It’s so soft.

29
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,840
Eup!

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,860
What the.. what is happening…

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
Birthday present.

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,600
Oh, congratulations.

33
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
But still, what is this?

34
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,940
I’ve always wanted to try CPR.

35
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,020
That’s great but…

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,880
See, your hiccups stopped.

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,180
It really has.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,440
And… and…

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,060
and...
