do you like what I prepared?

I like anything you prepare.

Chen, your wedding robe

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,830
your heart pains
are becoming more frequent.

93
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
Could she be remembering something?

95
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,190
stays by my side like this,

100
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,430
to invite the Crown Prince
to discuss the wedding.

101
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,670
How dare you stop me!

102
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,670
By order of His Highness,

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,720
no one is allowed in or out
of the Eastern Palace.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,310
Please return.

105
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,200
Step aside!

106
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,600
Miss, let's go.

107
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,230
Chen.

108
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,350
Yao.

109
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,520
Why are you here?

110
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,000
Chen, you gave me a lantern,

111
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,870
so I made you a sachet

112
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,910
in return.

113
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,040
It smells so nice.

114
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,750
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

115
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,470
Since Yao gave it to me,

116
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,080
I'll wear it every day from now on.

117
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,550
Then let me put it on for you.

118
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,680
Alright.

119
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,630
Chen,

120
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,670
the weather has been so nice
these past few days.

121
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,170
I'd like to go out for a walk,

122
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,330
and maybe visit the market.

123
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,440
Is that alright?

124
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,750
Yao, be good.

125
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,200
Our wedding is approaching,

126
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,440
and those who've hurt you

127
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,320
are surely watching from the shadows.

128
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,030
The Eastern Palace
is the safest place right now.

129
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,510
After we're married,

130
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
I'll take you out
to ride horses and admire flowers.

131
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,630
Okay?

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
Your Highness!

133
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,350
Your Highness,

134
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,150
I know you're still upset with me,

135
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,790
But today, the Empress sent someone
to take our measurements for the wedding robes.

136
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,840
You must be present.

137
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,360
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

138
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm swamped with official duties today.

139
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,210
After court, I have
more important matters to attend to.

140
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,960
I must trouble you and my mother

141
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,240
to handle the wedding preparations.

142
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
But...

143
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,150
Isn't this our wedding?

144
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,160
Your Highness!

145
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,510
Your Excellency.

146
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,750
You said

147
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,270
the Eastern Palace
is also preparing for a wedding?

148
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,480
Yes, Your Excellency.

149
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,630
The people we sent

150
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,910
couldn't get close to the Eastern Palace,

151
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,870
but they kept watching them.

152
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,790
It seems those in charge of purchases

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,720
bought many festive items.

154
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,730
There's something suspicious going on.

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,360
Since it's my wedding,

156
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,600
I must find a way to see for myself.

157
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,960
(The Eastern Palace)

158
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,600
- Raise it a little higher over here.
- Alright.

159
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,150
Keep an eye on it.

160
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,550
I'll take this inside.

161
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,020
(Joy)

162
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,480
Is there something you need?

163
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,510
What is it?

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,720
Gu Junyao, what do you think I need?

165
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,630
Do you know me?

166
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,150
Do I know you?

167
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,240
Gu Junyao, do you know what you're talking?

168
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,800
No,

169
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,270
I haven't recognized you.

170
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,320
I thought you and my brother
were childhood sweethearts,

171
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,660
that you had feelings for him.

172
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,240
He was willing to sacrifice
the entire Defender Duke's Mansion for you.

173
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,550
But you?

174
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,030
You're here,

175
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,910
preparing for a wedding
with Yue Jinchen.

176
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,550
He's my fiancé!

177
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,320
And we, My brother and I,

178
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,750
are nothing but fools.

179
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Zhao Ming...

180
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,480
Zhao Ming...

181
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,200
You don't remember anything?

182
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,720
Chen said

183
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,150
I was injured by villains
and lost my memory.

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,030
Lost your memory?

185
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,160
Then,

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
do you remember the Gu family?

187
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,230
Gu Xunan,

188
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,000
your father?

189
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,550
You were just a pawn to him.

190
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,600
And your entire Gu family

191
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,440
was nothing more than a stepping stone
for Yue Jinchen to become Crown Prince.

192
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,030
The one who orchestrated all of this

193
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,790
is Yue Jinchen.

194
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,280
Your Highness!

195
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,680
Sister Yao!

196
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,390
Yue Jinchen,

197
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,200
you've deceived me so cruelly!

198
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,510
Miss! Miss! What's wrong?

199
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,940
- Zhao Li, leave now!
- Hurry, hurry!

200
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,390
- Miss!
- Get out of here, hurry!

201
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,600
Hurry, hurry!

202
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,000
- Miss!
- Miss,

203
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,440
- are you alright?
- Are you alright, Miss?

204
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,510
- What happened?
- What's going on?

205
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,150
- Miss.
- Are you alright, Miss?

206
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,080
Call the Imperial Physician!

207
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,140
(The Eastern Palace)

208
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,630
Your Highness.

209
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,080
Where is Yao?

210
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
I deserve to die.

211
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,440
Princess Zhao Li
disguised herself and got in.

212
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,510
She spoke a few words to the lady,

213
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,600
and the lady fainted.

214
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,910
The physician has already seen her.

215
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,960
She's not in serious condition,

216
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,030
just resting early.

217
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,200
Yao.

218
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,320
Chen,

219
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,440
I had a dream.

220
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
In the dream, you deceived me.

221
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,000
Everything was fake.

222
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,390
You and I were actually mortal enemies.

223
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,200
Dreams are always the opposite.

224
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,390
Yao is the one I care about most
in this life.

225
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,720
Even if I betray the entire world,

226
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,390
I will never betray you.

227
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,030
But every time I wake up,

228
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,440
my heart feels so uneasy.

229
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,600
You really won't lie to me, right?

230
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,510
If you lie to me,

231
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,670
I'll never forgive you in this lifetime.
