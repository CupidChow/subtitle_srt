00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,150
Zhao Li?

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,200
Sister Yao?

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,950
Slow down, don't fall down!

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,790
Catch me if you can!

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,790
Slow down. I can't keep up with you!

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,510
I told you to slow down!

25
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,760
Sister Yao,

26
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,910
you're so kind.

27
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,960
When we grow up,

28
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,120
it would be wonderful
if you could marry my brother.

29
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,280
What are you saying, silly girl?

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,200
Your Highness, I've told you
that you cannot enter without permission!

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,070
Chief Gu, are you alright?

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,120
I'm fine.

33
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,960
- You may leave now.
- Yes.

34
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,270
Come inside quickly.

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Sister Yao,

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,710
where have you been all these years?

37
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,470
My brother has been so worried about you.

38
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,560
Chief Gu?

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Sister Yao,

40
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,750
were they calling you?

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Yes.

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,870
Sister Yao is indeed Chief Gu.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
Yes.

44
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,910
I'm truly happy to see you again

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,030
after all these years.

46
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,870
But there's something

47
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,630
I need to ask you.

48
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,000
What is it?

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Feel free to ask.

50
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,630
Now that you've given me permission,

51
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,960
I'll speak plainly.

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Now

53
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm engaged to the Crown Prince.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,910
But I've heard

55
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,360
that there's a palace maid

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,150
who is very close to him.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,360
I want to know,

58
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,710
if you are the maid

59
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,430
who is always by his side?

60
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,640
Yes…

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,080
I see.

62
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,590
My brother and I thought you were dead.

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,520
For years,

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,910
on every Ghost Festival, Qingming Festival,

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,590
or your birthday,

66
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,120
my brother couldn't sleep,
tormented by thoughts of you.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
I was heartbroken too.

68
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,710
But I never imagined
that not only were you alive,

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,470
you had entered the Eastern Palace

70
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,680
and become a close confidante
of the Crown Prince.

71
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,430
Or rather,

72
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,360
his favored guest.

73
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,990
Zhao Li,

74
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,520
you've misunderstood me.

75
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
Misunderstood what?

76
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,430
Misunderstood that you
and the Crown Prince are innocent

77
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,430
and nothing more,

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,150
or you're not his favored guest?

79
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,150
Zhao Li,

80
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,080
listen to me.

81
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,040
My relationship with Yue Jinchen
is too complicated

82
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,360
to explain in a short time.

83
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,390
Yue Jinchen is not a good person.

84
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,800
If you marry him,

85
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,680
it might not be a good thing!

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,390
If I don't marry the Crown Prince,

87
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
does that mean you want
to marry him instead?

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,950
I would never marry him!

89
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,600
Sister, that's absurd.

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,630
You don't want to marry the Crown Prince,

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,560
yet you don't want to leave him either.

92
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,680
After all these years,

93
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,000
I thought you

94
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,270
were still the same sister I knew.

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,120
But I see

96
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,560
you've changed.

97
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,360
Staying here

98
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,870
is not my choice.

99
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,800
It's Yue Jinchen who really...

100
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,360
Enough! I don't want to hear any more!

101
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,950
Sister Yao,

102
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,750
we used to do everything
together as children.

103
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,070
I only ever wanted to confide in you.

104
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,790
I always thought

105
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,560
you would marry into my family

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
and become my sister-in-law.

107
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,270
But now

108
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,070
I see you had grander ambitions,

109
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
looking down on my brother.

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,360
My relationship with Zhao Ming
was never possible.

111
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,630
But things are not as you think.

112
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,760
Zhao Li,

113
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,630
Yue Jinchen is not a good person.

114
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,000
He's deep and scheming,

115
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,000
He's not what he appears to be
on the surface!

116
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,310
I told you,

117
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,800
I don't want to hear you
slandering the Crown Prince anymore.

118
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,120
Your Highness?

119
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,390
Who gave you permission t
o act so recklessly in the Eastern Palace?

120
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,230
Your Highness, I...

121
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,560
- Get out.
- Your Highness, I...

122
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
This is the Eastern Palace,

123
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,000
not your mansion.

124
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,000
Zhao Li, leave now.

125
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,070
- Yao...
- Yue Jinchen.

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,310
So you've been deceiving Zhao Li

127
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,600
while keeping me imprisoned?

128
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,560
I'm only doing this...

129
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,680
Everyone who cares about you

130
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,240
ends up being used by you,

131
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,430
turned into nothing
but pawns in your game.

132
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,910
(Yao)

133
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,160
(What should I do?)

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,580
Poison Mandarin Ducks and Forgotten Love Water

135
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,770
(The Secret Poisons of Yueying)
are two legendary secret poisons.

136
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,640
(- Forgotten Love Water)
are two legendary secret poisons.

137
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,910
It's said they can control one's mind.

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,870
Those who are poisoned

139
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,560
will only listen to the one
who poisoned them,

140
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,360
obeying all commands without resistance.

141
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
However,

142
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,040
the one whose blood is used
to bind the Poison Mandarin Ducks

143
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,360
will have their life shortened.

144
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,070
No one who's experienced it
has lived past the age of forty.

145
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,160
Poison Mandarin Ducks and
Forgotten Love Water are not ordinary.

146
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
Poison Mandarin Ducks

147
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,480
shares emotions,

148
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,190
joy, and sorrow.

149
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,240
Forgotten Love Water

150
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,360
erases past memories,

151
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,270
forgetting everything.

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Poison Mandarin Ducks only works
with my blood as the binder.

153
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,950
Once she forgets everything,

154
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,480
she'll love me only.

155
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,160
Your Highness, you must not!

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,040
Are you willing to risk your life?

157
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,360
Back then, my mother wanted
to use this on my father,

158
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,480
but she only wanted him

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
to feel her happiness,

160
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,600
not her sorrow.

161
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,920
So she hesitated and never used it.

162
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,040
In the end, the Empress found out,

163
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,560
accused her of practicing witchcraft,

164
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,560
and she was sentenced to death.

165
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,510
So I mustn't be soft-hearted.

166
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
I need Yao to forget everything,

167
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,160
so that

168
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,150
we can be together forever.

169
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,150
Your Highness, if you use the poison,

170
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,600
it will backfire on you.

171
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,320
As long as I can be with her,

172
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,390
what does it matter if I only live to forty?

173
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,040
That's enough.

174
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,040
Your Highness...

175
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Leave.

176
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,110
Yes.

177
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,840
(Poison Mandarin Ducks)

178
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,750
(Forgotten Love Water)

179
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
(Yao)

180
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
(We can start over)

181
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,110
My lady,

182
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,960
please have some.

183
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,000
Or I'll be punished again today.

184
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,510
Has she eaten?

185
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,200
Replying to Your Highness,

186
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,030
Chief Gu ate everything.

187
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,910
I watched her finish it.

188
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,320
Yao,

189
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,790
after tonight,

190
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,630
we can start over.

191
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,440
Yao.

192
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Yao, you're awake.

193
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,040
Who are you?

194
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,030
You don't remember me?

195
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
That's wonderful.

196
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,440
You...

197
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,910
You're hurting me.

198
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm sorry, Yao.

200
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,790
Yao?

201
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,510
Who is Yao?

202
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,750
This place...

203
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,480
Where am I?

204
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,150
I am Yue Jinchen,

205
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,600
the Crown Prince.

206
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,150
You are my betrothed.

207
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,320
We've known each other since childhood,

208
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,670
and were engaged long ago.

209
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,000
But because I made enemies at court,

210
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
you were kidnapped

211
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,960
by villains

212
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,910
and fell off a cliff.

213
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,270
You've been unconscious ever since.

214
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
The physician said

215
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,080
you might lose your memory.

216
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,360
I didn't expect...

217
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry, Yao,

218
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,670
for the suffering you've endured.

219
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,670
From now on,

220
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,150
I will never let you be wronged again.

221
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,870
We're getting... married?

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,840
Yes,

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,030
we're getting married.

224
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,000
Now that you're awake,

225
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,870
we should proceed with our wedding.

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Once we're married,

227
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,670
everything will be in its proper place,

228
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,200
and I'll feel secure.

229
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,240
But who am I?

230
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,270
Am I only your betrothed?

231
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,800

your past

235
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,670
was too painful.

236
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,630

are better left forgotten.

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,720

Yao, look.

254

This pear tree,

255
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,550
I planted it myself for you long ago.

256
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,200
It's in full bloom now.

257
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,150
I like this pear tree.

258
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,030
It smells so nice.

259
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,240
Like home.

260
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,720
Because this is our home.

261
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,910
Soon,

262
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,790
I'll use its blossoms
to make pear flower candy.

263
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,750
In the past, during our leisure time,

264
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,480
we would sit here
playing chess and drinking tea.

265
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,390
You would cook soup for me,

266
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,480
and I would tell you stories from books.

267
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,920
Then

268
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,120
I'll continue making soup for you.

269
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,230
And

270
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,720
I'll slowly tell you all about our past,

271
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,360
so you can remember everything.

272
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,920
Yao,

273
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,710
it's so good to have you.

274
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,110
By the way,

275
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,480
you've just recovered,

276
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,960
and you need to be more cautious.

277
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,120
Stay in the mansion today
and prepare for the wedding.

278
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,510
Just don't go out.

279
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,320
You can send the servants
to buy whatever you need.

280
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,550
I can't imagine

281
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,440
what I'd do

282
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,710
if anything happened to you again.

283
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,110
Alright.

284
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,870
Your Highness.

285
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,440
Your Highness,

286
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,630
are you alright?

287
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,000
So this is the suffering
of the Poison Mandarin Ducks.

288
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,280
(Doesn't matter)

289
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,960
(Sharing feelings with Yao)

290
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,960
(This pain is nothing)

291
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,600
Your Highness,
why put yourself through this?

292
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,160
Your marriage
with Princess Zhao Li is imminent.

293
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,440
The Empress, who has been under house arrest,

294
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,310
has returned from the temple
to oversee the wedding.

295
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,960
All eyes are on your every move.

296
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,110
And here you are,

297
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,550
not only avoiding the preparations
for your marriage to Princess Zhao Li,

298
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,590
but also hiding someone here.

299
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,960
If the Empress found out
that Gu Junyao is in the Eastern Palace,

300
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,070
it would be difficult to manage the situation.

301
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,990
The Eastern Palace is now
filled with the Dark Blades.

302
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,880
No one will know that Yao is here,

303
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,240
and no one can take her away.

304
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,080
But Your Highness,

305
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,310
your marriage with Princess Zhao Li…

306
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,510
Or do you want both?

307
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,030
Zhao Li's situation requires the right timing.

308
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,030
For now,

309
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,600
