=Episode 23=

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,310
This is the Reminiscence Incense.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,600
Yes, Your Highness.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,070
It is a unique incense
from the Western Regions.

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,270
It's non-toxic and harmless.

23
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,600
But

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,350
it has the effect
of amplifying a person's emotions,

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,610
bringing up their most unforgettable memories.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,880
Good.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,600
Find an opportunity

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,760
to light it in Yao's chamber.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,560
But, Your Highness,

30
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,560
aren't you afraid that if she smells it,

31
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,380
she'll hate you even more?

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
It's already as bad as it can get.

33
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,430
How much worse could it possibly be?

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
(Why am I having these dreams?)

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,630
(Could it be that I'm still clinging
to the past?)

36
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,030
What are you doing?

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
In response, Miss.

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,800
His Highness ordered us

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,960
to come and decorate your chamber.

40
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
Take them away!

41
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,470
I don't want to see any of this!

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,590
Please forgive us, Miss.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,590
But these are His Highness's orders.

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,310
If we remove them without permission,

45
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,030
we fear His Highness will be angry.

46
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,430
Fine,

47
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,840
do as you wish.

48
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,520
- Thank you, Miss.
- Thank you, Miss.

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,920
Wait.

50
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,030
Everything else is fine.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Take that lantern away.

52
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,870
I don't want to see it.

53
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes, Miss.

54
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,870
Your Highness,

55
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,430
everything has been returned.

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,630
Yet you seem pleased?

57
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,710
Out of all these things,

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,360
only the lantern was returned.

59
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,590
Do you know

60
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,470
what that means?

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,310
I do not, Your Highness.

62
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,080
It means she still cares about me.

63
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,120
She kept everything else,

64
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,560
but couldn't bear to keep the lantern.

65
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,120
If she didn't care,

66
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,190
she wouldn't have bothered to return it.

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,750
It means she still remembers.

68
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,120
And as long as she remembers,

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,270
there's still hope.

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,710
But, Your Highness,

71
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,800
if she remembers,

72
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,800
won't she hate you even more?

73
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,430
And be less likely to forgive you?

74
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,070
Do you know what the greatest punishment

75
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,680
for someone is?

76
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,270
It's forgetting him.

77
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,480
As long as Yao still remembers me,

78
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,360
there's still a chance.

79
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,110
Shiba,

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,520
prepare my horse.

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,640
I'm going to the palace.

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,840
Yes.

83
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,590
Your Highness.

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,560
Greetings to you, Father.

85
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,720
Rise, Chen.

86
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,950
What brings you

87
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,950
here today?

88
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,600
I've come to ask Father

89
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,600
to bestow a marriage upon me.

90
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Bestow a marriage?

91
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,270
That's right.

92
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,680
I recall

93
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,750
that the Crown Princess
initially chosen for you

94
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,480
was the Defender Duke's only daughter.

95
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,070
But it seems she was not fit
for such a position,

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,480
certainly unworthy of you, my Chen.

97
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
Very well.

98
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,870
You're getting older.

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,680
It's indeed time for you to marry.

100
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,830
But tell me,

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,630
which young lady has captured your heart?

102
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,510
The daughter of the
former imperial physician Gu Xun'an,

103
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,720
Gu Junyao.

104
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,310
Say that again?

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,750
The daughter of the former imperial physician
Gu Xun'an, Gu Junyao.

106
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,040
She was nearly chosen
as one of my concubines.

107
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,870
How could she become your Crown Princess?

108
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,200
Do you want to make a laughingstock

109
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,160
of me across the nation?

110
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,600
But Father, my feelings for her
are deep and unwavering.

111
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,950
I've decided that I will marry no one but her.

112
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
You...

113
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,230
(Yao,)

114
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,720
(if we were granted this marriage,)

115
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,120
(would you be happy?)

116
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,110
(Why...)

117
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,120
(Why am I thinking about this?)

118
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,510
(This scent... it's strange.)

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,270
(So it was the incense after all...)

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,840
- Miss!
- Miss!

121
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,390
What's wrong?

122
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,270
Yao.

123
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,520
Yao, what's wrong?

124
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,630
This tree is dead...

125
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,750
How can people still be alive?

126
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,270
Miss Gu, let us help you get dressed?

127
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
What for?

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,920
I'm not going anywhere.

129
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,870
The Crown Prince has ordered it.

130
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,200
The carriage is already prepared.

131
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,960
If you're not in the carriage

132
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,360
when the Crown Prince finishes court,

133
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,440
- we...
- Say no more.

134
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,670
Yao, we've arrived.

135
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,470
Where are we?

136
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,750
Come down, and you'll see.

137
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,340
(The Grave of the Late
Gu Xun'an and Lady Gu)

138
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,790
The case against the Gu family
has been overturned.

139
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,720
Their name cleared.

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,750
But we've all been so preoccupied lately,

141
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,270
we couldn't come earlier.

142
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,670
I found some of your parents' belongings
in the old mansion

143
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,630
and set up this cenotaph.

144
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,150
So in the future,

145
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,510
if you want to pay your respects,

146
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,480
you'll have a place to go.

147
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,030
A cenotaph?

148
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,910
You and I both know

149
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,150
that my parents' bodies
were scattered in the mass graves.

150
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,670
There's no place for them to rest.

151
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,550
I want to take Yao for a walk.

152
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
You don't need to follow.

153
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,320
Your Highness, it's dangerous

154
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,680
out here in the wild.

155
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,280
It's fine.

156
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,200
I'll protect Yao.

157
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,230
Yao,

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
you've always said
you wanted to go out and see.

159
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,120
I found this place by chance,

160
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,710
so I thought

161
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,550
I'd bring you here to see it.

162
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,790
Time has passed.

163
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,750
The weather has turned cold.

164
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,200
It's not the right season to be out.

165
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,200
It doesn't matter.

166
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,480
Next year,

167
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,750
this place will be full of cherry blossoms.

168
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,320
We can come back then.

169
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,480
You're the Crown Prince, the future emperor.

170
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,270
There won't be a next time for us.

171
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,440
Yao, are you upset
that I haven't given you a proper title?

172
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,790
That was my oversight.

173
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,120
I should have given you
the wedding you deserve.

174
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
I told you,

175
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,630
whatever I want,

176
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,440
I will get it.

177
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,440
Is that so?

178
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,490
♪A gentle evening breeze blows♪

179
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,380
♪And the pear blossoms fell like frost♪

180
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,410

♪Each time the flowers bloom♪

183
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,470
Don't leave.

184
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,840
Yue Jinchen,

185
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,150
why won't you let me go?

186
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
I suddenly remembered

187
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,630
that night in the Imperial Prison.

188
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,870
