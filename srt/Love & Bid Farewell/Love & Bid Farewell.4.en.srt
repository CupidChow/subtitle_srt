00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,150
Is Princess Yingge here?

20
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,190
Come in.

21
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,760
What brings you here, Your Highness?

22
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,590
I have some ointment from the palace.

23
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,310
I thought it might be good for your injury.

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,760
So I brought it to you.

25
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,420
(Prescription)

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,790
It's Imperial Physician Gu's handwriting.

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,950
Do you know him?

29
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,990
How did you get this prescription?

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,280
Years ago, Physician Gu traveled to Yueying

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,750
and saved my life.

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,910
I found this in the secret chamber

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,590
of the Third Prince's residence.

34
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,150
So, your visit to my brother's residence

35
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,680
was to investigate the case of the Gu family?

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,990
Precisely.

37
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,120
The savior I mentioned was Physician Gu.

38
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,800
I'll take the ointment.

39
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
Good day.

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Princess,

42
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,360
do you see anything unusual
in the prescription?

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,960
I do not.

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,400
If the prescription reveals nothing,

45
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,470
maybe you should check the records
of the medical staff on duty that day.

46
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,310
Finding that person

47
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,870
might yield some answers.

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,520
I'll be back shortly.

49
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,680
You are still recovering.

50
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,550
It's fine.

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,520
Are you Huang Lian?

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I am.

53
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,310
Who are you?

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,430
Did you decoct and deliver the medicine

55
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,280
prescribed by Physician Gu?

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,590
I did.

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,630
(Prescription)
Is this the prescription back then?

58
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,190
Well…

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,630
It was so long ago.

60
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,800
I don't recall.

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,710
The Gu family's massacre
was widely known back then.

62
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,870
If you were truly uninvolved,

63
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,150
why did you hide?

64
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,920
It's true

65
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,190
that I decocted the medicine

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,590
according to Physician Gu's prescription.

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,520
But after it was prepared,

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,150
someone else snatched it.

69
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,270
Who did it?

70
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,160
An ordinary palace guard at the time,

71
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,000
who is now General Jiang He,

72
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,430
promoted by the Chancellor.

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,120
The Chancellor?

74
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,680
Why didn't you say anything back then?

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,600
I was just a decoctor.

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,640
Besides...

77
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,480
Besides, you took their bribe, didn't you?

78
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
I had to take it or die.

79
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,680
I had no idea

80
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,390
that the Gu family would be wiped out
because of that.

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,070
I beg for your mercy.

82
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,800
I had no choice.

83
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,390
If I hadn't complied,

84
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,510
my family and I would have been killed.

85
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,870
Keep this secret,

86
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,670
and I won't kill you.

87
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,720
I will.

88
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,560
Hold on a moment, lady.

89
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,040
There's a price

90
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,630
on your head.

91
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,190
See if you can take it.

92
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,870

Help!

116
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,040
Run.

117
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,950
(Don't kill them.)

118
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,000
(Don't kill them.)

119
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,590
You're awake.

120
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,230
You're seriously injured.

121
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,230
Stay put.

122
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,510
Where am I?

123
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,640
Don't worry.

124
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,030
You're safe.

125
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,190
Why are you here, Your Highness?

126
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,680
Someone sent a letter to my palace,

127
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,750
asking me to come here for you.

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,680
(It must be Dieling.)

129
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
The Lantern Festival?

130
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,870
How long have I been unconscious?

131
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,600
A day and a night.

132
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,870
- Bravo!
- Great!

133
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,360
Amazing.

134
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you all right?

135
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,120
Thank you.

136
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,560
Did you hurt yourself?

137
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,630
Did the lantern break?

138
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,080
It's fine.

139
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,320
If it's broken, I will make you another one.

140
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you, lady.

141
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,670
Goodbye.

142
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,960
Are you all right?

143
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,150
Bravo!

144
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,270
Do you want a rabbit lantern, Princess?

145
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,750
That's not what I'm thinking, Your Highness.

146
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,720
I've long outgrown the age for that.

147
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,240
But you miss that time.

148
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,740
Great.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,550
To repay Physician Gu for saving your life,

150
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,270
- you didn't hesitate to risk yourself.
- More!

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Your determination

152
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,630
is truly admirable.

153
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,390
What do you mean, Your Highness?

154
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,710
You once said

155
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,630
you are not the Princess of Yueying.

156
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,030
And I recall that Physician Gu had a daughter.

157
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
If she were still alive,

158
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,930
Lanterns.

159
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,390
- she would be…
- Nice lanterns.

160
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,870
of the same age as you.

161
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,930
Wonderful.

162
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,270
The Gu family was wiped out that night,

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,440
leaving no survivors.

164
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,390
What if one or two got out that night?

165
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,720
Since we are allies,

166
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,550
can't we be honest with each other?

167
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,600
Look at those two,

168
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,550
shamelessly flirting in public.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
What a degenerate age.

170
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,870
Since we are allies,

171
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,510
we should stop speculating about each other.

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,280
As my ally,

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,550
you should be truthful with me.

174
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,440
If you act this way,

175
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,960
how can I trust you?

176
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,720
If you know the truth,

177
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,360
why bother with this pretense?

178
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,960
Do you intend to report me

179
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,800
or

180
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,320
use this against me?

181
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,720
Since we are allies,

182
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,870
why do I go against you?

183
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,390
The Incident of Zhaotian Tower

184
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,600
also took away someone important to me.

185
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,390
Now, I am certain

186
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,510
that no one is more suitable

187
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,320
to be my ally than you, Princess.

188
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,790
May we both

189
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,840
achieve our goals.

190
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,630
The Gu family

191
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,750
could get their revenge soon.

192
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,390
The Northwatch has triumphed!

193
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,840
The Northwatch has triumphed!

194
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
The Northwatch has triumphed.

195
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,840
The Northwatch has triumphed.

196
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,630
General Zhao Ming
from the Defender Duke's family

197
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,910
has returned in triumph.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,240
This time, he has reclaimed the border.

199
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,120
General Zhao Ming is truly a military genius.

200
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,790
Now, everyone calls him the Young Ares.

201
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,510
He's so young and yet so accomplished.

202
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,000
If only I could marry him.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,030
(General Zhao Ming of the Great Dynasty)
That's why he's called

204
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,660
the Adonis of Wrath.

205
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,080
I heard that a princess from a foreign land,

206
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,270
upon seeing him on the battlefield,

207
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,890
was so captivated
that she demanded to marry him.
