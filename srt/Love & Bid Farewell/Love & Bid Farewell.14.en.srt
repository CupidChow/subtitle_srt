Wait a moment.

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
Go in.

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,840
Manager Gu,

29
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,190
this is today's lunch.

30
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,990
Leave it there.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
Yes.

32
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,840
Manager Gu, please have some.

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,120
There's pickled bamboo shoots
and quail today,

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,910
a dish you used to love.

35
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,240
Leave now.

36
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,310
Yes.

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Today, at the west gate
of the Eastern Palace,

38
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,590
meet me at noon.

39
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,990
Zhao Ming!

40
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,310
Yao,

41
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,710
are you alright?

42
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,550
I thought you...

43
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,400
This isn't the time to talk.

44
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,150
Let's leave here first.

45
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,640
Alright.

46
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,360
Your Highness,
you must be exhausted today.

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,520
How is His Majesty's condition?

48
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,510
Father's illness is very strange.

49
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,710
It doesn't seem like a sickness,

50
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,800
more like he's been poisoned.

51
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,000
Poisoned?

52
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,270
Could it be Her Grace?

53
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,430
Let's wait and see.

54
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,510
How is Yao? Is she alright?

55
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,350
She is doing quite well.

56
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,750
I heard she even finished
all the lunch sent to her today.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Her appetite is quite good.

58
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,920
You said she ate?

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,600
She finished everything?

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,510
That's what the Dark Blade reported.

61
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
Let's go back to the palace.

62
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,230
What's going on?

63
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,070
All the Dark Blades were...

64
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,910
Your Highness…

65
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,080
Find her.

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,750
Everyone, go out and search.

67
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,030
Yes.

68
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,270
Your Highness,

69
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,040
when you say everyone,

70
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,240
do you mean even the Dark...

71
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,600
I said everyone!

72
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,560
Yes!

73
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
The more people around,
the safer we'll be.

74
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,440
Let's go.

75
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,320
Your Highness,

76
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,440
aren't we pursuing outside the city?

77
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,400
Can you smell it?

78
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,880
What?

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
The calming incense.

80
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,430
It's always burning in Yao's room,

81
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,070
so naturally, she's carrying that scent.

82
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
Your Highness,

83
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,590
is it here?

84
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,000
Over there.

85
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Yao!

86
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,790
Yao,

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,950
you stay here for now.

88
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,510
The city is under lockdown.

89
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,160
I'll find a way

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,830
to get you out of this place later.

91
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,430
Thank you, Brother Zhao Ming.

92
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,360
There's no need for such formalities
between us.

93
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,950
Yue Jinchen will surely suspect me

94
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,680
when he finds out you're gone.

95
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,680
I must return to the Mansion quickly.

96
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
This place is secluded; he won't guess it.

97
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,960
Rest easy here.

98
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,880
Alright.

99
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,430
General Zhao Ming, you're finally back.

100
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,040
What is the meaning of this, Your Highness?

101
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,270
Where is Yao?

102
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,040
Where have you hidden her?

103
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
Strange,

104
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,950
Yao is ill in the palace.

105
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,840
I couldn't even see her myself.

106
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
I don't understand
what you're saying, Your Highness.

107
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,150
Do you understand now?

108
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
I know you've hidden Yao.

109
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,750
You don't have to hand her over.

110
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,510
But for every day you hide her,

111
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,440
I will kill one person in your mansion.

112
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,840
When everyone in your mansion is dead,

113
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
Yao will have no choice but to come out.

114
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,030
Am I right?

115
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,030
Let me advise you, Your Highness.

116
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,720
The Defender Duke's Mansion
is loyal only to His Majesty.

117
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,360
We fear no threats.

118
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,630
Then let's wait and see.

119
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,990
Oh,

120
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,270
and I wonder if the Duke himself

121
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,790
is as fearless as you say.

122
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,270
Lady, please help!

123
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,200
Aren't you the steward
of the Defender Duke's Mansion?

124
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,280
Please, stand up.

125
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,160
What's going on?

126
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,910
The Seventh Prince came to the Mansion.

127
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,030
He said if the General
doesn't hand over you,

128
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,320
he'll kill one person
in the Mansion each day.

129
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,480
The General is risking his life,

130
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,440
and the Mansion is in grave danger!

131
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,240
I understand.

132
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,870
I'll go with you.

133
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,270
Thank you.

134
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
(Yue Jinchen,)

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,720
(to you, everyone's life)

136
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,630
(is worthless, right?)

137
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,440
(You're using this to force me.)

138
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,500
(The Eastern Palace)

139
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,390
Yao,

140
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,350
you're back.

141
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
How despicable!

142
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,670
At least you've returned.

143
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,320
I didn't expect Zhao Ming

144
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,480
to be so important to you.

145
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
Let go of me!

146
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,080
Put me down!

147
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,320
Yue Jinchen, don't forget,

148
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,240
you're already betrothed to Zhao Li.

149
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,840
If word of this gets out,

150
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,720
your alliance with the Defender Duke
will be in jeopardy.

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,510
And your ambition to conquer the world

152
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,670
will be shattered.

153
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,960
Can you bear that?

154
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
Even now,

155
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,240
you are still thinking of me.

156
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,200
Conquering the world?

157
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,510
If I lose the Defender Duke's support,
I have other ways.

158
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,390
But right now,

159
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,030
I just want to live up to your care.

160
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,300
Are you crazy?!

161
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,390
If you weren't planning to escape,

162
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,360
I wouldn't have lost my mind!

163
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,440
Be good.

164
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,630
You're really heartless.

165
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,270
Do you want to trap me here?

166
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,870
