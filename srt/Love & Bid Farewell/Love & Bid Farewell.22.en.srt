00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,430

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,150
it's already the afternoon.

00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,710
Afternoon?

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,310
(It's already afternoon?)

(Have I really slept

28
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,990
You shouldn't get up.

29
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,790
The physician repeatedly warned us

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,510
that your body is weak right now,

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,480
And you need to rest.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,710
It's best if you don't leave the bed.

33
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,310

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,990
Please accept my condolences, Miss.

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,030
Gone...

36
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
It's good that it's gone.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
I'm free.

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,120
I'm completely free now.

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Miss,

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
please don't be like this.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,240
The physician warned us

42
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,310
that you shouldn't get too emotional right now.

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,870
If you do,

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,240
it could

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,000
cause long-term health issues.

46
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,840
Long-term health issues...

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,680
For someone like me,

48
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,590
it would be better to die than to live.

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
Your Highness.

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,520
Leave us.

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,680
Yes.

52
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,520
- Yao.
- Get out!

53
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,840
I came to ask you,

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,520
what exactly happened?

55
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,030
What happened?

56
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,520
You came to ask me what happened?

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,520
Fine,

58
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,080
let me tell you.

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,680
Zhao Li is dead too.

60
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,310
Zhao Li's death was an accident.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,630
What you need to do now

62
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,080
is take care of yourself.

63
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,710
Take care of myself?

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,520
Zhao Li, Zhao Ming-

65
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,710
What did they do wrong?

66
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,840
How innocent they were!

67
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,630
Just because they were close to me,

68
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,750

doesn't deserve to have children.

We don't deserve
to have children in this life.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,830

killed our child, didn't you?

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,030

how can I win back Yao's heart?

165
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,910

169
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,120

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,960
Yes,

171
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,390
our Crown Prince

172
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,870
treats her so well,

173
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,200
hiding her here

174
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,000
and having you watch over her
day and night.

175
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,150
I've heard His Highness's fiancée is gone.

176
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,720
With how much His Highness favors that lady,

177
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,270
he might make her the Crown Princess.

178
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,910
If that happens,
you'll be the greatest hero among us.

179
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
We'll all rely on you then.

180
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,870

181
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,840
That's just wishful thinking.

182
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,120
You're so naive.

183
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,320
What do you mean?

184
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,870
Sure, the Crown Prince favors her now,

185
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,720
but he keeps her locked away
in the Eastern Palace,

186
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,790
never letting her step outside.

187
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,550
Who knows

188
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,480
there's even such a favored lady?

189
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,480
It's clear that her status can't be told.

190
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,200
The Crown Prince keeps her

191
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,270
like a caged bird,

192
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,150
something to toy with, nothing more.

193
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,870
If she dreams of becoming Crown Princess,

194
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,790
that's absolutely impossible.

195
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,870
Your Highness!

196
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,270
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

197
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,040
Are you Cuiju?

198
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Yes, Your Highness.

199
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,050
You've been in the palace for years.

200
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,200
Do you know the punishment
for gossiping about your superiors?

201
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,960
I know my mistake!

202
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,960
I know my mistake!

203
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,390
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

204
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,440
Shiba,

205
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,110
take her away

206
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,280
and give her fifty lashes.

207
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,390
Yes.

208
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,150
I know my mistake!

209
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,320
Please forgive me!

210
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,390
Your Highness, have mercy!

211
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,480
Your Highness!

212
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,150
They were right.

213
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,200
I should give Yao a proper status.

214
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,470
Your Highness.

215
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,960
Please have mercy on me.

216
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,600
Please stop crying.

217
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,600
What's wrong?

218
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,320
Where's Cuiju?

219
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,670
Cuiju neglected her duties yesterday,

220
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,240
so she was given fifty lashes

221
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,750
and expelled from the Eastern Palace.

222
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,670
She won't be taking care of you anymore.

223
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,440
If anything happens to you today,

224
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,240
I'm afraid I'll be the next
to get fifty lashes.

225
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,510
(Yue Jinchen...)

226
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,750
(You're so two-faced.)

227
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,360
(This is your true nature.)

228
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,910
(I should have known.)

229
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,710
Miss.

230
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,280
Alright,

231
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,000
I won't cry anymore.

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,250
(Praying that I can repay
what I owe Zhao Ming in the next life.)

233
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,980
(Guilty friend Gu Junyao in tears.)

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Now that I'm trapped in this Eastern Palace,

235
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,750
I might never leave.

236
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
But these things,

237
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,630
they don't belong here.

238
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,840
If I burn them here,

239
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,000
they won't carry my thoughts
to those I've lost.

240
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,440
So I want to ask you,

241
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,360
please take them outside the palace,

242
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,840
find a quiet place and burn them,

243
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,750
as a final tribute to my lost friends.

244
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,270
Miss, I...

245
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,870
I know it's a lot to ask.

246
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,270
But I have nothing else to offer.

247
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,200
This is all I have left.

248
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,000
Can you help me?

249
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,270
Miss, you ask too much.

250
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,270
Your Highness.

251
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,270
I heard Yao is willing to eat now.

252
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,870
Yao really listens.

253
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,790
If I didn't eat,

254
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,630
you'd take it out
on the people around me again.

255
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,120
If this goes on,

256
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,390
I'll be carrying the weight of all these lives.

257
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,350
What do you mean?

258
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,750
You know exactly what I mean, so why ask?

259
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,480
I really don't understand.

260
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,960
Fine.

261
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,850
If you really don't understand,

262
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,320
let me remind you.

263
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,200
Where is Cuiju?

264
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,320
So that's what this is about.

265
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,030
Cuiju spoke ill of you,

266
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,120
so I gave her a minor punishment.

267
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,200
Enough!

268
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,350
I'm sick of this.

269
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,150
I can't bear it anymore.

270
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,750
I know you're now the Crown Prince,

271
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,480
you hold all the power,
and no one dares defy you.

272
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,390
But I'm asking you,

273
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,670
please don't use me as an excuse

274
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,870
to hurt others.

275
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,120
I've had enough of this guilt.

276
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,450
(Praying that I can repay
what I owe Zhao Ming in the next life.)

(Guilty friend Gu Junyao in tears.)

278
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,270
You just can't forget him, can you?

279
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,030
I just can't.
