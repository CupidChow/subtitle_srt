19
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,120
Let go of me!

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,760
Let go.

21
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,320
Let go!

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,480
Murderer!

23
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,150
I will kill you!

24
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,790
You'll pay for this.

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,920
So, you really had an affair with him.

26
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,120
That's right, I love Zhao Ming.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,350
He's a thousand times better than you.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,400
You will never measure up to him!

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,840
- Did you hear that?
- Shut up!

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,230
Even if he's dead now,

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,000
he will always live in my heart.

32
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,230
Did you hear me?

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,590
I said shut up!

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,240
What are you going to do?

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm going to make you completely mine.

36
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,190
Yao, don't be afraid.

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,030
I'll be gentle.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,400
It won't hurt at all.

39
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,630
Miss Gu, everything here
was arranged by His Highness.

40
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,600
From now on,
this room is exclusively for you.

41
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,870
You're a noble lady,

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,830
and we servants are just simple folks.

43
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,120
If you were to accidentally hurt yourself

44
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,920
on something sharp in this room,

45
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
even if we had eight heads,

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,950
it wouldn't be enough to save us.

47
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,270
Is that so?

48
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,680
Of course it is.

49
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,430
We won't disturb your rest any longer,

50
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,920
so we'll take our leave.

51
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,270
Yue Jinchen,

52
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,390
are you afraid I'll take my own life?

53
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,540
(The Defender Duke's Mansion)

54
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,920
By the Emperor's command:

55
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,360
The Defender Duke has grown old

56
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,800
and has lived in the capital for many years.

57
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,720
Recently, I've heard
that illness has been overtaking him,

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,510
and he no longer has the strength
to serve.

59
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,480
I sympathize greatly.

60
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,800
It is said

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,480
that retiring to one's home

62
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,630
is the ultimate fortune.

63
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,680
Therefore, I grant him permission
to retire to his hometown,

64
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,160
to fulfill the bond
between ruler and subject.

65
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,070
Thus, it is decreed.

66
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,560
Father!

67
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
Father!

68
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,680
Congratulations, Your Highness,

69
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
you've removed another obstacle

70
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
in your path.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,080
Your wish has been fulfilled.

72
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,960
Shiba,

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,240
what have I always taught you?

74
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,160
A centipede dies

75
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,680
but never falls.

76
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,430
There's only one person left:

77
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,390
The Empress.

78
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,000
Only when she truly
breathes her last breath

79
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,680
will I consider it a victory.

80
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,430
Yes, Your Highness.

81
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,270
You may all leave.

82
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Yes.

83
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,680
My good son,

84
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,920
what brings you here today to visit me?

85
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,270
I've come

86
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,630
under Father's orders

87
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,950
to send you off on your final journey.

88
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,830
Impossible.

89
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,510
His Majesty would never
sentence me to death.

90
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,600
I am the Empress,

91
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,430
the Empress of this nation.

92
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,720
It's impossible
that he would order my death.

93
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,120
It must be you.

94
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,310
You've poisoned the Emperor's mind
with your lies.

95
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,120
That's why he's doing this to me!

96
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,040
I should

97
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,950
have eliminated you back then,

98
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,270
sent you to join your cursed mother!

99
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,870
That's right.

100
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,750
Just as my mother was falsely accused
and died a tragic death,

101
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,440
you deserve nothing
less than the same fate.

102
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,600
One wrong move,

103
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,200
and I lose the entire game.

104
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,390
(It's over.)

105
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,960
(The inner demons
that tormented me for so many years)

106
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,000
(have finally been vanquished today.)

107
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,360
Congratulations, Your Highness.

108
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,040
Let's return to the palace.

109
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,150
I want to see Yao.

110
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,480
Your Highness.

111
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
Yes.

112
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,960
Don't come any closer!

113
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,990
You'll catch a cold
sitting on the floor for too long.

114
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,200
Let go. Let go!

115
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,790
Go away! Go away!

116
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,750
Let go! Go away!

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,750
Go away!

118
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,720
Miss Gu is imprisoned here every day.

119
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,790
- It's worse than death.
- Let go of me!

120
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,790
You say the Crown Prince

121
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,390
is known for being cold

122
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,870
and emotionless,

123
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,440
yet he's constantly
losing his temper with her.

124
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,480
Cold and emotionless?
He's a ticking time bomb around here.

125
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,480
He's trying to keep her here by force,

126
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,000
but she'll only end up hating him more.

127
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,750
It's nothing but a cursed fate,

128
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,550
a lifetime of mutual torment.

129
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,630
Your Highness.

130
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,510
Take good care of her.

131
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,240
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,670
- Miss Gu!
- Miss Gu!

133
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,480
- Miss Gu!
- Miss Gu! Miss Gu!

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,390
This is bad, Miss Gu has fainted.

135
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,000
Last time, when Miss Gu
used a broken bowl

136
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,910
to cut her wrist,

137
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,030
His Highness went into a rage

138
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,910
and punished everyone in the palace.

139
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,120
Now that she's fainted,

140
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,150
what should we do?

141
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,550
Let's quickly inform His Highness.

142
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,630
Congratulations, Your Highness.

143
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,440
Miss Gu is pregnant.

144
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,320
Are you sure?

145
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,390
Yao is really pregnant?

146
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,030
That's right, Your Highness.

147
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,440
Miss Gu's pulse is steady,

148
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,120
and her heartbeat is strong and vigorous,

149
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,600
just like the pulse

150
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,360
of someone who is pregnant.

151
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,510
Yao,

152
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,320
did you hear that?

153
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
- We...
- Your Highness,

154
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
may I have a word with you in private?

155
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,630
What is it?

156
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,150
Your Highness,

157
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,270
although Chief Gu is indeed pregnant,

158
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,720
her pulse is weak and unsteady.

159
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,960
She must be careful
and take good care of herself.

160
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,330
She needs to nourish her blood
and energy.

161
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,120
And above all, she must remain calm

162
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,870
and avoid stress.

163
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,510
Otherwise, I fear...

164
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,080
Fear what?

165
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,600
I fear the pregnancy may not be sustained.

166
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,280
I understand.

167
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,960
Please keep a close watch on her.

168
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,720
You're too kind, Your Highness.

169
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,550
This is my duty.

170
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,320
Yes.

171
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
Yao,

172
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,960
did you hear that just now?

173
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,790
We're going to have a child.

174
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,000
Our child.

175
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,080
He will definitely be as beautiful as you,

176
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,000
with big eyes

177
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,320
that flutter

178
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,080
when he looks at us.

179
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,240
Aren't you happy?

180
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,030
Why should I be happy?

181
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,440
This is our child.

182
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,840
Our flesh and blood.

183
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Why aren't you happy?

184
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,280
You...

185
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,750
You killed my entire family,

186
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,440
and now I'm carrying your child?

187
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,440
You want to bring him into this world,

188
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,030
