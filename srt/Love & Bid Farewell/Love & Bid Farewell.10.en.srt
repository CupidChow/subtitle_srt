I'm sorry.

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,190

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,710

Yet, at the very last moment,

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,470
I found myself hoping you would.

the Seventh Prince suddenly fallen ill
and is bedridden.

54
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,070
He was fine usually,

55
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,070
but he falls ill as the ceremony approaches.

56
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,240
Please calm your anger, Your Majesty.

57
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,800
Seventh Prince has always been in poor health,

58
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
and regularly relies on medicinal treatments.

59
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,470
Greetings, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,270
Greetings, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,920
Greetings, Father,

62
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,670
Your Highness.

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,310
This morning, I suddenly fell ill

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,160
and was unconscious for half a day,

65
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
missing the Heaven Worship Ceremony.

66
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,800
Please forgive me, Father.

67
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,040
How is his health now?

68
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,950
Your Majesty,

69
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,390
his illness is due
to an accumulation of old ailments.

70
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
He probably caught a cold
from the preparations for the ceremony,

71
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,720
and aggravated his condition.

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,160
Given the circumstances,

73
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,270
I shall not hold you accountable.

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Jinchen,

75
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,950
you must take good care of yourself

76
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,430
so you can share my burdens in the future.

77
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,480
Yes, Father.

78
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,590
Your Highness,

79
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,680
how could you take the Venomous Potion
just to feign illness?

80
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,870
Even if it works,

81
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,630
you shouldn't disregard your health.

82
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,830
Take this ginseng to the infirmary

83
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,310
for Yao to recover.

84
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes, my lord.

85
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,950
I'm going to settle some scores.

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,870
Master, you finally agree to see Dieling.

87
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,910
I want to…

88
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,000
How dare you!

89
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
Master, I…

90
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,510
I tasked you with uncovering

91
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,480
the truth about Princess Yueying,

92
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,560
but look at what you've done!

93
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,910
Master,

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,920
I apologize.

95
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,640
But I won't accept this.

96
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,070
Who is that Gu Junyao anyway?

97
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,600
I've been nothing but loyal to you.

98
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
Who do you think you are,

99
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,510
daring to compare yourself to her?

100
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,310
Have I let you go unchecked for so long

101
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,720
that you've forgotten your place?

102
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,390
If this happens again,

103
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,560
I'll take your life.

104
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,000
(After all these years
of facing life and death together,)

105
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,160
(am I less than a woman
who appeared out of nowhere?)

106
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,070
Gu Junyao,

107
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,510
I will make your life a living hell.

108
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
- Your Highness,
- Yao.

109
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,080
you summoned me?

110
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,390
Sit.

111
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,150
Your Highness, you've been working hard
after court lately.

112
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,000
You must have regained some favor

113
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,510
in His Majesty's eyes.

114
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,780
But what I'm trying to make amends
for is something else.

115
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,280
What is it?

116
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,000
Close your eyes.

117
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,160
Eyes open.

118
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,230
I made it.

119
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,680
Do you like it?

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,840
I do.

121
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,590
Jinchen,

122
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,030
to secure your position,

123
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,550
you must

124
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,870
secure the realm.

125
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,240
Now, the Defender Duke holds military power.

126
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,270
If he isn't kept in check,
he could become a major threat.

127
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,590
It just so happens

128
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,550
that the Duke wishes
to marry his daughter to you.

129
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,000
This is excellent.

130
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,360
In a supreme position,

131
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,960
romance is secondary.

132
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,000
As for Gu's daughter,

133
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,120
you can take her as a concubine later.

134
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,160
Father,

135
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,750
even without a marriage alliance,

136
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,080
I can still

137
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,120
have the Duke under control.

138
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,870
Winning the people's hearts
is winning the realm.

139
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,000
Alienating the hearts of the old ministers

140
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,720
shakes the foundation of the country.

141
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,360
- Father.
- Enough.

142
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,040
I am weary.

143
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,560
You may leave.

144
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,920
Mother,

145
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,750
someone made a lantern for me

146
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,240
and is fond of me.

147
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,750
Have I truly

148
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,320
found my destined one?

149
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,320
When your marriage alliance
with the Defender Duke's family is settled,

150
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,000
you will be appointed Crown Prince.

151
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,200
The imperial edict arrives.

152
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,150
According to the will of heaven,
the emperor issued an order.

153
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,240
Yue Jinchen, the Seventh Prince,

154
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,630
is wise and virtuous,
possessing talent and integrity,

155
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,120
and is fit to inherit the throne.

156
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,030
I hereby confer upon him

157
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,510
the title of Crown Prince.

158
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,840
Defender Duke's daughter, Zhao Li,

159
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,670
is gentle and virtuous,

160
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,320
and of noble character.

161
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,600
She is hereby betrothed to the Crown Prince,

162
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,440
with officials assigned to choose
an auspicious date for the wedding.

163
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,510
Chief Steward Gu shall
oversee the wedding preparations.

164
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,440
That is all.

165
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,080
Your Highness, accept the decree.

166
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,320
I humbly accept the decree.

167
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,390
This is wonderful.

168
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,910
The edict naming the Seventh Prince
as Crown Prince has been issued.

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
His Majesty also bestowed a marriage

170
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,960
between His Highness and the Duke's daughter.

171
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
A double blessing.

172
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,910
Indeed.

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,200
Congratulations, Your Highness.

174
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,870
Congratulations, Chief Gu.

175
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,750
Yao,

176
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,350
I…

177
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,290
Congratulations on your betrothed,
Your Highness.

178
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,670
The marriage is only expedient.

179
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,960
You know my heart belongs to you.

180
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,630
This is a good match.

181
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,440
Your Highness, please stop the nonsense.

182
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,670
Give me some time.

183
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,670
You don't need to worry about this.

184
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,000
Trust me, within a month…

185
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,550
The Duke is a key figure in the court,

186
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,030
and General Zhao Ming is a war hero.

187
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,390
Your marriage to the Zhao family benefits you.

188
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,800
Moreover,

189
