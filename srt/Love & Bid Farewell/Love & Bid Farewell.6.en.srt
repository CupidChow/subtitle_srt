00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,120
Yao,

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,310
you have a feather-shaped birthmark
on the back of your neck.

21
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,200
Dare you show it to me?

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,480
If you persist, General,

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,310
don't blame me for humiliating you.

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,310
Are you all right?

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,960
I'm fine.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,790
Just that my presence seems

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,710
to have interrupted your private matters.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,000
Judging by your condition,

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,680
you were drugged.

30
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,710
We must leave now.

31
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,630
Let's go.

32
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,710
Princess.

33
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,350
General, you should leave now.

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,070
You have mistaken me for someone else.

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,190
Be careful.

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,150
Your Highness, you'll be all right.

37
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,840
Your Highness, hold on.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
We're here.

39
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,150
Your Highness.

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,560
Your Highness.

41
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,710
So, your childhood name

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,000
is Yao.

43
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,150
Your Highness.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
Your Highness.

45
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,750
Your Highness.

46
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,000
- Surround this place.
- Aye.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,910
To have an affair
with the Emperor's intended consort,

48
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,910
I'd like to see
how you'll get out of it this time.

49
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,270
Hold on.

50
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,680
Third Prince, with such a big act,

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
what are you here for?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,430
Is there something wrong
in the Palace of Yueying?

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,750
Are you playing dumb?

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,710
Are you insinuating something, Your Highness?

55
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,400
Please, do enlighten me.

56
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,710
I heard

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,800
that the Seventh Prince is in your palace now.

58
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,560
Being together in the dead of night.

59
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,000
Surely,

60
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,430
need I say more?

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Third Prince, mind your words.

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,910
There's nothing
between me and the Seventh Prince.

63
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,360
If you keep slandering me

64
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,710
and ruining my reputation,

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,910
I shall seek justice from His Majesty.

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,520
Whether it is slander or not,

67
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,710
we shall see once we have a look inside.

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Very well.

69
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,150
To prove my innocence,

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
please proceed.

71
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,310
Well, Your Highness,

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,310
did you find who you were looking for?

73
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,800
Princess Yingge, my apologies.

74
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,600
I was misled by the words of a vile servant,

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,160
and in my concern for the Princess's safety,

76
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,950
I acted rashly.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,220
There is no need to trouble Father

78
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,270
with such a trivial matter.

79
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,630
Indeed, Your Highness.

80
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,870
But the vile slander caused no small trouble.

81
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,750
With such a commotion,

82
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,750
it would be difficult for me
to keep this incident hidden.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,840
You worthless servant.

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,830
You've done more harm than good.

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,070
You shall pay for your crime today.

86
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,070
It's getting late.

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
I shall let you be, Princess.

88
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,200

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960

he would punish me severely.

Indeed, the Third Prince is right.

130
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,030
Given His Majesty's favor towards her,

131
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,120
it's too risky to act against her

Once my son ascends to the throne,
all will be solved.

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,150

(Jiang He, Huang Lian, the prescription)

141
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,120
We hardly know each other, General.

142
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,200
It appears there's little for us to discuss.

143
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
It seems

144
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,910
the Princess is intentionally avoiding me.

145
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,320
Are you afraid I might discover something?

146
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,840
You must be kidding.

147
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
May I ask

148
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,870
what exactly you want to discuss?

149
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,150
Princess, you're from Yueying.

150
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,650
Coincidentally,
I too visited there years ago.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,440
I was particularly impressed
with a candy shop on the east side of the city.

152
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,510
I wonder if you've been there.

153
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,200
I've lived in Yueying since childhood,

154
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,840
but I've never heard

155
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,390
of such a candy shop there.

156
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,910
If you're trying to test me,

157
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,200
I suggest you not waste your time.

158
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,000
I have matters to attend to,
so I'll take my leave now.

159
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,510
Yao,

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
you may pretend

161
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,480
to be Princess Yingge flawlessly,

162
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,630
but the birthmark on your neck

163
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,870
has been with you since childhood.

164
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
Yao,

165
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,390
what have you been through all these years?

166
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,870
When the Gu family fell,

167
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
I was away at war

168
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,600
and couldn't return in time.

169
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,910
It's a regret I'll carry for life.

170
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,910
I don't understand

171
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,390
what you are talking about.

172
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,270
Please mind your manners

173
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,840
and release me.

174
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,550
What are you doing here?

175
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,080
Seventh Prince.

176
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,630
Since when did General Zhao Ming

177
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,390
become so familiar with Princess Yingge?

178
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,440
I was…

179
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,840
The General was here at my invitation.

180
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,240
I greatly admire

181
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,630
his heroic deeds

182
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,840
and invited him over

183
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,790
to tell me the stories of the frontier.

184
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,390
Exactly.

185
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,630
The stories General Zhao shared

186
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,480
were fascinating.

187
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,390
I look forward to hearing more in the future.

188
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,910
I shall take my leave now.

189
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Am I interrupting

190
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,790
something between you two?

191
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,200
Please don't forget your place, Princess.

192
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm going to check out Jiang He's residence.

193
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,680
Jiang He?

194
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,640
A subordinate of General Zhao Ming?

195
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
That's right.

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,030
Before Huang Lian died,

197
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,100
he mentioned Jiang He as someone

198
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,750
who knows the truth from years ago.

199
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,320
That's why it's worth a visit.

200
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,390
It seems everything is slowly coming to light.

201
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,440
Do you need to discuss that
with General Zhao Ming?
