Your Highness,

63
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,310
at times, I truly do not understand you.

on doing such painstaking things?

out of the palace.

66

we would have seen her by now.

67
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,550
In my opinion,

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,030
she surely won't come.

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
She shall come.

70
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,150

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
how can you be so certain
that Chief Gu will come?

72
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,470
In my view,

73
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,390
a woman as cold-hearted as her

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,000
will surely not show up.

75
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,240
Because she, too,
wishes to return to those days.

will be here tonight?

87
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,390

88
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,360

94
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,120

98

99
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,950
I am Zhao Li.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,720
So, you are Defender Duke's daughter.

101
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,510
Forgive my manners.

102
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,310
Thanks to your help,

103
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,510
I was able to survive.

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,680
Are you here to appreciate the lanterns?

105
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,920
If you don't mind,

106
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,920
would you care to accompany me?

107
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,800
Miss Li, you misunderstand.

108
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,360
I left the palace tonight on official business.

109
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,590
I have no interest

110
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,950
in lanterns.

111
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
If you like it,

112
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,600
this lantern is yours.

113
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,070
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,160

115
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,960
It's getting late.

116
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,870
You should return soon.

117
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,440
Your Highness.

118
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,470
Lady.

119
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,350
His Highness

120
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,200
saved me

121
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,390
and gave me a lantern.

122
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,630
Surely,

123
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,910
the engagement
isn't my one-sided wish, is it?

124
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,710
Your Highness,

125
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,390
are we no longer waiting for Chief Gu?

126
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
She likely won't be coming.

127
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,270
Your Highness the Empress?

128
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,480
Chief Gu, you are indeed clever.

129
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,630
Why don't you

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,550
take a guess

131
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,910
as to why you're here?

132
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,840
The Third Prince's rebellion
has already been revealed.

133
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Instead of reconciling

134
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,080
with the Seventh Prince,

135
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,390
you brought me here by force.

136
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,240
My life means little

137
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,550
to the Seventh Prince.

138
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,790
You know this is a dead end,

139
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,240
yet you press on,

140
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
hoping for a reversal.

141
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,240
Isn't that naive?

142
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,630
So what?

143
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,000
Even if it's a dead end,

144
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,150
I will see to its conclusion.

145
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,630
You had better comply

146
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,360
and testify before His Majesty,

147
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,790
claiming that this was all a conspiracy

148
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,390
between you and that wretched Yao Jinchen.

149
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,440
If not for him and his wicked mother,

150
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,630
my son would never

151
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,360
have lost his position as Crown Prince.

152
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,240
Your Highness,

153
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,510
the Third Prince is now a spent pawn.

154
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,670
I advise you to reconsider.

155
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,120
It is not your place to teach me what to do.

156
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,120
I will never
let that wench's son go unpunished.

157
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,240
I must say,

158
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,270
you do have a pretty face, Chief Gu.

159
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,030
No wonder that sickly cherishes you so.

160
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,670
Let's see,

161
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,320
between you and the throne,

162
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,840
which one he cherishes more.

163
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,080
Your Highness, you overestimate me.

164
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,960
The Seventh Prince's grand ambitions

165
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,910
will not be swayed by the likes of me.

166
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,320
Chief Gu,

167
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,200
it's too soon to say.

168
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,630
Perhaps that wretched boy, like his mother,

169
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
is a hopeless romantic.

170
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,670
Either way, we will know by tomorrow.

171
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,200
His Majesty has decreed
that Yao Jincheng will

172
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,320
preside over tomorrow's
Heaven Worship Ceremony.

173
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,150
If you can make him lose his composure

174
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,200
and abandon the throne
that is within his grasp,

175
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,630
that would be ideal.

176
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,080
If not,

177
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,550
killing you

178
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,630
will still be no loss for me.

179
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
(For the eternal stability of the empire,
we pray for heaven's blessings.)

180
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,280
Your Highness,

181
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,550
His Majesty has commanded
that you preside over the ceremony.

182
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,600
Does this mean

183
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,910
he acknowledges you
as the next Crown Prince?

184
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,390
Your Highness.

185
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,230
Your Highness.

186
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,030
Father's health is beyond the aid of medicine.

187
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,200
Among the princes,

188
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,320
there is none more suitable than I
to inherit the throne.

189
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,280
Congratulations, Your Highness.

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,840
After years of laying low,

191
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,550
you have finally reached this day.

192
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,120
This is only the beginning.

193
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,360
Where is Chief Gu? Has she been found?

194
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,390
No.

195
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,870
Your Highness, the Heaven Worship Ceremony
is about to begin.

196
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,680
Has she been found?

197
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,300
(Southern Cliff)

198
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,630
(Southern Cliff)

199
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,120
How much longer until the ceremony?

200
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,270
Your Majesty,

201
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,150
there is one hour left.

202
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,150
Your Majesty entrusted the Seventh Prince
with the ceremony.

203
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,550
You must have great expectations for him.

204
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,600
Jinchen is a good child.

205
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,150
But in recent years,

206
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,000
I have neglected him.

207
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,150
It's time I properly groom him.

208
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,510
I am certain the Seventh Prince

209
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,750
will not disappoint His Majesty.

210
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,550
His Majesty has decreed
that Yao Jincheng will

211
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,750
preside over tomorrow's
Heaven Worship Ceremony.

212
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,440
If you can make him lose his composure

213
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,200
and abandon the throne
that is within his grasp,

214
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,360
that would be ideal.
