36
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,030
but she needs to rest well.

37
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,520
She must avoid any anger

38
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
or stress.

39
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,990

are you asleep?

43
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,150
The physician said the child is safe.

44
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,400
But the truth is,
you don't care about that,

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,640
do you?

46
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,080

the child is innocent.

181
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,390
you would marry my brother,

182

everything has changed.

185
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,840
It's all because I loved the wrong person.

186
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,750
My family is gone,

187
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,720
and I caused my brother's death.

188
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,390
I was too foolish.

189
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,030
I should have listened to you

190
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,870
and stayed away from Yue Jinchen.

191
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,390
Then none of this would have happened.

192
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,150
It's all my fault.

193
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,510
What should I do now, Sister Yao?

194
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,670
What should I do

195
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,240
with myself?

196
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,200
You've grown up, Your Excellency.

197
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,180
But things have come to this point,

198
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,960
and there's no turning back.

199
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,160
Your brother

200
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
would surely want you

201
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,720
to live out the rest of your life well.

202
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,750
You're right, Sister Yao.

203
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,790
I should go.

204
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,600
And you should take care of yourself too.

205
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,200
Why are you taking this path back?

206
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,200
Isn't this the way to Zhaotian Tower?

207
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,790
