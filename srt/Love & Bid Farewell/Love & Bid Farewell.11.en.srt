105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,310
may I have a word?

106
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,000
Your Highness, the Duke
is known for being decisive.

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,510
He wouldn't kill her in a fit of anger,
would he?

108
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,350
Silence.

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,790
General,

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,070
Chief Gu has been taken by the Duke.

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
What?

112
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,830

(Defender Duke's Mansion)

114
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,830
It is a blessing to be able

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,160
to meet the daughter of an old friend

116
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
and play chess together today.

117
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,800
But I wonder,

118
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,190
am I playing

119
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,920
against the little girl I once knew

120
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,720
or the palace official she has become?

121
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,480
I serve my ruler faithfully.

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,390
It's been years since we last met,

123
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,560
so we're just old acquaintances now.

124
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,320
Duke,

125
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,360
please speak plainly.

126
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,990
Very well.

127
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,480
I'll be straightforward.

128
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
As the daughter of an old friend,

129
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,670
I should look after you.

130
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,320
But as a father, I'm worried.

131
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,870
I've heard rumors

132
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,150
about you

133
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,150
and the Seventh Prince.

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,150
My daughter Zhao Li

135
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,360
is soon to marry him.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,840
So,

137
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,630
as her father,

138
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,150
I shall resolve all unpleasant matters

139
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,440

in the Eastern Palace.

141
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,510

142
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,000
drink this

143
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,150
and leave the Seventh Prince.

144
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,870
I understand your concern.

145
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,470
Duke,

146
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,910
I'm the Chief Steward
at the Seventh Prince's palace.

147
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,550
Whether I stay or leave

148
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
is his decision.

149
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,360
Are you

150
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,510
rejecting my offer?

151
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,960
I appreciate it, Duke.

152
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,320
But I can't handle ﻿alcohol

153
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,790
and must respectfully refuse.

154
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,910
You dare refuse my offer?

155
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,870
I shall end you with my own hands.

156
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,800
Chief Gu,

157
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,480
I'm giving you one last chance.

158
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Don't force me to be ruthless.

159
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,990

160
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,350
Zhao Ming,

161
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,880
- what are you doing?
- Father,

162
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,200
you're trying to kill an innocent person

163
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,750
just to secure my sister's marriage.

164
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,630
Isn't that too extreme?

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,960
Move aside.

166
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,200
I can't.

167
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,840
I said move!

168
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,150
You ungrateful son.

169
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,510
Zhao Ming, are you all right?

170
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,510
I'm fine.

171
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,390
Yao,

172
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,320
are you all right?

173
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,080
Well,

174
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,110
how are you feeling?

175
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
I'm all right.

176
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,510
If that's the case,

177
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,230
it's getting late now.

178
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,870
General, you should head back and rest.

179
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,110
Your Highness,

180
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
I wish to stay a little longer.

181
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,720
I'd like to talk to her.

182
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,270
General, you're an outsider.

183
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,910
It would be inappropriate for you

184
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,510
to talk privately with my official.

185
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,960
Please, Your Highness.

186
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,550
Allow us to speak privately.

187
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,960
Fine.

188
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,240
I shall leave you to your reunion.

189
