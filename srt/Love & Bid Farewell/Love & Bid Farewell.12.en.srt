19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,760
Your Highness,

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,000
shall we not hear how Chief Gu would choose?

21
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:21,950
What's there to hear?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,280
We shall not interrupt their reunion.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,590
Could you stop following me?

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,120
As you wish.

25
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,560
Today, you saw it yourself.

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,870
I am no longer the person you once knew.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,240
Yao,

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,310
my father was just being overly protective.

29
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,760
I know this has been unfair to you.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,280
But now that you've regained your identity,

31
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,590
you can let it all go.

32
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,150
Five years ago, I failed to protect you.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,040
But from now on, I swear I shall shield you.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,680
Come back with me to my residence.

35
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,560
I shall explain everything to my father.

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,360
Let us leave all this behind

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,120
just like the old days.

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,710
I'm not leaving.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,840
Why not?

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,710
Do you have feelings for the Seventh Prince?

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Why are you all

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,590
interfering with my life?

43
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,750
If I say yes,

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,310
what would you do?

45
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,360
Kill me as the Duke did?

46
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,680
After all these years,
my feelings remain unchanged.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,030
Even if you now

48
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,470
in love the Seventh Prince,

49
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,430
I shall still protect you with all my being.

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,400
Zhao Ming,

51
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,710
the past cannot be undone.

52
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,470
The Gu's grievances have been cleared,

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,190
but there are still things I need to do.

54
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,910
You have a bright future ahead.

55
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,000
Let the memories of our childhood

56
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,590
stay in the past.

57
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,960
Whatever you want to do, I can help.

58
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,470
Is it because

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
of the Crown Prince?

60
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,030
He's about to marry Li.

61
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,960
He can't protect you forever.

62
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,800
The Seventh Prince is the Crown Prince.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,710
His heart fills with compassion for all beings.

64
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,710
But all I desire is freedom.

65
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,840
We're utterly different,

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,670
so there's nothing left to hold on to.

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,080
Zhao Ming,

68
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,400
could you do me a favor?

69
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Sure.

70
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,920
I didn't realize the General was so injured

71
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,160
that you need my chief steward to hold you.

72
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,190
Forgive us, Crown Prince.

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,950
We reunited

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,400
after so long

75
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,140
and got carried away.

76
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,070
Improper, indeed.

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,160
Thank you, Your Highness, for your care

78
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,310
of Chief Gu.

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
When Chief Gu leaves the palace,

80
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,390
I shall thank you properly with her.

81
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,470
You're leaving?

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm grateful for Your Highness' trust,

83
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
but my personal matters are resolved.

84
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,070
There's no reason for me to stay in the palace.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,270
I'll take good care of Chief Gu.

86
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,720
Please rest assured.

87
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,680
It's getting late. I shall take my leave.

88
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,310
I shall personally

89
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,830
explain everything to my father.

90
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,800
Magnanimous as you are, Your Highness.

91
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,510
Please, don't let this
cause any rift between you and my sister,

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,520
lest it affects your marriage.

93
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,040
You're truly considerate, General.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,750
Both your sister and old friend
have found good paths ahead.

95
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,360
Thank you for your kind words, Your Highness.

96
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,590
Come with me.

97
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,560
I, too, have things

98
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,120
to discuss with Chief Gu.

99
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,600
I must congratulate you, Chief Gu,

100
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,950
on reuniting with your childhood friend

101
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,240
and climbing high. You shall soon leave here

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,390
to become a noble lady in the Duke's Mansion.

103
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,390
You're being quite ungracious.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,120
Your Highness, the Eastern Palace
is within your reach,

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,200
and you are soon to wed the Duke's daughter.

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,270
That's truly a powerful alliance.

107
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,830
Must you say such things to hurt me?

108
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,790
Your Highness,

109
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,480
we were merely allies.

110
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,720
Now we have taken what we need.

111
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,950
For the sake of your grand cause,

112
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,070
it is best for both of us

113
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,360
to part ways.

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,120
What if I refuse?

115
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,040
Even the palace cannot hold me captive.

116
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,600
Are you rekindling the old flame
with Zhao Ming?

117
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,870
What else did you expect?

118
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,600
We grew up together.

Everything is settled now.

120
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,600

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,630
What do you know?

189
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,750
The Dark Blade

190
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,630
once served Consort Ning.

191
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,630
So, who do you think

192
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,750
the current master of the Dark Blade is?

193
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,670
It's Yue Jinchen, the Seventh Prince,

194
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,320
the one you've been so close to.

195
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,000
Why should I believe you?

196
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,080
One more lie, and I shall end you.

197
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,200
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

198
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,600
One word, you're a dead

199
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,670
I can take you to see the true nature
of the Seventh Prince,

200
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,030
who you believe is your savior.

201
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,000
The Dark Blade is having a meeting tonight.

202
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,550
The master will surely appear.

203
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,270
If you dare.

204
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,720
As I expected.

205
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,120
If you dare deceive me…

206
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,510
Don't worry.

207
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,200
I wouldn't.

208
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,960
Master.

209
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,960
Well?

210
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,440
You strived to help him rise to power.

211
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,480
You've done well

212
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,000
in hiding your feelings.

213
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
But you're just a vengeful orphan,

214
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,790
clinging to your grudges.

215
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
Do you think heaven would favor you?

216
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,750
Tell me,

217
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,320
is he still

218
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,720
the flawless Seventh Prince

219
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,960
in your heart?

220
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,750
Do you believe he loves you?

221
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,360
What if I told you the truth

222
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,600
behind the Incident of Zhaotian Tower?

223
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,360
Would you be able to take it?

224
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,480
What truth?

225
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,750
Well,

226
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,630
do you still remember
what happened to your family?

227
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,080
Tell me the truth!

228
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,320
Think about it.

229
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,670
Your father, Physician Gu,

230
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,480
was upright and honest all his life.
He avoided trouble.

231
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,750
How could he have suddenly colluded
with the Fifth Prince

232
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,360
and found himself trapped in a conspiracy?

233
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,670
In fact,

234
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,790
the Seventh Prince already knew

235
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,080
that the Empress and others
had switched your father's prescription.

236
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,480
But he let it happen.

237
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,630
Yet, the Seventh Prince,
in his quest for power,

238
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,390
chose to hide the truth.

239
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,440
That untainted prescription

240
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,720
was the Fifth Prince's death sentence.

241
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,960
Through this,

242
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,920
the Seventh Prince not only

243
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,990
eliminated the Fifth Prince,
who was pretending to be his ally,

244
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,600
but also gained leverage
over the Third Prince.

245
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,720
All to one day

246
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,270
bring the Third Prince down

247
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,000
and become the sole contender for the throne.

248
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,800
Gu Junyao,

249
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,030
haven't you noticed

250
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,480
how easily your path of revenge has gone?

251
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,670
That's because he's been
pulling the strings all along.

252
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,440
You're nothing but a pawn in his game.

253
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,600
And your family was slaughtered

254
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,200
as his steppingstone to the throne.

255
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,200
The one who orchestrated it all

256
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,720
was Yue Jinchen.

257
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,200
You've been deceived, used,

258
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,270
and fooled.

259
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,390
Gu Junyao,

260
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,440
you're so pathetic.

261
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,440
You fell in love with the one
who wiped out your family.

262
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,840
(That's right.)

263
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
(Gu Junyao.)

264
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,910
(If I can't have him,)

265
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,120
(how could you?)

266
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,840
May we both

267
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,840
achieve our goals.

268
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,080
The Gu family

269
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,150
could get their revenge soon.

270
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,790
You've reclaimed your identity

271
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,720
and avenged your father.

272
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,840
I just

273
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,600
want to be myself again.

274
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,670
You're nothing but a pawn in his game.

275
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,870
And your family was slaughtered

276
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,360
as his steppingstone to the throne.

277
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,240
The one who orchestrated it all

278
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,480
