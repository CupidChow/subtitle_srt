and come search my Eastern Palace?

190
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,360
Rest assured, Your Highness,

191
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I would give my life

192
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,390
for Yao.

193
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,870
But, General, your life
is of little consequence,

194
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,030
don't drag the entire
Defender Duke's Mansion into this.

195
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,750
In the past, I failed to protect her.

196
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,630
Today, I am willing to try again.

197
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,750
No need.

198
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,360
Please leave, General.

199
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,150
Your Highness, don't forget,

200
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,550
the Defender Duke's Mansion
is not yet yours to control.

201
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,680
(Yao)

202
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,710
(Wait for me)

203
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,230
Brother Zhao Ming,

204
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,120
I've been placed under the palace
arrest by His Highness.

205
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,960
Can you find a way to take me away?

206
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,320
From Gu Junyao.

207
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,390
(Brother Zhao Ming)

208
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,120
(I hope you receive my letter)

209
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,200
Yao, what are you staring at out the window?

210
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,790
Are you thinking of someone?

211
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,360
Are you thinking of General Zhao Ming?

212
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,150
Is that why you must leave me?

213
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,270
Zhao Ming was here earlier.

214
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,720
Do you think he could possibly

215
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,120
take you away from here?

216
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,550
Stop thinking about him,

217
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,280
alright?

218
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,990
Let go!

219
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,840
I said,

220
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,790
stop thinking about him!

221
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,030
I can't!

222
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,750
- What?
- I said I can't!

223
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,720
Let me tell you, Yue Jinchen.

224
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,510
You may control my body,

225
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,720
but you can never control my heart.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
Who I choose to love
and who I choose to miss

227
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,240
is my freedom.

228
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,510
Even though you are now
the Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace,

229
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,960
you will never control me.

230
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,920
Enough!

231
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,510
I'll show you whether I can or not.
