19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,790
General, what is the matter?

20
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,310
You go ahead and make arrangements.

21
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,630
I'll return shortly.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,840
Understood.

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
Yao.

24
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,990
Princess.

25
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,310
General Zhao Ming, are you calling me?

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,710
My apologies. I made a mistake.

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,310
I beg your pardon.

28
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,750
Do you know General Zhao Ming, Princess?

29
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,360
No, I do not.

30
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,520
You rarely leave the palace.

31
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,120
Is there anything you want to buy?

32
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
I don't need anything.

33
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,120
Where is she?

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,910
Your Highness,

35
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,590
we do not know.

36
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,280
Your Highness!

37
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,150
Finally, I've found you.

38
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,270
What's the matter?

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,560
It's not you; it's her...
Something has happened.

40
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,890
The Empress went to the Palace of Yueying.

41
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,870
You weren't there,

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,280
and now she is furious.

43
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,150
You do not know?

44
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,310
What a princess.

45
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,680
In the dead of night,

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
in this vast palace,

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,910
where could she possibly go?

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,680
What a crowd.

49
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,710
Princess.

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,120
Your Highness,

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,560
are you looking for me?

52
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,240
Princess Yingge, stop putting on airs.

53
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,310
You're not a consort yet.

54
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,000
But you dare to make me wait.

55
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,430
I'm new here

56
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,840
and don't yet know all the palace rules.

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,520
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

58
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,750
However, His Majesty treats me like a guest.

59
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,830
If you want me to follow the palace rules,

60
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm afraid you'll have to wait
until I'm formally conferred.

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,720
How smart-mouthed.

62
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,040
Don't use His Majesty to threaten me.

63
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,760
Tell me,

64
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,560
where did you go tonight?

65
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,560
If you can't give a proper explanation,

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,270
I shall set the rules straight

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,160
with punishment.

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,830
Your Highness,

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,510
the Northwatch has returned in triumph,

70
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,880
and His Majesty ordered me to perform
the Dance of Rainbow Skirt at the banquet.

71
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,510
I was so absorbed in practicing

72
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,630
that I lost track of time.

73
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,190
Practicing the dance?

74
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,590
That's right.

75
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,120
I don't like to be disturbed
when I'm practicing.

76
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,390
So I found a secluded spot in the backyard.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
I didn't expect Your Highness to misunderstand

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,750
and put on a show in the Palace of Yueying.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,430
I'm in fear, Your Highness.

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
Will Your Highness

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,070
discipline me tonight?

82
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,070
It's already late at night.

83
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,120
If I interrupt your rest,

84
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,160
that would be a grave offense.

85
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,270
Forget it.

86
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,950
I doubt you'll master

87
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,600
courtly manners anytime soon.

88
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,920
But there's still time.

89
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,190
Just wait.

90
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,240
We need to find a way
to return to the palace immediately.

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,600
Princess, returning now won't do any good.

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,600
I must return now.

93
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,270
Come with me.

94
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,190
There's a passage that leads
to the side chamber of the Palace of Yueying.

95
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,720
My mother had it built years ago.

96
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,430
Following the secret passage,

97
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,950
you'll get to the Palace of Yueying shortly.

98
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,760
All right.

99
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
Your Highness,

100
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,310
the Emperor ordered
all princes and key ministers

101
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,880
to attend the Northwatch's victory banquet.

102
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,040
I heard that Princess Yingge of Yueying

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,680
will perform a dance at the banquet.

104
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,510
Why are you telling me this?

105
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,790
Your Highness,

106
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,560
you have shown considerable interest

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,800
in Princess Yingge today,

108
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,750
even revealing our secret passage to her.

109
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,350
Your Highness,

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,070
you've been acting strangely lately.

111
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,120
I thought you might have
developed feelings for her.

112
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,400
But I understand.

113
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,270
She is the fairest of Yueying.

114
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,190
Quite stunning indeed.

115
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,390
If she is a sharp blade,

116
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,720
why not use it for my purposes?

117
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,870
So that it won't get into someone else's hands

118
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,870
and hurt me.

119
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,640
You're right.

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
How sophisticated.

121
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,160
That princess is in trouble.

122
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,230
Get lost.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,840
But it's true.

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,070
I'm just telling the truth.

125
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,920
To have generals like you

126
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
is a great fortune for the Great Dynasty.

127
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,760
Generals,

128
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,240
join me in a toast.

129
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,800
Tonight, we get drunk.

130
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,430
Thank you, Your Majesty.

131
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,430
Please welcome Princess Yingge

132
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,510
to perform a dance.

133
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,800
(Why does Princess Yingge)

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,720
(look so much like Yao?)

135
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,800
(No.)

136
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,600
(She's definitely Yao.)

137
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,750
(Yao,)

138
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,200
(you are still alive.)

139
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
(Yao,)

140
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,510
(after all these years,)

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,550
(what have you been through?)

142
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,910
Princess Yingge,
you're such an excellent dancer.

143
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
It's so graceful

144
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,750
and captivating.

145
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

146
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
(No way.)

147
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,670
(I must go ask Yao to find out the truth.)

148
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,790
Ministers,

149
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,960
please enjoy your drinks.

150
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,630
Let us drink until the night is done.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,510
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Father.

152
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,600
(After you drink this cup
of aphrodisiac alcohol,)

153
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,270
(and I'll catch you and the princess
in the act of adultery.)

154
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,960
(Let's see how you'll end up.)

155
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,280
Jinchen,

156
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,040
it's been so long,

157
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,870
yet we never had a drink together.

158
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,800
That's my fault.

159
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,480
Come on, this is for you.

160
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,200
Fancy a toast?

161
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,560
All right.

162
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,510
That's my good brother.

163
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,910
Your Highness, the drink...

164
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,200
I know.

165
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,630
Get the horses saddled.

166
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,510
Yes, sir.

167
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,350
Your Highness.

168
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
General Zhao Ming,

169
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,960
you've been following me for quite some time.

170
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,270
Is there something I can help you with?

171
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,710
Are you

172
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,390
Yao?

173
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,030
General, you must be drunk.

174
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,840
I am not Yao.

175
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,200
My name is Yingge.

176
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,030
Princess Yingge of Yueying.

177
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,670
Haven't you heard of me?

178
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,750
If there's nothing else,

179
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,960
I shall take my leave.

180
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,360
I've been out for a while.

181
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,710
Wait.

182
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,590
You are Yao.

183
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,870
Let go.

184
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,280
I can't be wrong.

185
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,350
Yao,

186
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,550
you have a feather-shaped birthmark
on the back of your neck.

187
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,550
Dare you show it to me?

188
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,600
If you persist, General,

189
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,550
