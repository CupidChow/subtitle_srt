00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,990
get some rest.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,560
(then let me continue deceiving you,)

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
(okay?)

40
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
Your Highness.

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
You visited the Eastern Palace yesterday.

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,870
What were you up to?

43
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,400
Do you really think

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,280
I won't dare to kill you?

45
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,520
I know you've hidden Gu Junyao
in the Eastern Palace.

46
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,840
You even made her lose her memory.

47
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,190
What does that have to do with you?

48
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,710
Zhao Li, aren't you
overestimating yourself?

49
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,750
How could I allow my future husband
to hide a woman in the house?

50
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,150
Your Highness,

51
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,800
you underestimate me.

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,120
Your Highness, Gu Junyao is missing.

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,640
Where did she go?

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,150
If you have no intention towards me,

55
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,590
why did you agree to the engagement?

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
Where did she go?!

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
I don't know.

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,120
I mentioned her father,

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,910
and she remembered everything.

60
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,000
Yue Jinchen!

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,190
She hates you so much!

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
How could she ever love you again?

63
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,830
No matter how hard
you try to win her over,

64
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,430
she will never forgive you

65
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,240
in this lifetime.

66
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,830
I have given you all my love,

67
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,870
but you've treated me with disdain.

68
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,480
Yue Jinchen,

69
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,560
this is karma!

70
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,710
Go ahead.

71
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,800
What you're doing to her

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
is nothing but torture.

73
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,480
Your Highness, Princess Zhao Li
didn't seem to be pretending.

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,800
The Eastern Palace is heavily guarded.

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,870
If Gu Junyao didn't want to leave,

76
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,920
who could have taken her out?

77
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,150
Your Highness,

78
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,310
if you insist on going,

79
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
what if it's a trap?

80
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,070
Even if it's a trap,

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,510
I have to bring her back.

82
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,660
(Shen Ling's Tomb)

83
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,230
Yao,

84
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
what's wrong?

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,040
Look at these people.

86
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,360
They rest here among the weeds.

87
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,360
In life, they were someone's family,
someone's beloved,

88
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,950
but now they are just a mound
of yellow earth,

89
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,510
unattended,

90
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,070
and unmourned.

91
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,200
Tell me,

92
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,950
do you think they feel cold?

93
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Do they still miss their loved ones?

94
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
It's windy here.

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,840
Let's go back.

96
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,360
There's no going back.

97
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,600
We can never go back.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,390
Isn't it good the way we are now?

99
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
No!

100
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,870
It's not good at all!

101
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,000
Why do you keep lying to me?

102
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,510
Do you know how much it hurts inside?

103
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,510
- I know.
- You don't know.

104
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,270
You know nothing at all!

105
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,950
Everything!

106
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,680
It's all because of you!

107
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,120
All because

108
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,920
of what you've done.

109
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,760
Stop it.

110
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,350
Stop it…

111
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,390
I'm so cold.

112
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,510

114
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,360
stop overthinking things.

greatest war hero.

189
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
Farewell.

190
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,990
Farewell.

191
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,870
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

192
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,160
Your Highness,

193
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,870
please wait.

194
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,240
What is it, General Zhao Ming?

195
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,000
I came here today

196
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,720
just to ask

197
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,910
how Chief Gu is doing.

198
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,510
The General still cares

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,390
for Chief Gu as always.

200
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,750
Yao and I grew up together.

201
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,160
Naturally,

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,510
our bond is different from others.

203
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,080
Since the bond between you
and Chief Gu is so special,

204
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,240
how could you not know she resigned

205
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,200
and returned to her hometown?

206
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,320
It seems that your bond with her

207
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,600
is not as deep as you claim.
