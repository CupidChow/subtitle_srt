18

=Episode 1=

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,480
(In the 64th year of the Great Dynasty,)

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,000
(the princes fought for the throne.)

21
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,560
(The Crown Prince was killed,)

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,310
(and the Fifth Prince was executed.)

23
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,280
(The event became known
as the Incident of Zhaotian Tower.)

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,760
(The Gu family was wiped out)

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,280
(except for one daughter,)

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,280
(the orphaned Gu Junyao.)

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,150
(The Seventh Prince, Yue Jinchen,)

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,920
(who was allied with the Fifth Prince,
narrowly escaped death.)

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,150
(No one knows)

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,510
(what his future holds.)

31
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,760
Gu's orphan girl.

32
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,920
If I survive today,

33
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,590
I will make you pay for what you did.

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,680
You don't even know who your enemy is,

35
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,760
yet you still want revenge?

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,040
Who are you?

37
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,630
However, I can give you another chance

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,310
and help you take your revenge.

39
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,220
No matter how much
the Seventh Prince is disregarded,

40
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,630
(Five years later)
he is still a prince.

41
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,910
His mother, Consort Ning,

42
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,960
was a treacherous concubine
who brought chaos to the palace,

43
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,990
leaving no trace of her remains.

44
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,310
Back then, he was allied with the Fifth Prince.

45
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,590
After the Incident of Zhaotian Tower,

46
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,150
he became a pariah in the palace

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,150
that everyone loathes.

48
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,030
So pathetic.

49
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,000
I heard another princess from Yueying
is here for a marriage alliance.

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,840
(Yue Jinchen)
I wonder if this princess

51
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,360
will end the same as the last one.

52
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,680
Summon the envoy from Yueying for an audience.

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
By the command of the King of Yueying,

54
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,360
I humbly present our most precious treasure.

55
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,590
May Your Majesty enjoy eternal prosperity

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,000
and auspicious wellness.

57
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,360
This is the treasure of Yueying,

58
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,750
the fairest of all,

59
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,400
Princess Yingge.

60
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,220
(Princess Yingge from Yueying)

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Ning?

62
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,800
Isn't this the dance

63
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,360
the late Consort Ning used to perform?

64
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,150
Watch it.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,390
Don't mention that name.

66
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,160
From this day forth,

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,390
Princess Yingge shall be bestowed
the title of Imperial Consort.

68
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

69
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,670
You may rise.

70
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,190
Thank you, Your Majesty.

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
I heard that the late Consort Ning

72
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,830
was also from Yueying.

73
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,310
May I reside in her former palace?

74
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,510
How dare you?

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,000
Consort Ning was wicked and manipulative.

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,430
It's a taboo within the palace.

77
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,830
How dare you mention that name?

78
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,030
Never mind.

79
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,360
It's all in the past.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,000
Since you are interested,

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,240
I shall allow it.

82
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:01,540
It's…

83
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,870
Princess Yingge may reside wherever she wishes.

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

85
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,920
Jinchen, why do you appear so destitute?

86
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,310
You don't even have an attendant
to hold your umbrella.

87
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,790
Brother.

88
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,000
That makes sense.

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,390
(Yue Jinchuan, the Third Prince)
After the incident five years ago,

90
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,830
you've been all alone.

91
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,160
Since the Fifth Prince, who was close to you,

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,070
conspired with the treasonous doctor Gu Xun'an
to plot against the Crown Prince

93
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,600
and was executed as a traitor.

94
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,200
Also,

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
that wicked consort from Yueying

96
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,720
has long become a feared taboo,

97
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,630
reeking of misfortune.

98
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,720
Since you are so obsessed

99
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,920
with what happened back then,

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,120
you should report it to Father.

101
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,830
Having another concubine from Yueying

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,950
will not change the circumstances.

103
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,960
Jinchen,

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
watch your back.

105
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,480
After all, the blood of Yueying
flows in your veins as well.

106
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,560
(May I reside in her former palace?)

107
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,390
(The conferral ceremony will be held
three months from now.)

108
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,000
(The Ministry of Rites shall oversee it.)

109
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
(Yes, Your Majesty.)

110
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,680
(Is Yue Jinchuan that impatient?)

111
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,510
I am deeply grateful

112
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,790
for your help, Princess.

113
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,600
How will you

114
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,960
repay this favor?

115
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,080
I had no idea you were so skilled.

116
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,750
I also didn't expect

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
the Seventh Prince to be so different
from the rumors.

118
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,080
You remain so calm in the face of danger.

119
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,550
Your attire is stained with blood.

120
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,480
It's inappropriate to return like this.

121
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,960
Why not clean it up at my palace?

122
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,750
Thank you, Your Highness.

123
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,080
You may take a moment to freshen up.

124
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,870
There are a few sets of clothes here.

125
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,440
See if any fit.

126
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

127
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,120
(Back then, you were so close
to my father and the Fifth Prince.)

128
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,120
(Do you know the truth)

129
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,600
(behind the Incident of Zhaotian Tower?)

130
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,820
(Ning)

131
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,750
(Consort Ning's belongings?)

132
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,360
Why are you here, Princess?

133
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,160
Your Highness.

134
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,270
You haven't answered

135
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,320
my question.

136
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,670
I couldn't find any suitable clothes,

137
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
so I came to take a look.

138
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,110
Is that so?

139
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,000
If you don't believe me,

140
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
check it yourself.

141
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,440
Who are you exactly?

142
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,080
I am Princess Yingge, of course.

143
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,600
I will soon be your father's consort.
