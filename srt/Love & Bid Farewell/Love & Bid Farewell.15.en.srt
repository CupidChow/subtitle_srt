00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,460
(The Eastern Palace)

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,520
Your Highness,

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,870
there are countless women in the world.

22
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,480
Why are you so fixated on her?

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,400
Even

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,200
to the point of risking your own life.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,960
Yes,

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,590
why is it her?

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,710
But what if I insist on keeping her?

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,120
Your Highness,

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,920
if you persist,

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,920
I will eliminate her

31
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,120
before she can harm you,

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,280
even at the cost of my own life.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,870
Please don't forget the hardships

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,560
we've faced to get here.

35
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,510
If she wants to fly away,

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,630
then I'll break her wings.

37
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,310
That way, she can stay by my side forever.

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,240
Go summon the Dark Blade's physician.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,920
Yes.

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Yue Jinchen,

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,520
what are you planning now?

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,870
Yao, don't be afraid.

43
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,590
Let this old physician

44
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,000
examine you.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,710
You're the one who's sick!

46
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,030
She's a natural talent for martial arts.

47
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,000
No wonder she's made some progress
over the years.

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,590
But Your Highness,
consider this carefully.

49
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,840
If her martial skills are destroyed,

50
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,430
it will damage her tendons and bones.

51
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,190
She won't be able
to regain such strength again.

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,800
No,

53
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,200
no!

54
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,710
No!

55
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,750
No!

56
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,240
I'm begging you! Don't do it.

57
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,310
As long as I'm here,

58
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,520
you will never need to wield a blade again.

59
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,360
Just do your job.

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,400
Yao,

61
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,630
this way, you can stay
by my side forever.

62
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,400
Your Highness,

63
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,310
as per your orders,

64
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,000
we've checked everyone
in the Eastern Palace.

65
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,880
Keep a closer watch
on the palace from now on.

66
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,190
Yao is very weak right now.

67
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,720
I must protect her well.

68
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,670
Your Highness,

69
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,040
was today's court session smooth?

70
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,150
It was fine.

71
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,370
Greetings to Your Highness.

72
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,160
Has Manager Gu woken up yet?

73
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,270
Not yet.

74
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,470
Yao!

75
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,670
Yao!

76
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,350
Yao!

77
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,270
Yao! Shiba, call the Imperial Physician!

78
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,270
Yes.

79
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,670
Yao!

80
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,720
Yao, don't scare me.

81
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,400
Yao,

82
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,760
wake up!

83
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,070
Yao, don't scare me. Yao!

84
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,350
Don't scare me.

85
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,480
Don't scare me, Yao.

86
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,000
If you don't wake up,

87
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,160
I'll bury the entire Zhao Ming family
with you.

88
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,750
Wake up!

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
No.

90
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,230
No.

91
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm begging you.

92
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm begging you…

93
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,150
No...

94
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,400
Yao,

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,950
hurt me if you want.

96
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,950
But don't hurt yourself.

97
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
Yao.

98
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,030
Yao.

99
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,630
Look, I brought you something nice.

100
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,200
This.

101
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,040
This is called
the Water-Powered Puppet Theater.

102
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,680
I bought it for you
at the temple fair in the east of the city.

103
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,310
They say Ma Jun made this

104
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,510
for Emperor Wei Ming.

105
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,910
Look at these little figures,

106
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,400
aren't they interesting?

107
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,830
Yao, look at this, and this.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,840

Your Highness.

133
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,390
Your Excellency,

134
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,960
I made this myself.

135
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,750
Please take it back and try it.

136
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,360
You're very thoughtful, Your Excellency.

137
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,750
If you're not in a hurry
to return to the palace,

138
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,200
would you accompany me
to the temple fair in the east of the city?

139
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,840
I've heard they have
many interesting things there.

140
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,150
I've never been there.

141
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm sorry,

142
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,150
I still have official duties
to attend to today.

143
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,600
So I won't be able to accompany you.

144
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,990
Official duties come first.

145
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,240
The temple fair can wait for another time.

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,390
Your Highness, go handle your duties.

147
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,110
I'll take my leave.

148
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,910
Your Excellency,

149
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,600
we clearly inquired and found out

150
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,240
that His Highness is on leave
for the next few days…

151
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
Silence!

152
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,720
Maybe he suddenly

153
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,790
had some official matters to attend to.

154
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,910
He is the Crown Prince.

155
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,390
It's normal for him to be busy.

156
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,750
No matter how busy he is,

157
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,990
he wouldn't be too busy to spend half a day
at the temple fair with you.

158
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,550
I've heard

159
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,440
there's a favored lady official
in His Highness's palace.

160
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,600
She spends every day
eating and sleeping with him.

161
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,510
Could it be that His Highness
doesn't want to accompany you

162
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,960
because of her?

163
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,670
- How dare you!
- I know my mistake.

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,320
Your Excellency!

165
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,480
- Your Excellency, you can't go in!
- Your Excellency, you can't enter!

166
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,550
What's stopping me?

167
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,480
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- Today, I insist on seeing what's inside

168
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,030
What kind of vixen lives here?

169

170
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,670
I'd like to see who dares to touch me!

171
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,480
Today, I'll see for myself

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,670

173
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,240
is so carefully guarded in here.
