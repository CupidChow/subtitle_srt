(Token of Authority)
Who are you to block the way?

21
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,310
How dare you to disturb His Highness?

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,310
Can you bear the consequences?
Make way.

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,340
(Seventh Prince's Residence)

24
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,400
Did you send someone to follow me?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,950
Because you are always involved
in unexpected accidents

26
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,400
in unexpected places.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,870
It is truly intriguing

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
to see how you manage to do so.

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,120
If I had allied with the Third Prince,

30
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,240
I would surely

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,310
be dead by now.

32
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,030
Am I right, Your Highness?

33
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,680
Who are you?

34
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,680
I am but a wandering soul in this world,

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,360
here only for vengeance.

36
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,590
(Why don't you just live your life?)

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
(You're here for revenge,)

38
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,280
(but against whom?)

39
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,710
Who is your nemesis?

40
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,750
The Chancellor.

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,400
My savior was brutally murdered

42
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,400
by the Chancellor.

43
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,630
What are you doing, Your Highness?

44
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
If your wound isn't treated soon,

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,030
it will get worse.

46
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,310
The Empress summoned the Seventh Prince
to the palace immediately.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

48
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,080
Do you know

49
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,630
why I summoned you today?

50
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,030
I do not.

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,360
How rude.

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,470
You've been getting
more and more presumptuous lately.

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
After your altercation with Jinchuan

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,630
in the Imperial Garden today,

55
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,080
he fell ill upon his return.

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,470
The imperial physician said

57
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,520
that only the finest snow lotus
from the ice mountain can cure him.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,150
You know

59
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,190
that is very difficult
to melt the ice of the snow lotus.

60
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,960
It requires the warmth
of human touch to melt it

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,520
to preserve its efficacy.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,190
You have been kind and gentle by nature.

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm sure you'd be willing

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,470
to melt the ice for your brother.

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,800
Even if the Emperor
has only two sons remaining,

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,600
the position of crown prince

67
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,270
is not for a scoundrel like you to covet.

68
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,270
This is fine ice presented
by the ice craftsmen of Lantian.

69
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,390
Very difficult to melt.

70
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,240
Your Highness must have the blood

71
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,390
in your palm cool down completely

72
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,160
to live up to the Empress's good intentions.

73
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,430
You vile creature.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,190
Just like your scheming mother,

75
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,830
you're both beneath contempt.

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,400
Well, well, well.

77
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,070
Look at those eyes.

78
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,670
What now?

79
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,600
Can't keep up the act anymore?

80
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,480
Today, I shall see

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,630
whether it was others who wrongly accused you

82
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,390
in the death of the Crown Prince,

83
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,000
or if you truly are a vicious being.

84
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,070
Greetings to the Empress.

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,680
Princess Yingge,

86
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,070
why are you not staying
in your Palace of Yueying?

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,800
What brings you here?

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm here

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,720
to clear up a misunderstanding.

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
(Do you have to drag me into this?)

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
(You'll regret it.)

92
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,950
Princess Yingge,

93
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,800
does it have anything to do with you?

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,160
Yes, it does.

95
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,920
Earlier in the Imperial Garden,

96
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,680
I had a dispute with the Third Prince.

97
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,480
The Seventh Prince argued with him

98
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,310
to protect me.

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,160
It wasn't a matter
of disrespecting his elder brother.

100
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,040
So, it seems

101
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,070
Jinchuan is the one to blame.

102
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
That's not what I meant.

103
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,040
I just want to say

104
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,480
that this was a simple misunderstanding.

105
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,030
A misunderstanding?

106
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,800
Even if Jinchuan had accidentally intruded,

107
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,160
it must be because of your reckless behavior

108
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,680
and your guilty conscience.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,270
You have not yet married into the palace,

110
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,310
but you are already entangled with the princes.

111
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,720
This is a disgrace to the court
and a breach of etiquette.

112
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,630
I shall teach you some manners today.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Slap her!

114
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,760
Stop!

115
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,630
Dieling, go and invite His Majesty
to the Empress's palace.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,070
Tell him that to show Yueying's respect,

117
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,950
I plan to prepare a Yueying delicacy

118
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
and invite His Majesty
and the Empress to taste it together.

119
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,720
Yes, Your Highness.

120
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,630
Greetings, Your Majesty.

121
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,680
What are you doing?

122
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,680
Reprimanding a prince

123
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,750
and slapping a princess?

124
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,360
Is this how you act as my Empress?

125
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,070
I was teaching her some manners.

126
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,080
Manners?

127
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,720
She hasn't married into the palace yet,

128
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,800
and that makes her a guest here.

129
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,680
As the Empress,

130
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,000
is this how you treat guests?

131
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,120
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

132
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,560
Enough.

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,750
Help Princess Yingge up

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,870
and tend to her carefully.

135
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

136
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

137
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,360
You're in shock, Princess.

138
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,480
Escort the princess to rest.

139
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,400
And take the Seventh Prince

140
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,190
to rest as well.

141
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

142
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,860
(Palace of Yueying)

143
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,310
Thank you for your help today, Princess.

144
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,070
But I fear the Empress

145
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,240
won't let you off easily in the future.

146
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,230
There's no need for such formality,
Your Highness.

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,080
I only wonder

148
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,320
if you're willing to give me a chance

149
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
to trust me.

150
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,840
So I can continue to help you

151
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,480
and return this favor.

152
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Why did you choose me?

153
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,510
Because we are the same kind of people.

154
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,840
In that case,

155
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,030
I have no reason to refuse.

156
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,390
I won't let you down, Your Highness.

157
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,240
(Yue Jinchen,)

158
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,960
(how did you survive)

159
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,600
(the Incident of Zhaotian Tower?)

160
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,230
Your Highness.

161
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,390
Do you really trust her?

162
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,440
Don't worry.

163
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,720
Those with ill intentions

164
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,750
won't live long.

165
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,240
Princess Yingge

166
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,150
appears gentle and kind,

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,080
yet she dared to defy the Empress

168
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
for the Seventh Prince's sake.

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,360
(Chancellor of the Great Dynasty)
What could she possibly gain from this?

170
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,480
What good does it do her

171
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,600
to save the Seventh Prince?

172
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,840
Whatever her motive,

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,550
a soon-to-be consort mingles

174
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,960
with a prince

175
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,670
saves me some trouble.

176
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,630
If that's the case,

177
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,510
we can't keep her around.

178
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,870
Lest she becomes a pawn for others.

179
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,120
I'll make arrangements right away.
