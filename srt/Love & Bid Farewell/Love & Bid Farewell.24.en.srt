20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,910
Your Highness!

21
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,070
- Your Highness.
- Where is Yao?

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,350
Where is she? Have you found her?

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,510
Rest assured, Your Highness.
Miss Gu has been found.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,120
But as soon as she returned,
she went into her room

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,120
and hasn't come out since.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,430
She hasn't even asked to see you.

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,150
As long as she's safe.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,300
Your Highness, you're so badly injured,

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,400
yet you're still thinking of her?

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,430
The physician said that arrow

31
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,040
was just an inch away
from piercing your heart.

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,350
Was it worth it?

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,280
Yao still cares about me.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,560
You didn't see

35
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,350
how anxious she was

36
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,550
when the assassin tried to kill me

37
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,790
and how worried she was

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,590
when I got hurt.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,960
Oh, by the way, Your Highness,

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,560
we've identified those assassins.

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,150
They were all subordinates
of General Zhao Ming,

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,400
seeking revenge.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,080
The remaining conspirators
have been imprisoned.

44
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,870
Zhao Ming...

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,560
Even in death, he haunts me.

46
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,750
Your Highness, His Majesty has summoned you.

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,290
Your Highness,

48
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,080
lately, there have all been complaints
about you and Miss Gu.

49
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,150
His Majesty must be summoning you
regarding this matter.

50
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,120
Chen, what happened to your injury?

51
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,360
Is it because of that Gu girl again?

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
In reply, Father,

53
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,000
I was ambushed by assassins

54
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,630
while on an outing.

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,120
It was only thanks to Miss Gu,
who risked her life

56
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,630
that I was saved.

57
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,240
You are the Crown Prince,

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,870
surrounded by countless skilled guards,

59
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,150
yet you needed an unarmed girl

60
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
to protect you?

61
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,590
I may be old,

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,310
but I'm not senile!

63
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,630
Do you really expect me

64
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,960
to believe such nonsense?

65
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,470
Every word I've said is the truth.

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Enough!

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,120
You two are worlds apart.

68
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
Seeing your persistence,

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,680
I was willing to consider it,

70
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,710
but now it's threatening
the very foundation of the state.

71
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,400
You are my only son,

72
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,000
and yet, for a woman,

73
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,000
you disregard your own safety

74
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,710
and take such reckless risks.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
I've made up my mind.

76
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,030
This will never happen!

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,470
Father, please reconsider.

78
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,550
How dare you!

79
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,710
Get out!

Gu Junyao, daughter of the former head

146
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,510
let's go home.

147
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,040
Miss, with the happy occasion approaching,

148
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,200
why do you seem to be getting thinner?

149
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,910
Have you ever heard of a bird
with its feathers plucked?

150
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,670
Thinner?

151
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,080
If it doesn't take flight again,
it will fall.

152
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,960
Forgive me for speaking out of turn.
I deserve to be punished.

153
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,270
The one who deserves punishment
is someone else.

154
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,160
Yao,

155
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,920

Chen,

158
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,200

it hurts, doesn't it?

161
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,720
Have you forgotten?

162
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,390
We took the Poison Mandarin Ducks together.

163
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,280
If you're in pain,

164
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm in pain.

165
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,680
If I'm injured,

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,840
you're injured.

167
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,960
This is the closest I've ever been to you.

168
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,960
But in the end,

169
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,150
I still couldn't keep you.

170
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,080
You know my lips are poisoned.

171
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,550
But I accept it willingly.

172

Isn't this what our relationship
has been like?

00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,990
Yao,

174
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,240
it hurts so much.

175
