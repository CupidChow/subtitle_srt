What are you doing here?

29
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,840
General Jiang He, you're accused

30
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
of colluding with the enemies,
withholding provisions,

was my mother.

I thought I could protect the people around me,

68
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,040
but she never confided in me.

69
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,070
It wasn't until she was accused of witchcraft

70
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,070
and forced to hang herself

was covered in wounds.

73
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,310

76
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,390
for bringing this up.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,390

to keep those you cherish close.

81
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
I hope you're right, Princess.

82
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,190
So I can keep those I care about safe.

Yao,

90
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,630
I know you're hesitant to connect with me,

91
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,480
and I understand.

92
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,480
When the Gu family was wiped out,

93
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,830
I thought you were dead,

94
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,720
and the pain was unbearable.

95
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,830
Now that we've met again,

96
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,870
I'm overwhelmed with emotion.

97
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,750
I'm no longer the powerless youth

98
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,200
I was ten years ago.

99
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,750
Now, I can protect you.

100
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,680
The events of the past

101
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,750
caused me great sorrow,

102
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
but I hope you'll give me a chance.

103
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,440
I swear to protect you with my life
for the rest of my days.

104
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,000
I must leave the capital for a few days

105
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,360
to quell a rebellion.

106
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,670
If anything dangerous happens,

107
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,870
please take care of yourself

108
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,240
until I return.

109
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,600
Wish you a safe return.

110
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,860

111
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,560

112
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,390

113
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm on the mend.

114
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,120
What brings you here?

115
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,750
I've found evidence
that Physician Gu was framed.

116
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,480
Don't you find it odd

117
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,270
how quiet
the Empress's faction has been lately?

118
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,390
Do you suspect...

119
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,080
Yes.

120
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,390
But with this evidence,

121
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,670
the Chancellor and the Third Prince
are both guilty of treason.

122
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,990
Since the Empress holds great power,

123
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,080
I think they have further schemes.

124
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,550
The Third Prince has arrived.

125
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,910
You two are together again?

126
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
Perfect.

127
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,240
It saves me another trip.

128
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,120
Yingge, the Princess of Yueying, brought
disgrace with scandalous affairs,

129
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,240
seducing a prince.

130
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,750
Yue Jinchen, the Seventh Prince,
disobedient and unfilial,

131
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,480
he was bewitched

132
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,750
and poisoned the Emperor,

133
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,960
and committed treason.

134
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,120
By the decree of Her Majesty the Empress,

135
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,270
you are both to be apprehended
and brought to justice.

136
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,840
What did you say?

137
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,320
Father's been poisoned?

138
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,480
Isn't this your doing, Jinchen?

139
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,790
You conspired with an enchantress
and poisoned Father,

140
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
who is still unconscious.

141
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,470
Seventh Prince,

142
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,110

144
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,360
I do care for you after all

145
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,150
for having a beauty to keep you company.

146
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,670
You two

147
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,390
should enjoy your time here.

Your Highness, are you all right?

152
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,990
I'm fine.

153
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,910
I just need a moment to rest.

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,470

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,980
Just after five o'clock in the afternoon.

189
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,550
It's been quite a while.

190
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,510
This won't do.

191
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,870
We need to find a way to get out of here.

192
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,040
Seventh Prince,

193
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,240
Princess Yingge,

194
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,720
His Majesty summons you.

195
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,350
Father has awakened?

196
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,150
Your Majesty,

197
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,510
you just recovered.

198
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,790
There's no need for you

199
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,790
to personally attend to these criminals.

200
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,200
There are criminals to be punished,

201
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,270
but not these two.

202
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,990
Lai Fu.

203
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,120
Your Majesty was poisoned days ago,

204
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,840
yet thanks to the prescription
sent by the Seventh Prince,

205
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,600
the Imperial Academy of Medicine

206
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,320
was able to prepare an antidote.

207
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,870
Your Majesty,

208
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,840
this must be a ruse by Yingge
and the Seventh Prince conspired the poison

209
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,550
and then provided the prescription.

210
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,040
Your Highness,

211
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,480
after careful examination
by the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

212
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,990
it was confirmed that the antidote
was a formula of the late Physician Gu.

213
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,600
Moreover, traces of the poison were found

214
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,320
in the Third Prince's palace.

215
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,100
(Prescription)

216
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,080
Father, you are very wise.

217
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,270
I am innocent.

218
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,150
This must be Jinchen's doing.

219
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,480
He staged this entire act

220
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,480
to frame me.

221
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,080
Jinchen,

222
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,240
do you have anything to say?

223
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
Speaking of framing,

224
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,000
I have a letter

225
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,960
I'd like Father to review.
