00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,280
(Why did you return?)

20
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,000
(What is your true intention?)

21
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,640
Greetings, Princess Yingge.

22
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,310
What brings you here, Princess?

23
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,590
If I say

24
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,840
I'm here to help you,

25
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,800
would you believe me, Your Highness?

26
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,750
The princess is now betrothed to the Emperor.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,870
Please mind your conduct.

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Then tell me, Your Highness,

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,560
how should I mind my conduct?

30
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,120
What do you want exactly?

31
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,870
To get you

32
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,750
to mourn Consort Ning

33
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,910
openly and honorably.

34
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,400
That's presumptuous.

35
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,630
I propose an alliance.

36
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,630
I will help you ascend the throne

37
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,630
and all I ask is for peace in Yueying.

38
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,190
If you want to compete with the Third Prince,

39
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,190
you will need a strong ally.

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,910
And I have the entire Yueying behind me.

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,310
Please leave, Princess.

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll pretend that we never met today.

43
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,150
It is said

44
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,800
that the Seventh Prince is as ethereal
as a banished immortal,

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,430
devoid of desires

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,400
and indifferent to palace affairs.

47
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,080
I find that hard to believe.

48
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,710
It seems that your tranquil surface conceals
a depth of complexity,

49
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
like a pool of ink.

50
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,360
Where are you heading, Princess Yingge?

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,630
I shall see you off.

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,950
No need to trouble yourself, Your Highness.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,390
I'm out for a walk

54
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,630
and shall return shortly.

55
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,390
Hold on, Princess.

56
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,720
If you become Father's favored consort,

57
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,630
we won't have such opportunities

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,270
to stroll together again.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,390
Please mind your manners, Your Highness.

60
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,470
Brother.

61
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,600
We are in the Imperial Garden,

62
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
surrounded by prying eyes.

63
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,360
I suggest you to be discreet.

64
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,030
Jinchen,

65
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,950
I didn't expect to see you here.

66
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,950
I suppose the palace paths

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
were treacherous the other night.

68
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,360
With no power or influence now,

69
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,830
it's hard for you to protect yourself,

70
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,630
yet you want to shield a beauty?

71
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,150
Princess,

72
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,160
our paths will cross again.

73
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,830
Princess, are you all right?

74
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
Would you kindly escort me back?

75
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,310
The Palace of Yueying is not far from here.

76
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,600
You may return on your own.

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,750
Why are you so cold to me?

78
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,600
I'd like to remind you

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,240
that the Third Prince is around.

80
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,070
You're not my only option.

81
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,750
I am glad to hear that.

82
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,510
Just don't break your own wings, Princess.

83
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,030
Good day.

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,080
Princess,

85
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,680
the envoy has arrived.

86
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,750
I understand. You may leave.

87
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,110
As you wish.

88
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,560
What brings

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
the envoy here today?

90
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,430
I am here to remind the princess

91
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,680
of the task entrusted by the King of Yueying.

92
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,070
Rest assured.

93
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,270
I have everything under control.

94
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,150
Is that so?

95
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,070
Then why are you getting involved

96
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,950
with the Seventh Prince?

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,680
Have you forgotten

98
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,070
what your task is, Princess?

99
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,310
Of course not.

100
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,680
I approached the Seventh Prince

101
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,480
because he may be of use to me.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,600
What do you mean?

103
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,560
He's the only one who survived

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,040
the Incident of Zhaotian Tower.

105
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,800
It's getting late.

106
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,270
You may leave.

107
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,670
Princess,

108
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,720
I will be watching you closely.

109
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,750
Don't do anything that harms Yueying.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,190
Or your true identity
will be the first to be exposed.

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,880
Lord Gu,

112
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,430
you've brought this upon yourself.

113
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,560
This is the price
of siding with the Fifth Prince.

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,600
The extermination of the Gu family

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
is all your own doing.

116
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,950
I wonder who will fall first tonight,

117
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,430
you or Yue Jinchen.

118
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,910
Princess.

119
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,870
Princess, are you all right?

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,560
I am exhausted and want to rest.

121
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,710
You may leave.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
As you wish.

123
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,870
(Dieling)
(Approach the Seventh Prince?)

124
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,750
(That's a dead end.)

125
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,480
(To get you)

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,870
(to mourn Consort Ning openly and honorably.)

127
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,270
(Given your current situation,
if you don't act soon,)

128
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,840
(you will surely fall by another's blade.)

129
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,960
Do you know what to do?

130
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,160
Yes, Your Highness.

131
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,860
(Third Prince's Palace)

132
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,000
(The Third Prince led the investigation
into the Incident of Zhaotian Tower.)

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,840
(If there are any clues,)

134
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
(they should be here.)

135
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,960
Your Highness,

136
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,250
she went to the Third Prince's palace.

137
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,000
I was afraid I'd be noticed
if I followed too closely,

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,910
so I came back first.

139
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,120
The Third Prince?

140
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,990
Yes.

141
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,790
(What is she back for?)

142
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,550
(Intriguing.)

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,840
Who's there?

144
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,080
