=Episode 8=

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,280
I have a letter

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,350
I'd like Father to review.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,040
Your Majesty,

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
these are letters between Jiang He,

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,320
the Third Prince, and the Chancellor

24
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,070
found in Jiang He's residence.

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,200
Years ago, the Third Prince conspired
with the Chancellor

26
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,350
to poison the Crown Prince

27
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,560
and frame the Fifth Prince.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,200
To protect himself,

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,860
(Plan completed. Silence all who knows.)
Jiang He kept evidence of their collusion.

30
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,680
(Yue Jinchuan)
Recently,

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,040
the Third Prince could no longer

32
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,200
suppress his ambitions.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
He attempted the same trick

34
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,400
to poison Your Majesty
and frame the Seventh Prince,

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,400
hoping to claim the throne that way.

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,840
His intentions are treacherous.

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
Utter nonsense.

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,150
As a princess from another land,

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,630
you not only had an affair
with the Seventh Prince

40
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,120
but also meddled in state affairs

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,150
and falsely accuse my son.

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,590
How dare you!

43
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,870
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,430
I am not the legitimate princess of Yueying.

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,280
Years ago, I drifted into Yueying

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,910
and became acquainted
with the royal family.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,560
I later returned under the guise
of presenting tributes.

48
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,840
I am the daughter of the late
Imperial Physician Gu Xun'an,

49
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,750
Gu Junyao.

50
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,750
Father, the word

51
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,400
of a criminal's daughter means nothing.

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,000
You mustn't listen to their one-sided story.

53
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,080
Report.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,800
General Jiang He has confessed.

55
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,620
(Jiang He)

56
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,710
Jiang He already confessed.

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,710
Zhao Ming found the same letters
in the Chancellor's residence.

58
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,710
Do you still deny it?

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,310
No, Father.

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,520
Father, I…

61
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,910
I...

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
Father, forgive me!

63
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,360
Wasn't I always your favorite?

64
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,430
Please, Father,

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,280
give me a chance to redeem myself.

66
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,120
You scoundrel.

67
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,910
My beloved Crown Prince was killed
because of you.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,590
Now, you want to poison me as well?

69
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,360
You've committed

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,400
unforgivable sins!

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
Father.

72
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,150
Father.

73
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,470
And remember,

74
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,590
you are not my only son.

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,710
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,310
Gu Junyao concealed her identity.

77
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,750
That's a crime of deception.

78
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,870
It's a lapse in judgment for Jinchuan.

79
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,360
But he's still your son, Your Majesty!

80
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Silence!

81
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,710
Your Majesty.

82
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,590
Junyao,

83
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,310
you may rise.

84
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,000
Approach.

85
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,240
No wonder I found you familiar.

86
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,110
Well,

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,510
In consideration
of your loyalty to your father,

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,240
your righteousness,

89
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,870
and for saving me,

90
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,600
I shall pardon you.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
Henceforth,

92
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
you shall stay in the Seventh Prince's palace

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,480
as a Chief Steward.

94
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,750
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your mercy.

95
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,270
Jinchen,

96
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,430
I've neglected you

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,920
all these years.

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,120
From now on,

99
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,430
you must grow and be stronger

100
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,750
to live up to my expectations.

101
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,800
The Chancellor has committed treason,

102
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,190
poisoned the Emperor,

103
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,800
and conspired to murder the Fifth Prince
and Imperial Physician Gu.

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,680
He is to be immediately imprisoned
in the death cell.

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,920
Yue Jinchen, the Third Prince,
disobedient and unfilial,

106
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,830
is guilty of plotting against the Crown Prince

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,240
and framing another prince.

108
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,680
His title is revoked,

109
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,560
and he is to be confined in Zhuque Pavilion.

110
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,920
The Empress failed to properly guide her son
but ﻿harbored him,

111
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,870
is to reflect on her mistakes grounded.

112
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,310
For exposing Yueying's ambitions,

113
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,000
Gu Junyao is appointed
as Supreme Chief Steward

114
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,720
and will serve
in the Seventh Prince's residence.

115
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
The sun shines bright,

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,870
but gazing at it may harm your eyes.

117
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,040
Better to keep them covered.

118
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,600
What do you want to ask, Your Highness?

119
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,950
I'm just glad

120
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,720
that you've reclaimed your identity

121
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,510
and avenged your father.

122
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,950
I owe much to your unwavering support.

123
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,270
What do you plan to do next?

124
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,200
I just

125
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,510
want to be myself again.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
Your Highness,

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,900
Defender Duke requests your presence
at his residence.

128
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,820
(Defender Duke's Mansion)

129
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,120
Your Highness,
I apologize for the sudden invitation.

130
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,600
(Defender Duke)
I want to collaborate with you.

131
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Please elaborate.

132
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,630
Soon, you will be the Crown Prince.

133
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,720
My family is willing

134
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,600
to serve you with utmost loyalty.

135
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,190
Given your kindness,

136
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,950
I shall not fail you.

137
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Excellent.

138
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,150
Furthermore,

139
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,190
I would be grateful

140
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,070
if you could fulfill my wish.

141
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,400
I'm all ears.

142
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,920
I have a beloved daughter,

143
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,800
whom I wish to entrust to you.

144
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,920
I hope you shall protect her.

145
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,630
I understand

146
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,520
your intentions.

147
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,270
Your Highness,

148
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,720
are you going to cooperate with them?

149
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,120
Will you

150
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,560
marry the Duke's daughter?

151
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,320
Shiba,

152
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,680
have you been acting for long

153
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,920
that you forget your place?

154
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,990
Begging your pardon, Your Highness.

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
Rise.

156
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,280
Yes, my lord.

157
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,870
The Duke's family wields too much power.

158
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,670
They've long been a threat to Father.

159
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,440
Yet you're willing to work with them?

160
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,800
Where's Yao?

161
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,630
I don't know.

162
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,750
Go find her.

163
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,440
I need to speak with her.

164
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,870
The Duke's mansion, too?

165
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,710
Yes.

166
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes, my lord.

167
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,910
It's you?

168
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,560
Yes,

169
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,750
that's right.

170
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,790
Did you ever think you'd end up here

171
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,960
when you destroyed the Gu family?

172
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,080
I've served for decades.

173
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,630
Success and failure are a part of life.

174
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,910
Who could tell

175
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,120
what really happened back then?

176
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,960
Now, karma's coming for you.

177
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,320
Tell me the truth

178
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,790
about the Gu family's incident.

179
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,510
In the struggle for power,

180
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,120
no one's truly innocent.

181
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,800
(Silence the witness?)

182
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,960
(Who would still want
to silence the Chancellor now?)

183
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,710
What is it?

184
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,040
Chief Gu,

185
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,910
you might want to be cautious
of the Seventh Prince.

186
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,550
It's said he agreed

187
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,080
to marry the Duke's daughter

188
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,080
and plans to kill you

189
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,200
as a gesture of good faith.

190
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,630
Chief Gu,

191
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,320
His Highness requests your presence.

192
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,510
Yao,

193
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,750
you're here.

194
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,680
Your Highness.

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,960
I've been waiting for you.

196
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,040
Come.

197
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,440
I have something to say.

198
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,320
What is it?

199
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,000
Now that we had our revenge,

200
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,990
we should celebrate.

201
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,390
I've been waiting for you

202
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,630
to share this victory toast with me.

203
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,320
(Be cautious of the Seventh Prince.)

204
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,960
(He agreed to marry
the Duke's daughter)

205
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,870
(and plans to kill you
as a gesture of good faith.)

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
Yao?

207
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,920
Your Highness,

208
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,120
what did the Duke discuss with you?

209
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,550
Just some trivial matters.

210
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,240
Are you sure?

211
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,390
Leave the affairs of the court to me.

212
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,150
You needn't worry.

213
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,510
What's on your mind?

214
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,160
Nothing.

215
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,960
I went to the Imperial Prison
to see the Chancellor.

216
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,870
But someone seems to be trying to silence him.

217
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,270
After all the evil he's done,

218
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,150
it's no surprise that many want him dead.

219
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,270
But why take the risk now?

220
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,360
Take your mind off it, Yao.

221
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,720
They are of no consequence.

222
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,550
Don't let it upset you.

223
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,750
Your Highness, I...

224
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,590
Well, Yao.

225
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,550
Stop worrying.

226
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,510
Leave it to me.

227
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,910
(Are you really indifferent,)

228
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,120
(or are you hiding something?)

229
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,360
I trust you, Your Highness.

230
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,920
However,

231
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,390
now that your revenge is complete,

232
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,440
it's time for me to leave.

233
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,200
Leave?

234
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,600
You now hold great power,

235
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,440
and the throne is within your grasp.

236
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,600
My time here has ended.

237
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,360
I came here today

238
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,320
