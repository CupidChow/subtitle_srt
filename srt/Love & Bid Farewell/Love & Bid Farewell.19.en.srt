Long live Your Grace!

20
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,590
General Zhao Ming, please rise.

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,070
May I ask

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,480
why Your Grace summoned me for today?

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,590
It's a matter of great regret and misfortune.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,120
I've summoned you today, General,

25
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,590
to discuss the Crown Prince.

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,590
I can't bear to see

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,760
the Crown Prince's hands
stained with blood.

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,480
What do you mean, Your Grace?

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,040
I don't understand.

30
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,150
Although the Crown Prince
is not my biological son,

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,120
I've watched him grow up

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,070
and he calls me Mother.

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,760
As his mother,

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,870
I can't just stand by
and watch him make a mistake.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,920
I still don't understand
what Your Grace means.

36
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,710
General Zhao,

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,870
do you remember the Chief
by the Crown Prince's side,

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,560
a woman surnamed Gu?

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
His Highness said she was unwell

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,120
and has returned to her hometown.

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,680
If she truly has returned home,
that's it.

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,590
But I've heard

43
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,150
that this palace maid named Gu

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,520
has attempted to assassinate
the Crown Prince multiple times

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,240
and is no longer tolerated by him.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,080
She's to be executed tonight.

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,800
Your sister is about
to marry the Crown Prince,

48
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,430
and is surely more aware of his actions

49
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,680
than I, his mother.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,430
Why not ask her

51
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,800
what she thinks?

52
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,680
I take my leave.

53
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,420
(The Defender Duke's Mansion)

54
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,280
Sister, what's going on?

55
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,630
Why won't you tell me?

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Brother,

57
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,680
I...

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,840
Yao is in grave danger,

59
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,430
and you grew up with her.

60
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,120
Can you really bear to see her die?

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Brother,

62
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,590
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,710
Sister, what happened?

64
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,680
I didn't want this.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
I really didn't want this.

66
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,520
I didn't know the Crown Prince

67
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,360
had made her lose her memory.

68
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,470
I thought she was pretending.

69
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,870
I really didn't know,

70
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,590
so I...

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,240
Lost her memory?

72
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,750
What did you do?

73
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,030
I told her everything.

74
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,270
Brother,

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,030
I never thought the Crown Prince
would kill Sister Yao.

76
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,680
I didn't want things
to turn out this way.

77
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,990
Brother,

78
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,870
it was not intentional.

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
I understand now.

80
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,470
Brother!

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,680
General.

82
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,470
Have you found out anything?

83
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,430
Reporting to the General,

84
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,280
the Eastern Palace seems normal
on the surface,

85
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,430
but our spies report

86
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,510
that the Crown Prince does plan
to execute a traitor tonight.

87
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,830
Notify all the brothers,

88
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,430
come with me tonight.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,840
Yes.

90
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,500
(Command)

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,310
You say the Defender Northern Army
is showing signs of movement?

92
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,390
That's right.

93
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,440
We've confirmed the information.

94
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,630
Your Highness, should we prepare for this?

95
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,030
No need.

96
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,390
the Defender Duke's family
has always been loyal and upright.

97
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,870
They would never commit treason
or regicide.

98
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,000
However...

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,310
Your Highness, what is it?

100
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,630
Tonight, relocate Yao to another place.

101
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,830
Assign more people to guard her carefully.

102
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,600
As for Zhao Ming,

103
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,950
let's see how far he gets.

104
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Yes.

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,310
Why are you in such a hurry?

106
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,670
Miss Gu,

107
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,750
we're following the His Highness's orders

108
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,120
to move you to a different residence.

109
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,870
- Move to a different residence?
- That's right.

110
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,560
We've heard that bandits
might attack tonight,

111
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,800
so we're relocating you

112
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,750
to avoid alarming you.

113
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
Bandits?

114
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,830
We don't know

115
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,120
what exactly is happening.

116
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,310
Please come with us.

117
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,630
Your Highness, everything is in order.

118
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,950
Your Highness, are we really going
to act against Zhao Ming?

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
After all, he's backed
by the Defender Duke.

120
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,510
And the Defender Northern Army
has great influence among the people.

121
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,150
If we...

122
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,360
If he doesn't come to the Eastern Palace,

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,950
then I'll let it go this time.

124
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,000
But if he dares to take Yao,

125
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,720
he's courting death.

126
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,750
Not even the gods

127
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,870
can save him.

128
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,240
Yes, understood.

129
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,040
(Yao's jade pendant is here.)

130
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,800
(But she's missing.)

131
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
Capture the intruders!

132
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
Withdraw!

133
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,990
Anyone who trespasses
into the Eastern Palace will be killed!

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,160
Your Highness, General Zhao Ming
has entered Miss Gu's room with his men.

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
Kill them.

136
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Yes.

137
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,480
Over there! Hurry, pursue them!

138
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,040
Miss Gu, it's terrifying outside.

139
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,310
Let's go back.

140
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,430
(Brother Zhao Ming?)

141
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,350
Stop!

142
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,350
Over there!

143
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
Quick!

144
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,150
Stop!

145
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,840
- Miss Gu!
- Move aside!

146
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Miss Gu,

147
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,270
His Highness has ordered

148
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,560
that you cannot leave this courtyard.

149
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,040
Everyone, step aside!

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
Yes.

151
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,990
General Zhao Ming, what is your purpose
in trespassing into the Eastern Palace

152
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
at night without a decree?

153
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,230
Yue Jinchen,

154
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,840
why do you pretend to be oblivious?

155
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,150
You know exactly

156
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,960
why I'm here.

157
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,790
How dare you, traitor,

158
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,670
to address the Crown Prince by name!

159
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,560
Traitor?

160
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,240
I have no treacherous intent.

161
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,150
I've come to the Eastern Palace tonight,

162
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,440
not in the name
of the Defender Duke's Mansion,

163
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,320
nor as a representative
of the Defender Northern Army,

164
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,480
but to protect a woman I love.

165
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,840
I know that trespassing
into the Eastern Palace without a decree

166
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,790
is a crime deserving death,

167
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,120
and I never expected
to leave alive tonight.

168
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,080
I only ask for one thing:

169
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,960
My brothers

170
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,440
who came with me

171
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,750
are innocent,

172
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,200
please spare their lives.

173
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,960
I promise you.

174
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,480
We will defend the General to the death!

175
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes, we will defend the General
to the death!

176
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,630
Leave.

177
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,910
I'm ordering you to leave!

178
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,040
This is an order!

179
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,470
Go!

180
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,710
Ready?

181
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,350
Wait!

182
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,550
Brother Zhao Ming!

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
Yao!

184
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Go!

185
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,680
Run!

186
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,630
Go!

187
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,720
Go!

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,080
Just go!

189
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,960
Why are you leaving me?
