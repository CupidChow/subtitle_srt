1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,180
(Episode 30)

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,750
Sorry!

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,690
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,890
I won't see you off.

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,290
Thanks for your hard work.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,730
Let's grab a drink
with the police commissioner soon.

10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,260
Goodness, let's do that.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,540
Man Su, live a good life.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,910
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,850
I won't gain anything
by jumping on him...

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,250
and demanding an answer right now.

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,180
I've been through this already.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,650
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,750
Excuse me.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,890
You saved my life.

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,390
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

20
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,960
You have my loyalty.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,760
Watch what you say.

22
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,070
We're at a police station.

23
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,090
Hwang Gi Chan.

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,290
I hoped you wouldn't be that low.

25
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,360
Were you the one...

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,430
who tried to kill me?

27
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,370
You killed Eun Ho?

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,870
How can you do that to him
as his dad?

29
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,270
You're not human.

30
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,240
You can't be called human.

31
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,480
We can't detain him
solely on the driver's testimony.

32
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,120
He took cash from Hong Man Su,
so there was no transaction history.

33
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,890
There's no hard evidence.

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
Goodness, hello.

35
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,560
Hello.

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,700
Right. This case.

37
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,370
So, you can't keep him detained?

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,710
Hong's attorney called it
an unlawful arrest...

39
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,470
and had a go at us,

40
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,480
even requesting a review
of the legality of his arrest.

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,150
We don't have enough evidence
to investigate him under custody,

42
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,820
so it won't be easy
to take this to court.

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,220
You're saying
I'll need hard evidence.

44
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,220
That's right.

45
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,190
We're doing our best to investigate,

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,660
so please trust us and wait,

47
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,960
although it must be hard for you.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,730
- Do your best.
- Yes, sir.

49
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,050
What happened?

50
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,660
Was Mr. Hong released?

51
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,630
Why won't you even answer me?

52
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,300
What happened to Mr. Hong?

53
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,640
Did it not work out?

54
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,240
Your tone makes me think that
you must be done reflecting on yourself.

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,240
I thought you weren't mad anymore.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,710
I said I'd do my best.
I never said I forgot it all.

57
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,480
How can I feel better
after Eun Ho's death?

58
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,950
How long will you be like this?

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,550
Do you want to torture me like this?

60
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,520
Fine, I'll turn myself in.

61
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,760
Should I go tell the police
that I made Mr. Hong kill Eun Ho?

62
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,130
I should've done that
from the start.

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,830
If I had, I wouldn't have made
your life so hard.

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,640
This must be the only way
for you to save yourself.

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,410
I'll turn myself in now.

66
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,840
Let go of me. Let go!

67
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,180
I'll turn myself in! Let go of me!

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,380
That's enough!

69
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,320
What do I have to do?

70
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,150
What do you expect me to do?

71
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,590
Should I die after Eun Ho?

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,930
I want to kill myself, too.

73
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,930
I want to see Eun Ho
and apologize to him in person.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,260
Then, what about Ji Ho?

75
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,400
What about our poor Ji Ho?

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,250
Get a good rest, Mom.

77
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,440
Why did he turn out to be
that woman's younger brother?

78
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,570
He set my heart on fire...

79
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,010
and captured me so passionately.

80
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,380
How can this happen?

81
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,710
Will it be love or goodbye?

82
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,720
If I had to choose
between love and money,

83
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,420
I could easily answer
and choose money.

84
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,630
Where am I going to meet
a man like that at my age?

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,200
Darn it. It's either do or die.

86
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,500
I wasn't caught to this day,

87
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,570
so I just have to keep it quiet.

88
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,180
Hey, you were home.

89
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,210
Didn't you hear me
coming in with Mom?

90
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,750
I was deep in thought.

91
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,690
It's been a while,

92
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,190
so I wanted to make
a late-night snack for you.

93
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,460
Are you craving anything?

94
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,360
How about
seasoned whelk and noodles?

95
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,590
Let's grab some soju and beer.

96
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,690
Do I look like
a little child to you?

97
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,300
You can't coax me with food anymore.

98
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,270
You should find a different method.

99
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,940
Is it wrong
to want to lighten your mood?

100
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,240
Do you think I want to humor you?

101
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,840
Then, don't do it.

102
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,440
Why would you do that
if you didn't want to?

103
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,150
I'll beg your father
to quit his part-time job.

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,550
Are we good now?

105
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,990
You have no idea why I'm mad.

106
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,920
Wasn't it because I kept
his part-time job a secret?

107
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,260
Did you forget
all about the things...

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,800
you said to me?

109
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,370
I was just mad. That's all.

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,200
Anyway, how did he find out...

111
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,710
about Eun Ho's thing?

112
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,110
Are you sure you didn't tell him?

113
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,710
You should ask him yourself.

114
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,250
That'd be the most accurate.

115
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,880
Me?

116
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,320
Why not? Can't you do it?

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,020
Are you too embarrassed?

118
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,520
I know he's my dad,
but I can't ask him, either.

119
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,260
And why?

120
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,990
I'm embarrassed, too.

121
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,970
Darn it.

122
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,440
I was about to go
to the police station.

123
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,580
Did they catch Hong Man Su?

124
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,320
Where's Ms. Jung?

125
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,250
She went to the supermarket
around the corner with Bo Ram.

126
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,860
Hong Man Su...

127
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,490
was arrested,
but he was released immediately.

128
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,460
What do you mean?

129
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,240
Are you all right?

130
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,440
I should've died.

131
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,080
Then, Eun Ho would still be here,

132
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,720
and I wouldn't have to find out
Gi Chan was that evil.

133
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,490
Do you want to avoid this?

134
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,730
Do you think
he would've grown decently...

135
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,930
if he grew up
with a father like that?

136
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,260
Is that what you want?

137
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,830
I find myself so pathetic.

138
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,400
Eun Ho died because of me,

139
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,370
but I have zero power
and let everything happen,

140
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,280
even though I'm his mother.

141
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,880
It's not over yet.

142
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,880
You still have the driver
as the witness.

143
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,950
There may be no hard evidence,
and you may not disclose everything,

144
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,290
but they can't hold out...

145
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,960
and deny this forever
as long as the witness is around.

146
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,530
It's been a while, Secretary Yoon.

147
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,510
Do you have an update on Ms. Choi?

148
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,970
I heard she was released
from the detention center.

149
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,050
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan?

150
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,350
Attorney Seo must've been
the middleman.

151
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,860
Attorney Seo is emigrating?

152
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,890
Yes, all right.

153
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,770
He's suddenly emigrating?

154
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,440
Something doesn't seem right.

155
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,480
Hey, it's me.

156
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,110
Where's Ms. Choi staying?

157
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,080
Ms. Choi, I'm here because
your long-term stay wasn't paid.

158
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,350
If you're unable to pay,
we'll have to assist you...

159
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,080
with vacating the place
to open up the room...

160
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,580
for other guests to stay.

161
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,290
Don't make a huge scene
over a delay in that small payment.

162
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,320
Follow me.

163
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,860
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,700
Process the payment.

165
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,600
I'll run your credit card.

166
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,050
Ms. Choi,
this credit card was maxed out.

167
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,490
I'll send over cash,

168
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,960
so wait there.

169
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,470
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

170
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,830
Please check and...

171
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,040
This is Attorney Seo's number.

172
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,070
Ma'am?

173
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,310
Will you be quiet?

174
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,050
(Attorney Seo's Office)

175
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,950
Is this Attorney Seo's office?

176
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,720
Why can't I reach...

177
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,820
What?

178
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,490
He emigrated with his family?

179
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,830
What about the investment
in his brother's business?

180
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,560
He doesn't have an older brother?

181
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,470
Please escort her out.

182
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,540
Let go of me. Let go!

183
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,040
Do you know who I am?

184
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,790
The paperwork was all forged,

185
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,230
and the venture business itself was
just a shell company?

186
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,030
Yes.

187
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,900
The police will
further look into this,

188
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,010
but that's the information I found
from my acquaintances.

189
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,240
Attorney Seo, that lowly trash.

190
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,980
How dare he try to con me?

191
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,750
Director Do, you must do
whatever it takes to catch him.

192
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,520
Do you understand?

193
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,860
Yes, Ms. Choi.

194
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,260
But for now, please come with me.

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,310
All right.

196
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,320
This is your place?

197
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,650
Yes.

198
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,390
But this wasn't your neighborhood.

199
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,660
I moved.

200
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,690
That old house was
too big to live alone.

201
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,530
Even so, how can you live
in this tiny little place?

202
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,540
It may be uncomfortable for you,

203
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,810
but feel free to stay here
until you find another place.

204
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,480
It's not just uncomfortable.

205
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,140
I've never lived
in a place like this.

206
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,610
Gosh, the air is stuffy, too.

207
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,020
I'll purchase
an air purifier right away.

208
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,450
Make sure it generates oxygen.

209
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,920
Yes.

210
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,660
I want to get some rest.

211
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,300
You should probably stay
in the master bedroom, right?

212
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,130
Please sit here for a moment.

213
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,670
I've been using it,
so I have to clean it up.

214
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,940
It's okay.
You must have a guest bedroom.

215
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,090
How am I going to breathe
in this tiny room?

216
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,490
There's no bed, either.

217
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,730
Are you telling me to sleep
on this hard floor?

218
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,960
I'll order a bed.

219
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,630
It's okay. I won't have to stay
at a place like this for long.

220
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,240
You may leave.

221
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,300
I have to go out and run an errand.

222
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,640
All right.

223
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,170
Please get some rest.

224
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,380
It's so suffocating.

225
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,450
How am I supposed to stay
at a place like this?

226
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,430
It's me, my brother.

227
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,370
I got released.

228
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,500
I'll be tried without detention.

229
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,970
So, I wanted to stay
at the family house.

230
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,210
I'll be there now.

231
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,010
Did you just tell me
to cut all ties with the Chois?

232
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,850
I'm one of the Chois, too.

233
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,920
I'm the disgrace of our family?

234
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,990
Were you even worried about me?

235
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,130
You never visited
or reached out to me,

236
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,590
so you really hurt me.

237
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,530
Hello?

238
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,900
My brother!

239
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,050
Hello?

240
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,080
Really? You found it?

241
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,790
Send me to me right away.

242
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,460
Where did you stay last night?

243
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,830
Seung Woo.

244
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,000
Director Kang, we're at work.

245
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,570
I know you're my boss,
but please don't mind my private life.

246
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,380
Tell Ms. Kang Se Ri to come in.

247
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,910
She's out working.

248
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,690
I thought he had come to his senses,
but these moments show...

249
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,820
that he has a long way to go.

250
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,560
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

251
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,070
How may I help you?

252
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,670
I had to report something to you.

253
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,140
Choi Ja Young...

254
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,380
Director Choi Ja Young is
staying at your place?

255
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,720
I thought about it
and decided it would be best.

256
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,960
It'll be easier to figure out
where she is...

257
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,090
and what she's scheming.

258
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,800
If I'm around her,
I can find out naturally...

259
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:10,000
and report back to you
with great detail.

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,170
That's a great idea.

261
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,080
Anyway, how did you know
she was staying at that hotel?

262
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,210
I asked Secretary Yoon.

263
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,780
Secretary Yoon would know.

264
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,750
All right.

265
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,090
Director Choi Ja Young...

266
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,120
That title no longer suits her.

267
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,460
Anyway, keep an eye on her,
and tell me if anything seems odd.

268
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes, I'll do that.

269
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,940
She's still
visiting him persistently.

270
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,310
This woman, Kang Jae In,
is very persistent.

271
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,080
He's not even her husband,

272
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
but she's doing her best
to keep him alive.

273
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,220
I heard some doctor...

274
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,590
also asked the hospital
to focus on treating this punk.

275
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,960
Some doctor? Who could it be?

276
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,800
The case will go over
to the prosecution soon,

277
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,330
so we'll be in big trouble
if he continues to yap.

278
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,470
We'll have to hope
that he dies soon.

279
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,080
Otherwise, both you and I will
end up in prison.

280
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,880
You're right.
It'd be great if he died soon.

281
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,320
- I'm home.
- Uncle Do Yun!

282
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,790
- Did you have fun, Bo Ram?
- Yes.

283
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,360
Is Jae In not back yet?

284
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,170
It seemed like
someone she knew was hospitalized.

285
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,300
She'll be back soon.

286
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,770
Anyway, I need to talk to you.

287
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,840
No, you can't.

288
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,000
I get dibs on Uncle Do Yun.

289
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,540
He promised this morning
that he'd play with me...

290
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,180
after he came home.

291
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,010
Hey, Bo Ram.

292
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,580
Can you let me borrow him
for just five minutes?

293
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,820
In return,
I'll get you strawberry ice cream.

294
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,920
Two of them.

295
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,220
All right.

296
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,330
Uncle Do Yun,
I didn't let him get you...

297
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,630
because I liked
strawberry ice cream more than you.

298
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,860
I'll get two,
so I want to share them with you.

299
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,930
- Okay.
- All right.

300
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,670
- Bo Ram, keep watching that.
- Okay.

301
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,800
- Go. Hurry.
- What is it?

302
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,510
Let's go.

303
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,010
What's going on?

304
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,080
Hey, I've been looking
into Do Hee's whereabouts...

305
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,380
on the day of her accident.

306
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,050
I asked my acquaintances for help...

307
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,690
and found this CCTV footage.

308
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,050
You should take a look.

309
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,190
Here.

310
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,580
Doesn't that seem odd?

311
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,250
Why did Do Hee meet these two
on that day?

312
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,490
And look at the envelope.

313
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,930
But of course,
I have no idea what was inside,

314
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,330
but what did that woman say...

315
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,700
to make that nice girl
pour water all over her?

316
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,500
And why did the police
fail to find this footage?

317
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,910
I don't get that, either.

318
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,210
It was the dashcam footage.

319
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,210
The accident caught on the dashcam
was the most decisive evidence,

320
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,550
and CCTVs
around the area were down...

321
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,120
due to weather conditions
on that day.

322
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,250
Well, if that had been the case,

323
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,590
they wouldn't have done
a search at that cafe.

324
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,360
Anyway, the accident may have been
caused by that YL woman,

325
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,030
but doesn't this seem odd?

326
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,630
Do Hee must've been framed
as the adulteress instead of her.

327
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,670
Ms. Kang!

328
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,280
I finally realized
after seeing this...

329
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,890
that I was so blind
and didn't notice anything.

330
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,020
Hello.

331
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,860
It's great to meet you.

332
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,260
Anyway, you must've been
quite surprised to see me.

333
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,430
Oh, my. Se Ri.
I have that necklace, too.

334
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,970
My gosh. I just realized that.

335
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,840
Where did you get it?

336
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,970
Well, he gave it to me as a present.

337
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,140
Really?

338
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,110
Mine was
also a present from my husband.

339
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,010
Eun Ho, is he in the room...

340
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,480
Jae In, let me clear this up
in case you take it the wrong way.

341
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,320
Something was on his face,

342
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,320
so I blew it off...

343
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,520
instead of touching his face.

344
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,590
Something bad happened to her,
so I just comforted her.

345
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,790
Nothing is going on between us.

346
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,560
What has gotten into you lately?

347
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,400
Are you turning into your mother?

348
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,200
They humiliated me right to my face.

349
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,610
How come I didn't notice?

350
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,910
I was such a fool.

351
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,650
If I had realized it sooner,

352
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,950
if I did that,

353
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,920
Ms. Do Hee wouldn't have...

354
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,090
It's my fault.

355
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,190
It was my foolishness and stupidity.

356
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,400
I'm sorry.

357
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,600
Why do you think...

358
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,470
your mother was
suspicious of Do Hee?

359
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,170
Do you think...

360
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,540
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri
framed her on purpose?

361
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,050
Do you know something?

362
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,550
I heard Ms. Do Hee
had been investigating...

363
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,220
Gi Chan's corruption.

364
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,260
How did you know?

365
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,060
You should meet him
and ask him in person.

366
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,030
You must be
Ms. Kim Do Hee's older brother.

367
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,500
Nice to meet you.

368
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,340
I heard you had information
regarding my sister.

369
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,410
Mr. Do, please explain everything.

370
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,320
Why didn't you stop her?

371
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,390
If you did...

372
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,620
- If you stopped her...
- I told her to stop...

373
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,830
I told her to stop
because it seemed too dangerous.

374
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,370
But as you know,
she's an upright person,

375
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,070
so she probably
couldn't turn a blind eye to it.

376
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,370
I would've done
whatever I could to stop her...

377
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,970
if I didn't get fired.

378
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,180
I'm sorry.

379
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,180
You were a victim in this, too.

380
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,450
It's a part of my job to protect
and take responsibility...

381
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,780
as a superior.

382
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,880
I'm greatly responsible.

383
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,050
I'm so sorry.

384
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,820
But I didn't find...

385
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,860
any evidence
among the articles she left behind.

386
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,690
She's not allowed to take...

387
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,430
anything work-related
out of her office.

388
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,170
Everything was
probably on her computer.

389
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,770
Then, all I'll have to do is
find that computer.

390
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,070
He probably deleted everything
and formatted it by now.

391
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,880
Hwang Gi Chan is...

392
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,050
more meticulous and evil
than anything you can imagine.

393
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,020
I'm sorry for saying that.

394
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,690
I recently realized...

395
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,730
how evil he was.

396
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,530
Did something else happen?

397
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,030
I'll tell you later.

398
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,230
Hello?

399
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,870
He died of a heart attack?

400
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,780
You're going to close
Eun Ho's case just like this?

401
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,080
The culprit passed away,

402
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,350
so it was closed
without anyone to prosecute.

403
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,680
He stated that
he was put up for the job...

404
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,850
by a man named Hong Man Su.

405
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,450
You need to investigate...

406
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,390
why he was put up for it
and who's behind Hong Man Su.

407
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,320
Since the culprit passed away
without any direct evidence...

408
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,860
to the supposed crime instigation,

409
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,060
so we can't help you.

410
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,360
Excuse me.

411
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,630
- Detective!
- Jae In.

412
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,700
Calm down.

413
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,970
You must maintain
a good relationship...

414
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,610
with the detective in charge
if you want to reopen Eun Ho's case later.

415
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,340
But this is too sudden.

416
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,910
A heart attack?

417
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,880
He was terminally ill,

418
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,880
but he had
such a strong will to live.

419
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,120
It'd be the worst,

420
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,250
but the instigators
may have caused this.

421
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,160
Gi Chan is someone
who'll do anything.

422
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,960
Excuse me.

423
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,100
What if I requested an autopsy?

424
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,970
I don't understand
why he suddenly passed away.

425
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,670
You already knew
he was terminally ill.

426
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,010
He didn't pass away due to a crime,

427
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,280
so there's no chance
of getting an autopsy warrant.

428
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,910
We did our best.

429
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,480
Please leave.

430
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,150
Wait.

431
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,900
If you conduct an autopsy,

432
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,100
you can at least find out
why he suddenly passed away.

433
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,010
He was in pain
until the moment of his death.

434
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,370
I can't let them open up his body.

435
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,210
I don't want to cause him more pain.
I'm sorry.

436
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,010
I'm very sorry.

437
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,680
Hello?

438
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,710
I have something to wrap up
before I quit.

439
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,910
I met a wonderful boss
who showed me lots of consideration,

440
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,180
which helped me raise Bo Ram
without trouble.

441
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,650
I can't say
it's my way of paying back my debt,

442
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,920
but I won't turn away
knowing everything.

443
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,790
Above all,

444
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,330
I don't want to be
a shameful mother to Bo Ram.

445
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,650
Eun Ho.

446
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,890
I'll become stronger.

447
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,790
All right. Here.

448
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,230
Try some.

449
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,860
You eat it.

450
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,830
My baby, you left this world
before you saw your best days.

451
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,870
I'm sorry for my foolishness.

452
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,740
Goodness.

453
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,740
Come on, Mom. Try harder.

454
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,110
Show me again.

455
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,520
I won't forgive
any one of the people...

456
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,680
who made you pass away.

457
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,150
My goodness.

458
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,620
Look at that.

459
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,500
I'll make sure I punish them myself.

460
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,030
I feel like that's the only way...

461
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,270
I can ask you for forgiveness.

462
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,370
Gi Chan, Se Ri, just wait.

463
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,910
Before you two find
your way to the inferno,

464
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,510
you'll find out...

465
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,580
what it's like to be tortured
on the face of this earth...

466
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,390
without fail.

467
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,370
Have you been somewhere?

468
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,370
Can we talk?

469
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,770
It's too dangerous.

470
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,340
I'm ready to face the danger.

471
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,010
It's an unchanging fact
that my mom killed Ms. Do Hee.

472
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,220
Of course, she should be punished.

473
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,050
But I know she fell
into such a misunderstanding...

474
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,520
because of Gi Chan and Se Ri.

475
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,920
I know it.

476
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,660
I need to find out more
about H and K Company,

477
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,560
and I especially need
the double contract.

478
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,100
It must be on Gi Chan's computer.

479
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,700
I have to find that.

480
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,700
Do Hee would
want the truth to come out, too.

481
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,770
And it must happen for her sake.

482
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,180
Why don't we...

483
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,580
work together?

484
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,090
It's better to have a partner.

485
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,590
How can I help you?

486
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,360
(Queen's House)

487
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,490
Do I look weird?

488
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,960
No, I wouldn't say it's weird.
You just seem strange.

489
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,600
Then, it's a success.

490
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,100
No one should recognize me.

491
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,770
Dr. Kim, do you know
my brother's ex-wife?

492
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,800
He's Chairman Hwang.

493
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,100
Doesn't she look like her?

494
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,070
- Not at all.
- No, she does...

495
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,570
Seung Woo went
to the prosecution today.

496
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,080
They had to question him again
as a testifier.

497
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,350
Just tell him to state
everything he knows.

498
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,580
You already know who the culprit is.

499
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,480
Assisting him is a part
of the management,

500
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,520
so do your best.

501
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,050
Of course.
