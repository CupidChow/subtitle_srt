00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,340
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,680
Die!

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,950
Die!

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,520
Please just die!

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,580
Die!

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,890
(Episode 92)

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,040
You think killing me
will solve everything?

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,140
Did you think all your secrets...

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,210
would just be covered up?

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,780
Too bad.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,380
You didn't manage to kill me.

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,290
Just you wait.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,860
Tae Ho, I only did it
because I was scared.

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,860
I was afraid if you told everyone,
our whole family would fall apart,

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,030
and I was terrified
that everything would be ruined.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,900
So, to protect everything you have,

19
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,170
you figured it wouldn't matter
if a guy like me just disappeared.

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,110
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,780
I wasn't thinking straight.
I must've lost my mind.

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,350
Would you be apologizing like this
if I were dead?

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,180
Kang Se Ri.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,420
You brought this all on yourself.

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,920
Now, watch it all come
crashing down.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,060
Tae Ho, No! Please spare me!

27
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,060
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,470
If it's money you want,
I'll give you whatever you ask for.

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,770
So, about what happened today...

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,140
No, about us...

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,470
Please don't tell Gi Chan.

33
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,670
If you want,

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,810
I'll even let you see Ji Ho
whenever you want.

35
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,140
I mean it.

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,280
I can see Ji Ho whenever I want.

37
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,810
He's my son.

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,150
I don't need your permission.

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,120
Please keep this a secret for Ji Ho.

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,690
I'm his mother.
Please, I'm begging you.

41
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,960
I haven't changed my mind
about taking Ji Ho.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,890
This makes me more determined.

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,270
Better get things in order
as soon as possible.

44
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,650
You're home early. Did you tell him?

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,090
Yes.

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,820
- What did he say?
- He must've been shocked.

47
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,320
I can only imagine.

48
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,730
Of course.
He probably never saw it coming.

49
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,960
He was pretty taken aback.

50
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,370
He'll need some time to process it.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,540
I'm still processing it myself,
so I'm sure he is too.

52
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,240
I'll wait.
I can wait as long as he needs.

53
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,340
Just take your time getting
to know each other.

54
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,980
Blood is thicker than water.

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,680
So, don't worry too much.

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,850
And don't even think about trying
to patch things up with that woman.

57
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,180
Just focus on your relationship
with your son.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,090
Yun Hee.

59
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,360
Can't you be a little more
open-minded about this?

60
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,220
She's still his mother, after all.

61
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,190
I'm not saying she isn't his mother.

62
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,500
Just tell her to stick
to being a mother and nothing more.

63
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
What is it, Bo Ram?

64
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,570
What's with the sudden sigh?

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,810
I don't get
what the three of you are saying.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,550
I see.

67
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,350
Don't you think
we should explain it to Bo Ram now?

68
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,060
Bo Ram.

69
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,400
Do you remember the handsome guy
who visited us the other day?

70
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,700
Yes, I remember him.

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,270
He's my son.

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,970
He takes after me,
so he's really handsome.

73
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,510
Surprised?

74
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,010
Yes...

75
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,310
Do Yun, is it true?

76
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,420
But he isn't handsome.

77
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,360
The handsome guy really is his son.

78
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,230
So that means he's your uncle.

79
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,830
Now you have many uncles, Bo Ram.

80
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,830
You have another uncle now.
You're so lucky.

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,340
Good morning.

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Jae In?

83
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,320
I start working here today.
You know that, right?

84
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,920
So you're back to your true self?

85
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,160
Yes. It's time to get back
to who I really am.

86
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,790
Good morning.

87
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,530
Oh, my.

88
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,100
Your style's so different,
I almost didn't recognize you.

89
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,500
Everyone's reaction
is making this awkward.

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,500
I guess I should have come
as Designer L.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,900
- No.
- No!

92
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,110
What I mean is,
this is more like the real you.

93
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,620
It really suits you.

94
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,920
I think you look great
no matter what.

95
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,350
You're beautiful.

96
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,150
Oh, honestly.

97
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Come in.

98
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,160
I need to talk to you.

99
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,100
(DH Holdings)

100
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,210
Stop crying.

101
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,340
Didn't you say you wanted to talk?

102
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,150
I really didn't know.

103
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,050
I was so wrapped up in my own
trauma from the fire.

104
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,790
I had no idea...

105
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,290
your family were suffering
because of what I did.

106
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,690
I really had no idea...

107
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,300
she would embezzle
the insurance money.

108
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,170
You were just a kid.
Of course, you didn't know.

109
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,780
I wrote the PIN in the passbook.

110
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,050
It's everything I have.

111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,680
I know there isn't much money
in there.

112
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,260
But this is a designer brand,

113
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,060
and this was a gift,
but it's also from a designer brand.

114
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,860
This one is limited edition,
so you can sell it for a premium.

115
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,570
This one is a designer brand too.

116
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,270
Please take it all.

117
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
This is all I have to give you.

118
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,910
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

119
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,120
I know you mean well, Na Ra.

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,750
And I know how much you've suffered.

121
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,220
But your mother...

122
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,790
I can't forgive her.

123
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,260
She could have saved my father.

124
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,040
I can't accept this,
so take it back.

125
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,710
You've been tormented by this
for over 20 years,

126
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,980
so go get some help for your trauma.

127
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,150
I don't blame you, Na Ra.

128
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,150
Take these back.

129
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,330
Na Ra!

131
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,540
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

132
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,140
Don't you know how to knock?

133
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,080
It belongs to Hwang Na Ra.

134
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,020
I guess there's at least
one sane person in that family.

135
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,960
She might be immature
and a bit thoughtless,

136
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,260
but unlike you or your mother,

137
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,760
she has a conscience
and a sense of morality.

138
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,460
She's certainly a better person
than you.

139
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,200
At least she knows what it means
to be a decent human being.

140
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,840
You should learn from your daughter.

141
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,270
Did you run your mouth to Jae In
about all this?

142
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,010
About my family's business?

143
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,780
With all the news about it,
it'd be weirder if she didn't know.

144
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,550
Right.

145
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,690
But you're blocking the news,
so I guess she could stay ignorant.

146
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,620
What I mean is,

147
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,290
did you exaggerate things,
play the victim,

148
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,800
and feed her a bunch of nonsense?

149
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,170
Didn't you hear me?

150
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,540
Well, you got here first,

151
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,210
so, you know,
"First come, first served."

152
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,940
I guess I should move then, right?

153
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,350
And...

154
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,510
you don't have to feel awkward.

155
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,150
Besides, it's not like
anything's going to change.

156
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,090
That's what I think.

157
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,260
Take your time with your drink.

158
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,890
Take your time.

159
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,330
Excuse me.

160
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,470
No, wait...

161
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,510
Go away. I'm not buying anything.

162
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,690
How could it all have been a lie?

163
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,720
All my hard-earned money is gone.

164
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,730
Fine.
No one's going to turn down money.

165
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,130
I can let that slide.

166
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,690
But...

167
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,800
you're going to play with my heart?

168
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,930
That's the worst crime of all.

169
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
You hear me?

170
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,300
You jerk.

171
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,040
You absolute monster!

172
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,910
Say something!
I said, say something!

173
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,040
Did you ever love me at all?

174
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,420
Save the drunken rant for home.

175
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,020
Stay out of it. You two broke up.

176
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,220
What does my love life have
to do with you?

177
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,960
Who says we broke up?

178
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,830
I'm the only one he loves.

179
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,360
He has very high standards.

180
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
You really think...

181
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,630
he'd leave me for you?

182
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,200
But you said you two broke up.

183
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,340
Was that just another lie
to trick me?

184
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,580
And I'm not at all sorry to say...

185
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,150
that I never had feelings for you,

186
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,580
not even once,
not for a single second.

187
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,620
- Jung Oh Seong!
- If anything, when I met you,

188
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,530
I was so creeped out, I had to
scrub my hands raw afterward.

189
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,630
How could you...

190
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,160
say something so cruel...

191
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,970
so nonchalantly?

192
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,370
I can say much worse.

193
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,010
If you'd feel better being arrested
for obstruction of business,

194
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,840
I can certainly arrange that.

195
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,310
He was the first man
since your father.

196
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,380
My heart raced
just by being near him.

197
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,050
Six million dollars?
It wasn't a big deal.

198
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,320
I would've given him...

199
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,120
anything and everything.

200
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,090
What am I going to do?
How could he do this to me?

201
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,030
Six million dollars?
What do you mean?

202
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,800
Are you saying the man
who made your heart race is Patrick?

203
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,170
Kim Do Yun's uncle?

204
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,870
Do you mean CEO Jung Oh Seong?

205
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,480
Well, you see...

206
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,650
The heart is a funny thing.

207
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,450
It doesn't care
about age or nationality.

208
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,150
It just brings people together.

209
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,990
Are you out of your mind?

210
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,730
He's the last person
you should be falling for.

211
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,060
That man is the CEO of DH Holdings.

212
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,600
He's my enemy!

213
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,170
How was I supposed to know?

214
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,270
At first, I just figured he was
some guy from the chicken shop.

215
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,340
I didn't know about
this whole company business...

216
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,980
Who knew it would end up like this?

217
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,480
Did you ever think you'd be punished
for embezzling insurance money?

218
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,980
Once you found out who
CEO Jung Oh Seong really was,

219
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,890
you should've got over him sooner.
Didn't that ever cross your mind?

220
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,790
The outcome was obvious
from the start.

221
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,820
Use your head for once.
Please just think.

222
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,730
Fine.
So I'm thoughtless and ignorant.

223
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,130
Yes. I'd have to agree.

224
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,830
Because of what you did in the past,

225
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,200
it's draining the life out of me
every day.

226
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,870
Although I'm not legally responsible
for what you did,

227
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,780
people are demanding the 'ethically
and morally corrupt' chair resign.

228
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,050
The company is being flooded
with complaints.

229
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,150
Please get a grip.

230
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,380
You're not the one who wants to cry.

231
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,550
I am!

232
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,600
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

233
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,200
Why did you want to meet out here
instead of at the office?

234
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
It's about Catherine.

235
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,110
I want to know why you're looking
for Catherine.

236
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,220
I'm guessing it has something to do
with Kang Se Ri.

237
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,320
I'd like to know too.

238
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,230
Will you tell me?

239
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,040
While trying to expose corruption
at Catherine's H and K Company,

240
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,640
your sister was killed.

241
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,210
And she was also framed for having
an affair with Hwang Gi Chan.

242
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,150
That's right.

243
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,350
That was why I was trying
to find out who Catherine is.

244
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,830
You must have been through so much.

245
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,970
They were the two people I loved
and trusted the most,

246
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,740
so the word "betrayal"
doesn't even begin to cover it.

247
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
But it's not just about me.

248
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,010
Many other people were victims
of their evil deeds.

249
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,420
It's tragic enough that they died,

250
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,550
but I want to help them finally
rest in peace.

251
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
How?

252
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,960
Kang Se Ri and Hwang Gi Chan.

253
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,590
We have to bring them both down.

254
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,160
By exposing every single one
of their crimes to the world,

255
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,960
my ultimate goal
is to see them ruined.

256
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,270
All right.

257
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,510
Then,

258
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,640
let me join you.

259
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,010
May I ask why?

260
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,820
Is it because
she stole your sister's name?

261
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,480
That's part of it.

262
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,550
She stole my sister's name
and disgraced it.

263
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,230
And you were right, Jae In.

264
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,770
She tried to kill me.

265
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,570
(Sleeping Medication)

266
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,310
I wonder whose fault it is
that I can't sleep lately.

267
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,690
Sleeping pills?

268
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,190
Yes.

269
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,800
She might have insomnia
like she says,

270
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,760
but something feels off.

271
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,170
It looked like a very large dose.

272
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,300
Be careful, just in case.

273
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,970
- What?
- The one Kang Se Ri fears most,

274
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,310
besides me and Do Yun,

275
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,580
is probably you.

276
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,050
She knows you know who Catherine is,

277
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,020
and she must be nervous about you
living in the same house.

278
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,790
You can't be too careful.

279
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Be careful.

280
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,060
I had a feeling she might
try something,

281
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,630
but I never thought
she'd actually go that far.

282
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,360
Just because he knew Catherine
and dated her in the past,

283
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,060
is that a reason to kill him?

284
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,870
She's completely out of her mind.

285
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,600
She has another reason
to want me dead.

286
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,410
It's because of Ji Ho.

287
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,180
Hwang Ji Ho.

288
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,850
He's not Chairman Hwang's son.

289
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,960
He's my son.

290
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,930
When did you find out?

291
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,770
After I came to Korea this time.

292
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
If I hadn't come here,
I never would've known.

293
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,510
Still, I don't see it as a tragedy,
but a blessing.

294
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,110
Because at least I know now.

295
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,920
Go on ahead.
I have something else to do.

296
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,830
Yes, hello?

297
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,070
Isn't it dangerous for you
to keep staying in that house?

298
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,600
It might be safer
to stay in plain sight.

299
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,010
And this way,
I can find out what Se Ri plots.

300
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,180
I moved in to watch over Ji Ho,
even for just a bit,

301
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,550
but that house
is a terrible place for him.

302
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,450
So I'm going to take him to the U.S.

303
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,090
Does Se Ri know?

304
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,990
I told her.
The chairman doesn't know yet,

305
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,230
but I'm planning to tell him soon.

306
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,010
See?

307
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,880
I told you something was up
with those two.

308
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,530
Excuse me.

309
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,170
I'm not interrupting, am I?

310
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,800
Not at all.

311
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,510
What can I do for you?

312
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,510
I noticed your gallery lists work
by promising new artists.

313
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,050
Would it be possible
to meet with them?

314
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,850
Of course. I'll let my mother know.

315
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,550
Understood.

316
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,090
How's the collaboration
with Designer L coming along?

317
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,330
You seem very interested in me.

318
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,330
Jae In has a great eye for art,
so we're on the same wavelength.

319
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,070
Things are moving more smoothly
than expected.

320
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,140
You call her Jae In,

321
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,340
not Designer L.

322
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,480
Well, her name is Jae In,
so that's what I call her.

323
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,650
So you're interested in Jae In?

324
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,650
You catch on quick.

325
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,450
Jae In is a very charming woman.

326
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,190
Of course, I'm interested.

327
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm interested in her.

328
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,160
You know she's divorced, right?

329
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,130
She's single now, and I'm single.
That's all that matters.

330
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,100
I'm not one to dwell on the past.
What matters is the here and now,

331
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,470
and how I feel.

332
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,710

You're not going to toast with me?

333
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,080
All right.
I'll have one of those, too.

334
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,250
I'll toast with you.

335
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,420
Do you like banana milk?
There's chocolate milk too.

336
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,870
Here's your coffee.

337
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,510
Ma'am, where are you off to?

338
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,440
Yes, I just have somewhere to be.

339
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,180
Would you like a ride?

340
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,550
No, it's okay.

341
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,550
Don't worry, everyone.

342
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,080
I'll be back soon.

343
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,430
She seems so fragile lately.

344
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,700
She's always been a gentle soul.

345
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,200
She was just very good at hiding it.

Let's talk, man to man.

348
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,720
I have to step out for work,
so wait until my return.

349
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,290
And don't even think
about running off.

350
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,030
I mean it.

351
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,100
Fine.

Looks like Director Kim Do Yun
isn't here.

He said he needed a file,
so I came to drop it off.

00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,480
Just leave it on his desk.

357
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,290
I don't see Tae Ho either.

358
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,890
Where did he go?

359
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,790
If you're so curious,
call and ask him yourself.

360
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,970
Right.

361
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,670
You really have a knack
for wrapping men around your finger.

362
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,300
Maybe I should learn a trick or two
from you.

363
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,940
You went after Director Kim,
then you hit on Gi Chan,

364
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,540
and now it's Lee Tae Ho?

365
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,310
You just have to try your luck
with every man you see, don't you?

366
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,880
Se Ri.

367
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,620
You know, the more I see Tae Ho,

368
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,560
the more he looks like someone,
you know.

369
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,760
He looks a lot like Ji Ho,
don't you think?

370
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,800
Even more than his own father,
Hwang Gi Chan.

371
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,230
How could Ji Ho possibly look
like Tae Ho?

372
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,170
Gi Chan is his father.
Don't be ridiculous.

373
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,410
You think you can frame me,
but you think I'll fall for it?

374
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,780
Don't make me laugh.

375
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,310
Gi Chan won't fall for a cheap trick
like that either.

376
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,480
Fine. Believe what you want.

377
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,720
Don't be so defensive.

378
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,220
The way you're reacting
just makes it sound true.

379
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,060
If you dropped off the files,
go back to work.

380
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,460
I have to step out for a meeting.
Could you leave now?

381
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,360
If you spout that nonsense
one more time,

382
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,000
I might just sue you for defamation.

383
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Mark my words.

384
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:35,910
I wonder how Gi Chan will react
when he finds out, Se Ri.

385
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,220
How have you been feeling?
Are you in any pain?

386
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,820
I came here to talk to you
about something.

387
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,720
You don't need to worry about me.

388
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,760
Okay, go ahead.

389
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,560
It's about Seung Woo.

390
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,030
Please register him as your son.

391
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,870
Seung Woo now knows that I'm sick.

392
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,470
I think that's why he's trying
so hard to stay by my side,

393
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,110
but there's no reason for him to.

394
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Ja Young,

395
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,310
Seung Woo thinks of you
as his mother.

396
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,280
He doesn't have any ulterior motives
for being with you.

397
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,580
Exactly.

398
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,450
After he found out the truth
about his birth,

399
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,460
I think he can't help
but feel guilty.

400
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,430
But Seung Woo has no reason
to feel guilty.

401
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,130
If anything, he's the one
we should feel sorry for.

402
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,770
I wasn't able to give him the love
he deserved.

403
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,270
So what right do I have
to be his mother?

404
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,410
You should legally adopt him.

405
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,050
I was being shortsighted when I said
I'd register Seung Woo as my son.

406
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,550
Please don't dwell on it.

407
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,390
You're Seung Woo's mother.

408
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,090
Just think about Seung Woo
and be selfish for once.

409
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,620
That's what's best for him.

410
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,630
Don't worry about me.
Please just do it.

411
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,260
It's the right thing to do.

412
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,440
I've said my piece.

413
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,110
I'll be on my way now.

414
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,040
Wait.

415
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,710
We need to talk.

416
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,480
What do you want that you had
to drag me all the way out here?

417
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,250
I have nothing more to say to you.

418
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,690
Have you ever once accepted me
as your son-in-law?

419
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,430
What?

420
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,830
I want to know
if you ever accepted me...

421
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,560
as your son-in-law,

422
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,770
as the man married to Jae In,

423
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,770
even just once.

424
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,810
Why do you want to know that
now of all times?

425
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,010
I was just curious.

426
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,220
Why do you think
I let Jae In marry you?

427
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,360
I don't know.

428
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,090
Think back to the first time
you met me.

429
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,960
That's my answer.

430
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,340
Ma'am, how much do you think
Jae In is worth?

431
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,780
A child is priceless.

432
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,540
I feel the same way.

433
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,180
My parents always put
their children's happiness first.

434
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,480
I want to show Jae In...

435
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,350
that a world like that exists
for her too.

436
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,120
I approved of the marriage
because you said that.

437
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,220
I looked past everything else,

438
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,360
and only thought
of my daughter Jae In's happiness.

439
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,950
I can't believe you actually waited
instead of running away.

440
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,090
(DH Holdings)

441
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,950
I wouldn't call it "running away."

442
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,190
Let's say I gave you time
to soften the blow, as a courtesy.

443
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,160
That's how I'd prefer you put it.

444
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,470
Now that sounds more like Patrick.

445
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,670
Sorry about that.

446
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,240
You said I seemed
to have gained some wisdom with age.

447
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,110
And not long after
you complimented me,

448
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,280
I acted like a complete fool,
didn't I?

449
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,780
I get it.

450
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,850
As shocked as I was,

451
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,920
you must have been
even more shocked.

452
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,220
I know all too well
what a terrible father I am,

453
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,230
so I guess I got scared.

454
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,800
I didn't even know I had a son.

455
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,760
I didn't get to see you grow up.

456
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,670
And I completely failed
in my duty to raise you.

457
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,740
Then I show up,
claiming to be your father.

458
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,340
How absurd and pathetic
must that have seemed?

459
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,210
I could say that I didn't know
or that I was shocked too.

460
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,210
But that's just my side
of the story.

461
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,180
It's obviously different
from a son's perspective.

462
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,850
So go ahead, you can punch me.

463
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,790
Why would I punch you?

464
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,800
"Where have you been all my life?"

465
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,960
"You think being my dad now
makes it all okay?"

466
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,770
Seung Woo, if you're angry
or feel like you've been wronged,

467
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,970
just hit me and let it all out.

468
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,040
I'll admit I was surprised.

469
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,180
But I'm also pretty intrigued
and even excited.

470
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,220
That the man my aunt was with...

471
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,050
was you, Patrick,
and not just anyone.

472
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,690
And to think that you're the one
who brought me into this world,

473
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,030
I'm honestly relieved.

474
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,410
Man to man, with feeling!

475
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,410
Can I give you a hug?

476
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,620
Thank you...

477
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,750
for being my son.

478
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,820
Me too.

479
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,090
I'm grateful too.

480
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:09,640
Did Mom really suggest
you legally adopt Seung Woo?

481
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,410
Seung Woo knows she's sick,

482
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,350
and she feels bad
he's taking care of her.

483
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,650
She thinks he's only
looking after her out of guilt.

484
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,790
She doesn't want Seung Woo
to feel that way.

485
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,360
I think that's why she brought up
the adoption for his sake.

486
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,100
I have no intention of changing
Seung Woo's legal status now.

487
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,400
What do you think?

488
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,270
I understand
where Mom's coming from,

489
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,870
but my feelings on the matter
haven't changed.

490
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,640
It should be Seung Woo's decision.

491
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,610
And I want to respect
whatever he chooses.

492
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,750
Seung Woo considers her his mother,

493
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,680
and wants to care for her as her son
until the very end.

494
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,120
And I respect his wishes.

495
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,860
Thank you.

496
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,100
Are these really the best specs available
for our company laptops?

497
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,730
Is there a rule that only designers
get to use the expensive ones?

498
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,100
I have to run a lot of programs too.

499
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,850
I knew I saw that correctly.

500
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,690
She was logging
into Catherine's email account.

501
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Found it!

502
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,480
H and K Company's duplicate contract.

503
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,460
(Queen's House)

504
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,230
Did I hear that right?
What did you just say?

505
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,330
Give me my money! It's mine!

506
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,330
Just because I skimmed a little off
your husband's insurance payout,

507
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,530
doesn't mean you can shake me down
for six million dollars.

508
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,470
We have an urgent bank loan payment due.

509
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,870
Can't we just ask the bank
for an extension?

510
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,070
Well...

511
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,440
- The bank denied our request.
- Cash is king!

512
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,880
Mom, why does it always have to be
about money with you?

513
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,550
Happiness, love,
success, relationships,

514
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,120
and everything is about money
to you.

515
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:46,320
Hey, come play with me. I'm bored.

516
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,790
