1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,770
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,250
(Episode 33)

5
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,480
The hospital in which Hwang Gi Chan
locked up his faithful wife was...

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,790
Haesung Psychiatric Hospital.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,090
How can a hospital take a bribe,
issue a false diagnosis,

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,020
and even lock someone up?

9
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,330
Ms. Kang has
already sued the hospital,

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,400
but it's still in full operation.

11
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,660
How is this allowed to happen?

12
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,170
You can already tell
the kind of people they are...

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,900
by their actions.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,670
- Whoa! No!
- Isn't it obvious?

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,740
Yes, they're the worst.

16
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,610
It's coming straight
from the projector on the ceiling.

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,580
The broadcasting room is
in control of that,

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,280
but it's locked right now,
so they're trying to open it.

19
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,750
Let me ask you one question.

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,090
He abused the adult guardianship system
to divorce her.

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,550
Do you think
their divorce was valid?

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,990
If it started as an affair,
wouldn't it always remain an affair?

23
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,690
Everyone, please be the judge.

24
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,160
Turn the screen off now! Now!

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,070
Honestly speaking, homewreckers
shouldn't get to live a good life...

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,040
- after what they did to her.
- I even called these reporters...

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,540
to make public that
I was the lady of YL Group!

28
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,670
Don't you think
they're just criminals?

29
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,340
I mean, it's a crime.

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,750
Put those cameras away.
Put those away!

31
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,180
Do you think I called you here...

32
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,750
to capture such nonsense?

33
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,690
Is this exposure true?

34
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,120
Do you admit to your affair?

35
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,860
Did you make a malicious attempt
to claim YL's management rights?

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,120
- Say something.
- Please respond, Mr. Chairman.

37
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,130
- Just one word.
- Just say something.

38
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,190
Do you admit to your affair?

39
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,430
- Wait!
- Mr. Chairman!

40
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,100
- Is this true?
- Say something, Mr. Chairman!

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,800
- Chairman Hwang!
- Please tell us!

42
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,900
- Do you admit to everything?
- Is this all true?

43
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,400
Man, I don't know who that is,

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,010
but that person just hit a home run.

45
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,680
Allow me to present...

46
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,380
the homewreckers,
the criminal couple of the century!

47
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,720
YL Group's new chairman
and his wife,

48
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,320
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri!

49
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,490
- Hwang Gi Chan...
- People are responding rapidly.

50
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,860
The number of likes
continues to go up, too.

51
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,660
Most of the comments are negative
toward Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

52
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,800
This streamer gave them a big blow.

53
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,600
Do you know who this person is?

54
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,170
No.

55
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,440
I can't tell
with that distorted voice.

56
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,810
It must be
someone who knows you very well.

57
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,010
It might be a former reporter
or a private detective.

58
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,580
I'm not sure.

59
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,610
Hey, Uncle Oh Seong.

60
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,380
I was just watching it.

61
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,750
All right.
I'll see you at home later.

62
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,360
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri
must've fled from the venue.

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,160
At this speed,

64
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,160
the entire country will
hear about them in a few hours.

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,700
I guess so.

66
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,170
What's wrong?

67
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,870
This was a simple exposé,

68
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,840
but it helped
with the public sentiment.

69
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,540
I began to wonder
why I couldn't do...

70
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,010
something this simple
and easy before.

71
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,410
Nothing is more effective
than playing the media...

72
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,020
by exposing the actual truth.

73
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,120
On the other hand,
some people misuse that power.

74
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,790
Do you remember
what Hwang Gi Chan said to the media...

75
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,220
when Chairman Kang passed away?

76
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,230
His false propaganda...

77
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,990
made the public criticize
our entire family.

78
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,760
We shouted that
what he said wasn't true,

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,230
but the public was
already on his side.

80
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,300
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,270
All right. I accept your apology.

82
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,440
That way, you'll feel more at ease.

83
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,640
No.

84
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,910
Both Gi Chan and Se Ri
must be punished.

85
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,940
Only then can I finally
ask for forgiveness...

86
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,210
from Ms. Do Hee,
Bo Ram, and Ms. Jung.

87
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,680
And of course,
my mom must be punished, too.

88
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,450
I'll fix the wrong information...

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,560
and expose the actual story.

90
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,490
I'll make sure I do that.

91
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,260
I thought I'd look
at least a decade younger,

92
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,930
but I only look
4 to 5 years younger.

93
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,970
Darn it.

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,540
Even plastic surgery isn't
as effective because of my age.

95
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
Should I find a new plastic surgeon?

96
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,310
No, should I do the procedure again?

97
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,850
I put in ten threads last time,

98
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,820
so if I put ten more in,

99
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,980
- it'll look...
- Mom!

100
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,490
Mom, this is bad!

101
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,320
My gosh. You surprised me.

102
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,890
That's not what's important.

103
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,860
This is really bad.

104
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,530
Losing money is
about the only bad thing you can do.

105
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,430
How much did you lose this time?

106
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,730
Do I need to beat you up
to make you come to your senses?

107
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,970
No, it's not about me!

108
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,400
It's Gi Chan.

109
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,900
Gi Chan and Se Ri
got into a huge scandal.

110
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,240
- What?
- You need to look at this.

111
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,580
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri!

112
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,440
- The hospital in which...
- What?

113
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,010
Hwang Gi Chan locked up
his faithful wife was...

114
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,510
- Haesung Psychiatric Hospital.
- What is this?

115
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,750
How can a hospital take a bribe,
issue a false diagnosis,

116
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,620
and even lock someone up?

117
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,620
Do whatever it takes to stop this!

118
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,490
Contact portal sites
and block out all articles.

119
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,830
And find out
who uploaded that video.

120
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,600
You have to go back to the office.
Why did you come here?

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,400
What can you do at home?

122
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,670
The entire staff saw that.
Do you want to be a laughing stock?

123
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,570
I said I wanted to be cautious...

124
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,040
because I knew
something like this could happen!

125
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,610
Look at this mess.

126
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,340
Of all places,
we were utterly humiliated...

127
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,710
at an official event!

128
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,280
Are you blaming me?

129
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,610
Is this my fault?

130
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,380
This is a problem
between you and me.

131
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,750
Don't talk like
this is just my problem.

132
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,750
You and I are both victims.

133
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,490
Nitpicking over that detail
isn't important right now.

134
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,360
We have to resolve
this problem first!

135
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,890
We can just catch the culprit.

136
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,330
We need to know
who it is to catch them.

137
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,030
Who do you think has...

138
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,130
such intimate information
about our private life?

139
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,270
Yes, Kang Jae In.

140
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,340
It had to be her.

141
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,070
That girl just messed with us.

142
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,050
Yes, Mother.

143
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,150
I'll be there now.

144
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,880
You don't have to come.

145
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,120
Hello?

146
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,390
Don't go anywhere and stay home.

147
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,090
No, I'm coming with you.

148
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,700
Just stay home
until things quiet down!

149
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,730
Look at this.
People keep calling me.

150
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,700
Everything hit the fan,

151
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,200
so stay home quietly.

152
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,240
Jae In, I know it was you.

153
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,380
You should've died.

154
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,480
This wouldn't have happened
if you died!

155
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,990
Mom, what do we do now?

156
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,660
This is freaking embarrassing.

157
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,560
What if Dr. Kim saw that?

158
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,870
Stop talking like that.

159
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,800
Don't use words like
"freaking embarrassing."

160
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,440
That's not the problem.

161
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,970
I might never get married!

162
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,610
Put up a brazen act.

163
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,380
This isn't even a big deal.

164
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,650
Hey, what happened?

165
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,450
That YouTu...

166
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,420
Who's the punk that said
all those things in the video?

167
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,160
I'm looking into it.

168
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,560
What if I never get married
because of you?

169
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,690
Shut your mouth.

170
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,100
Zip it and sit quietly.

171
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,430
I apologize
for causing this concern.

172
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,870
You didn't do anything wrong.

173
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,970
Why do you look so down?

174
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,510
A married couple can
end up divorcing,

175
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,710
and you're allowed to remarry
after the divorce.

176
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,280
Act with dignity.

177
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,180
You didn't do anything wrong.

178
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
But he did. He had an affair.

179
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,220
Insist on your own argument.

180
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,950
Just tell people
that everything was fake.

181
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,520
No one can win against that.

182
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,990
That's the best move.

183
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,290
The entire staff
must've seen the video.

184
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,660
Everyone who works
at this company is...

185
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,100
under your control.

186
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,600
If you deny it as the chairman,
what can they do?

187
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,270
If they continue to speak nonsense,

188
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,100
make an example out of one
and fire them.

189
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,370
They need to know
you control their paycheck.

190
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,840
They'll all learn a good lesson.

191
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,940
Watch me.

192
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,510
Hey, Ms. Kim.

193
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,320
What are you talking about?

194
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,750
An affair?

195
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,650
It's all nonsense.

196
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,320
This world is full of fake things.

197
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,460
There are fake things everywhere.

198
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,390
That's what I'm saying.

199
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,460
There is so much fake news out there.
Why did you believe that?

200
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,200
Just trust me.

201
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,140
I presented myself to him today,

202
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,480
and he seemed quite interested
in an investment.

203
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm sure he'll reach out to me.

204
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,850
If he doesn't, I have to make him.

205
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,150
He'll reach out.

206
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,760
He'll try to play everything safe
because of his scandal.

207
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,260
That's true.

208
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,330
Hey, it felt like
I was on a movie set today.

209
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,760
It was so much fun
to watch it in person,

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,170
much better than
any soap opera I've watched.

211
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,040
Anyway, about that video.

212
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,670
Whoever that person is
must be as prepared as we are.

213
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,840
The person knew they'd both be
at the luncheon and did that...

214
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,310
to humiliate them.

215
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,950
Could his ex-wife be behind this?

216
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,180
That's a possibility.

217
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,790
I don't know. I doubt it.

218
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,720
No, my sixth sense is telling me
that it was his ex-wife.

219
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,160
She only blurred out her face, too.

220
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,030
Come to think of it,
I wonder what she's up to.

221
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,700
You're back.

222
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,340
I was about to go and get you.

223
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,870
I closed early.

224
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,140
You're busy,
so you don't have to come, either.

225
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,610
Things aren't too hard,
thanks to my part-timer.

226
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,610
Where's Bo Ram?

227
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,480
I'm coming in.

228
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,980
Sure.

229
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,450
- You're back.
- You should sit down.

230
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,460
She just fell asleep.

231
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,400
I see.
I hope she isn't bothering you.

232
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,670
No.

233
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,000
Bo Ram is very good with her hands.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,400
She's an excellent artist.

235
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,600
She must've taken after her mother.

236
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,480
Back in school, my daughter
was known as a good artist.

237
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,550
You should get to work.

238
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,610
Okay.

239
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,250
Mommy.

240
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,790
Don't go, Mommy.

241
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,030
I'll sleep next to her.

242
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,030
She might cry if she woke up now.

243
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,600
She'll be a nuisance.

244
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,000
Not at all.

245
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,330
You can sleep in peace tonight.

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,110
Thank you.

247
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,480
It feels like Do Hee sent me
such a great present.

248
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,610
And I say this as someone
who lived a little more than you have.

249
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,180
It'd be great if life went smoothly,
but it never does.

250
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,520
You'll face
rough and sorrowful days,

251
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,820
but when they pass,
you'll face another good day, too.

252
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,460
I don't know your whole story,
but hang in there.

253
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,660
Everything will go well.

254
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,630
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,100
I'm so sorry.

256
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,940
Our shareholders are protesting,

257
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,610
and the public shows
a negative response.

258
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,810
The phone lines are all busy,

259
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,810
and our website
can't take that much traffic.

260
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,450
Have you released an explanation?

261
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,880
There was another article
about the corruption...

262
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,520
of the hospital
where Ms. Kang was locked up,

263
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,660
so people aren't convinced
with our explanation.

264
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,530
Ildo Partners, the investment firm
that signed a contract with us,

265
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,530
also wants to withdraw
the investment.

266
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,730
They're demanding
the entire amount back...

267
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,600
with compensation
on top of everything.

268
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,300
They're withdrawing the investment
over some rumor...

269
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,570
they don't even know is true?

270
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,600
Why won't you say anything?

271
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,240
Do whatever it takes
to make them stay.

272
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,280
You don't get to say anything
in this meeting, Ms. Kang.

273
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,350
You need to leave.

274
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,110
I already told you.

275
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,980
I participated to explain myself.

276
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,220
This isn't your private...

277
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,790
You two may leave and get to work...

278
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,520
and map out a specific plan.

279
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,490
We're losing time.

280
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,190
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

281
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,100
Do you two think I'm a joke?

282
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,240
I put you in that office...

283
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,740
to make you do good work.

284
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,340
I wouldn't have put you there...

285
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,750
if I knew we'd lose more
than whatever we could gain.

286
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,520
You know better than anyone that
the management's private life has...

287
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,580
the biggest impact
on the corporation's image.

288
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,020
Director Kang,
you're deceived by that video.

289
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,190
Don't believe everything in it.

290
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,930
There are many discrepancies
with actual facts.

291
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,030
What about the kid?

292
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,930
Did you really have him
with another man?

293
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,970
Are you sure
you two didn't have him?

294
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,040
Yes, she had him before she met me.

295
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,440
I asked the police to investigate...

296
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,240
and find the person in the video,
so give me a little more time.

297
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,440
You can rebuke me after that.

298
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,780
There's no use in fixing this
after the damage is done!

299
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,580
We lost an investor,
and our stock price is plummeting.

300
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,120
I'll find a new investor.

301
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,260
You must've heard of DH Holdings.

302
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,430
I met him during the luncheon,

303
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,230
and he seemed
highly interested in our business.

304
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,270
I've heard of DH Holdings.

305
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,140
But the CEO there
never shows himself...

306
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,540
and remains a mystery.

307
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,540
Yet you met him?

308
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,340
Yes, I'll get him to invest.

309
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,110
That firm is infamous...

310
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,180
for their fastidiousness
in their investment review.

311
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,680
Why would he choose
to invest in YL Group?

312
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,420
Our corporate image hit rock bottom
because of the owner's family!

313
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,890
I have a good idea.

314
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,000
Actually, I was born
with the name Kang Jae In.

315
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,370
Kang Jae In.

316
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,170
Ms. Kang.

317
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,740
Stop telling me this nonsense!

318
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

319
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,550
You're saying
you want to mimic Jae In!

320
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,580
No.

321
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,120
I'm saying I'll reclaim
the real name I lost.

322
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,690
I had to transfer to a new school
and change my name...

323
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,720
because of Jae In's mom.

324
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,890
So?

325
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,130
Are you telling me
to betray my own blood?

326
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,160
Ms. Kang.

327
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,800
You may lose something bigger
if you try to protect Jae In.

328
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,860
Your family will go down...

329
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,870
if YL goes down.

330
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,500
Is that okay with you?

331
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,210
I had a meeting outside.

332
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,280
We'll talk again later.

333
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,020
What were you two discussing?

334
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,320
It's not a big deal.

335
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,920
How did the meeting go?

336
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,030
Hello?

337
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,970
I see.
The secretary's office at YL Group?

338
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,240
I'm sorry.

339
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,870
I don't know when I'll be free.

340
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,980
Many different people
want to see me,

341
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,380
but I'm only one man.

342
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,150
Please excuse me. I'm busy.

343
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,650
You should call me yourself.

344
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,660
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

345
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,330
you don't seem too desperate.

346
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,100
So, you couldn't even
schedule a meeting?

347
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,000
No, I looked into it,

348
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,440
and many other companies were
in a similar situation.

349
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,740
I understand for now. You may leave.

350
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,350
Yes, sir.

351
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,450
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

352
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,450
Hello?

353
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,320
Mr. Chairman, please help me.

354
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,320
My hospital, family,
and acquaintances are...

355
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,360
all under investigation
because of your exposure!

356
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,490
So what?

357
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,530
What does that have to do with me?

358
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,860
Other patients...

359
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,030
began to sue the hospital,
claiming they were victims, too.

360
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,570
I'll end up broke
trying to pay my attorney.

361
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,770
I locked up Ms. Kang,
although she was fine...

362
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,570
because you asked me to!

363
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,970
I'll get you an attorney,
so watch what you say.

364
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,410
If you don't,
I don't know what I'll do.

365
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,410
Also,

366
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,110
shut your mouth and deal with it
if you took that much money!

367
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,760
You'll come here?

368
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,400
Anyway, I saw this video.

369
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,860
Have you seen it, too?

370
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,700
The video regarding
Chairman Hwang and Kang Se Ri.

371
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,210
Let me call you back.

372
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
You're here.

373
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,780
A video? I need to see it, too.

374
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,390
Hwang Gi Chan drugged her,

375
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,460
made her temporarily insane,
and extorted her assets.

376
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,490
After that, he forced her
to sign the divorce paper...

377
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,530
and locked her up
at a mental institution.

378
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,640
Ms. Yoon is running a little late.

379
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,810
Please have some tea first.

380
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,110
This is the kind of black tea
served for the British Monarchy.

381
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,890
Is that the painting?

382
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,350
Yes.

383
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,360
It felt like an insult
to purchase a piece of art...

384
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,360
only with cash,

385
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,860
so it made me feel so uneasy.

386
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,170
But I wanted to share...

387
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,470
my passion for fine arts
with you ladies,

388
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,940
so I went ahead and did it.

389
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,510
Please take a look.

390
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,280
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

391
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,790
It's a fake.

392
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,990
Imitations of good quality...

393
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,390
are tough to tell
unless you take a close examination,

394
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,960
but an amateur made this one,

395
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,330
and it's not even worth examining.

396
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,030
Darn it.

397
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,730
Why are you here again?

398
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,930
And don't be ridiculous.

399
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,640
This art, this piece of paper...

400
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,510
Do you have any idea
how much I paid for this?

401
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,210
I gave 300,000 dollars!

402
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,450
The authentic painting...

403
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,750
cannot be purchased
for such a small amount.

404
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,650
Last time, it was auctioned off
for five million dollars.

405
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,290
Five million dollars?

406
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,720
- How is this worth five...
- You shouldn't do these things.

407
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,530
You always humiliate yourself...

408
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,590
by acting like you're rich
and you know your stuff.

409
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,230
Well, you'll first need a brain...

410
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,630
to start thinking before you act.

411
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,870
What now?

412
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,870
Is that all you have to say?

413
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,840
How dare you come here
and try to teach me?

414
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,010
I don't plan
on having a student like you.

415
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,680
Where's Kang Se Ri?

416
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,180
Grandma!

417
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,950
Who are you?

418
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,520
I'm my mommy and daddy's son.

419
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,620
Who are your mommy and daddy?

420
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,690
My mommy's name is Kang Se Ri,

421
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,660
and my daddy is Hwang Gi Chan.

422
00:19:58,770 --> 00:19:59,940
What did Ms. Kang say?

423
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,740
She still won't say anything?

424
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,670
She must be thinking.

425
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,980
She has to save her company,
so she'll have to do something.

426
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,750
Look at you two.

427
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,720
Was this the hideout
for your affair?

428
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,220
You filthy scumbags.

429
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,330
You two are less than beasts.

430
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,460
How dare you two...

431
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,030
take and humiliate this office?

432
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,470
How dare you two do this?

433
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,200
Give me back my money.

434
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,440
Return the shares you took
and my gallery, too.

435
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,940
Give everything back.

436
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,510
Give it back now!

437
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,210
Why are you so mad?

438
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,550
I know. Are you mad that
you got suspicious of an innocent woman...

439
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,920
and even killed her?

440
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,290
So, what did I tell you?

441
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,390
I told you Ms. Kim Do Hee
wasn't my other woman.

442
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,020
You crazy punk.

443
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,390
You crazy punk!

444
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,130
Stop it! Let go of him.

445
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,110
It was you?

446
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,450
I trusted you and asked for help
because you were Jae In's friend.

447
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,150
But you made a fool out of me?

448
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,460
It's belated,
but let me apologize anyhow.

449
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Sorry. Happy now?

450
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,590
If you're sorry, die.

451
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,930
Pay me back with your life.

452
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,230
- Pay me back!
- Honey!

453
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,200
- Die!
- What are you doing?

454
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,500
Let go of her!

455
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,600
Die!

456
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,800
Let go!

457
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,770
- Die!
- No!

458
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,710
- You all need to stop!
- Die!

459
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,010
Ms. Choi Ja Young!

460
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,080
Are you okay?

461
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,280
I'm going to sue her.

462
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,320
- Get me an attorney.
- Go ahead and do that.

463
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,760
Why are you making this scene?

464
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,720
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

465
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,030
You're talking to me and not them?

466
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,100
Haven't you watched the video?

467
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,500
The two who were
the closest to Jae In...

468
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,730
didn't just betray her,

469
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,000
but had a kid, too!

470
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,400
How can they do this as humans?

471
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,910
The child wasn't born from them.

472
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,140
Says who?

473
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,510
Them?

474
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,950
And you believed them?

475
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,110
I should.

476
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,420
They denied it themselves.

477
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,120
Wake up!

478
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,850
Why are you adding to this?

479
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,020
I have my own standards
when I make decisions.

480
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,290
Don't try
to meddle with my opinion...

481
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,530
and go home.

482
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,300
I called the guards.
They'll be here soon.

483
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,960
I need to take my money
before I leave.

484
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,230
Give me back my money.
Give back everything you took!

485
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,840
Take her outside.

486
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,340
Let go of me. Don't touch me
with your filthy hands!

487
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,710
Let go!

488
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,740
Why are you doing this to me, too?

489
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,010
You should've left...

490
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,010
while you could leave with dignity
when I warned you.

491
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,450
What are you waiting for?
Get her out of here.

492
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,350
I won't let all of you live!

493
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,990
Mi Ran, you two, and Seung Woo,
all of you!

494
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,590
Let go of me! Let go!

495
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,790
I apologize for this mess.

496
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,530
There will come a day
when you must pay me back for today.

497
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,830
I'm worried...

498
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,940
about Jae In's mom, Director Choi.
She was too worked up.

499
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,340
What if she says
something weird to the media?

500
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,210
It'll have a negative impact
on YL Group.

501
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,110
What do you want to do?

502
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,750
I'll follow...

503
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,180
whatever decision you make.

504
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,420
- Come on in.
- Hello, Father.

505
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,130
I got you a housewarming gift.

506
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,000
- Jeez.
- Have a seat.

507
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,260
Gosh.

508
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,370
Where's Jae In's mom?

509
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,140
She left to do something.

510
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,870
You don't work for YL anymore.

511
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,440
Why are you helping her like this?

512
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,310
Send her away.

513
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,580
She's my guest.

514
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,410
You don't have to mind her.

515
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,710
Dad.

516
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,250
I'm using my common sense
to act like a decent person,

517
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,480
so don't say anything else.

518
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,260
Gosh, this place is so humble
compared to your old place.

519
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,190
It's big enough
for me to live alone.

520
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,230
It's just a shame
that you lost the property.

521
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,130
If you gave me the money you lost,

522
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,530
you would've made
enough money to retire...

523
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,330
and live in a huge mansion.

524
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,030
Why did you give your money
to the wrong people?

525
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,900
That's enough.

526
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,440
We're in recession,
so the market isn't doing so well.

527
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,580
But I used to be
a famous asset manager.

528
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,410
So, I wanted to ask you this.

529
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,850
You didn't lose everything, did you?

530
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,450
You should give me
whatever you have left.

531
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,750
- I'll make 4, 5 times more than...
- That's enough!

532
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,550
Everything you're saying...

533
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,890
isn't so different
from the con man who took his money.

534
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,090
Did you call me a con man?

535
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,260
Enough, both of you!

536
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,030
You need to stop.

537
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,560
I'll manage my own life.

538
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,030
You don't have to get into a fight.

539
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,400
We'll go.

540
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,270
Let's grab a meal next time.

541
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,010
We'll go for now, Father.

542
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,950
Where are you?

543
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,460
I don't need to hear it.
Come to where I am now!

544
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,590
I'm just like a con man?

545
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,150
Did you have to say it like that?

546
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,920
Your words are always the problem.

547
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,730
Didn't you receive
enough education...

548
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,930
to think before you speak?

549
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,030
What about you?
Did you receive all your education...

550
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,000
to shoot down my spirit
just like my mom?

551
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,470
And I wasn't wrong.

552
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,200
If he invested
all that money with me,

553
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,670
I would've made some more...

554
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,710
and returned the principal
even after losing his fortune.

555
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,540
Those con artists
took his money and fled!

556
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,480
Is that all you have to say?

557
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,380
Yes, what else will he say?

558
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,480
How dare you raise your voice
against your husband?

559
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,250
He crossed the line.

560
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,690
You get mad at him, too.

561
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,020
He's my son,

562
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,460
so it's not like what you do to him.

563
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,330
Go and make dinner.

564
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,230
Jeez.

565
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,740
Look at the time.

566
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,770
I told you to come right away.
What took you so long?

567
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,480
What is it?

568
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,910
You knew Kang Se Ri was the woman...

569
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,750
who married that scumbag,
Gi Chan, right?

570
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,850
Yes.

571
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,750
Then, why didn't you tell me?

572
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,390
Why are you so stupid?

573
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,020
Look at you.

574
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,390
You wouldn't have ended up like this
if you listened to me.

575
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,390
Do you regret everything?

576
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,700
Yes, I'm in deep regret.

577
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,930
At this point?

578
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,700
You're finally regretting this
after you ruined our family?

579
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,840
How am I going to take them down
without a penny in my pocket?

580
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,610
I'll do it.

581
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,510
How?

582
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,750
Even your aunt is
siding with Seung Woo now.

583
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,880
How are you going to do this
without money or connections?

584
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,750
I'll do it
even if I must sell my soul.

585
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,620
Watch me.

586
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,160
You should go and beg your aunt.

587
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,630
You're her only blood,

588
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,290
so she won't be as cold to you...

589
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,700
as she was to me.

590
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,530
I'll manage.

591
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,400
Mom, but apologize to Seung Woo.

592
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,870
That's the right thing to do.

593
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,110
I'm not crazy.

594
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,940
He even came here
and made a huge scene.

595
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,940
Why would I apologize to him?

596
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,010
If anything,
he should apologize to me.

597
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,510
- Mom.
- Forget it.

598
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,450
Don't even mention him.

599
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,890
He acted like a mighty chairman...

600
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,960
and called me through a secretary
to schedule a meeting.

601
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,330
I guess he isn't that desperate yet.

602
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,130
Let's make him more desperate.

603
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,470
Hello?

604
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,140
Yes, CEO Kim. It's been a while.

605
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,650
Well,

606
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,520
I'm doing so-so.

607
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,020
As a docent at a gallery?

608
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,820
Do I have to...

609
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,160
No, I'll do it.

610
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,930
I'll be there to work.

611
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,400
Do you understand?

612
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,970
And you must pay extra attention
to the next guest you'll escort.

613
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,340
Oh, my. You're here, Ms. Noh.

614
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,980
I need you to pick out
a decent painting for me.

615
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,850
All of these were imitations.

616
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,720
I was too humiliated
with these fake paintings.

617
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,960
What's she doing here?

618
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,630
Why is she here?

619
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,430
She started here today
as a docent to our gallery.

620
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,430
I don't know what a docent does,

621
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,540
but I'm not buying from you.

622
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,370
Haven't you learned to remain quiet
when you look at paintings?

623
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,670
I said you'd be better off
if you didn't do anything.

624
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,910
Did you forget that already?

625
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,250
How ignorant.

626
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Yes, I'm ignorant,

627
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,320
but you're an educated murderer.

628
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,520
How dare you hit me?

629
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,120
How dare you push me?

630
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,430
Okay, fine. Bring it on.

631
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,030
Come at me!

632
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,400
- Come at me! You!
- Ouch!

633
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,660
- Ma'am!
- Let go of me!

634
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,400
A murderer like you
doesn't get to teach anyone!

635
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,000
Let go of me! Let go!

636
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,600
- Ouch!
- Goodness, Ms. Noh!

637
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,140
- Let go of me!
- Oh, my!

638
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,540
- Goodness!
- How dare you try to teach me?

639
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,070
Let go of me! Let go!

640
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,010
Let go of me!

641
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,140
No, I won't.

642
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,340
Goodness, Ms. Noh!

643
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,220
You should probably see this.

644
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,630
("Hansan Daily")

(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan, his wife,
Kang, and her aunt, Kang Mi Ran)

646
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,290
It looks so good.

647
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,690
And now,
I became the real Kang Jae In.

648
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:04,330
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

649
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,980
I'm looking forward to hearing...

650
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,240
what you'll say this time.

651
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,050
I have nothing to say to you.
Goodbye.

652
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,950
How can you do this to me?

653
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,290
Are you really my aunt?

654
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,990
I told you already.

655
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,220
I'll do anything
for Seung Woo's sake.

656
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,790
Your mom was just like that.

657
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,660
Why do you think
she even killed someone?

658
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,470
It was to protect you.

659
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,870
That's what mothers do.

660
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,570
You made a big mistake.

661
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,480
You just denied my late dad...

662
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,210
by denying my existence.

663
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,580
And I can't forgive you anymore.

00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,070
Are you still not over him?

666
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,570
Not at all.

667
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,110
Why would I be attached
to someone who killed my son?

668
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,740
She's not my sister.

669
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,950
You need
to publish a correction now!

670
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,520
I had to stop this scandal first,

671
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,020
and I did it for you.

672
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,020
No, that's impossible.

673
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,990
No way.

674
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,460
I must've gotten confused
because I haven't dated in a long time.

675
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,730
Of course, he can
put a blanket over her. Yes.
