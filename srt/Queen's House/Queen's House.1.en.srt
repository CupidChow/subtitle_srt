1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,530
I will punish you with my own hands.

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,960
You two will be tortured
right where you are,

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,630
even before you're thrown down
into the hottest pit of fire.

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,240
Just wait.

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,250
(Episode 1)

9
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,490
Here.

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,500
It's all right. No one can tell.

11
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,140
Come on. Stand still.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,580
Perfect.

13
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,340
Are you done appreciating me?

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,310
Your father is waiting.

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,020
You have to go to work very early
every single day,

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,350
so that's my present.

17
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,030
You always see me off
even though I leave so early,

18
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,330
so this is my present.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,030
You have no idea, do you?

20
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,130
What?

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,370
I always wait for this time.

22
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,800
You leave early every day
and return home late after work.

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,840
Then, you practically collapse
and go to sleep.

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,740
But now, we can look at each other
and chat with a smile.

25
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,380
It's my happiest hour.

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,810
It's a shame that
it flies by so quickly.

27
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,920
Ms. Jae In, the chairman is leaving.

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,720
All right.

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,020
I must've talked for too long.

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,590
You should go, honey.

31
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,160
Now, start scanning.

32
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,730
- What?
- Then, you can remember...

33
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,630
what your husband looks like
all day long, not just now.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,540
You said it made you happy.

35
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,970
Should I do the same?

36
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,220
Have a great day.

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
Where's Seung Woo?

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,690
He just started.

39
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,530
He looked tired,
so let him sleep in.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,200
There's nothing
for a rank-and-file worker to do...

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,630
even if he goes to work this early.

42
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,600
He's not just a mere employee.

43
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,040
He needs to set an example.

44
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,440
- Dad, you have a morning meeting.
- Yes.

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,970
Have a great day.

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,410
All right.

47
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,990
The chairman has been concerned
about his work lately,

48
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,520
so his blood pressure went up.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,460
Make sure you keep an eye on him.

50
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,530
Yes, I'll go.

51
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,500
Drive safely, okay?

52
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,170
Bye.

53
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,180
Don't show him too much love.

54
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,750
He'll forget his place...

55
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,220
and become haughty,
thinking he's somebody.

56
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,190
But he is somebody.

57
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,030
Not only was he a former prosecutor,
but he also proved his competence...

58
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,360
by doing a great job at work,

59
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,930
and Dad approved of him, too.

60
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm just grateful
that I married a man like him.

61
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,200
Gi Chan should be grateful, not you.

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,340
The upper class is not the same
as the working class.

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,440
There are different levels
in these classes.

64
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,210
We're all people.

65
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,240
We love each other and are married.

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,580
It seems so vulgar
to talk about class...

67
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,350
It seems less classy, Mom.

68
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,890
Let's not bicker this early.

69
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,620
Don't take it the wrong way.

70
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,090
What I mean is this.

71
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,990
Forget his background or whatever.

72
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,960
It's easier both physically
and emotionally...

73
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,530
for a woman to receive love
than to give love.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,430
I like to give love.

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,230
And he likes to give love, too.

76
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,040
Isn't that enough?

77
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,770
Hey, Mom. You didn't forget
about lunch, right?

78
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,510
I don't know. I hoped I'd forget it,

79
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,180
but I should go. What else can I do?

80
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,180
We should go. Okay?

81
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,630
Let us begin.

82
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,140
Yes, sir. Let me share
the most important agenda first.

83
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,270
We're holding this meeting today
to reinforce our strategy...

84
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,740
to bid for the factory in China.

85
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,840
Please look over the files...

86
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,550
for countermeasures by department
and the list of potential risks.

87
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,980
(Director of Planning Hwang Gi Chan)

88
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,190
Hey, I was in a meeting.

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,460
Are you home?

90
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,930
It'd be great if you came.
But it's just wishful thinking.

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Stop teasing me.

92
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,000
Are you serious?

93
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,770
Yes, all right.

94
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,540
I'll be there later.

95
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,810
Okay. Wait for me.

96
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,150
So, I won't be home
when you're back from kindergarten.

97
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,690
It's all right.
I'm not a baby anymore.

98
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,620
Yes, you're right.

99
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,220
You're now a child,
not just a baby, Eun Ho.

100
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,860
Hey, we're here.

101
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,130
Eun Ho, take your backpack.

102
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,230
All right.

103
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,670
Goodbye, Mommy.

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,140
Have a great day. Okay?

105
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,110
Bye.

106
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,540
Sir, the thing with funds is this.

107
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,080
There's not a lot of difference
between investment and gambling.

108
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,180
If you hit the jackpot,
it's an investment,

109
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,250
and if you lose everything,
you call it gambling.

110
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,420
What? If you don't get
your principal back,

111
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,860
I have to pull out my liver, kidney,
and eyes to pay you back?

112
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,860
My gosh. Sir, don't be so scary.

113
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,370
Yes, sir. Just give me two days.

114
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,640
I'll get your principal back
in two days.

115
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,600
This time, I mean it.
Give me just two days.

116
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,740
Yes, sir.
I'll reach out to you. Goodbye.

117
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,420
Mother, I'm going to work.

118
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,490
Honey, have some before you go.

119
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,860
I made it for you.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,760
I have an appointment
with a patient.

121
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,260
Honey.

122
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,270
Have you considered
what I mentioned last night?

123
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,170
I don't have any money.
You already know that.

124
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,440
I do know that.

125
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,910
I know I'm praising myself,
but this is a really good fund.

126
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,310
There's a low risk
with a high chance of return.

127
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,150
Why don't you ask
our sister-in-law, Jae In?

128
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,290
We haven't paid back
what we borrowed last time.

129
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,220
Why don't you ask Uncle instead?

130
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,790
Ask who for what?

131
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,030
I'm running late.

132
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,600
Goodbye.

133
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,370
Look at how she storms out
without answering her elder's question.

134
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,200
Who cares if she's a doctor?
Where are her manners?

135
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,610
She said she was running late.

136
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,410
You even made breakfast for her?

137
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,310
That's not the way
you tame your wife.

138
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,110
That's why she thinks
her mother-in-law's question is a joke.

139
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,950
I'll get mad at her
when she comes home tonight.

140
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,290
I made some for you, too.

141
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,420
I'm broke.

142
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,620
Mom, just this once.

143
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,960
- Please help me this once.
- This isn't your first time!

144
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,860
You never stop asking, do you?

145
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,800
Monetary transactions must be clear
even between a mom and her son.

146
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,130
Give back what you owe me.

147
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,400
You'll get a return
on your investment.

148
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,140
Who'll look after you later in life?

149
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Gi Chan is practically living with
his wife's family,

150
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,140
and Na Ra will
marry into another family.

151
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,540
I'm your only hope
as your eldest son.

152
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,140
Think of this as an investment
for your retirement.

153
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,210
- Just this once...
- Up your mouth!

154
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,610
That's not it.
You say, "Shut your mouth."

155
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,680
Shut it.

156
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,080
Don't ever ask me for this again.

157
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,720
If you do, I'll zip up your mouth.

158
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,290
Also, don't even dream
of getting my help.

159
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,730
You need to handle this yourself.

160
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,030
Mom, what do you think?

161
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,530
I'm dressed like
a rich family's daughter-in-law.

162
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,900
Make sure
you get on their good side today.

163
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,970
That way, they'll set you up
with a good husband material.

164
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,640
Mom, if you can ask,

165
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,610
tell them to find
the best-looking rich guy.

166
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,710
Okay?

167
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,610
Just take the lead.

168
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,090
Are they actually coming?

169
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,090
It's way past
when we were supposed to meet.

170
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,260
Right. Let me call them.

171
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,430
Hello, Ms. Choi.

172
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,030
You're here, Mother.

173
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,430
Yes, I'm here, Jae In.
Your mother-in-law.

174
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,140
It's been a while, Ms. Choi.

175
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,640
Is everything well?

176
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,770
Yes, we're at peace.

177
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,340
Hello.

178
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,380
You've become prettier
since the last time we met.

179
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,620
Well, I got some surgery.

180
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
She's such a good-natured
and naive girl,

181
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,760
so she can never lie
whenever adults ask a question.

182
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,960
I see. Let's go for lunch.

183
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,230
One moment.

184
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,530
We're here anyway,

185
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,860
so we should enjoy the paintings.

186
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,230
Na Ra took after me,

187
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,500
so she became highly interested in art,
especially paintings.

188
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,800
She has good taste, too.

189
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,710
This is...

190
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,150
Monet.

191
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,350
Monet.

192
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,180
It's by Monet.

193
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,020
The more I look
at Monet's paintings,

194
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,420
the more I feel, you know...

195
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,990
Well...

196
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,200
My girl, can you tell us about it?

197
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,030
Monet was
an impressionist painter...

198
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,600
nicknamed the painter of light.

199
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,970
- He was interested in the change...
- Na Ra.

200
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,940
It's Rene.

201
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,310
It's not Monet. It's Rene Magritte.

202
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,980
What? It's Rene, not Monet?

203
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,480
Right.

204
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,750
Mom, it's by Rene.

205
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,380
Rene, Monet.

206
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,090
These painters have
such similar names,

207
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,490
so Na Ra got them confused.

208
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,890
They're kissing each other
with a cloth over them.

209
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,700
Do they not want to see each other
because they're both ugly?

210
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,270
There are
many different interpretations.

211
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,840
This is called "The Lovers."

212
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,100
The word means
two people who are in love,

213
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,740
but it can also mean two people
who only sleep together, like an affair.

214
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,290
Who's married? The man or the woman?

215
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,990
One of them has to be married.

216
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,560
No way. Oh, my gosh.

217
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,500
Are they both married?

218
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,070
It may not be an affair.

219
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,040
It may be two people who don't show
how they truly feel on the inside.

220
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,410
There may be a secret,

221
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,550
or they may be in fake love.

222
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,380
It all depends
on the interpretation.

223
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,390
Only those two will know
what the truth is.

224
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,260
Good for you, Jae In.

225
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,460
You have a husband...

226
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,300
who only loves you
and cares about you...

227
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,500
with his unshaken heart
for all of his time.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,900
He's the type who won't budge
even if he had permission to cheat.

229
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,540
You must be a happy woman.

230
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,870
Isn't that so?

231
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,610
Yes, that's both my luck...

232
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,180
and Gi Chan's luck, Mother.

233
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,810
When it comes to luck,
Ms. Choi, you're a lucky woman, too.

234
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,080
Isn't that so?

235
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,450
My son serves his in-laws so well...

236
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,120
as if he were your daughter-in-law,

237
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,760
and you always get to see them
in love with each other.

238
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,660
It must be wonderful.

239
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,930
I also want to see them every day,

240
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,600
so I'm very jealous of you.

241
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,700
I always appreciate that, Ms. Noh.

242
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,940
Gosh, don't mention it.

243
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,570
You don't have to thank me.

244
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,770
But just know that
I let you do that...

245
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,510
only because I'm a woman
with a generous heart.

246
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,410
Please excuse me for a moment.

247
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,180
Yes, hello, Director.

248
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,250
Did Eun Ho pull a prank on...

249
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,990
What?

250
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
(Wife)

251
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,640
Hey, don't you have to go?

252
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,580
(Wife)

253
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,310
Have you not found Eun Ho yet?

254
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,680
No, I'm sorry.

255
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,620
Why wasn't there a supervisor here?

256
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,550
How did the child
suddenly go missing?

257
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,590
They were playing out in the yard
after lunch.

258
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,560
One of the children
had to use the restroom,

259
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,430
so the teacher left for a second
to help, then...

260
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,190
Do you call that an excuse?

261
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,360
You need to keep an eye
on my precious grandson!

262
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,700
Why should you help anyone else?

263
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,100
Do you know who he is?

264
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,240
Did you search everywhere
inside the kindergarten building?

265
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,470
Of course.

266
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,610
What about the CCTV footage?

267
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,310
He must've been caught there.

268
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,710
He was seen in passing
while he played here,

269
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,740
but he was headed to a blind spot,

270
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,310
so there was nothing else.

271
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,180
Eun Ho...

272
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,880
I need to look for him.

273
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,450
You could've missed him.

274
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,290
The teachers and I
all searched many times.

275
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,860
Classrooms, restrooms, kitchen,

276
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,230
nap room, teacher's office,
and everything else.

277
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,960
Na Ra, what about Gi Chan?

278
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,560
He won't pick up.

279
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,830
I left him a text message
so he'd reach out soon.

280
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,740
We shouldn't just stand around.

281
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,770
Shouldn't we call the police first?

282
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,670
Have you reported this?

283
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,840
Not yet. We weren't sure about it.

284
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,510
What do you mean?

285
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,650
He went missing a while ago.
Why haven't you reported this?

286
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,350
You need to report this
to the police right away. Now.

287
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,520
Okay. Yes.

288
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,420
What are you waiting for? Report it.

289
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,160
I can't remember the number.

290
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,930
I called your father.
He probably called them already.

291
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,530
We must remain level-headed
in times like these.

292
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,370
Trust me, and don't worry.

293
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,840
We will find him.

294
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,540
Okay.

295
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,370
Okay.

296
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,840
Honey...

297
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,480
(Restricted Number)

298
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,680
Hello?

299
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,550
Hello?

300
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,490
You must be Eun Ho's mother.

301
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,660
Yes, I'm Eun Ho's mother.

302
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,360
Who are you?

303
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,030
Don't you want to see him?

304
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,900
Do you know him?

305
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,640
Yes, I'm with him right now.

306
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,140
You'd better not call the police
if you want to see him again.

307
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,440
Do you understand?

308
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,350
Eun Ho will lose his life.

309
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,180
No!

310
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,820
No, Eun Ho!

311
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,220
Goodness.

312
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,250
Jae In.

313
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,120
Hello?

314
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,230
Mr. Kang.

315
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,160
Take the bidding file
for the factory in China...

316
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,760
and check for the files
we need to attach.

317
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,570
Mr. Kang?

318
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,280
My gosh! You surprised me.

319
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,750
What are you doing?

320
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,360
Mr. Kang, where are we?

321
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,230
The office.

322
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,630
So, you knew that.

323
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,960
Then, you must know
what to do during working hours.

324
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,460
Well, work, I guess.

325
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,730
And what are you doing?

326
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,340
Me?

327
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,700
You saw me already. Why do you ask?

328
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,540
I got sleepy, so I took a nap.

329
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,910
Look over the file and check
for whatever we need to attach.

330
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,950
I have to do this?

331
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,350
I can't do it.

332
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,590
It looks like your job,
so you do it.

333
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,230
Why don't you just quit?

334
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,170
I am the son of YL's chairman,

335
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,130
Kang Gyu Cheol.

336
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,970
Is that so?

337
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,040
And?

338
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,280
You're directly under me right now,
so you'll either do as I say...

339
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,010
or resign right now.

340
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,550
Who's going to accept it
once I write my resignation?

341
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,750
I'll report directly
to the chairman,

342
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,490
so don't worry about that, Mr. Kang.

343
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,920
I was going to do it.

344
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,570
Hey, Mom.

345
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
I don't want to work.

346
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,510
Is Gi Chan in the office?

347
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,550
He went out to work.

348
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,350
He went out to work.
Mom, you need to hear me out.

349
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,920
What did you say?

350
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,560
Where are you going, Mr. Kang?

351
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,430
I still can't believe it.
It feels like a dream.

352
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,870
I'm in Korea, right?
I'm not in the States.

353
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,070
Goodness.

354
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,150
My dream doesn't feel this real.

355
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,080
These touches and feelings...

356
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,780
all feel very weak there.

357
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,520
This is nice.

358
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,220
How did you suddenly come
without calling me?

359
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,460
I missed you.

360
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,490
I missed you to death.

361
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,970
I was going to use work as an excuse
to visit you there this weekend.

362
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,740
That's wonderful.

363
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,070
We can stay together
all through the weekend.

364
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,880
I have to go back to work.

365
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,880
And?

366
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,310
I'll be back after work.

367
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,780
Let's eat dinner.

368
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,490
I wasn't going to let you
leave the bed.

369
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,590
I'll cut you some slack.

370
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,590
Will you come back right away?

371
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,030
The hotel restaurant looked nice.

372
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,570
I'll meet you there at 6 p.m.

373
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,930
I hate it.

374
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,870
Do you not want to go
to that restaurant?

375
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,300
I mean you.

376
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,040
You look way too wonderful,
so I hate to share you.

377
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,940
I know.

378
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,210
I got into this
knowing you were married,

379
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,310
so I'd never blame you.

380
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,620
But you're the only one for me,

381
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,020
and I'm crazily in love with you,

382
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,890
but that's not your case.

383
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,460
This isn't fair.

384
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,430
Do you know how much time
we get to spend together in a year?

385
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,030
We don't even get 30 days
out of 365 days.

386
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,930
Do you even love me?

387
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,570
Or our Ji Ho...

388
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,910
I love you.

389
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,380
Don't you believe me?

390
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,450
I didn't come here to whine,

391
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,380
but I couldn't help it.

392
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,690
This is enough for now.
You should go.

393
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,660
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

394
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,110
(Messages, Missed Calls)

395
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,280
(Wife, Mother)

396
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,480
(Wife, Mother, Na Ra, Father)

397
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,180
(Wife)

398
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,320
(Mother)

399
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,790
Yes, Mother.

400
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,010
Goodness, Eun Ho.

401
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,180
My precious only grandson.

402
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,750
You're the son who would've carried on
our family name.

403
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,190
Eun Ho, my eldest grandson.

404
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,360
My goodness.

405
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,090
You need to calm down.

406
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,490
Some may hear you
and think the worst has happened.

407
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,130
This is the worst!

408
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,030
What else can be worse than this?

409
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,630
How can you be so nonchalant?

410
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,870
Your only grandson got kidnapped.

411
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,570
Aren't you worried about him?

412
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,870
We're all worried here.

413
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,110
We all feel the same,
but we just don't show it.

414
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,750
So, why did a rich family
like yours...

415
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,680
send him to a public kindergarten?

416
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,190
This wouldn't have happened
if you sent him...

417
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,420
to an expensive private institution!

418
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,290
Are you treating him like this
because he's your daughter's son?

419
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,360
Is that so?

420
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,800
Mom, you need to stop.

421
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
This is hard for Jae In.

422
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,830
It's hard for me, too.

423
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,500
Eun Ho, my grandson...

424
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,550
Don't worry, Jae In.

425
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,520
Eun Ho will return safely.

426
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,420
Darn it. That punk
better not let me catch him.

427
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,920
I'll rip him into pieces
and bury him alive.

428
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,630
Stop talking nonsense.

429
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,030
We'll handle it
according to the law.

430
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,130
Why did you come back
during your working hours?

431
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,730
Go back to work.

432
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,430
Work isn't important right now.
Eun Ho is...

433
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,500
So what?

434
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,870
How are you going to help
in any way?

435
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,810
Just do your job.

436
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,610
That's the only way
you can help Eun Ho.

437
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,680
All right. I'm leaving.

438
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,620
I just reached out...

439
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,820
to the police commissioner.

440
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,120
The detective in charge will
arrive shortly.

441
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,160
No, the kidnapper said
we couldn't talk to the police.

442
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,290
From what I hear,

443
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,430
the first 48 hours are important
when a child is kidnapped.

444
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,600
The more we delay this,
the bigger danger he'll be in.

445
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,240
They said they'd move discreetly,

446
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,870
so we should give them our trust.

447
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,980
Ms. Noh, I know it's hard for you,

448
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,850
but please wait.

449
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,480
Honey!

450
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,320
Where's Eun Ho?

451
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,790
Gi Chan, what are we going to do?

452
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,030
Where have you been?
We couldn't reach you.

453
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,100
I was in a meeting with a buyer,
so I didn't know.

454
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,300
What about the call?
Has the kidnapper called again?

455
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,100
He called once, then never again.

456
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,040
He told her to get
two million dollars in cash.

457
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,910
Director Do will handle this.

458
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,780
What about the police?
We should report this first.

459
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,080
I did.

460
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,890
Hello?

461
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,330
Why did you break your promise?

462
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,730
I have the money ready.

463
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm getting it in cash right now.

464
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,070
Eun Ho is still okay, right?

465
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,700
Right?

466
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,010
Please let me hear just his voice.

467
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,280
Please.

468
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,350
Why did you report this
if you wanted to see him again?

469
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,950
What?

470
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,450
No, I didn't. I mean it.

471
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,620
Who is that? Is that the kidnapper?

472
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,160
I already said he'd lose his life
if you reported me.

473
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,100
Do you not want to see him again?

474
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,100
No! Let him live.

475
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,070
Please let him live.

476
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,370
I'm sorry for everything.

477
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,540
I'll do whatever you want,
so just let him live. Please...

478
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,040
No, Eun Ho...

479
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,250
Please let Eun Ho live.

480
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,450
Please!

481
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,390
If you want to save his life,
keep your promise.

482
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,450
Hello? Where is he right now?

483
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,360
Hello?

484
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,790
He hung up.

485
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,970
No...

486
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
Dad...

487
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,040
Dad, you can't call the police.

488
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,010
Eun Ho is going to die!

489
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,280
Dad, he knows everything.

490
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,340
I can't let anything bad happen...

491
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,910
to Eun Ho!

492
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,970
Oh, no.

493
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,430
Eun Ho must be scared...

494
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,870
and looking for his mommy
and daddy. Will he be okay?

495
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,480
What if he gets beaten...

496
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,240
when he cries in fear?

497
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,610
No, Eun Ho...

498
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,080
Eun Ho...

499
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,220
No, Eun Ho...

500
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,690
Mommy's sorry.

501
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,730
Don't cry.
Nothing will happen to him.

502
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,470
He said he'd let him go
when he gets money, so we'll do that.

503
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,270
He'll call again,

504
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:49,410
so you must pull yourself together
and take it.

505
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,710
You should wash your face.

506
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,930
We're meeting tonight, right?

507
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,000
Why won't you pick up your phone?

508
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,700
You're on your way, right?

509
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,300
Are you not coming?

510
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,600
(Catherine)

511
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,540
I'm on my way
to your house right now.

512
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,820
It's me, baby.

513
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,290
No, you can't come.

514
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,190
Tomorrow, I'll...

515
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,090
Hello...

516
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,640
Where's the location tracker?

517
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,210
It's inside where no one can see it.

518
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,350
What about the CCTV footage we got
near the kindergarten?

519
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,420
We haven't found anything yet,

520
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,980
but we're still looking,
so please give it some time.

521
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,520
I postponed
the police from getting involved.

522
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,830
Jae In was frightened
that Eun Ho might get hurt.

523
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I also told
our security team about it.

524
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,570
They'll do a good job.

525
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,000
Bring him to me immediately
once you get him.

526
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,840
Won't you hand him over
to the police?

527
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,540
I need to see him first.

528
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,740
This is someone...

529
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,150
who blackmailed us
with a helpless child.

530
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,850
This must be a beastly thing
disguised as a human.

531
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,920
I can't forgive him.

532
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,570
I heard someone was here. Who is it?

533
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,070
Give it a moment.

534
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,940
It's for Eun Ho's mother,

535
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,780
but we don't know who it's from.

536
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,590
Things were hectic,
so I couldn't reach out.

537
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,820
I'm sorry.

538
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,900
It must be hard on you.

539
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,930
It's only been a few hours,
but you already look awful.

540
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,500
Gi Chan.

541
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,980
I don't deserve to be a dad.

542
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,810
I had no idea my son went missing,

543
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,310
completely mesmerized by you.

544
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,450
I was in such a thrill
that I couldn't hear anything.

545
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,320
How can I call myself a dad?

546
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,490
No, I can't do that.

547
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,560
- I don't deserve to say that.
- No.

548
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,790
You have all the right to be a dad.

549
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,860
You love and adore Eun Ho so much.

550
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,300
Nothing will happen.

551
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,600
Don't blame yourself.

552
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,160
- Jae In.
- Jae In.

553
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,310
(Queen's House)

554
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,450
- Jae In.
- Jae In.

555
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,950
Isn't this his?

556
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,620
Goodness, Eun Ho. My grandson.

557
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,320
How can I call myself a dad?

558
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,160
Find him.

559
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,760
You're his dad.

560
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,160
Bring him back.

561
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,430
I found it.

562
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,970
Life depends
on the tip of my fingers,

563
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:52,470
so I won't let any patient
who gets on my table die.

564
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,470
No! Eun Ho. No.

565
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,370
What are you doing?
