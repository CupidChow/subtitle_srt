1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,780
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,410
Let me make this clear once again.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,350
Seung Woo is my son.

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,680
Then, give him a choice.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,750
Tell him you're his birth mother...

8
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,090
and want to have him
as your son on paper.

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,860
You can ask him honestly.

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,130
Your mom took
that opportunity from me.

11
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,860
I wanted to be honest
and tell him myself.

12
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,570
I get that you want
to be accepted and understood,

13
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,530
but that's your selfishness.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,600
Can't you see
what's happening to Seung Woo?

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,710
Don't you know how shocking
and painful this is for him?

16
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,340
I didn't do that. It was your mom.

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,310
I didn't want to hurt him,

18
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,250
so I tried my best to protect him.

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,280
You're way too self-centered.

20
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,820
That's right.
My mom hurt him. I agree with that.

21
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,820
What about you?

22
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,700
- Didn't you hurt him...
- You don't have to continue.

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,300
What I want is...

24
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,200
to have my son
under my family register.

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,410
I'm trying to free your mother
from this burden.

26
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,850
Kang Seung Woo
wasn't Chairman Kang's love child?

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,120
He was Director Kang's son?

28
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,820
I knew something was weird.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,060
This was why he never took...

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,590
her niece, Jae In's side.

31
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,330
What are you doing here?

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,400
I came to get something approved,

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,000
but it didn't seem like
the right time to go in.

34
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,650
Talk to Seung Woo yourself
if that's what you want.

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,520
If he agrees
to be your legal family,

36
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,120
then I'll persuade my mom.

37
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,750
I think that's the proper order.

38
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,600
You're here.

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,100
Yes, you told me to come to work.

40
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,530
I'm glad you came.

41
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,870
What were you discussing inside?

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,210
You shouldn't hear it from me
but from Aunt Mi Ran...

43
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,880
I don't know
how to address her to you.

44
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,810
She's still an aunt.

45
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,050
And when we're at work,
she's the junior managing director.

46
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,550
You should hear it from Aunt Mi Ran.
That's probably best.

47
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,590
Does she want to have me
under her family registrar?

48
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,200
Says who?

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,460
I'm my father's son.

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,470
I don't know about Mom,
but I'll stay my dad's son.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,440
He thought of me as his son.

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,540
Right? Isn't that so?

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,280
I told you already.
You're my little brother.

54
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,520
Don't.

55
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,320
Nothing good will happen
if you see her in this mood.

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,590
She'll bring it up soon,

57
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,130
so wait until she does.

58
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,100
And you also need some time.

59
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,770
I should get some coffee.

60
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,620
Are you sure?

61
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,750
So, you also had no idea?

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Is Kang Seung Woo
really Director Kang Mi Ran's son?

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,360
I heard her clearly.

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,930
Aren't you worried about Seung Woo?

65
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,200
Even after all this,
he still is Jae In's brother.

66
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,670
He's a grown man.

67
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,840
He may lose his way for a while,
but it's not a big deal...

68
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,380
What's a bigger deal right now
than Seung Woo, who left home?

69
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,140
It's an agreement that says...

70
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,910
you won't make any calls regarding
YL's profit distribution...

71
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,120
and other major decisions for
the group without my consent...

72
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,120
and that you agree to endorse
Kang Seung Woo...

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,020
as the chairman after your office.

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,620
I found out where Seung Woo was.

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,830
Where is he?

76
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,130
He's at a hotel.

77
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,600
He'll come back
once he figures everything out.

78
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,200
That was why she always covered
for Kang Seung Woo.

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,270
He was her son.

80
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,570
She was drawing a big picture
to leave YL Group to her son.

81
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,650
The puzzle pieces are
finally coming together.

82
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,020
I never understood why Director Kang
turned her back on Jae In.

83
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,750
It seems like
Kang Seung Woo already knows.

84
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,990
- He knows?
- Yes.

85
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,860
Jae In knows everything, too.

86
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,630
Maybe you were the only one
who wasn't in the know.

87
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,670
No, Jae In recently found out
Seung Woo...

88
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,830
wasn't her real brother.

89
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,900
She found out when Choi Ja Young...

90
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,910
cursed at Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol
as she got dragged away.

91
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,240
It couldn't have been long...

92
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,810
since Seung Woo found out
he was a love child.

93
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,310
So, when did it happen?

94
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,850
It must've been when Seung Woo
didn't come to work without notice.

95
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,220
You're right.

96
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,720
It must've come to light recently.

97
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,860
So, what's your plan now?

98
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,960
I mean Kang Seung Woo.

99
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,830
He's Director Kang's son.

100
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,530
Will you let him lurk around?

101
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,680
When will the chairman come home?

102
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,380
He must be running late.

103
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,450
The chairman?

104
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,990
I was talking nonsense.
Pretend like you never heard that.

105
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,560
I told the fried chicken place
that you were quitting.

106
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,860
I'm glad.

107
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,060
Wait, may I ask...

108
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,200
why you suddenly wanted to quit?

109
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,070
I don't have a reason.

110
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,100
Why should I continue to work
at such a lowly place?

111
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,470
The woman at the pig's feet place
is also gone, so it was time.

112
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,810
I'm glad you quit.

113
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,950
So, why do you ask?

114
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,950
I was just wondering
if anything happened.

115
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,790
I'm tired. I need to get some rest,

116
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,720
so don't wake me
when you go to work.

117
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,770
She's been rather exhausted lately.

118
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,280
Why did you do that?

119
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,250
On the day...

120
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,920
we...

121
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,990
Don't use the word we
to describe you and me.

122
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,590
Leave that out.

123
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,160
On the day of the mishap.
Are we good?

124
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,200
What about that day?

125
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,300
Why did you come to see my sister?

126
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,300
I heard you came in the afternoon
to tell her about Jae In.

127
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,910
I wanted to know what you were
going to say the second time you came.

128
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,010
Why did you do that?

129
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,250
I just stated the fact...

130
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,550
to prevent
something worse from happening.

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,850
She's your niece.
Did you want her to get hurt?

132
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,620
You turned your real niece
and made her look fake,

133
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,830
and you even kicked her out
of the place she took refuge.

134
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:38,000
What do you get
from taking things this far?

135
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,730
I'm getting curious.

136
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,040
I don't know what it is,
but something is up.

137
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,010
Mind your own business.

138
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,780
I can't do that
if my family is involved.

139
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,180
My family is a mess
after you told Yun Hee about Jae In.

140
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,280
Tell me now
if you have more news to drop,

141
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,320
and stop hurting my sister.

142
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,850
I don't.

143
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,350
Then, why did you come?

144
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,220
Because I felt bad.

145
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,830
I knew it must've been shocking,

146
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,660
so I felt bad.

147
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,800
Are you happy now?

148
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,120
Did you want to see me?

149
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,830
Mr. Chairman?

150
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,790
I said
I'd pay more attention to you,

151
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,830
but I couldn't, so I wanted
to know how you were doing.

152
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,970
How have you been lately?

153
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,570
How's work?

154
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,070
It's so-so.

155
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,540
I never bothered to study,
so the job isn't so easy, either.

156
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,940
Take your time and think of this
as a chance to learn.

157
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,010
Okay.

158
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,850
How's everything...

159
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,150
with your aunt,
Director Kang Mi Ran?

160
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,590
You must have
a lot to learn from her.

161
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,860
Did Director Kang ask you...

162
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,760
to check in on me?

163
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,500
Why not? Of course,
she can ask me to do that.

164
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,670
She's your family.

165
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,170
Please excuse me
if you have no other questions.

166
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,570
Wait.

167
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,810
You probably learned a lot
during your time here.

168
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,680
So, I want you to take charge
of the on-the-job orientation...

169
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,750
for the new recruits.

170
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,050
Me?

171
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,820
No, I can't do that.

172
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,720
Don't say that.

173
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,060
It's tomorrow, so come prepared.

174
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,930
It's tomorrow?

175
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,400
Isn't that a job
for HR or another department?

176
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,400
Any employee of YL Group
should be able to do that.

177
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,670
Do as you're told.

178
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,650
You can stop, Uncle Do Yun.

179
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,950
Why? I have a lot more to go.

180
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,150
Ms. Kang always drew
pretty pictures...

181
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,990
and colored them nicely, too.

182
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,690
But you're worse than me,

183
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,220
so I think I can do this alone.

184
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,930
Is it that bad?

185
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,700
This is supposed to be you,

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,430
but your face is
much bigger than your body.

187
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,570
This is supposed to be Grandma,
but her face is blue...

188
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,040
and her hands are yellow.

189
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,670
I'm not so talented
as an artist, am I?

190
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,180
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Uncle Do Yun.
If Ms. Kang no longer lives with us,

192
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,350
does it mean
I can never see her again?

193
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,460
I miss her already.

194
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,800
You can meet her
whenever you want to.

195
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,130
I'll make it happen.

196
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,140
Then, tomorrow,
may I go and give her...

197
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,240
the cookies I'll make
at the kindergarten as a present?

198
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,180
I'll pick you up early
from the kindergarten,

199
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,310
so let's go and see her.

200
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,010
But...

201
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,850
it's a secret.

202
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,260
Are you busy?

203
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,290
I'm done for the day.

204
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,860
What is it?

205
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,530
Here.

206
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,400
I wanted to grab a drink with you.

207
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,510
Do you not want some?

208
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,110
I quit drinking.

209
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,710
That was sudden.

210
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm getting old.

211
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,610
I used to be able to drink a lot
without even flinching,

212
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,450
but I began to lose my reason
when I got drunk.

213
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,250
I never wanted to repeat
the same mistake, so I quit.

214
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,090
What mistake?

215
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,460
What? There's this thing.
You don't have to know.

216
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,660
- What?
- I'm coming in.

217
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Sure.

218
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,670
I have something to say to you two.

219
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,910
Dismiss Ms. Kang from her job.

220
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,110
Mom.

221
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,120
It gives me the creeps to think
that she still works with you two.

222
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,520
I tried to think of this
in a good way,

223
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,020
but how could she be so brazen?

224
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,520
How could she
smile like that before me?

225
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,360
How could she
treat Bo Ram like that?

226
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,760
I already told you.

227
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,360
She wanted to tell you,
but I stopped her.

228
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,630
So, she really didn't do it?

229
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,070
It means she never wanted to.

230
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,430
She couldn't have done that
if she had some conscience.

231
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,800
Dismiss her.

232
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,470
I also stopped her
from telling you, Yun Hee.

233
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,440
You already know
she isn't a bad person.

234
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,480
That's exactly why you're so mad.

235
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,880
How would I know
what that woman is like?

236
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,080
I don't know what she's like.

237
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,590
Mom, she's been looking
into Do Hee's death with us.

238
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,720
I already told you.

239
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,520
Her death didn't seem like
a simple hit-and-run case.

240
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,130
So what?

241
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,930
Does that change the fact
that her mom killed Do Hee?

242
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
She did!

243
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,030
Jae In's mother is at fault,
Yun Hee.

244
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,640
It wasn't Jae In.

245
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,840
Try to think with reason.

246
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,210
Do Hee isn't a stranger.

247
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,810
She's your niece,
and she's your sister.

248
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,480
How can you talk about this
like she's a stranger?

249
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,280
I saw her wailing in my dreams...

250
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,050
without saying a word.

251
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,390
She must've felt so resentful.

252
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,090
I'm her mother,

253
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,630
but I had no idea
what my daughter was thinking,

254
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,960
and adored
my enemy's daughter so dearly.

255
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,670
I can't do it right now,

256
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,830
but I'll let her go
as soon as possible. Okay?

257
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,070
So, Yun Hee, don't even
think about her from now on.

258
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,070
It'll only make you stressed out.

259
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,620
Wait, Jae In.

260
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,260
Take this.

261
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,490
It's okay. It's your car.

262
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,130
I don't need it for a while.

263
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,470
My business is nearby, anyway.

264
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,330
I can walk there,
so you can take this.

265
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,510
You said you had lots of work
outside the office. You'll need it.

266
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,410
Thank you for your help.

267
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,620
As you can see,
this is the information desk.

268
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,790
We're going upstairs.

269
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,360
This is the showroom.

270
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,270
I also came here first
when I was a new recruit.

271
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,570
It's where we can find out
what our customers are really thinking.

272
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,970
It's near the subway station,
so it's easy to access.

273
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,540
Can customers begin the construction
after their consultation here?

274
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,680
- Well...
- You're right.

275
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,750
YL Group offers
custom-made interior design,

276
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,490
including the windows,
the kitchen, and even the doors.

277
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,920
So, people can freely redecorate
their places to their needs.

278
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,730
The themes are different
from the first floor to the ninth floor,

279
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,300
so let's start from the top
and take a tour.

280
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,070
This on-site tour will be
very important for your job.

281
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

282
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,310
Then, shall we take a look around?

283
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,910
Ta-da!

284
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,450
This is where Ms. Kang and I work.

285
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,720
Where is she, Uncle Do Yun?

286
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,690
I don't know.
Is she in the staff lounge?

287
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,090
Hey, Bo Ram. What brings you here?

288
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,460
She wanted to see Jae In,
so I brought her here.

289
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,600
Gosh, I'm sorry, Bo Ram.

290
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,030
She just went out to work.

291
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,500
She said she'd be late
and told us to leave first.

292
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,500
I really wanted to see her today.

293
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,610
I should've called her first.

294
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,010
I'm sorry.

295
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,580
But may I leave
the cookies I made for her?

296
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,420
Of course. This is her desk.

297
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,020
- Over here.
- Come here.

298
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,190
- All right.
- Goodness.

299
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,590
One moment.

300
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,160
- Here.
- Now, you can leave it here.

301
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,830
Look! Isn't it pretty?

302
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,000
I put the ribbon on it myself.

303
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,030
Hey, that looks delicious.

304
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,400
Do you have anything
for your little grandpa, Bo Ram?

305
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,640
I'll give you some later.

306
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,910
Uncle Do Yun,
I want to leave a note, too.

307
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,810
Gi Chan.

308
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,860
If Kim Do Yun is
that girl's uncle...

309
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,590
and Patrick Jung is
her little grandpa,

310
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,230
does this mean
they are a nephew and his uncle?

311
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,670
What are you talking about?

312
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,300
Kim Do Yun and Patrick Jung are
a nephew and his uncle?

313
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,070
Yes.

314
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,180
That was why he covered
for Kim Do Yun...

315
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,880
like it was his business.

316
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,550
He was his nephew.

317
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,280
Does this mean Kim Do Yun is
the reason why DH Holdings...

318
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,050
invested in us and joined us?

319
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,560
This means they didn't join us
just to do business as an investor.

320
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,390
If Kim Do Yun had a say in this,

321
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,030
it couldn't be just an investment.

322
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,560
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

323
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,700
What does he want?

324
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,000
Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee?

325
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,540
You're right.

326
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,110
He came to investigate
Ms. Kim's death.

327
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,340
What...

328
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,610
and how much does he know?

329
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,550
How much does he know?

330
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,300
(Designer Kang Jae In)

331
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,040
I miss you so much, Ms. Kang!

332
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,840
From Bo Ram.

333
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,180
Bo Ram.

334
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,880
I miss you, too.

335
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,100
(Tomorrow, July 19:
Eun Ho's birthday)

336
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,270
Tomorrow is...

337
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,740
already Eun Ho's birthday.

338
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:00,940
Eun Ho.

339
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,880
Eun Ho...

340
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,870
Eun Ho.

341
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,240
Happy birthday.

342
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,060
Right. I got your favorite
beaded ice cream, too.

343
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,700
One, two. Hey.

344
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,500
See? You can do this.

345
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,140
- That's it!
- Be careful.

346
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,240
You're so good at this.

347
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,580
Mommy!

348
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,250
This is a promise sticker.

349
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,450
I'll keep you safe, Mommy.

350
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,390
This is for you.

351
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,190
It's a present from me.

352
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,700
- Is it good, Eun Ho?
- Yes.

353
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,760
You can have a bite.

354
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,220
Eun Ho,
you enjoyed this so much, too.

355
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,320
It's really good.

356
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,560
Why are you here?

357
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,600
It's Eun Ho's birthday.

358
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Do you actually feel bad for him?

359
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,340
Of course, I do.

360
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,710
He's my son.

361
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,860
I don't want to fight...

362
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,560
on his birthday.

363
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,370
But I still need to say this.

364
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,810
The culprit who killed him,

365
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,710
the man who caused
the hit-and-run accident, may have died,

366
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,250
but I do not think
he's the real culprit.

367
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,980
Then what?

368
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,220
The real culprit is someone else.

369
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,520
Who's the real culprit?

370
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,760
That driver turned himself in
at the police station.

371
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,900
Are you saying it's me?

372
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,380
Are you in your right mind?

373
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,810
Did you think
I told him to kill my own son?

374
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,750
I didn't say anything,

375
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,680
so don't act like
you're the guilty one.

376
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,820
The culprit said...

377
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,760
someone tried to have me killed.

378
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,630
What are you talking about?

379
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,000
I heard him clearly.

380
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,800
He said he tried to kill me,
but Eun Ho...

381
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,370
died instead.

382
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll find out who put him up...

383
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,110
for that job.

384
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,580
If there's only one thing I'll do,

385
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,520
it'll be exposing
whoever that did this...

386
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,820
to my angel, my Eun Ho,

387
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,990
and have them punished.

388
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,860
And I'll do it even if it's you.

389
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,100
I also loved my son, my Eun Ho,

390
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,340
more than anyone.

391
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,140
Did you?

392
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,540
Why does that
sound like a lie to me?

393
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,780
I only had one dream.

394
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,120
You and Eun Ho,

395
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,190
you two were everything to me.

396
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,290
My only dream was
for us to have a happy life.

397
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,930
That was the only thing I wanted.

398
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,940
But...

399
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,210
you destroyed that brutally.

400
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,810
You...

401
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,240
do not get to claim
that you loved Eun Ho.

402
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,300
I don't want to fight in a place...

403
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,740
full of Eun Ho's memories.

404
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,110
I'm leaving.

405
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,880
You shouldn't drink
if you have a weak stomach.

406
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,210
Stop it.

407
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,850
Think of your health.

408
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,020
Today is Eun Ho's birthday.

409
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,290
I didn't know.

410
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,960
You should've told me.

411
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,390
If you did,
I would've made something.

412
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,330
I'm sorry...

413
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,000
for not understanding how you feel.

414
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,470
But honey,
those who are alive must go on.

415
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,500
I mean,

416
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,110
I know it's hard for you,
but Ji Ho is also your son.

417
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,280
You have to brace yourself
for Ji Ho's sake.

418
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,280
You're his dad.

419
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,480
Are you saying
I can't even mourn for Eun Ho?

420
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,150
You already know
what's happening at work...

421
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,590
better than I do.

422
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,860
If you fall, we'll lose YL Group,

423
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,520
and our family will go down.

424
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,960
Don't you remember
the terms Director Kang proposed...

425
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,060
when you first became the chairman?

426
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,300
She's been drawing
the bigger picture all along.

427
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,370
She had been getting her son,
Kang Seung Woo, ready...

428
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,470
to leave YL's management rights
to her son.

429
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,440
What are you talking about?

430
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,450
Who's the son of whom?

431
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,810
It's Kang Seung Woo.

432
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,320
Jae In's younger brother was
Director Kang Mi Ran's son.

433
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,690
What?

434
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,920
Wait, so he wasn't
Jae In's half-brother,

435
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,920
but he was his aunt's son?

436
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,260
Apparently so, and we were
the only ones who didn't know.

437
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,060
No way. This means
my mother-in-law would be...

438
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,800
my ex-aunt-in-law?

439
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,800
Look at me.

440
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,770
Get yourself together.

441
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,170
It wasn't easy
for you to become the chairman.

442
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,380
Will you leave it
to a random kid like that?

443
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,450
That won't happen.

444
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,680
YL Group is mine.

445
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,850
Yes, you are the owner,

446
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,990
my son, Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

447
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,650
of YL Group.

448
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,820
Do not let anyone else
outside of our family have it.

449
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,090
Do you understand?

450
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,230
Yes.

451
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,120
I called you a few days ago,
but someone else picked up.

452
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,320
Didn't she tell you?

453
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,030
I didn't know.

454
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,760
Why did you call?

455
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,200
Because of the box of articles
the chairman left behind.

456
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,000
I was going to stop by
and pick it up,

457
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
but things were hectic,
so I had forgotten.

458
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,640
I'll pick it up tomorrow.

459
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,180
You can hang out
with your uncle today, Bo Ram.

460
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,720
I have to go to a meeting
at the arcade co-op today.

461
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,290
I'll drop you off on my way out.

462
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,190
Where are you going?
Why don't you rest on the weekend?

463
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,860
There are no specific workdays
for an investor.

464
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,960
I'm always busy.

465
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,490
Should I pick you up
after the meeting?

466
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,860
You'll feel better
after a change of air...

467
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,400
if we go out for a drive.

468
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,470
I'm fine.

469
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,670
I'm leaving, Bo Ram.

470
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,170
Goodbye, Grandma.

471
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,110
Goodbye. Bye.

472
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,950
Can we ask Ms. Kang
to come over, Uncle Do Yun?

473
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,420
Grandma isn't here,
so I want her to come over.

474
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,630
Hello, Jae In? It's me.

475
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,200
Can you come over to my place?

476
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,640
Bo Ram misses you,

477
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,270
and I have to give you something.

478
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,310
The box of articles your father,
Chairman Kang, left behind.

479
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,450
My dad's articles?

480
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,290
I just remembered.
I'll be there right away.

481
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,820
Bo Ram!

482
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,990
Ms. Kang!

483
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,590
Have you been well?

484
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,960
Yes, I missed you.

485
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,100
I missed you a lot, too.

486
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,570
And I enjoyed the cookies.
They were so good.

487
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,910
Really? Were they really good?

488
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,310
Yes, they were so good.

489
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,340
Do you want me to make some more?

490
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,950
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

491
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,620
I memorized the recipe.

492
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,150
It'd be fun to bake some with you.

493
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,730
Why don't we do it next time
instead of today?

494
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,830
You'll need the ingredients
to bake cookies,

495
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,200
and it'll take a while,
so maybe next time. Okay?

496
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,900
This is a present for you, Bo Ram.

497
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,140
It's your favorite stuffed animal.

498
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,910
Gosh, thank you.

499
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,010
This is it.

500
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
I should've given it to you
a while ago, but I forgot.

501
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,690
I had forgotten, too.

502
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,620
You can take your time.
I'll be outside.

503
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,430
I am not backing down like this!

504
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,460
No.

505
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,130
My daughter. Jae In... No...

506
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,000
No...

507
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,080
No, you punk! Give it back!

508
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,790
You. No.

509
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,590
My daughter. Jae In... No...

510
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,660
No...

511
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,670
(Queen's House)

512
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,870
At home,

513
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,080
- there is...
- No. Dad!

514
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,580
Jae In!

515
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,380
I thought of you
when I built this house.

516
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,650
You're the rightful owner
of this house.

517
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,250
He came to see me
a few days before he passed away.

518
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,490
He must've found out something
and began to be suspicious.

519
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,390
Jae In and I are complete opposites,

520
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,330
so I won't sit around
and take this like an idiot.

521
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,960
Get out of here, you punk.

522
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,060
Drag out this outsider now.

523
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,830
Let go of me. Let go!

524
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,800
Gi Chan was the one who killed Dad.

525
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,000
Who killed whom?

526
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,600
Gi Chan,
I will rip you into pieces...

527
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,840
and take your life.
