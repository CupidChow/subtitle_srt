1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,990
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,290
(Daddy, Eun Ho loves you so much.
I love you!)

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,530
Daddy, Eun Ho loves you so much.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,400
Have you caught the culprit?

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,740
I'm an expert at finding people.
Should I look into it?

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,670
Hey. The police will manage,

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,080
so stop talking nonsense and leave.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,150
(Daddy, Eun Ho loves you so much.
I love you!)

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,320
Did you two...

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,220
kill my son?

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,760
Well, Mr. Chairman.

15
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,200
Please hear me out first. I...

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,800
Tell me. Was it you?

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,370
Did you do it?

18
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,270
You're trying to kill me.

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,440
Honey, you have to stop.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,540
Let go of him.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,680
Tell me now!

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,150
She made me do it.

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,310
Stop talking nonsense!

24
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,830
Honey, it wasn't me.

25
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,030
I didn't do it.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,260
I mean it.

27
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,130
It was him. I'm serious.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,500
Se Ri.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,740
Se Ri.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,570
Kang Se Ri!

31
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,430
Honey.

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm sorry. What I did was wrong.

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,400
- Get out.
- I can explain everything.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,670
Please hear me out.

35
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't want to hear anything,
so get out of here. Now!

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,810
Honey, I wasn't trying
to kill Eun Ho.

37
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,610
I loved him as much as you did.

38
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,080
I didn't give birth to him,

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,680
but he was Ji Ho's older brother,

40
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,180
so I thought of him as my own.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,620
- Shut your mouth!
- It's all Jae In's fault!

42
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,020
Jae In killed him!

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,660
I hated how Jae In
kept getting in your way.

44
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,730
I wanted to get rid of her
and remove her from your future.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,630
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Mr. Hong.

46
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,040
Check and see if I wanted Jae In
or Eun Ho dead.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,070
I really had no idea
Eun Ho would go there.

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,880
I wasn't planning to let him go,

49
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,650
and I never told him where she'd be.

50
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,850
You already saw on that day...

51
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,850
that I stopped him
from going to meet his mom.

52
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,550
Jae In must've called him out
without telling us.

53
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,860
Otherwise, how would he know
where to go?

54
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,460
Don't you think so?

55
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,830
What's going on?
What's with all the noise?

56
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,360
What's going on with you?

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
What did you do wrong this time?

58
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,300
My only sin is...

59
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,840
my love for you.

60
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,440
My sin is that
I tried to protect you.

61
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,680
That's my crime.

62
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,520
Mommy.

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,390
Honey, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

64
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

65
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,890
Mommy, stop crying.

66
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,860
Daddy, please forgive her.

67
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,630
She's saying she's sorry.

68
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,440
Please forgive her, Daddy.

69
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,010
- Mommy!
- I'm sorry, Ji Ho.

70
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,210
Don't cry.

71
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,410
- Mommy!
- I'm sorry, Ji Ho.

72
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,920
Mommy...

73
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,650
Goodness.

74
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,820
The sound of them crying is
making my head hurt.

75
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,390
What did she do so wrong...

76
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,990
to make a huge scene like that?

77
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,460
My head hurts.

78
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,160
Goodness. My entire body aches.

79
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,170
I might end up passing away first.

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
No way.

81
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,410
Life is always better than death.

82
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
I can't leave
this huge mansion behind and die.

83
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,910
I need to eat well
and pull myself together.

84
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,460
You should get some rest.

85
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,660
Thank you.

86
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,530
Thank you for letting me
go see Eun Ho.

87
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,640
Stay strong.

88
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,330
Eun Ho.

89
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,180
Goodness, my head hurts.

90
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,210
My gosh. Are you all right?

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,950
I'm sorry. I don't think I can walk.

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Let me help you. This way, please.

93
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,490
Be careful. This way.

94
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,390
You should sit down.

95
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,660
Good.

96
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,670
Wait.

97
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,900
You should have some water.

98
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,140
You have very warm hands.

99
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,980
Are you sure
you won't have to see a doctor?

100
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,220
My condition is untreatable.

101
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,460
I have a broken heart.

102
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,590
I lost someone I loved.

103
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,830
Did her husband pass away?

104
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,800
This reminds me of the time
when my brother-in-law passed.

105
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,870
I may not fully understand
how you feel,

106
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,040
but please stay strong.

107
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,480
You're such a kind person.

108
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,450
Why does everyone have to pass away?

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,640
She told me to make sure...

110
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,180
Kang Jae In doesn't get involved
with you anymore, not Hwang Eun Ho.

111
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,220
We were heartbroken about your son
because we didn't expect him...

112
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,620
to get into the situation
so abruptly.

113
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,260
Eun Ho, when we meet again later,

114
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,730
I'll beg you for forgiveness
and fall into the pit of fire.

115
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,270
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,680
Did you confirm the fact
with Mr. Hong?

117
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,680
Did you not do it?

118
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,250
Let me confirm it for you
if you still don't believe me.

119
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,260
Do not ever forge a scheme again
without telling me.

120
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,930
This is my warning.

121
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,340
(Witness needed!)

122
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,210
Please read this.

123
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,810
Hello, I'm sorry to bother you.

124
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,780
Can you please read this and...

125
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,360
Hello?

126
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,930
(YL Planning and Design)

127
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,570
Aunt Mi Ran wanted to see me.

128
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,640
Is she in her office?

129
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,250
Yes.

130
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,190
You're here.

131
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,100
Have a seat.

132
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,410
You don't look well.

133
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,650
Are you doing okay?

134
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,520
You wanted to say something.

135
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,820
Go ahead.

136
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,920
We let Eun Ho pass away in peace.

137
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,120
Gi Chan told me
not to tell you anything,

138
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,030
but I thought
you should know as his mom.

139
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,230
It must've been hard.

140
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,970
If that's all you have to say,
I'm leaving.

141
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,470
Here.

142
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,640
Take this.

143
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,510
You should...

144
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,050
find an apartment unit
where you can stay comfortably.

145
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,650
I don't need it.

146
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,120
Think of it
as a token of consolation.

147
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,790
You even lost Eun Ho,
so everything must've been hard.

148
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,590
This is all I can do for you.

149
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,090
A token of consolation?

150
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,230
Are you telling me
to live in comfort...

151
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,260
with the money I got
in exchange for Eun Ho's life?

152
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,630
Why do you take this
in such a twisted way?

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,970
You're my niece, too.
Of course, I'm worried about you.

154
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,270
This wouldn't have happened
if you chose me at the general meeting.

155
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,140
If you had,
Eun Ho wouldn't have died.

156
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,380
I understand how you feel
better than anyone.

157
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,550
I understand.

158
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,980
But you need to think rationally.

159
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,920
No, you couldn't understand.

160
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,590
How could you know how I feel?

161
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,190
I resent you so much,

162
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,730
and I despise Seung Woo, too.

163
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,790
How can you two...

164
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,560
side with Gi Chan
and throw me to my rock bottom?

165
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,830
Would you believe me
if I had to do that...

166
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,970
for YL Group and Seung Woo?

167
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,610
So, you didn't care about me.

168
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,910
How does this make us family?

169
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,540
We can't be called family.

170
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,210
I'm not your family anyway.

171
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,350
Stay out of this.

172
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,150
Why? Because I'm not your family?

173
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,550
That's enough, Seung Woo.

174
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,460
Did you think it was unfair
that Aunt Mi Ran sided with me?

175
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,220
Did you feel this was unfair?
Things were worse for me.

176
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,760
Did you forget
what your mother did to me?

177
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,330
She tried to make me a murderer!

178
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,000
That's the kind of family
you're talking about!

179
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,010
Jae In.

180
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,910
What do you think you're doing?

181
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,310
How dare you slap him?

182
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,350
Are you all right?

183
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,220
- Seung Woo.
- You and your mother are the same!

184
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,520
You two always blame others
whenever something goes wrong.

185
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,660
Did you say Eun Ho died
because I sided with Chairman Hwang?

186
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,330
Jae In,
let's set the record straight.

187
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,900
You killed Eun Ho.

188
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,570
You said you wanted to meet him.

189
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,870
How dare you blame others?

190
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,670
If you want to blame anyone,
blame and resent yourself.

191
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,110
That's what mothers do.

192
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,180
I did the same.

193
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,180
I resented and blamed myself
my entire life.

194
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,990
I thought that was the only way
my son would be happy and held out,

195
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,460
but your mother was
such a cruel woman.

196
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,790
Do not lay a hand on Seung Woo.

197
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,430
He is...

198
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,900
my son.

199
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,170
Do you get it now?

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,570
Do you understand
why I resent your mother so much?

201
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,810
I...

202
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,480
had to abandon my love and my son...

203
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,750
to protect YL Group.

204
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,380
And this is all I was left with!

205
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,420
Did Dad know about this?

206
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,190
Why? Are you going to tell your mom?

207
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,460
Even if she found out,
she'd only resent your father more.

208
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,530
Seung Woo doesn't know anything.

209
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,800
Keep it a secret...

210
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,400
until the day I tell him.

211
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,870
If you feel
even a bit sorry for him,

212
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,180
do not put him in bigger shock.

213
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,480
But if you must tell him, go ahead.
I can't stop you.

214
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,650
However,

215
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,420
if Seung Woo gets hurt in any way,

216
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,660
I won't sit around and let you live.

217
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,790
Do you understand?

218
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,920
Why are you here?

219
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,220
What kind of nonsense
are you trying to assert?

220
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,350
You may hate me to death,

221
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,420
but how can you return
my kindness with evil?

222
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,230
What's wrong with her?

223
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,810
I don't think I heard you right.

224
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,470
You need to debrief me again.

225
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,140
Debrief you?

226
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,910
If you want to hear it again,
I will say it again.

227
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,720
In a nutshell,

228
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,750
I'd like to buy out
half of your shares...

229
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,250
at a dirt-cheap price.

230
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,890
And I'll take the gallery, too.

231
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,530
Those are my terms.

232
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,130
How shameless.

233
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,200
Are you out of your mind?

234
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,700
Was that too modest?

235
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,970
Give me everything you own.

236
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,380
How dare you act up like this
out of line?

237
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,440
A petty man like you
cannot dare to want YL Group.

238
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,680
Everything I own? Half of my shares?

239
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,890
This is the problem with the needy.

240
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,420
Know your place first
before you show your ambition.

241
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,020
You must know your place
to take only what you can.

242
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,160
You should calm down.

243
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,860
It's an awful sight.

244
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,860
You seem crude and vulgar.

245
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,930
What did you say?

246
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,740
Mother. No.

247
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,810
I shouldn't call you that anymore.

248
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,240
I left the Kangs,
the family I loathed so much,

249
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,480
and got a fresh start.

250
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,050
You locked my daughter up
at a mental institution...

251
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,750
and got remarried
as soon as you divorced her?

252
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,150
You're filthy.

253
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,260
That was unexpected.

254
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
I thought you'd be happy...

255
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,790
to lose an eyesore like me.

256
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,200
The family dog may act like the homeowner
when they're gone,

257
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,960
but the dog will always be a dog.

258
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,140
Ms. Choi Ja Young,
I thought you wanted to get out.

259
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,670
Do you want to spend
a long time in this ditch?

260
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,410
The man who can decide your fate is
sitting in front of you.

261
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,080
Will you continue to speak
with such disrespect?

262
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,590
Have you finally learned your place?

263
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,890
How much ransom
do you want to pay for yourself?

264
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
I thought you were worth
at least that much.

265
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,900
If you aren't, never mind.

266
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,000
You can turn it down if you want to.

267
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,840
I don't care.

268
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,110
Then, I believe
our deal has fallen through.

269
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,780
Please excuse me.

270
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,150
Wait.

271
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,330
(Jungnam Detention Center)

272
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,040
There's not even one person
who came to see me.

273
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,050
Attorney Seo, didn't you hear
about my release today?

274
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,950
You have to be
at an important trial?

275
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,590
I'm hanging up.

276
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,090
How is some trial
more important than my release?

277
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,660
I should find a chance
to get a new attorney.

278
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,400
I don't even have a car.

279
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,870
Where can I grab a taxi?

280
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,870
Open the door. What are you doing?

281
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,240
Open the door!

282
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,050
Who's here this early?
What's with the noise?

283
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,920
Mom. This is really bad.

284
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,090
Why? What? What's going on?

285
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,930
Well, she's here.

286
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,830
She came here. Right here.

287
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,960
Right here? What?

288
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,760
Why are you suddenly out of breath?

289
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,570
The owner of this house is here.

290
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,200
What an idiot.

291
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,900
Are you still asleep?

292
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,210
Who do you think owns this place?
It's me.

293
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,570
No, I mean...

294
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,680
Why isn't everyone
coming out to see me...

295
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,810
as soon as I walk in?

296
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,950
She should be in prison.
Why is she here?

297
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,380
She must've broken out.

298
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,890
Why are you people in my home?

299
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,720
Get out. Get out of here!

300
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,790
Butler Lee! Where are you, Lee?

301
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,460
Wait.

302
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,730
This is my house.
Why should I lose my spirit?

303
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,900
This is my house.

304
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,500
How dare you tell me to leave?

305
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,240
Get out of my house now!

306
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,510
Your house?

307
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,010
Yes, it's my house.

308
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,340
I paid my money to buy this house.

309
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,380
- Isn't that so?
- She's right!

310
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,950
We bought the place.

311
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,990
What kind of a scheme
did you devise while I was gone?

312
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,190
We even lost our home
to these petty...

313
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,020
and lowly beggars?

314
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,130
I can't stand this anymore.

315
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,900
How dare a murderer like you
call us lowly beggars?

316
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,460
Did you say we were petty?

317
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,900
I don't care what you say.

318
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,800
You're just a murderer.

319
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,870
Shut your mouth!

320
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,500
How dare you speak to me...

321
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,740
No, you shut your mouth.
Zip your mouth!

322
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Calm down, Mom.

323
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,650
That felt so nice.
It took a load off my chest.

324
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,250
Hey, woman.

325
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,650
You can't win against me
in an argument.

326
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,750
What's so good about you anyway?

327
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,350
Let's be frank.
All you ever did was...

328
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,890
live in good wealth...

329
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,130
thanks to your rich family
and husband!

330
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,430
I was always appalled...

331
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,530
whenever you acted like
you were so high and mighty.

332
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,870
How ridiculous.
You're just a murderer.

333
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,870
My gosh!

334
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,410
Mom! Mom, please!

335
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,810
Ms. Choi, please stop!

336
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,280
- Mom, please stop.
- Get out of my way.

337
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,010
- Come over here.
- You need to stop!

338
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,080
- You.
- You have to stop.

339
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,320
Stop it!

340
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,220
- Stop it.
- Stop that and call the police!

341
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,760
Tell them that a murderer
broke out of jail!

342
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,960
- Hey, you.
- Mom, you have to stop.

343
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,660
- You have to stop.
- Let go of me!

344
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,030
No, you have to stop.

345
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,830
- Get your hands off me!
- Calm down.

346
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,100
- Let go of me!
- No.

347
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,940
Hey! Where are you going?
Get back here!

348
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,670
Mom, you need to stop. Mom!

349
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,840
Mom, you won.

350
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,410
- I did?
- Yes.

351
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,610
Bring some salt.
I have to cleanse this place.

352
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,280
- Okay.
- Darn it.

353
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,920
Hello.

354
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,490
No, you can't go in.

355
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,990
You can't... Gi Chan!

356
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,840
Are you here to thank me?

357
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,400
I'll give you money,
so get out of my house.

358
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,770
How much do you want?

359
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,110
I don't want to sell it.

360
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,940
Find another place.

361
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,880
- How much do you want?
- One billion dollars.

362
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,010
What did you say?

363
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,280
One billion dollars.

364
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,550
If you want that house so much,

365
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,420
bring me a billion dollars.

366
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,090
What I regret the most is failing
to pull you away from Jae In.

367
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,290
At the very least,
dogs never bite their owners.

368
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,360
You're worse than dogs.

369
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,000
You never treated me
like I was human anyway.

370
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,940
You're here to lash out at me
even after I saved your life.

371
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,270
You need to leave
if you're done talking.

372
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,240
Tell the guard to come upstairs.

373
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,510
Fate has its eyes on you.

374
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,110
And the eyes aren't just on me.

375
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,650
It's on you, too, Ms. Choi Ja Young.

376
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,120
You killed Ms. Kim Do Hee.

377
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,920
The guard will be here soon.

378
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,860
What do you want to do?

379
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,460
Do you want to get dragged out
or walk out elegantly?

380
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,140
And she remains elegant
until the very end.

381
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,280
Come in.

382
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,450
Dr. Kim.

383
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,660
I wanted to give you cookies
I baked through the night.

384
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,160
Ta-da. Surprise.

385
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,560
"Homemade Confectionery,
Wonderful Bakery?"

386
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,900
Darn it. I asked them to make these
look like they were homemade.

387
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,470
Hwang Gi Chan's sister, Hwang Na Ra.

388
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,180
She'll be useful someday
if I keep her around.

389
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,280
It's all right
if you didn't bake these.

390
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,480
What I find endearing is
that you thought of me.

391
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,880
Thanks.

392
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,280
You found me endearing?

393
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,760
- Try some.
- Okay.

394
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,080
Hello.

395
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,150
Dad?

396
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,190
What are you doing here?

397
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,190
What's with that apron?

398
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,860
Well, it's...

399
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,260
- I was just helping out.
- Father, what's for lunch today...

400
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,360
My gosh.

401
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,530
Honey, why did you
suddenly show up here...

402
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,900
at this hour?

403
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,140
Wait, did she find out
you were working here part-time?

404
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,740
You need to shut your mouth.

405
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,880
Dad, did you get a part-time job?

406
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,080
Well, I'm doing it for fun.

407
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,510
It's not even that.

408
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,750
I took it up
because I was just too bored.

409
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,590
What?

410
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,720
Hello.

411
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,290
We'll talk later.

412
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,630
Honey, let's go outside.

413
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,800
- Let go of me.
- He wants to talk later.

414
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,230
There are customers here. Let's go.

415
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,330
You can talk later.

416
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,570
Come on inside. Let's talk here.

417
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,640
When did you find out?

418
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,770
I found out only recently.

419
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,980
He made sure I stayed quiet.

420
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,180
I'm his only daughter.

421
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,980
How can you hide it from me?

422
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,950
He asked me to stay quiet.

423
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,750
I had to listen to him.
What other choice do I have?

424
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,090
Have you always been
so obedient to your elders?

425
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,120
If you were like that,
why did you whine to your mother...

426
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,630
that you didn't want
to run this business?

427
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,300
Why are you taking things that far?

428
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm his only daughter,

429
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,530
which means
you're his only son-in-law.

430
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,240
Didn't it break your heart
to see my dad doing such hard labor?

431
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,140
Did you just stand around watching?

432
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,410
Yes, so that was why I went over
to eat lunch with him.

433
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,580
I had been looking after him.

434
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,880
Don't you know about the things
I do for your family?

435
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,450
But it wasn't like
I made him get a part-time job.

436
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,190
Honestly speaking, I'm here
touching pig's feet to make money.

437
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,090
Why isn't he
allowed to work that job?

438
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,290
People take up jobs like those
when they get older.

439
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,000
Is that all you have to say?

440
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,260
All right. Fine. Let's stop.

441
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,430
I'm sorry for everything.

442
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,830
I understand how you feel.

443
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,640
No, Gi Man.

444
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,840
You don't understand anything.

445
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,340
Honey!

446
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,250
Fine. Everyone thinks I'm a joke.

447
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,160
I'll go with you.
I want to help out today.

448
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,360
No, it's all right.
You must be busy. I'm fine.

449
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,830
No, I want to help out when I can.

450
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,430
That was why I skipped work.

451
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
Thank you, Ms. Jung.

452
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,810
Let me just grab my jacket.

453
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,350
Hello?

454
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,220
What? Really?

455
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,490
Did you really catch the culprit?

456
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,400
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

457
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
The culprit turned himself in?

458
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,600
What do you mean?

459
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,210
He gave me a call
and went to the police station.

460
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,820
Where is he?

461
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,020
Where's the culprit
who killed Eun Ho?

462
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,220
Was it really you?

463
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,360
Did you kill...

464
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,730
my son, my dear Eun Ho?

465
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,530
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,200
Bring him back!

467
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,870
Bring back my son! Bring him back!

468
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,580
Bring him back!

469
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,280
Bring back my son!

470
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,580
Eun Ho! Bring him back!

471
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,720
Bring him back!

472
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,920
He said he'd take the blame
and get punished.

473
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,660
Eun Ho!

474
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,030
- Bring him back!
- I'm Eun Ho's father.

475
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,000
Gi Chan, it's him.

476
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,200
He killed Eun Ho.

477
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,110
I heard he turned himself in.

478
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,980
But this won't bring
my dead son back.

479
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,550
I don't plan to forgive him
or settle the case.

480
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,620
Please investigate thoroughly
and punish him properly...

481
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,850
under the power of the law.

482
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,390
Yes, we'll do that.

483
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,660
Come out.

484
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
I'll handle everything here,
so you need to go.

485
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,130
No, I want to listen...

486
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,530
to what he has to say.

487
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
You have no right
to meddle with this.

488
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,810
He may have killed Eun Ho,

489
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,570
but you were also the cause.

490
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,780
Why did you call Eun Ho out?

491
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,250
He wouldn't have died...

492
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,880
if you didn't call him out
on that day.

493
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,350
It doesn't matter
how that punk gets punished.

494
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,990
You need to spend your life
atoning for what you did.

495
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,110
Don't just stand there. Sit.

496
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,010
What happened?

497
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,450
"What happened?"
That's what I want to ask.

498
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,920
What happened while I was gone?

499
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,430
How did our Changpyeong-dong home
go to those petty beggars?

500
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,190
What happened?

501
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,960
I sold it...

502
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,000
to pay off the inheritance tax.

503
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,670
And you chose to sell it to them?

504
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,170
They sent a proxy,
so I had no idea, either.

505
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,970
What about Attorney Seo?

506
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,780
Why didn't you make use of him?

507
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,250
You even lost our home
because of your stupidity.

508
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,050
Why couldn't you notice?

509
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,420
That's why
the worst happened to Eun Ho!

510
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,160
I heard Gi Chan got remarried.
Who's the woman?

511
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,260
Why won't you say anything?

512
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,630
Mom.

513
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,400
Eun Ho died.

514
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,800
Everyone knows that.

515
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,870
How can you lose your child
and let that happen?

516
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,740
Yes, it's all my fault.

517
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,810
My stupidity...

518
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,840
and idiocy killed Eun Ho.

519
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,080
But Mom, you can't say that to me.

520
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,920
You're my mom.

521
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,990
Can't you comfort me
in times like these?

522
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,660
Who do you think
I lived for to this day?

523
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,990
It was you.
I put up with everything because of you.

524
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,730
So, why are you in this mess?

525
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,770
I had no idea you were this stupid.

526
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,040
Where are you going?

527
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,440
I'm not done talking to you!

528
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,050
Kang Gyu Cheol, you jerk.

529
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,750
Why did you pass away so early
and make a mess out of my family?

530
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,580
Eun Ho died because of you.

531
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,680
You're a murderer.

532
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,050
You're my son's murderer!

533
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,780
Bring him back!

534
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,290
You killed him. It was you!

535
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,160
You should've thrown yourself
and saved him if you were his mom.

536
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,030
You should've died
instead of my grandson!

537
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,130
Why didn't you do that?

538
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,950
You killed Eun Ho.

539
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,990
It doesn't matter
how that punk gets punished.

540
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,520
You need to spend your life
atoning for what you did.

541
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,120
You said you wanted to meet him.

542
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,420
How dare you blame others?

543
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,330
That's why
the worst happened to Eun Ho!

544
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,030
He wouldn't have died
if you didn't call him out on that day.

545
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,830
If you want to blame anyone,
blame and resent yourself.

546
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,200
That's what mothers do.

547
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,140
(Queen's House)

548
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,540
You're still at work?

549
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,450
I want to prove
my competence to Jae In.

550
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,550
I was already questioned
more than enough...

551
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,620
when I got framed as the culprit.

552
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,920
You know who Jae In is.
How can you do this?

553
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,220
It wasn't her fault.

554
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,960
She wouldn't feel lonely.

555
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,360
Have you finally
come to your senses...

556
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,020
now that you see me out here?

557
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,530
I made that choice on my own...

558
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,960
in my clear mind.

559
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,470
I cannot let my sister-in-law
covet after YL Group.

560
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,030
I'll make sure...

561
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
neither you nor Kang Seung Woo
can ever lay a finger on YL Group.

562
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,770
Just wait, Hwang Gi Chan.

563
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,440
I'll pull you down
with my hands very soon.
