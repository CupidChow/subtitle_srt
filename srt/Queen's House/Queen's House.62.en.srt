00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,230
Jae In.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,900
Jae In.

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,330
I was worried sick about you.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,600
Thank you.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,140
Thank you for waking up, Jae In.

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,820
Who are you?

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,220
(Episode 62)

11
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,530
Do you know your name?

12
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,330
It's Kang Jae In.

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,530
Do you know what day it is today?

14
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,470
Wednesday...

15
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,270
Friday?

16
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,810
I'm not too sure.

17
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,880
Do you know today's date?

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,220
The year is 2018.

19
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,660
And it's January...

20
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,590
January...

21
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:33,160
Do you recognize this man
next to me?

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,540
No. I don't.

23
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,340
More importantly,

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,610
is the baby okay?

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,020
The baby I'm carrying.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,120
It's okay, right, Doctor?

27
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,320
Jae In.

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,830
Do you not remember anything?

29
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,330
It's not 2018 right now. It's 2025.

30
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,540
I don't know.

31
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,470
I really don't know.

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,540
Doctor.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,110
Is it true...

34
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,550
what that man said?

35
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,020
She needs a thorough examination.

36
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,300
Jae In.

37
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,030
Jae In.

38
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,000
Jae In...

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,300
Se Ri's high school classmate?

40
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,480
In short, that woman is currently married
to YL Group's chairman...

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,550
and Kang Jae In's
high school classmate?

42
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,180
That's right.

43
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,250
Do Yun said that...

44
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,050
Do Hee had been wrongly accused
of having an affair...

45
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,320
with Choi Ja Young's son-in-law.

46
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,990
Maybe she took the blame
in that woman's stead.

47
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,530
I'm not certain.

48
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,300
But I personally believe so.

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,610
This world is truly full of humans
who are no better than beasts.

50
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,880
Listen. Don't try to confront...

51
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,280
Kang Se Ri yourself.

52
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,250
As someone far more evil than you realize,
she's unpredictable.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
(Approval Request)

54
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,640
Why are you in here?

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,210
Director Kang isn't here.

56
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,270
I thought she was here.

57
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,040
What's Director Kang's schedule today?
She's not answering my calls.

58
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,710
She took her monthly leave.

59
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,090
What are you daydreaming for?

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,290
Are you going to stay
in this empty room?

61
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,290
You really know
how to say things so nicely.

62
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,000
Such a sweet talker, aren't you?

63
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,970
What is he? A pervert?

64
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,410
She's suffering from RA.
Retrograde amnesia.

65
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,310
As you already know,
forcing her to recall things...

66
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,780
won't do her any good.

67
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,120
Her automatic self-defense system
was triggered.

68
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,650
It's an unconscious way
of blocking out painful memories.

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,190
Considering she lost eight years
of recent memories,

70
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,130
she went back to the days when
she felt the safest and happiest.

71
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,670
Her brain instinctively paused
her memories to protect itself.

72
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,830
What now?

73
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,870
I know it's obvious,

74
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,340
but time is the cure.

75
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,310
With enough rest,
her memories will return to her.

76
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,510
Right now, her stability
is the most important thing.

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,350
Give her time.

78
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,950
Please move.

79
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,450
Why are you doing this to me?

80
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,060
Please calm down, miss.

81
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,360
You need absolute rest.

82
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,360
What is it? What's going on?

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
Where's my husband?

84
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,530
Were we both in the accident?

85
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,430
Your husband?

86
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,600
Yes. Since he hasn't shown up yet,

87
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,710
it must mean he's injured too.

88
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,240
You know who my husband is, right?

89
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,250
Please take me to him.

90
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,650
I miss him.

91
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,780
Please help me. I beg you.

92
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Is that what you really wish?

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,220
Is the man
you really need right now...

94
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,130
Hwang Gi Chan?

95
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,800
Yes.

96
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,830
So where's my husband?

97
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,450
This is Hwang Gi Chan.

98
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,920
Hello?

99
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,720
It's me, honey. It's Jae In.

100
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,460
Hello?

101
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,490
Honey.

102
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,660
Kang Jae In?

103
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,070
Hello?

104
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,650
Honey.

105
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm sorry, honey. It's all my fault.

107
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,840
Our dear Chukbok.

108
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,640
Chukbok is...

109
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,910
"Chukbok?"

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,320
The baby died before having
a chance to see the world.

111
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,660
Had I not been involved
in the accident...

112
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,930
You were over the moon.

113
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,460
You were worried about me...

114
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,600
and Chukbok every single day.

115
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm sorry, honey.

116
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,060
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,800
Have you lost your mind?

118
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,800
Do you realize what you've done?

119
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,100
How could you lie
and say she was dead?

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,510
I simply wanted to protect her
until she gained consciousness.

121
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,140
That was for the best.

122
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,710
And so, you held a funeral
for someone alive?

123
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,250
To protect her?

124
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,880
Who do you think you are?

125
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,750
Who do you think you are
to want to protect her?

126
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,720
All I want is for Jae In
not to get hurt.

127
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,290
Is that so wrong?

128
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,530
Are you saying she should've died?

129
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,970
I didn't want to contact you either.

130
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,700
But Jae In wanted me to do it.

131
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,270
More accurately, Jae In from
eight years ago wanted me to do it.

132
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,610
"Eight years ago?"

133
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,480
Jae In...

134
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,280
lost her memories
from that accident.

135
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,300
Jae In's memory stopped
at eight years ago.

136
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,830
She can't remember anything
that happened after that.

137
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,740
You expect me to believe that?

138
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,440
Ask her doctor.

139
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,110
She even got an MRI, CT,

140
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,450
psychological,
and neurological examination,

141
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,850
so check her diagnosis too.

142
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,520
Her doctor said those were...

143
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,490
her safest and happiest moments in life.

144
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,660
Her memories most likely stopped
in the past to escape...

145
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,400
this nightmare-like reality.

146
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,470
I'm dying to tell her
what a shameless man you are.

147
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,740
But Jae In won't believe my words.

148
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,780
Chukbok.

149
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,180
"Chukbok?"

150
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,350
Eun Ho.

151
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,720
Hwang Eun Ho.

152
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,020
It was my son's nickname.

153
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,900
What's wrong, Bo Ram?

154
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,700
I miss Ms. Kang.

155
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,810
Drawing with her was so much fun.

156
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,910
Grandma. Can't I go meet her?

157
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,850
Bo Ram.

158
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,520
Can you sort this dry laundry
and put it in the drawers?

159
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,590
- You can do it, right?
- Yes.

160
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,030
I'm back, Yun Hee.

161
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,870
Welcome home. What about dinner?

162
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,170
I had a quick one. Where's Do Yun?

163
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,770
Looks like he'll be late
without telling me.

164
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
Have you talked with Do Yun yet?

165
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,140
I did. He's all right.

166
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,350
Play innocent,
and give him some time.

167
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,850
What happened to Jae In
shocked me too.

168
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,620
He likely had it worse,

169
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,750
having witnessed the accident firsthand.

170
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,060
What an ill-fated relationship,
and that includes Choi Ja Young.

171
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,130
Why? Did something happen?

172
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,170
There's no need for you to know.

173
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:40,400
Besides that, I saw the wife
of YL Group's chairman.

174
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,540
Apparently, she's Kang Jae In's friend.
Is that true?

175
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,610
Yes. Where did you see her and how?

176
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,850
Was that woman behind
Do Hee's incident?

177
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,250
I'm talking about
the false accusation.

178
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,020
I'm on the same page as you.

179
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,490
But there's no clear evidence.

180
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,060
It's under investigation.
Something will definitely come up.

181
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,830
If, and I'm only saying if.

182
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,740
If that woman was the cause,
I won't let it slide.

183
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,870
I'll make her pay.

184
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,680
Tell me the moment
you know something.

185
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,310
Don't try to fool me.

186
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,510
I won't.

187
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,760
Weren't you in your study?

188
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,230
Kang Jae In is alive.

189
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,600
Did you have a dream?

190
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,300
Don't say that even as a joke.

191
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,980
Kang Jae In. She's really alive?

192
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,110
How do you know that?

193
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,050
I just came back from the hospital.

194
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,220
Kim Do Yun was hiding her all along.

195
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,290
What do we do now?

196
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,890
If Jae In finds out...

197
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,860
No. She won't know I was behind it.

198
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,730
Pretend like you know nothing.

199
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,900
Tell her you know nothing, got it?

200
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,000
Honey. Why aren't you answering me?

201
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,640
Kang Jae In.

202
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,310
She has amnesia.

203
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,610
"Amnesia?"

204
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,050
Does that mean
she remembers nothing?

205
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,850
Even the fact that
you were in an accident?

206
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,520
No.

207
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,720
Her memories stop
at eight years ago.

208
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,990
She thinks I'm still her husband.

209
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,420
Unbelievable. That's nonsense!

210
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,730
Isn't Kang Jae In deceiving us?

211
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,170
I clearly heard something.

212
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,340
Was it from downstairs?

213
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,440
More importantly,
I must go and confirm it.

214
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,250
Don't.
What good would your visit do?

215
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,880
I must know whether she's faking
her memory loss or not.

216
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,180
I'll be the one to confirm it.

217
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,590
I'll ask for a re-examination.
Now stay away from the hospital.

218
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,090
Honey.
Kang Jae In might be fooling you.

219
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,620
Jae In is alive?

220
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,350
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

221
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,850
I visited the hospital
and confirmed it last night.

222
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,590
Was it really my sister?
Was she Jae In?

223
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,300
That's right. DH Holdings'
Chief Director Kim Do Yun...

224
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,600
was deceiving us all.

225
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,570
Despite knowing she's alive,

226
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,770
he made it look like she was dead.

227
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,310
Why...

228
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,010
Why on earth did he do that?

229
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,410
I don't know.

230
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,780
But more importantly,
it's Jae In's condition.

231
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,590
What is it?
Is she in critical condition?

232
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,290
(Chief Director Kim Do Yun)

233
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,560
The least you could've done
was tell me.

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,300
Who were you to declare Jae In dead
when she was still alive?

235
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,870
Who did you think you were?

236
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,810
And who do you think you are?

237
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,750
What?

238
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,950
When Jae In was dragged
to a mental institution.

239
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,090
When she wanted to sell her entire fortune
to get the company back.

240
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,720
When she lost everything
and had nowhere to go.

241
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,590
When she was breaking down
after losing her only child.

242
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,930
Where were you?
And what were you doing?

243
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,930
Well...

244
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,600
From what I saw,
you didn't seem fit...

245
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,670
to protect Jae In.
That's why I made that decision.

246
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,570
You know nothing
to run your mouth like that!

247
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,110
From now on, I will protect Jae In.

248
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,040
Don't you dare act cheeky.

249
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,820
Do Yun.
Was everything I heard outside true?

250
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,860
Is Kang Jae In alive?

251
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,460
Yes. She's alive.

252
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,490
And that's it?

253
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,730
How and what did you do?

254
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,830
Later, Uncle.

255
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,230
Let's talk at home.

256
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,640
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

257
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,620
Did you know about it?

258
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,820
That Jae In was alive?

259
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,720
I just heard about it.
I'm bewildered.

260
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,430
What was
Chief Director Kim thinking,

261
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,530
pulling such a stunt?

262
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,160
Although we're family,
I don't fully understand him.

263
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,600
I've got to hear his story.

264
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,140
But no matter the reason, it must've been
the best decision for Jae In.

265
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,200
But still. How could he
even fool us, his family?

266
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,870
I don't blame you for being shocked.

267
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,240
But your niece,
whom we thought was dead, is alive.

268
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,910
What more is there to say?

269
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,380
If it were me, that alone would be plenty,
and I'd be grateful.

270
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,390
Enough. I won't nag
at Chief Director Kim.

271
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,990
Why are you here?

272
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,600
I was wondering
if you were feeling better.

273
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,330
Are you all right?

274
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,830
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

275
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,100
As you can tell, I'm fine.

276
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,440
I'm swamped.

277
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,080
Right. Keep working.

278
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,590
It came by express delivery
without a sender's name.

279
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,400
What if it's like that blackmail
from back then?

280
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,230
Gosh, I don't want to see it.

281
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,160
And were you
also the whistleblower...

282
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
for this recent corruption report?

283
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,930
It's a misunderstanding.

284
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,300
Why would I do that?

285
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,700
It wasn't Ms. Kim Do Hee,

286
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,140
but that designer, Ms. Kang Se Ri.

287
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,110
Your other woman.

288
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,610
Go ahead and make more excuses.

289
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,080
Do it!

290
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,070
When I asked the other doctors
at Kang Jae In's hospital...

291
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,200
and caretakers,

292
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,100
they told me she was in a coma.

293
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,670
She's not well enough
to be pulling a move like this.

294
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,040
Kim Do Yun.

295
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,410
It must be his doing.

296
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,590
Jae In!

297
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,130
You were shocked to hear
I woke up, weren't you?

298
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,900
I remember you
in your school uniform.

299
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,310
You've become a fine man.

300
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,880
Do you still get scolded by Dad
for not listening to him?

301
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,220
I will never leave you alone
from now on.

302
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,190
Trust me, okay?

303
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,560
All right. I'll trust you.

304
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,500
Aunt.

305
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,010
Don't tell me I made you fly
from the US despite being busy.

306
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,010
No, I'm working
at the head office now.

307
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,310
What? Really?

308
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,850
I'm getting pumped up.

309
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,450
That means I get to chat with you
in person all night long,

310
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,420
instead of through video calls.

311
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,230
Seeing Seung Woo and Aunt...

312
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,660
makes me want to go home
as soon as possible.

313
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,630
When will Mom and Dad come?

314
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,240
They're still busy with work, yes?

315
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,140
Jae In. You see... Listen.

316
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,710
Yes?

317
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,650
Seung Woo. There's no rush
with the rest of the talk.

318
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,120
Jae In should recover first.

319
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,330
So, in short, her memories
from the past eight years are gone?

320
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,600
Yes. I confirmed it myself.

321
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,040
If Jae In's accident
was intentional,

322
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,210
only a handful of people
could've done it.

323
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,540
Even Hwang Gi Chan is a suspect.

324
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,740
Was telling him about Jae In
the right thing to do?

325
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,480
Yun Hee?

326
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,860
Is she really alive?

327
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm sorry I couldn't tell...

328
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,270
both of you earlier.

329
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm fine as long as she's alive.

330
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,240
What will happen to Kang Jae In
from now on?

331
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
Doesn't she believe she's still
lovey-dovey with her ex-husband?

332
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,320
Even if that's
her current condition,

333
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,250
should you really be handing her over
to that family?

334
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,520
Her memories may be stuck
eight years in the past,

335
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,760
but that's what Jae In wants.

336
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,530
Director.

337
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,400
How is she?

338
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,740
The results,
from the basic re-exam...

339
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,540
to the neurological evaluation,

340
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,550
all point to amnesia.

341
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,320
Are you certain?

342
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,490
But there was no brain damage,
right?

343
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,820
You were there throughout her exams.

344
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,720
There are different causes
of amnesia.

345
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,560
And in many cases,
the causes are unidentifiable.

346
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,930
See it as a psychological trauma,

347
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,500
not a visible physical injury.

348
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,470
I would never lie to you
of all people,

349
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,440
would I?

350
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,010
Kang Jae In.

351
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,680
So you indeed lost your memories.

352
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,530
Get some rest.
The exams must've been tiresome.

353
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,160
Honey. Come closer.

354
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,150
When I woke up,

355
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,050
it was scary since
you weren't by my side.

356
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,290
But now that you're here,
I feel relieved.

357
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,300
I just want to go home.

358
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,260
It's stuffy in here.

359
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I don't want to stay away from you.

360
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,070
You may not know it,

361
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,610
but you were in the hospital
for a long time.

362
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,180
For almost eight years.

363
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,450
I know.

364
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,150
I was taken aback
when I checked the date.

365
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,290
That's all the more reason
I want to stay by your side.

366
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,690
I'm scared, honey.

367
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,670
We've done the health check.

368
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,070
But let's stay a few more days
before discharge.

369
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,210
I need to clean up the house
before you come home.

370
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,280
Okay?

371
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,680
Okay.

372
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,050
Two million dollars?

373
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,590
Yes. Invest around
two million dollars in me.

374
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,660
As the wife of YL Group's chairman,

375
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,560
I'm sure two million
isn't much at all.

376
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,660
Gi Man. I don't have any money.

377
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,860
I'll pretend you never asked.

378
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,770
My mom doesn't know...

379
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,870
you tried to kill Jae In, right?

380
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,340
What nonsense are you saying?

381
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,680
I tried to kill who?

382
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,010
I'm asking simply out of curiosity.

383
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,450
Why did you try to kill
Eun Ho's mom?

384
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,090
Gi Man. Watch your mouth.

385
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,020
I never tried to kill her.

386
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,320
I heard Jae In was alive.

387
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,600
I'll act like I didn't hear a thing,

388
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,430
so you'll invest two million dollars
in me. Good?

389
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,700
Goodness.
Welcome home, my dear chairman.

390
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,780
Take a seat, Mom.

391
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,410
Sit. You too, Gi Man.

392
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,960
What is it that you want to talk about?
You even have us gathered.

393
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,020
Chairman Hwang.
Did something good happen?

394
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,030
It's about Jae In.

395
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,130
- She's...
- Stop.

396
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,430
Don't bring up the dead.
It's creepy.

397
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,600
Move on to the next topic.

398
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,800
Eun Ho's mom is alive.

399
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,470
What? Oh, my gosh.

400
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,240
Gi Chan. Is Jae In alive?

401
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,350
Don't tell me she's a zombie
or something.

402
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,880
Hwang Na Ra. Quit watching movies.

403
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,450
Zombies don't exist.

404
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,490
What's a zombie?

405
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,220
Forget it.

406
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,490
She had her funeral already.
How can she be alive?

407
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,220
It's ridiculous.

408
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,200
Mom. Did Gi Chan ever lie to us?

409
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,700
Apparently, she's alive.

410
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,530
You quit lying and shut up.

411
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,270
She's currently at a hospital.

412
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,080
Are you saying she's actually alive?

413
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,850
It seems like it.

414
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,150
Goodness gracious.

415
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,720
My heart hurts. Calm down.

416
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,590
Good grief. I'm about to die first
from a heart attack.

417
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,760
She's really alive? Like, really?

418
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,870
What kind of nonsense is this?

419
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,400
The female lead
in that evening drama,

420
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,170
"In-Law's House,"
also has amnesia, right?

421
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,510
She rolled down the stairs because
her nasty mother-in-law pushed her.

422
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,380
Memory loss is a cliche
in a soap opera.

423
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,180
They usually recall everything
near the end.

424
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,020
Jae In will too with time.

425
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,820
But we're not in any soap opera,

426
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,660
so why do we keep
going through weird things?

427
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,990
Mom. We're no different.

428
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,660
Gi Chan fell in love
with Jae In's friend,

429
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,130
got a divorce, and married her.

430
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,600
Exactly.

431
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,070
Enough.

432
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,330
I didn't bring it up
so you could criticize me.

433
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,740
What is your point?

434
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,040
Jae In.

435
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,340
I need to bring her home.

436
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,680
What kind of nonsense is that?

437
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,050
Her memories are stuck
at eight years ago.

438
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,820
She doesn't know anything about
what happened after that.

439
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,730
Including our divorce...

440
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,430
and the birth of Eun Ho.

441
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,800
So what? That has nothing to do
with you now. You two are strangers.

442
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,070
Mother is right.

443
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,540
She's no longer family,
so why bring her here?

444
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,540
Right?
Stop acting like a kind husband.

445
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,540
You're going overboard, Gi Chan.

446
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,510
I'm impartial.

447
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,780
I'm not trying to get
your permission.

448
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,750
Everyone should just do as I say.

449
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,690
Okay, Mother?

450
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,690
Well, I have no other choice.

451
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,330
You're bringing Jae In
to this house...

452
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,440
without discussing it with me?

453
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,740
Let me make it clear.

454
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,810
Don't let her set foot
inside this house.

455
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,940
How about staying elsewhere
while Kang Jae In is here?

456
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,210
Are you telling me to move out?

457
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,280
Why should I? This is my house!

458
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,990
A partial recording
of when Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol died...

459
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,720
was delivered to me yesterday.

460
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,330
How does that even exist?

461
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,790
Who sent it?

462
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,060
If Kang Jae In
truly lost her memory,

463
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,370
it must've been Kim Do Yun.

464
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,470
Either way,
somebody has the evidence.

465
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,840
What's in the recording
that's frightening him?

466
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,380
The best thing to do is hold
Kang Jae In hostage...

467
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,710
and keep a close watch on her
by my side.

468
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,120
Couldn't it have been Gi Man?

469
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,320
Gi Man knew Kang Jae In was alive...

470
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,220
even before you told everyone.

471
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,090
What's more, he might even know
I was involved in that accident.

472
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,360
What do you mean by that?

473
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,900
I don't know the details either.

474
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,730
But he'll play innocent
if I invest two million dollars.

475
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,770
What? Gi Man said that?

476
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,470
Yes.
Investment was a nice way to put it.

477
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,970
It was nothing short of blackmail.

478
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,250
I'll take care of that matter.

479
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,050
Just do as I say for now.

480
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,120
It's all to save you.

481
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,190
You and I must both survive, right?

482
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,390
Fine.

483
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,130
(Gukil Jungang Hospital)

484
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,400
- Here's the prescription.
- Thank you.

485
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:09,970
You're the husband of Kang Jae In,
the patient being discharged, right?

486
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,140
This is what she was wearing
at the time of the accident.

487
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,850
I see. Thank you.

488
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,850
What's this memo?

489
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,350
(Home? 458-8, Changpyeong-dong)

490
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,590
"Home? Changpyeong-dong?"

491
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,160
"458-8?"

492
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:43,110
In other words, she only remembers
when I adored her...

493
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,240
and called her "Ms. Jae In,"

494
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,540
but nothing after that. Right?

495
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,080
Correct.

496
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,450
Mom. What do I call her?

497
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,850
Ex-sister... No. Leave the "ex" out.

498
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,520
"Welcome, sister-in-law."
Something like that?

499
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,090
I don't know either.

500
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,830
Shut your mouth
if you've got nothing to say.

501
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,060
Mother.

502
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,530
Mother.

503
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,700
Your daughter-in-law is here.

504
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,710
- Hi.
- Right.

505
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,600
(Queen's House)

506
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,170
It's really you, right, Jae In?

507
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,700
Yes. It's me, Yu Gyeong.

508
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,110
Jae In is alive,

509
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,510
but her memories stop
before Eun Ho was born?

510
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,540
It's hard to believe, right?

511
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,910
Thank you for keeping my house safe.

512
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,280
- Jae In.
- Hi, Mom.

513
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,880
"Mom?" Me?

514
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,050
It was going to be a surprise gift.

515
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,290
You thought you lost the baby
in the accident, right?

516
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,390
But you didn't.

517
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,990
Ji Ho.

518
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,700
Jae In. I need to see it
with my own eyes.

519
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,900
I vowed never to lose
anyone dear to me again.

520
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,470
I'm sorry I can't protect you.
