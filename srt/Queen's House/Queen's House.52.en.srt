1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,010
(Episode 52)

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,920
What did you do with your time?

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,620
I even stole her design
and gave it to you.

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,890
You should've improved on it!

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,360
You didn't change anything!

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,990
I feel wronged, too.

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,160
You already know
that wasn't my design.

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,800
It takes time to modify it
and make it look like mine.

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,630
Do you think
the creative process is that easy?

13
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,370
Jae In didn't even have enough time.

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,400
It makes no sense
that you made zero improvements...

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,070
compared to Jae In's new design.

16
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,870
Didn't you hear what I just said?

17
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,210
Both designs were
made by the same person.

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,780
But the design
and the concept were different,

19
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,610
and her new design came
with a better structure,

20
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,080
although she couldn't have had
much time.

21
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,610
Isn't it weird?

22
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,620
We've fallen into a trap.

23
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,190
She couldn't have made that design
in such a short while.

24
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,420
Are you saying Jae In knew
the design would be leaked?

25
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,460
Stop talking nonsense.

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,230
Who did you ask to steal her design?

27
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,130
Was it someone trustworthy?

28
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,940
It doesn't matter. It would've been fine
if you were better than Jae In.

29
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,300
If you were talented enough,

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,570
I wouldn't have done
something this dirty.

31
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,680
You also have a trust issue with me.

32
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,910
It wouldn't have felt so unfair
if I lost with my design.

33
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,420
This isn't the time
to nitpick over fairness.

34
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,450
After all, you lost.

35
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,920
You were so sure
you could win against Jae In.

36
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,490
So, what now?

37
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,660
Are you telling me to quit my job?

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,630
Do you really want me to quit?

39
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm the chairman's wife.

40
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,200
If DH Holdings wants me gone,

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,340
it means they think you're a joke.

42
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,000
Doesn't that kill your pride?

43
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,970
I have no way to save you
at the moment.

44
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,210
Hold out as long as you can...

45
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,910
and try to find a way to stay.

46
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,950
I'll give you a hint.
Kim Do Yun and Jae In are...

47
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,780
living under the same roof.

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,720
They're living together?

49
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,390
I don't know the details.

50
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,990
But Jae In can't do anything...

51
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,420
without her connection
to Kim Do Yun.

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,790
Make sure nothing affects me.

53
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,100
Do you understand what I mean?

54
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,630
I won't let anything hurt you.

55
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,070
Don't worry.

56
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,050
It's Alzheimer's disease,

57
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,680
usually known as dementia.

58
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,620
But you don't have to be
so disappointed.

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,950
You're still in the early stages,

60
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,960
so you can slow the progression
with drug treatment.

61
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,760
Please come
with a guardian next time.

62
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,700
I can't believe this.

63
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,230
I have dementia?

64
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,770
Why is this happening to me?

65
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,410
No.

66
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,380
This is impossible.

67
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,140
I feel completely fine.

68
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,980
No, it can't be true.

69
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,750
I need to call my daughter and...

70
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,950
My daughter...

71
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,590
My girl...

72
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,960
What's my daughter's name?

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,060
No!

74
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,700
No!

75
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,500
No.

76
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,340
No!

77
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,210
No.

78
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,340
No.

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,290
We're looking for the guardian
of Hwang Min Jeong in Ward 62.

80
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,890
Please head to the ward immediately.

81
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,790
It's all because of the Kang family.

82
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,130
I've become who I am now
because they tortured me...

83
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,460
throughout my life.

84
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,070
Gyu Cheol,
I won't forgive you or Mi Ran.

85
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,420
Why are you here again?

86
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,920
- This is my work. Don't barge in...
- You.

87
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,490
Do you really not want to know
who your birth mother is?

88
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,000
No.

89
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,030
I already made myself clear
last time.

90
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,500
I couldn't care less about that,

91
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,340
so leave.

92
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,940
But I have to tell you.

93
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,080
I feel too wronged and angry
to keep this to myself.

94
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,410
Listen up.

95
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,980
You need to stop!

96
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,080
It's your aunt.

97
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,350
Your aunt is your birth mother.

98
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,900
What are you talking about?

99
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,030
Do you expect me...

100
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,640
to believe this?

101
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,810
Hey, lady.
Enough with your nonsense.

102
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
You can ask your aunt,
your birth mother,

103
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,620
if this is nonsense or not.

104
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,190
That way, you'll know for sure.

105
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,700
Why are you here again?

106
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,560
I thought I warned you.

107
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,930
Leave.

108
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,770
Seung Woo knows now.

109
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,840
Aunt Mi Ran, no, right?

110
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,980
This woman told me
complete nonsense...

111
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,680
just to tease me.

112
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,220
She said you were my mom.

113
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,290
That's crazy, right?

114
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,400
Aunt Mi Ran, are you...

115
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,900
I said I'd do it.

116
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,400
Why? Do you feel wronged?

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,240
Then, imagine how I feel.

118
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,210
I never had
the chance to complain...

119
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,910
to my husband my whole life,
just because I didn't have a son.

120
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,420
I lived my entire life...

121
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,650
shedding tears of blood
and screaming on the inside.

122
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,120
How do you think that felt?

123
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,590
Did you really think I was fine?

124
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,030
He loved you.

125
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,730
If he hadn't,
he would've kicked you out ages ago.

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,870
Love?

127
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,210
He sacrificed me
for the sake of the Kang family.

128
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,280
How can you call that love?

129
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,550
He should've told me the truth...

130
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,820
before my heart broke into pieces!

131
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,790
You, Gyu Cheol,
and even my father-in-law...

132
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,760
didn't treat me like a human,
not a single person in your family.

133
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,630
And the Kang family
isn't even that big of a deal.

134
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,500
I lost everything...

135
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,200
because of you and your greed.

136
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,040
You destroyed my family.

137
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,110
Do you understand?

138
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,480
Aunt Mi Ran, is this true?

139
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,080
Am I really...

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,120
your...

141
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,690
No, right?

142
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,130
Just say no.

143
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,500
Please just deny it!

144
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,670
Calm down, Seung Woo.

145
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,370
Let me explain.

146
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,780
How can this... No.

147
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,940
This is just wrong.

148
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,480
Seung Woo.

149
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,730
Seung Woo.

150
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,570
Seung Woo!

151
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,640
Why are you here?

152
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,450
Did you tell Seung Woo?

153
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,620
Yes, I did.

154
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Aunt Mi Ran would've done it.
Why did you do that?

155
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,860
I asked you not to do it.

156
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,160
You need to worry about yourself,
not Seung Woo.

157
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,490
He needed to know.

158
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,130
That feels much better.

159
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,700
I always wondered
what pent-up anger felt like,

160
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,770
and it was something I had.

161
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,080
Seung Woo didn't know anything...

162
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,380
and thought you were his mom.

163
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,820
Don't hurt
that innocent kid anymore.

164
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,720
Why are you only worried about him?

165
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,420
Can't you see
that I'm in a lot of pain, too?

166
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,720
It's painful for me, too.

167
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,090
It's torturous.

168
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,560
Are you unwell?

169
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,730
I hope you don't live like I did.

170
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,570
It'll make you sick
in your body and mind.

171
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,410
Mom, is something going on?

172
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,210
I'm saying
I'm glad you divorced Gi Chan.

173
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,520
Goodbye.

174
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,760
I'm done after putting
the restaurant up for rent.

175
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,730
Why are you telling me to make an effort
to put up a sign there?

176
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,330
Then, you can go and put up
the sign for rent as my realtor.

177
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,840
Yes, goodbye.

178
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,610
No, Yu Gyeong. No!

179
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,340
No, Yu Gyeong! No!

180
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,010
No, don't go. Don't go, Yu Gyeong!

181
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,510
- Don't go!
- Hey, you punk.

182
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,250
Where are you going, Gi Man?

183
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,350
Good grief. I put the restaurant
he was running up for rent,

184
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,790
but he's out of his mind
instead of trying to stop me.

185
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,330
It's me, Mr. Chairman.

186
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,970
I'm calling today after hearing
that Jae In won the design contest.

187
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,930
It didn't sit right with me.

188
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,400
Jae In must've noticed...

189
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,440
that I had been
relaying information to you.

190
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,480
Yes.

191
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,980
I think she left the design
out in the open...

192
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,120
to make it easier for me to take it.

193
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,120
I should've been more careful.
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,260
So, Jae In noticed what was going on
between Mr. Do and me...

195
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,660
and used it as a chance to ruin me?

196
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,600
And no,
he wouldn't make this call...

197
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,900
if he was working with Jae In.

198
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,200
It didn't sit right with me, either.

199
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,270
We should lie low for a while.

200
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,440
Refrain from coming to my office
for a while.

201
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,150
We'll stay in touch over the phone.

202
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,060
(For lease)

203
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,260
Jae In,
I called Hwang Gi Chan first...

204
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,260
just as you suggested.

205
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,600
He also said
it didn't sit right with him.

206
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,070
He must've been suspicious.

207
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,970
I'm glad we beat him to it.

208
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,140
I knew Gi Chan would feel
something was suspicious...

209
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,440
after the result of the contest.

210
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,310
Yes, thank you for your help.

211
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,950
Goodbye.

212
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,890
Didn't the same person find out...

213
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,890
who Catherine really was?

214
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,990
Who is he?
Is he a private detective?

215
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,470
It's Mr. Do Min Jun,
the man who works with Mom.

216
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
He was the junior managing director
of YL Group.

217
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
- Min Jun?
- Yes.

218
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,070
Do Hee must've looked up to him.

219
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,780
She even talked to him
about the inside corruption,

220
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,010
but he got framed by Hwang Gi Chan
and was dismissed.

221
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,980
At the moment, he's pretending
to give information to Gi Chan...

222
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,820
while actually helping me.

223
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,620
I thought he was just a nice guy,

224
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,790
but he put up such a front.

225
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,190
He was a double agent?

226
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,590
Gosh, that's very bold of him.

227
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,000
How can I not show him respect?

228
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,970
Yu Gyeong! I just want to see you!

229
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,070
I'm not drunk!

230
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,610
I had a nightmare...

231
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,110
that something bad happened to you!

232
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,580
I just want to see if you're fine!

233
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,790
Hey, are you all right?

234
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
Are you fine?

235
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,900
I feel safer and better
than any day I spent with you.

236
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm fine, so you're good, right?

237
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,930
Please leave.

238
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,670
Wait, Yu Gyeong.

239
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,270
Why, hello.

240
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,310
What do you think you're doing?

241
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,050
It wasn't me.
I didn't bring him here.

242
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,750
Have you been following me?

243
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,880
My debtor ignored all my calls,

244
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,490
so I was wondering
where you were going.

245
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,860
This must be your parents' place.

246
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,560
You should ask them
for money as his wife.

247
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,960
If you keep holding out,

248
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,130
you'll only face the worst.

249
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,870
I divorced him already,
so we're strangers now.

250
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,800
Leave my home now
before I report you for trespassing!

251
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,270
Hey, she told you to go, so go.

252
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,510
Yu Gyeong, I won't let this happen again.
I'm so sorry.

253
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,940
Go, now.

254
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,150
Hey, I'll talk to the police
and tell them everything I know.

255
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,020
If you want to get
even a penny from me,

256
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,320
you better come out with me. Now.

257
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,550
Come out. Now.

258
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,550
- I'm sorry, Yu Gyeong.
- What?

259
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,990
Let's go. We'll talk outside.

260
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,700
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

261
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,470
Please leave a message
after the tone.

262
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,310
(Seung Woo: Hey, Seung Woo...)

263
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,580
Ms. Kang, come on out! Now!

264
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,780
What is it, Bo Ram?
Is something going on?

265
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,390
Congratulations on winning

266
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,990
Dear Ms. Kang, Uncle Do Yun
And Little Grandpa

267
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,490
Congratulations on winning

268
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,360
Blow out the candle.

269
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,930
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

270
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,700
Jae In was the one
who worked hard for the contest,

271
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,670
but we got to celebrate with her.

272
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,110
We did it together as DH Holdings,

273
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,640
so we must celebrate together.

274
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,940
I would've felt so uneasy
every single day...

275
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,880
if only one of you worked there,

276
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,350
but the three of you are
carrying out big projects together.

277
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,580
I feel a little more relieved now.

278
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,790
Grandma,
when are we going to eat the cake?

279
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
What?

280
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,990
Yes, let's eat it now.

281
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,190
- Okay. Let's eat the cake first.
- Yes, let's eat.

282
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,530
Why can't my brothers be good?

283
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,200
Do I seriously have
two ex-sisters-in-law now?

284
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,000
They're both insane.

285
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,240
The house is a mess
without Yu Gyeong around.

286
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,250
And it feels like
the kitchen reeks of food.

287
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,210
Everything is such a mess.

288
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,850
Jeez.

289
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,190
What are you up to?

290
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,620
My goodness! Fire!

291
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,290
What's all this?

292
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,490
That's hot.

293
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,430
What do I do? Goodness.

294
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,030
It... It almost
caught on fire, right?

295
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,910
Yes, you don't even have to ask!

296
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,150
Here.

297
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,250
You should've
put the fire out first.

298
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,090
Why were you trembling
out of your mind?

299
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,330
I thought I wasn't traumatized
by that fire anymore, but I was.

300
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,630
When the candles fell over,

301
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,730
it reminded me of the day
when I knocked over a stove.

302
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,600
I was reminded of that time.

303
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,700
Back then, the house we lived in
caught on fire and...

304
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,210
I told you...

305
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,510
we'd keep that incident a secret
until the day we die.

306
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,410
I told you
never to speak of it, didn't I?

307
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,080
Jeez. You did.

308
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,850
Watch what you say.
Do not ever speak of it. Okay?

309
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,620
Mom, stop. Okay. Stop it.

310
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,720
Goodness.

311
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,070
He won't pick up his phone
or come home.

312
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,420
Seung Woo.

313
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,420
Seung Woo.

314
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,490
No, get off me.

315
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,330
Seung Woo, please.

316
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,370
Please hear me out, Seung Woo.

317
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,570
I was going to tell you everything.

318
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,770
I was going to do that today.

319
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,210
I always wanted to tell you,

320
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,140
but I didn't know where to begin.

321
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,350
I also needed time
to prepare myself.

322
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,150
I asked you about my birth mother.

323
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,890
You should've told me then.

324
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,760
You should've told me.

325
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,160
Why...

326
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,000
do you make me feel
this miserable and insignificant?

327
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,640
Why?

328
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,800
Why?

329
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,210
I'm sorry, Seung Woo.

330
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,740
- I'm sorry.
- No.

331
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,310
Don't give me that.

332
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,920
Don't apologize to me,

333
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,790
because I don't need your apology.

334
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,390
I don't need anything!

335
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,270
Do you know why I feel so miserable?

336
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,910
Not only am I not my mom's son,

337
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,080
but now I'm not even my dad's son.

338
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,180
It was the only thing
that kept me going.

339
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,410
My existence...

340
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,790
is meaningless.

341
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,020
No, Seung Woo.

342
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,790
You're still one of the Kang family.

343
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,130
Nothing has changed.

344
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,400
You're the only one
who can keep YL Group going.

345
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,660
You can hold your head high.

346
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,270
Keep your head up.

347
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,070
What do you mean
nothing has changed?

348
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,940
Don't you feel bad for my mom?

349
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,870
Seung Woo...

350
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,250
I trusted you and betrayed my sister
at the general meeting.

351
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,880
You tried to use me...

352
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,890
as a front to take the company yourself.
How is that for my sake?

353
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,620
You took advantage of me
out of your greed!

354
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,400
No, Seung Woo...

355
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,640
You abandoned your child,

356
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,540
got married, and lived a good life.

357
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,710
If you were going to abandon me,
you should've kept it that way.

358
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,980
Why are you putting me...

359
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,180
through this pain
after such a long time? Why?

360
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,520
It would've been better...

361
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,920
if my birth mother were
a complete stranger.

362
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,600
You're not my mom.

363
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,000
I'll never accept you.

364
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,800
I can't lose my mind right now.

365
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,810
I must hold out somehow...

366
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,240
until the very end
for Jae In's sake.

367
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,540
Yu Gyeong.

368
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,240
Do you need something?

369
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,410
Why don't you
go on a trip somewhere?

370
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,950
I'm not so sure.

371
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,050
You can get some fresh air...

372
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,720
and join that recent trend
of living abroad for a month.

373
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,290
Don't worry about anything here
and go get some rest.

374
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,860
I'm not sure.

375
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,390
I feel lost.

376
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,730
I don't have
the will to do anything,

377
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,770
and I'm not even sure
where to begin my next step.

378
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,870
After I decided to get divorced,

379
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,670
it felt like a tightened screw
suddenly came loose.

380
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,950
I'm not so sure what I wanted.

381
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,580
Don't be so hard on yourself,
and give it time.

382
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,790
You don't have to care
about others or even me.

383
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,320
If you give it time and wait,

384
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,390
you'll find the path
you want to take.

385
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,760
Okay. Thanks, Dad.

386
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,570
- Daddy!
- Hey.

387
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,870
Hey, Ji Ho. I heard you don't have
to go to kindergarten today.

388
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,940
No.

389
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,980
I'll come home early today,
so let's play then.

390
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,350
Really? All right!

391
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,850
You're running a little late today.

392
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,790
I'm leaving, Ji Ho.

393
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
- Goodbye, Daddy.
- Bye.

394
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,860
You seem really happy
after wrecking my family.

395
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,430
Have a great day, Mr. Chairman.

396
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,300
Yes, I'm leaving.

397
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,770
That jerk.

398
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,610
He treated me like I didn't exist.

399
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,170
He doesn't deserve to do that.

400
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,910
Ji Ho can hear you.

401
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,810
You should study
in your room, Ji Ho.

402
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:29,810
Okay.

403
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,320
That tu something.
Ever since that tu something...

404
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,720
or whatever quit her job,

405
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,190
only I ended up
with mountains of work.

406
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,990
Tutor. She was a tutor, okay?

407
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,330
Shut your mouth.

408
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,700
Stop talking nonsense,

409
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,770
pull yourself together,
and find a way to make a living.

410
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,800
I put the restaurant up for lease.

411
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,870
What are you going to do
when it gets leased?

412
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,040
What do you think?
I'll sit around like a bum...

413
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,310
and make you frustrated.

414
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,140
Good grief.

415
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,650
You punk. Jeez.

416
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,550
My gosh.

417
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,200
Mr. Kang Seung Woo is
absent without notice once again.

418
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,330
Have you turned in your resignation?

419
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:25,440
Companies have rules
and procedures to follow.

420
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,040
You don't even work for YL Group,

421
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,010
so stop nitpicking over this
and just wait.

422
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,610
You're so shameless.

423
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,310
You better keep the promise...

424
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,680
you made before the contest
unless you want to be humiliated.

425
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,630
Seung Woo didn't come to work.

426
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,030
Since when did you care so much
to be worried?

427
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,100
I know my mom came by yesterday.

428
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,500
If you do, that's a bigger reason
to mind your own business.

429
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,800
I'll make sure he isn't involved
with you and your mom anymore.

430
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,040
Will Team Leader Kang Se Ri
continue to work here?

431
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,410
We agreed the loser of the contest
would quit their job.

432
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,150
We didn't seal it on paper.

433
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,850
We can always change what we say.

434
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,690
It's ridiculous
for the company to play along...

435
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,560
with the condition you made
for your personal vengeance.

436
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,360
Just let it go.

437
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,560
Ms. Kang may not be as talented as you,
but she's still talented.

438
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,870
It feels like you're attacking me
by using your personal feelings...

439
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,830
against me.

440
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,340
I admit it.

441
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,470
My personal feelings are involved,
but this is a matter of business.

442
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,840
The offer was made
while everyone was there,

443
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,180
and everyone there agreed.

444
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,850
Ms. Kang is the wife
of YL Group's chairman.

445
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,920
Do you still have trouble
accepting that?

446
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,720
DH Holdings may lodge...

447
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,720
a formal complaint
if she is not dismissed.

448
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,320
Please excuse me.

449
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,990
Yes.

450
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,860
A verbal contract is
still legally binding.

451
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,270
I believe you must know that
better than I do.

452
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,650
Someone already took the lease?

453
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,390
They can send the deposit
to my bank account.

454
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,650
What about the premium?

455
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,460
I still need it
even if I didn't pay it back then.

456
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,060
If I call off this contract,
I'll have to pay the monthly rent...

457
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,460
until someone else takes the lease.

458
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,900
No, I take that back.

459
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,400
I'll just take the deposit
and end it there.

460
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,040
Goodbye.

461
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,470
Darn it. I planned to take
a huge premium...

462
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,910
by making the business a success.
What a shame.

463
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,580
Anyway, what's the next business?

464
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,620
Oh, my. I forgot about Oh Seong.

465
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,260
If I stop working there,
how am I going to see him?

466
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,490
Should I call it off
and say I'll take it back?

467
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,260
I'm getting old, too.

468
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,100
Why hadn't I thought of that?

469
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,200
I can meet him at YL Group.

470
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,870
Not only is he rich,
but he's also handsome.

471
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,310
How am I going to hit on him?

472
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,720
The restaurant across the hall?
The pig's feet place?

473
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,790
Yes, it was up for lease,

474
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,060
so I took it.

475
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,930
I wanted to take it easy
and run the place with my daughter.

476
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,900
I heard Ms. Noh once say
her daughter-in-law was a doctor.

477
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,670
She's on leave,

478
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,970
so I don't think
she'll go back to work soon.

479
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,840
I didn't want her
to sit around at home,

480
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,970
so I thought it'd be nice.

481
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,810
It's not easy to be a doctor.

482
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,210
It's an exhausting job.

483
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,750
My son was a surgeon
at a famous general hospital, so I know.

484
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:02,250
Your son was a doctor, too?

485
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,050
Yes.

486
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,760
He's now running a business
with his uncle,

487
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,430
but I kind of want him
to go back to his job.

488
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,260
He was such a big shot
at Hanguk Hospital.

489
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,100
Yu Gyeong worked as a family physician
at Hanguk Hospital, too.

490
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,700
I can't believe this.

491
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,810
Our kids must know each other.

492
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,610
What are the chances?

493
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,940
Right?

494
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,850
It's such a small world,
and it's nice to know this.

495
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,310
Gosh.

496
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,820
Please excuse me.

497
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,590
I have to be at the training.

498
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,790
Right. I got a call
from your brother...

499
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,790
that he'd come out and help.

500
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,790
Don't worry about me and go.

501
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,470
Hello.

502
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,980
- Here.
- I want fried chicken and beer...

503
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,410
Goodness, it's you, right?
From YL Group.

504
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,950
Yes.

505
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,980
I'll come back next time.

506
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,790
Goodness, why? Have a seat.

507
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,630
I've been wanting to meet you,
and you actually came here.

508
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,230
Me?

509
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,230
Why?

510
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,670
I was grateful for your help
when I almost collapsed at your office.

511
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,400
Thank you.

512
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,700
Don't mention it.
I'll come back next time.

513
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,980
Look who it is.

514
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,010
How did you know about this place?

515
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,580
- He's...
- I'm a regular here.

516
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,850
Hello.

517
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
Yes, sure. Hello.

518
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,690
All right, then.
Grab a drink with me.

519
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,920
I'd like your best dish.

520
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,530
And two draft beers, too.

521
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,890
Sure.

522
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,270
What brings you
to this neighborhood?

523
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,170
I just ended up here.

524
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,370
You must come here often.

525
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,640
Do you like rich and older women?

526
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,480
Why? Do you want to set me up?

527
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,950
All right.

528
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,650
I'll fry some delicious chicken,
so give me a little time.

529
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,760
He's an important guest,
so be nice to him, Mr. Regular.

530
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,490
All right. Let's have a drink.

531
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,480
You got him way too drunk.

532
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,510
Stop here and grab a taxi for him.

533
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,780
I'll manage, so don't worry.

534
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,620
I'll clean up and close the place,
so you should go.

535
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,650
Bo Ram must be waiting for you.

536
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,390
He seemed like a good guy.
Be nice to him.

537
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,320
Okay. You need to go.

538
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,390
- Bye.
- Bye.

539
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,150
(Aunt)

540
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,990
Hello? Seung Woo.

541
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,550
Hello?

542
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,960
Who is this?

543
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,100
- Like this?
- Yes.

544
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,100
It's going to fall over!

545
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,440
You're back.

546
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,940
- You're home.
- Hey, there.

547
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,040
- Where's Jae In?
- She's running late today.

548
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,240
What's this?

549
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,050
It was in front of the gate.

550
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,110
It must be for us,
but I don't see an address.

551
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,550
What is it, Bo Ram?

552
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,960
I'm thirsty.

553
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,290
Is that so? I'll go with you.

554
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,870
(Kang Jae In is the daughter
of Kim Do Hee's murderer!)

555
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,440
(Kang Jae In is the daughter
of Kim Do Hee's murderer!)

556
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,510
(Kang Jae In is the daughter
of Kim Do Hee's murderer!)

557
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,480
(Queen's House)

558
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,820
At the time of Do Hee's accident,

559
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,420
the dash cam footage
wasn't the only thing I got.

560
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,590
I received a photo
and a text message that showed...

561
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,090
you were
Director Choi Ja Young's daughter,

562
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,330
and someone even called
with a distorted voice.

563
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,390
If you make a scene again,
I'll disown you first...

564
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,800
before Mom does. Got it?

565
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,060
Yes, sir.

566
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,230
Did you think I'd be like that?

567
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,400
I resented Seung Woo
because I thought he was a love child.

568
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,510
I plan to continue raising him
as my precious son.

569
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,240
That's crazy.

570
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,040
You can't do that!

571
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,610
What do you have to say?

572
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,110
I have nothing to hear from you.

573
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,210
I have something to tell you
about Kang Jae In.
