(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,310
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,980
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,950
(Episode 64)

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,050
Mom!

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,390
Jae In.

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,920
Is that really you?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,260
Yes, did you return from America?

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,660
What's wrong with me?

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,230
Jae In is dead.
She's just in my head.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,170
Get yourself together.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,440
Mom.

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,640
I've been completely healed.
It's me, Jae In.

14
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,760
Jae In.

15
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,400
Is this really you?

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,500
Yes.

17
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,540
My daughter. Goodness, my girl.

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,610
You were alive. You were!

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,380
Goodness, Jae In. My daughter.

20
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,620
Don't cry, Mom.

21
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,750
I'm fully well.

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,020
Aren't you supposed to be at work
at this hour?

23
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,290
You shouldn't want to get paid
for slacking off.

24
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,660
It's like stealing.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,100
Oh, my.

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,770
Seung Woo. Why are you here?

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,680
Mother, my mom is here.

28
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,850
I think she returned from America
after hearing that I woke up.

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,020
She must've had a rough time
after Dad passed away,

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,590
and I was bedridden.

31
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,390
We both choked up.

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,560
Jae In, what are you talking about?

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,630
Mom!

34
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,660
Can I talk to you for a second?

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,270
Jae In, I need to steal her
for a moment.

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Come on, Mom.

37
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,940
Goodness. He's impossible.

38
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,340
My head is splitting.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,940
Do you have a headache, Mother?

40
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,340
Forget it. Okay?

41
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,080
I just need to rest.

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,860
Are you going home now?
Let's leave together.

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,490
We're going separately.

44
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,360
It won't do any good
if we go together.

45
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,460
We work in the same office,
so it can happen.

46
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,970
I understand your distance at home,
but I don't want that here.

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,400
I'm your wife now.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,400
This isn't the time
to nitpick over that.

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,170
Yes, Mom.

50
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,880
She came home?

51
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,050
I'll be there now.

52
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,690
What's wrong?

53
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,260
Choi Ja Young came to our place.

54
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,460
Isn't that good news?

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,300
It's a chance to find out
if Jae In is...

56
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,170
really suffering from amnesia.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm not someone who comforts people
with shallow and meaningless words.

58
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,680
Back then and even now,
you've always been...

59
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,880
a woman to me.

60
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,960
Is this another menopausal symptom?

61
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,230
Why is it so hot in here again?

62
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,500
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

63
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,250
Why are you holding me back here?

64
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,090
Move aside. I need to see Jae In.

65
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,490
Didn't you hear what I just said?

66
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,730
Do you think I'll believe you?

67
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,860
She has amnesia?

68
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,600
Don't be ridiculous.

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,970
Wait just a little more.

70
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,770
You may not trust me,
but you'll trust a doctor.

71
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,540
Seung Woo!

72
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,440
Ms. Choi.

73
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,180
You should explain it to her.

74
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,980
She won't believe anything I say.

75
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,950
Why did it have to be then?

76
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,230
She only remembers
up until eight years ago?

77
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,260
Yes.

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,800
If we force her to remember,

79
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,170
it'll only confuse her.

80
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,770
I understand that
the situation seems absurd, but...

81
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,070
What was he thinking
when he brought her home?

82
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,280
I don't know the reason.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,250
That's why Seung Woo moved in
to be by her side.

84
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,350
I'll protect Jae In.
You don't have to worry.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,730
This might be better.

86
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,630
I'll go to that house, too.

87
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,100
What? Ms. Choi.

88
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,700
According to what you said,

89
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,270
wouldn't it be weirder
if I weren't at that house?

90
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,640
If we're going to stage a play,
we're doing it right.

91
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,440
Seung Woo,
can you get me some water?

92
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,150
You're unwell.

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm perfectly fine.
I'm on medication.

94
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,160
But still...

95
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,800
Jae In is in a den of wicked jerks.

96
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,470
I don't know what will happen
if I leave her there.

97
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,240
Seung Woo is there for her.

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,320
He doesn't stand a chance.

99
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,590
Are you really going
to move into that place?

100
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,620
If you're there,

101
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,560
there's no reason
for me to stay away.

102
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,760
I'll protect Jae In.

103
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,100
It's so great to see you, Mom.

104
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,670
It's been eight years
since the last time we met.

105
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,010
Is Jae In
really suffering from amnesia?

106
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,180
She won't even flinch.

107
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,950
Yes. Thank you, Jae In.

108
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,920
Thank you for waking up.

109
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,720
You should've told me right away...

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,420
as soon as she woke up.
What took you so long?

111
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,060
What was more important than this?
Why did you put it off?

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,260
How dare you shout at him?

113
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,200
That's enough, Mom. She's right.

114
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,730
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,100
Darn it.

116
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,010
You saw that your daughter was fine,
so you should leave.

117
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,680
Ms. Noh, what are you talking about?

118
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,180
This is my place. Why would I leave?

119
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,150
What are you...

120
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,850
Do you really not know
whose house this is?

121
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,250
Pull yourself together.

122
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,290
I asked you to house-sit
while I was abroad for a while.

123
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,160
You must've forgotten, Ms. Noh.

124
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,230
This is my house.

125
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,300
What kind of absurd robbery is this?

126
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,500
If she still remembers something,
she must know...

127
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,510
that nothing good will happen
if she lets her mom stay here.

128
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,610
Thank you for calling and telling me
that Jae In woke up.

129
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,060
Mom, you're here now,
so you should stay for a while.

130
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,990
Your beloved Seung Woo is here, too,

131
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,000
and it must be lonely to live alone.

132
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,300
I will. My son, Seung Woo, is here,

133
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,900
and you, my precious daughter,
are here, too.

134
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,210
I'll stay here with you
until you're fully well.

135
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,520
I feel jetlagged.
I should call it a night early.

136
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,450
You should.

137
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,560
Wait.

138
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,560
Not the master bedroom.
Find another room.

139
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,700
I can only sleep well in my room.

140
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,270
Exactly.

141
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
That room is mine now.

142
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,140
What? Darn it.

143
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,950
What you're doing right now is
breaking and infiltrating.

144
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,220
Come out right now!

145
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,320
You mean, breaking and entering?

146
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,790
Infiltrating is
when someone sneaks inside.

147
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,190
It doesn't matter.
They're both illegal.

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,330
This is now my house and my room.

149
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,770
If you're going to stage a play,
do it right.

150
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,340
As long as Jae In thinks
this is her home,

151
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,600
this is my house and my room.

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,910
Do you understand?

153
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Stop talking nonsense and leave!

154
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,910
Darn it.

155
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,780
Then, should I go out...

156
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,450
and tell her everything...

157
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,720
about your family's true nature?

158
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,290
I'll share everything you've done...

159
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,390
to my family and to my daughter.

160
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,730
All of you are
unable to kick her out...

161
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,370
because something is bothering you.

162
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,000
Isn't that so?

163
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,610
Why are you so strong?

164
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,710
I see right through
your dark intentions.

165
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,350
I'll only allow my daughter
to live here...

166
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,850
as long as I get to stay
as her guardian,

167
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,950
so make your choice.

168
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,320
Should I leave?

169
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,120
Why would you leave?

170
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,790
Just stay.

171
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,930
I'm taking the bed,
and that's final.

172
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,270
You're living off me,
so you should sleep on the floor.

173
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,540
Jae In!

174
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,510
I'll take the floor.

175
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,580
Happy now?

176
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,890
Honey.

177
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,300
Watch what you say.
What if someone hears you?

178
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,630
How dare you drag Choi Ja Young in here
and feign ignorance?

179
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,200
All I did was call her and ask...

180
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,940
if Jae In really suffered
from amnesia.

181
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,110
Everything you say is
an excuse and a lie.

182
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,610
Who are you, really?

183
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,550
Are you
really the Kang Se Ri I knew?

184
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,380
How can you say that?

185
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,450
I did that thinking
it wouldn't harm you in any way.

186
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,690
Choi Ja Young is
suffering from dementia.

187
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,260
What is this crazy talk?

188
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,030
She was completely fine back there.

189
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,830
I mean it.

190
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,500
I remembered picking up...

191
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,730
her medicine bottle
at Jae In's funeral, so I checked.

192
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,030
She'd slowly lose her mind anyway,

193
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,500
so I didn't think
it'd matter if I called.

194
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,910
It was my mistake. I admit it.

195
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,610
I didn't expect her to come here.

196
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,340
Are you serious?

197
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,050
I mean it, and I'm sure.

198
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,220
Choi Ja Young has dementia?

199
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,720
Are you going to let her live here?

200
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,890
She's not even in good condition.

201
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,520
I know that, too.

202
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,630
She's like a ticking bomb
even when she has her sanity.

203
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,330
Who knows what she'll do
if we kick her out now?

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,870
And Jae In is happy to have her,
so how am I supposed to stop this?

205
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,200
Why did you do something this rash
without thinking it through?

206
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,640
I've reached my limit, too.

207
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,610
Do not do anything you can't handle.

208
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,250
Director Kang Mi Ran is
coming tomorrow,

209
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,080
so play along.

210
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,920
Come out after five minutes.

211
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,480
Jae In.
You met with Yu Gyeong, right?

212
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,810
Have you talked to her?

213
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,380
I told you to stop that.

214
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,450
I need... May I have some water?

215
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,320
Sure, give me a moment.

216
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,560
I heard you were infertile.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,170
And Mother, you knew about it,
but you pretended like you didn't.

218
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,040
What did you say?

219
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,710
I heard you also beat her.

220
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,080
You should be grateful that
she didn't report you to the police.

221
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,750
If I were her, I would've reported you
or done the same...

222
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,410
to you.

223
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,820
Gi Man, will you serve
a cup of cold water to Mother?

224
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,290
Yes, sure. Of course.

225
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,830
I must go upstairs now.

226
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,600
Goodnight, Mother.

227
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,570
She just made
a fool out of us, right?

228
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,600
Yes.

229
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,140
My gosh.

230
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,460
This is
my father-in-law's handwriting.

231
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,290
I knew it seemed familiar.

232
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,560
It was his notebook.

233
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,070
Why is Choi Ja Young
carrying this around?

234
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,170
(Bucket List: Travel with wife,
to our honeymoon destination?)

235
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,240
(Spend time with family.
Architecture exhibition in Europe.)

236
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,510
(Receive midterm report.
The quality of the product...)

237
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,600
Come in.

238
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,200
Honey.

239
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,370
Do you have a lot to do today, too?

240
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,370
You should get some rest first.
I'll be upstairs soon.

241
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,280
Honey.

242
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,480
I feel much more at ease
thinking I'll get to live...

243
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,720
with my mom again.

244
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,050
It must feel uneasy both for you...

245
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,790
and your family
to live with your in-laws.

246
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,190
Thank you.

247
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm glad to hear
that you feel more at ease.

248
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,310
All done.

249
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
You should get your backpack,
Bo Ram.

250
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,450
Take this, Grandma.

251
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,320
- Do you want me to put this on?
- Yes.

252
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,690
I'm fine.

253
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,400
You got it from Ms. Mi Sook, right?

254
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,670
You should show that you like a gift
when you receive one.

255
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,540
You look much prettier
with the lipstick on.

256
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,240
You should put it on.

257
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,580
All right. The lipstick
didn't do anything wrong.

258
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,910
Should I put it on?

259
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,310
Yes.

260
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm going to work, Yun Hee.

261
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,220
Have a great day, Little Grandpa.

262
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,620
All right. Have fun
at the kindergarten, Bo Ram.

263
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,790
Okay.

264
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,360
Have a wonderful day.

265
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,860
You look great.

266
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,460
You should do that more often.

267
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,970
Bye.

268
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,580
I'm going to work, Mother.

269
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,150
Did you think I also lost my memories
because I played along?

270
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:54,820
I don't want to associate with you,
so don't get cheeky.

271
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,860
I have to feel her out
about the notebook,

272
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,660
but she still seems too fine.

273
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,530
Will you only leave
after I call Jae In and make a scene?

274
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,700
I'm also doing this
because of her condition,

275
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,400
so please cooperate.

276
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,780
Mr. Kang, I asked for a list
of materials to be used...

277
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,650
for the reconstruction project
in Saseon-dong.

278
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,990
Why don't I see it?

279
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,560
Can't you hear me, Mr. Kang?

280
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,360
Stop screaming.
I can hear everything.

281
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,800
Then, why did you pretend
like you didn't hear me?

282
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,660
I didn't. I just ignored you.

283
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,000
What did you say?

284
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,470
I remembered how you shamelessly...

285
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,670
came back to work,
thinking Jae In was dead.

286
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,510
Designer Kang Jae In was alive.

287
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,180
So, you should quit right away.

288
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,710
Let me make a brazen comment.

289
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,620
My competitor, who wanted me gone,
can't remember anything,

290
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,020
so why should I quit?

291
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,690
Gosh, you're so brazen.

292
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,920
Utterly shameless.

293
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,930
Don't you get it?

294
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,330
Director Kang or anyone up above
won't say anything.

295
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,030
That incident is implicitly over.

296
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,670
I gave you a job
as your direct superior,

297
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,840
so stop complaining,
have it done, and put it on my desk.

298
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,610
Unbelievable.

299
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,740
Kang Seung Woo.

300
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,650
You must put up with her
for YL Group.

301
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,120
Once I become the chairman,
I'll destroy all these ridiculous rules.

302
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,290
And you already know
who'll be the first...

303
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,420
to go, right?

304
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,890
I'm going out to work.

305
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,840
It's an article on the upcoming
opening ceremony...

306
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,980
for a residential complex...

307
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,880
built by YL Group and Louis B,
a world-renowned luxury brand.

308
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,150
Why didn't I know
something even reporters knew?

309
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,390
I didn't know I was
supposed to report...

310
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,160
every single process of a project
I was in charge of...

311
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,790
as the chairman.

312
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,230
You must still hold a grudge
after DH Holdings' incident.

313
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,800
I hope you won't go down low...

314
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,600
and begin to mix
personal feelings with business.

315
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,140
This may be your project,

316
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,270
but I hooked you up with Louis B.

317
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,040
You need to share
the progress with me.

318
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,540
I'll see you tonight.

319
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,600
If Choi Ja Young
went around with this,

320
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,370
it couldn't be a simple notebook.

321
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,750
What are these numbers?

322
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,050
This 458-8.

323
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,450
That's the address
for the Changpyeong-dong house.

324
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,060
And 1011...
That's Jae In's date of birth.

325
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,230
Jennie? Is that her English name?

326
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,600
The memo that was
apparently found...

327
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,340
in Jae In's pocket
after the accident.

328
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,340
That also had...

329
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,420
Yes.

330
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,750
This also says home
and the home number.

331
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,960
If this was a hint for Jae In...

332
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,300
The slush fund.

333
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,170
It's a lead
to Kang Gyu Cheol's slush fund.

334
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,870
Secretary Yoon, I need all domestic
and international bank accounts...

335
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,340
under Kang Gyu Cheol's name
and other names he used.

336
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,950
Do Yun told me what happened.

337
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,650
After all,
I'm glad she's still alive.

338
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,620
Yes, if she had died,

339
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,330
all truths would've been buried.

340
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,830
Ms. Kim would've wanted
to expose the truth, too.

341
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,570
You know that, right?

342
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,570
She should've
cared more about her life.

343
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,770
Justice isn't that important.

344
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,080
Jae In almost lost her life...

345
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,910
trying to uncover that justice.

346
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,610
She thought it was the only way
to undo the injustice...

347
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,220
over Ms. Kim's death.

348
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,060
How's her mother?

349
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,260
She's still the same.

350
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,330
She's trying to delay the progress
by taking medications,

351
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,730
but Jae In doesn't know yet.

352
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,500
She wasn't in good condition,

353
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,240
so I couldn't tell her.

354
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,350
Anyway, you look radiant today.

355
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,420
And you seem different.

356
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,650
Oh, is that so?

357
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,520
It must be my makeup.

358
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,760
Bo Ram made me put it on.

359
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,360
You look wonderful, healthy,

360
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,500
and beautiful.

361
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,700
Goodness,
you don't have to say that.

362
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,870
I'm an old woman.

363
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,170
Gosh.

364
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
I'll give you some privacy, too.
You can talk at ease.

365
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,680
Thank you, honey.

366
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,190
He's pretending to be generous,
as if this is his place.

367
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,500
Mom. My in-laws left...

368
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,970
to give us some privacy
and let us talk at ease.

369
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,810
I'm glad
you're still the same, Ja Young.

370
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,880
They may be her in-laws,
but they're still strangers,

371
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,680
so I've been concerned
about Seung Woo staying here.

372
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,050
You're now here with her,

373
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,320
so Seung Woo can move out again.

374
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,220
Aunt Mi Ran, I'm not leaving.

375
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,520
I'm staying until she's fully well.

376
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,760
I moved in to look after her,
regardless of Mom.

377
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,330
You won't be
that big of a help for Jae In...

378
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,560
even if you stayed.

379
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,670
I won't stop you from staying,

380
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,870
but don't try to patronize her later
and say you sacrificed yourself.

381
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,740
Mom, what's with you?

382
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,340
Did Seung Woo do something
to disappoint you?

383
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,110
You always adored him so much.

384
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,960
Seung Woo. She must feel sensitive
from the jet lag.

385
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,330
You understand, right?

386
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,800
Of course, I should.

387
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,470
Mom, you should hold back
for Jae In's sake.

388
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,540
If you're going to do this,
do not discriminate and...

389
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,370
Aunt Mi Ran, that's enough.

390
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,370
It's late. You should go.

391
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,450
All right.

392
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,580
You should get some rest, Jae In.

393
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,650
Okay.

394
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,650
Will you take her home, Seung Woo?

395
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,990
Please do that.

396
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,360
Okay. I'll do that.

397
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,470
Hey.

398
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,170
I thought you had a dinner thing
at Changpyeong-dong with your aunt.

399
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,340
Yes, but it ended
earlier than I thought.

400
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,710
Are you going home now?
Let me give you a ride.

401
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,010
One moment.
I have to change the lightbulb.

402
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,320
It's been flickering.

403
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,820
Give me that. I can do it.

404
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,120
Can you do this kind of work?

405
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,860
Have you done it before?

406
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,190
What? Yes, of course.

407
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,600
Changing the lightbulb
isn't a big deal.

408
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,100
- Give me that. I got it.
- Sure.

409
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,340
Here.

410
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,210
Hey! I haven't turned off
the fuse box!

411
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,410
It burns!

412
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,680
Hey! Are you okay? Are you hurt?

413
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,480
What? Probably not.

414
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,550
You must be electrocuted.

415
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,290
That could've been bad.

416
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,780
Why are you even good at this?

417
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,120
Next time, I'll do it for you.

418
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,190
Sure. I look forward to that day.

419
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,630
- Honey, will you take a shower?
- Yes.

420
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
What? What's this?

421
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,340
My gosh.

422
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,210
Why is Se Ri's earring right here?

423
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,310
I doubt that.
Why would she come into this room?

424
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,480
No, I saw her with this
before she went to work this morning.

425
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,520
Am I mistaken?

426
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,820
Honey, give me a moment.
I need to check.

427
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,630
Se Ri.

428
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,270
This is yours, right?

429
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,140
Yes, it's mine.

430
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,080
It was on the floor of our room.

431
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,710
Have you been in there?

432
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,380
No, why would I go there?

433
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,890
It must've been Ji Ho.

434
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,390
At times,
he'd hide Se Ri's things...

435
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,760
and call it a treasure hunt.

436
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,490
Isn't that so?

437
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,760
That's true.

438
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,560
It must've been him.

439
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,230
Really? I see.

440
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,540
Honey, if you're free
on the weekend,

441
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,670
why don't the three of us
go to an amusement park?

442
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,010
I'm his mother,
so I want to get to know him better.

443
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,520
All right. I'll check my schedule.

444
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,550
You should get some rest
to stay in good condition.

445
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,990
All right. Let's go.

446
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,060
I need to do some work in the study.

447
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,330
I forgot that I had to do something.

448
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,900
- You should go to sleep first.
- Okay.

449
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,640
I'm worried about
that workaholic man, Ji Ho's daddy.

450
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,810
Goodnight, Se Ri.

451
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,510
All right. Goodnight.

452
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,450
I told you not to do something
you can't handle.

453
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,160
It's only been a day
since I warned you.

454
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,590
You were patient for only a day?

455
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,190
I didn't do it.

456
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,760
I knew you'd take it the wrong way,
so I came to tell you...

457
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,960
If it weren't you, who would it be?

458
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,530
Are you saying it was Ji Ho?

459
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,730
How would I know?

460
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,140
It was juvenile of you
to throw your earring there...

461
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,370
to show your presence.

462
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,240
I didn't do it.

463
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,470
Why would I leave my earring there?

464
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,280
You must've wanted to see
if she really lost her memories.

465
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,480
When you got caught
doing that last time,

466
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,650
you pretended like you lost your earring
and looked for it.

467
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,180
I know what you're thinking.

468
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,890
You were trying to bring back
those memories to check.

469
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,490
I didn't. It wasn't me.

470
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,620
You're stifling me right now,

471
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,030
not Jae In, who lost her memories.

472
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,560
I need you to stay still!

473
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,970
You're back!

474
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,710
This is crazy. Doesn't this
make us look like newlyweds?

475
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,750
This must be why my sister-in-law
always sees my brother off to work.

476
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,820
Who are you calling newlyweds?

477
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,550
Don't be so shy.

478
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,220
Would you like
to grab a beer with me?

479
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,860
No thanks.

480
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,860
How about a cup of tea?

481
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,390
Or a cup of water?

482
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,830
Our families are around,
so enough is enough.

483
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,530
What do you mean?

484
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,000
Are you feeling shy
because of your family?

485
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,770
I know you used Jae In...

486
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,770
as an excuse to move in here...

487
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,210
because of me.

488
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,790
Stay still?

489
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,460
I make him feel stifled?

490
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,580
Jae In. It had to be her.

491
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,080
I'll prove that
you don't have amnesia.

492
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,590
Jae In, do you need help?

493
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,190
It's not good manners
to make a guest do chores.

494
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,260
I'm all done.

495
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,660
Right. We have a meeting today,

496
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,930
so why don't you pack
some lunch boxes?

497
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,760
Lunch boxes?

498
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,600
We can't cut the meeting
and go out to eat when it drags on.

499
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,940
You're a good cook,
so I thought I'd ask.

500
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,440
If it's too much to ask,
then just forget it.

501
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,480
No, I'll do that.

502
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,180
It sounds fun to visit the office
for the first time in a while.

503
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,510
All right. It does sound fun.

504
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,260
Designer Kang Jae In was
in charge of DH Holdings' side,

505
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,560
so it mustn't be easy
for you to fill in her gap.

506
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,090
Isn't it common sense to refrain
from chit-chatting in a meeting?

507
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,930
I hope I'm not losing my time here
with someone...

508
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,600
who doesn't know basic etiquette.

509
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,570
Director Kim,
that was way over the line.

510
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,310
He finally stated a fact
for the first time.

511
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,180
As we shared previously,
we're making new window samples.

512
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,150
Before we do that,

513
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,120
we plan to conduct a survey
with our customers.

514
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,050
We want to check the recent trend...

515
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,620
and reflect it as much as we can.

516
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,160
That sounds great.
I'll wait for the survey results.

517
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,500
Director Kim, you're near the door,
so can you get it?

518
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,230
I ordered some lunch boxes.
They must be here.

519
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,410
(Home? 458-8, Changpyeong-dong)

520
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,600
(Queen's House)

521
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,240
Do not barge into that room.
This is a warning.

522
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,940
I'm seeing my husband
in bed with another woman.

523
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,370
Do you expect me
to put up with that?

524
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,580
Enough is enough.

525
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,240
Don't you know
that Jae In has amnesia?

526
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,510
Can you leave her at that place?

527
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,580
We already know
what those people are like.

528
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,380
Are you going to use her amnesia...

529
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,850
as an excuse
to have an affair with her?

530
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,250
I know you're dying
to become Kang Jae In.

531
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,860
You're jealous of Jae In...

532
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,520
because she's an upper-class girl
and the daughter of YL Group.

533
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,290
How many times do I have to say it?
It wasn't me!

534
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,270
- Mother.
- What's wrong, Mom?
