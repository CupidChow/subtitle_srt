(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,350
(Episode 17)

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,090
Hey, how old are you?

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,520
I'm six years old.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,160
He's six? That means
it's been at least seven years.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,660
No way. It began before the wedding?

9
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,700
This wasn't a simple affair.
He had kept two families.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,000
This is why people say
you can never trust anyone.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,000
My name is Hwang Ji Ho.

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,110
Hey, what did you just say?

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,510
My name isn't Hey. I'm Hwang Ji Ho.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,710
Hwang Ji Ho.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,850
My gosh.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,020
You must be in shock.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,290
It hasn't been long
since Ji Ho came back from the US.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,990
I wanted to schedule something
more formal to introduce him,

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,130
but Ji Ho kept pestering me
and said...

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,260
he wanted to meet his grandma.

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,630
You can't deceive me.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,500
Hey, I've been through
all kinds of highs and lows.

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,600
I know what you're up to.

24
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,310
Did you think...

25
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,510
I'd welcome you with open arms...

26
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,910
if you came with a son?

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,850
Not even in your dreams.

28
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,250
Mother...

29
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,950
Shut your mouth.

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,820
Why are you calling me your mother?

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,650
I never had a daughter-in-law
like you, so get lost.

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,320
Ji Ho is Gi Chan's son.

33
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,690
I don't know about me,
but please accept Ji Ho.

34
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,330
The only grandson...

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,360
I acknowledge is Hwang Eun Ho.

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
I don't need you to bring me a kid
he had out of wedlock.

37
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,970
And I don't even know
if he really is Gi Chan's son.

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,370
Get him out of this house now.

39
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,710
You can conduct a paternity test.

40
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,680
Stop babbling
and leave while I'm still nice.

41
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,910
Do you want to get humiliated
before your son?

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,310
I'm a woman of my word.

43
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,220
I'm at Changpyeong-dong. What is it?

44
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,460
It must be fatigue.
You should stay in bed.

45
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,330
Bye.

46
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,760
Was that your mother?

47
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, the trip to the burial ground
must've been tough for her.

48
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,830
Shouldn't she see a doctor?

49
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,170
I'll go. You can get some rest.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,710
Your mother is returning tomorrow,

51
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,270
so you should be there for her.

52
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,440
She'll only feel offended
if she sees me,

53
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,480
so I'll leave
without saying goodbye.

54
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,750
Will you go to work tomorrow?

55
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,120
I should.
I have to catch up on lots of work.

56
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,820
Why do you ask?

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,420
I wanted to go
and pick up Dad's things.

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,190
I should clean out his office.

59
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,200
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,270
The dead Kim Do Hee...

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,670
was my niece.

62
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,910
Why did it have to be him?

63
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,110
This is such an evil twist of fate.

64
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,120
Aunt Mi Ran, Seung Woo
still won't pick up his phone?

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,820
He won't.
And he hasn't been home, either.

66
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,170
How can you eat in this situation?

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,900
Mi Ran, you've never had any food
at a detention center, right?

68
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,440
You can't even imagine
a huge feast like this in there.

69
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,340
I wanted to eat everything I could
before I went back.

70
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,280
Aren't you worried about Seung Woo?

71
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,320
We can't reach him,

72
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,080
and we have no idea where he is
after he left the funeral hall.

73
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,990
And he never came home, either.

74
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,550
Why should I be worried?

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,020
He's not my child.

76
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,320
Ja Young!

77
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,690
It's obvious.

78
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,630
He must be wasting his life away
at a hotel,

79
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,000
drinking and splurging.

80
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,970
I covered for him until this day.

81
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,540
But now,
I have no reason to do that.

82
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,200
You were the one
who spoiled him all you wanted.

83
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,840
You ruined him.

84
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,040
That's just how he was born.

85
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,850
Many people grew up decently
even if they were spoiled.

86
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,410
See?

87
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,180
He wasn't even
at his father's burial...

88
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,750
just because I said something.

89
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,650
How can he be so ungrateful?

90
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,090
Mom, that's enough.

91
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,660
Is that all you have to say to me?

92
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,530
I did as you asked at the funeral,
but this is my house.

93
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,660
I'm going to say
whatever I want under my roof.

94
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,700
It doesn't matter
if you don't accept him as your son.

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,000
It still doesn't change that
he's the eldest son of the Kangs.

96
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,100
I'll look after him from now on,
so do not meddle with him.

97
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,970
Why would you do that?

98
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,440
Because I'm one of the Kangs,

99
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,540
and he's my nephew.

100
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,150
Other than your aunt,
you're the only Kang left.

101
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,820
Remember that.

102
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,790
How can you smile...

103
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,660
before Dad's funeral portrait?

104
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,260
I know you hate and resent him,
but how can you do that to the deceased?

105
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,130
He loved you.

106
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,300
If he loved me,

107
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,770
how could he have a kid
out of wedlock?

108
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,810
As a woman, don't you understand
how humiliating it is?

109
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,910
I'm not saying
what he did was right.

110
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,020
But he had
a sense of guilt about you,

111
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,290
and he truly loved you.

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,160
Everyone suggested
that he divorce you...

113
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,990
because of the damage
you brought on YL Group,

114
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,130
but he said no. Did you know that?

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,700
He isn't allowed to demand a divorce
as he's the one liable.

116
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,770
You would've been liable
for the divorce.

117
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
What you did was
more than enough to do that.

118
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,400
What did I do?

119
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,310
Don't you know?

120
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,710
I don't.

121
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,580
You killed someone!

122
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,880
I would do that again...

123
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,050
if I had to do it for you.

124
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,850
Stop saying you did it for me.

125
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,750
You aren't doing anything for me.

126
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,450
If anything, you're cornering me.

127
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,520
I'm humiliated to death...

128
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,490
to have you as my mother.

129
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,670
Even my own child...

130
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,270
doesn't understand
how I really feel.

131
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,710
Fine. I live my life alone anyway.

132
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,520
I won't go down like this.

133
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,490
My son.

134
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,460
Wake up, Seung Woo.

135
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,260
It's time to wake up.

136
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,260
Seung Woo.

137
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,200
Don't go, Mom.

138
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,640
Mom, I had a nightmare.

139
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,140
Can you hold my hand? Mom...

140
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,760
Who's my son?

141
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,430
I never gave birth
to a son like you.

142
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,000
Stop calling me your mother!

143
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,900
I do not want to hear this!

144
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,570
You were the one
who tortured me for life.

145
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,370
Do you get it?

146
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,390
Daddy!

147
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,660
Hey, Ji Ho.

148
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,830
Daddy, Mommy said...

149
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,970
we'll stay in Korea
and live with you from now on.

150
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,570
I see.

151
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,810
Please keep an eye on Ji Ho.

152
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,780
Ji Ho, I need to talk to Mommy.

153
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,020
Ji Ho, you haven't had dinner, right?

154
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,420
You can eat dinner with Grandma.

155
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,760
Okay.

156
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,200
That girl...

157
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,770
Why did you suddenly drop this bomb
without talking to me?

158
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,270
Are you calling Ji Ho a bomb?

159
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,180
I'm asking for your intention.

160
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,710
What do you think it is?

161
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,810
I kept telling you about it
again and again.

162
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,380
Didn't you hear me?

163
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,180
- I asked you to give me time...
- Time is always your excuse!

164
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,850
You changed your mind again
after Jae In got pregnant.

165
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,520
Would I ever have my time
if I sat around doing nothing?

166
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,560
I'm trying to save myself.

167
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,530
I need to live
to help Ji Ho survive.

168
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,370
Don't you feel bad for him?

169
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,770
Don't you pity him? He's your son.

170
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,170
I don't want Ji Ho to live
in the shadow anymore.

171
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,540
Ji Ho isn't the bomb. It's you.

172
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,250
Yu Gyeong knows everything
about you and me.

173
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,280
The truth will
come out soon, anyway.

174
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,220
Mother, I'll see you next time.

175
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,260
You don't have to see us off.

176
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,330
Goodbye, Grandma.

177
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,130
Let's go.

178
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,840
Goodness.

179
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,280
I have a headache.

180
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,440
Do you want some painkillers?

181
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,350
I guess he is Gi Chan's son.

182
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,620
He ate only the kind of food
Gi Chan also liked.

183
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,220
Right? He's Hwang Gi Chan Jr.

184
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,560
Jae In would faint
if she found out, right?

185
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,120
Keep your mouth shut.

186
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,690
Don't even say a word.

187
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,130
Mom, I think
I need to get a job done.

188
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,030
Do you need to get a job?

189
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,040
No, I don't mean an actual job.

190
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,800
I want to get something done
to look more luxurious.

191
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,070
In return,
I won't say a word to her.

192
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,580
Fine. Don't you dare say a word.

193
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,910
I'll make you look like
how you were before surgery.

194
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,550
Don't say something that scary.

195
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,890
Thank you, Mom.
I'm going to rest in my room.

196
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,590
Who did
all my troublesome kids take after?

197
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,400
Gosh, not only do I have
a huge headache, I feel stifled.

198
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,000
I can't sit around like this.

199
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,070
I should talk to a shaman.

200
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,070
Why did you go to the funeral hall?

201
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,340
Do you think they'll care?

202
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,280
You already know what they're like.

203
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,750
I know. But it felt so unfair,
so I had to go.

204
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,950
Not only did she kill Do Hee,

205
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,680
but they used the press
to make us seem like the murderers.

206
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,220
I couldn't take it.

207
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,290
It'll only hurt us
if we get emotional.

208
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,330
I must've gone crazy
because all my spite blew up.

209
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,400
I won't do that anymore.
I'll stay level-headed.

210
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,000
And let me know if you need help.

211
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,600
You must want
to take this to the end...

212
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,400
if you got a job at YL Group.

213
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,970
It'll be better to have a partner.

214
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,780
Let me know anytime
if you need my help.

215
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,310
Anyway, when will you tell her that
you quit your job at the hospital?

216
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,580
I'll do it later.

217
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,520
I think Yun Hee noticed already.

218
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,890
Your schedule was all over the place
because of surgery and whatnot...

219
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,090
when you worked there.

220
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,690
She seemed to think
something was weird...

221
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,330
now that you came home regularly...

222
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,560
Yun Hee, you should knock.

223
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,260
You can't just
barge into a grown man's room.

224
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,930
Did you quit your job
at the hospital?

225
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,140
See? I told you she noticed.

226
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,900
I overheard you two.

227
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,640
I'm working at a different clinic.

228
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,540
- Which one?
- I can never have enough time...

229
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,740
while working at a big hospital.

230
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,380
I'd have more time and energy...

231
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,410
to spend time with Bo Ram
if I had regular hours,

232
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,080
and I wanted to relax a little.

233
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,590
I received an offer,
so I decided to take it.

234
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,390
All right. I'm glad you did that.

235
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,560
It would've been better
if you opened your own clinic.

236
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,590
Can you help him out?

237
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,130
- He...
- I don't want that.

238
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,030
If I want to open a clinic,
I want to do it on my own.

239
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,230
If I wanted to ask him for money,
I would've done so long ago.

240
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,100
I'm like a bank teller...

241
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,100
who's always open
to Yun Hee and you.

242
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,940
Let me know
whenever you change your mind.

243
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,510
Okay.

244
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,810
Hey.

245
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,650
Let's just forget
about what happened to Do Hee.

246
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,780
What do you mean, forget it?
Yun Hee.

247
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,350
What I mean is this.

248
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,690
The chairman of YL died,

249
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,490
and his wife will be tried.

250
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,630
The law will be the judge,
so let's give it our faith.

251
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,000
You can stop minding this
and focus on your job.

252
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,630
I'll stop crying, too.

253
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,570
Do Hee is still here with me.

254
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,970
I'll keep her here...

255
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,080
and pull her out
whenever I miss her,

256
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,650
so don't worry about me, either.

257
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,150
Do you understand what I mean?

258
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,320
I do. I'll do as you say.

259
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,060
Good.

260
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,060
From now on,
let's think of Do Hee...

261
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,230
and Bo Ram,

262
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,060
and live bravely with a big smile.

263
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,530
- Okay.
- Okay?

264
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,250
Where's Eun Ho?

265
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,820
He went to the kindergarten.

266
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,820
Did your aunt go to work?

267
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,420
Yes.

268
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,830
They're waiting outside.

269
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,700
I'm not going to flee.

270
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,900
I'll go.

271
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,900
Your father came to see me
a few days before he died.

272
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,710
He asked me about that punk.

273
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,870
He didn't elaborate,

274
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,880
but he must've found out something
and became suspicious.

275
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,550
He didn't say anything to me.

276
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,750
He would've told you
only after he was sure.

277
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,620
That's his biggest strength
and weakness.

278
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,260
At times, prudence can be poisonous.

279
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,660
He approached you
because of our wealth and influence.

280
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,530
These people are
very lowly and despicable.

281
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,960
Don't you get it?

282
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,960
You also sound very lowly...

283
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,700
as someone who likes
to place people in tiers.

284
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,310
You should go.

285
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,310
They're waiting outside.

286
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,830
I'm going to work.

287
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,000
Make sure you eat lunch.

288
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,530
I'm not a kid.

289
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,630
I'll manage, so don't worry.

290
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,400
And call me if you need a hand.

291
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,070
You don't have to mind my business.
Focus on yours.

292
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,080
Hello?

293
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,550
It's me, Kang Mi Ran.

294
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,120
Hello?

295
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,590
I'm listening.
Tell me why you're calling.

296
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,590
If you're free, I'd like to see you.

297
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,360
I want to talk to you in person.

298
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,800
I have no time...

299
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,300
or reason to see you.

300
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,500
Goodbye.

301
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:30,460
(Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)

302
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,740
Don't worry about your business.

303
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,010
Gi Chan will do a great job
as a leader.

304
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,580
And don't worry
about Seung Woo, either.

305
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,880
I will...

306
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,780
take good care of him.

307
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,640
Are you all right?

308
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,810
Please take a seat here.

309
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,160
Why is that man here?

310
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,440
Thank you.

311
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,080
Hey.

312
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,950
My dad passed away.

313
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,890
And yes. Thank you.

314
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,490
My brother told me...

315
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,790
that you provided first aid
when my dad collapsed.

316
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,530
He was YL's chairman.

317
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,030
You knew that, right?

318
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,140
I found out at the hospital
when those reporters swarmed in.

319
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,770
I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable,
so I stayed quiet.

320
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,140
May the deceased rest in peace.

321
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,480
Hang in there.

322
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,990
You always appear before me
whenever times are tough.

323
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,690
It's as if you're my guardian angel.

324
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,130
Thank you so much.

325
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,770
People can only survive...

326
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,040
when a heart attack is treated
within 3 to 4 minutes.

327
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,670
So, I didn't do much.

328
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,380
You still look pale.

329
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,880
I'm fine.

330
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,380
I'm in the early stages
of pregnancy.

331
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,760
You can't leave like this.
Come to the clinic for a moment.

332
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,190
My wife will be here soon.

333
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,230
I don't think
she'll come around quickly.

334
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,130
Do you know him?

335
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,310
He's the guy who helped
when Eun Ho got kidnapped.

336
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,040
I see.
I thought it was something else.

337
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,010
- Something else?
- It takes a woman...

338
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,150
to understand another woman.

339
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,450
He seemed a bit too close to her
to call him...

340
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,850
just a guy who once helped her.

341
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,620
But if you also know him,
I guess it's not like that.

342
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,800
It's rooibos tea.

343
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,970
It's good for anemia.

344
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,940
And these are iron supplements.

345
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,340
Make sure you take them every day.

346
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,870
And...

347
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,280
And this.

348
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,180
Why are you giving me this?

349
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,150
If your father had been alive,

350
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,590
he would've given you this
to celebrate with you.

351
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,960
It suddenly came to me.

352
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,930
Celebrate?

353
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,030
You said you were pregnant.

354
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,870
I must've said something wrong.

355
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,240
Here.

356
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,340
No, you didn't.

357
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,180
I remembered how my dad sent me...

358
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,080
a basket of flowers
when I was pregnant with Eun Ho.

359
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,820
If I had known
he'd pass away so soon,

360
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,680
I would've visited him more often.

361
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,420
I'm sure...

362
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,290
your father already knows
how you feel.

363
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,690
It's getting cold.

364
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,900
Right.

365
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,940
So? Do you like it?

366
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,540
Yes, it's wonderful.

367
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,340
It tastes very rich.

368
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,050
Feel free to drink it every day
instead of water.

369
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,050
Hey.

370
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,690
Hello.

371
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,190
I thought you were coming to see me.
Why are you here?

372
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,390
I was on my way.

373
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,060
Honey, you remember him, right?

374
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,260
- He's the one who saved Eun Ho...
- Stop it.

375
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,930
It happened a while ago.
Stop bringing it up.

376
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,400
Didn't you refuse
to take compensation?

377
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,040
Did you ask my wife
to get you a job here?

378
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,610
Even jokes may sound serious
if you take it too far.

379
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm sorry, Dr. Kim.

380
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,410
Honey, that's not the case.

381
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,280
What's that?

382
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,780
I got it as a present.

383
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,820
He congratulated me
for my pregnancy...

384
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,490
I don't think it's an occasion
for a stranger to celebrate.

385
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,230
Excuse us.

386
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Let's go.

387
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,700
Honey. Hey.

388
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,710
I haven't even started yet,

389
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,110
but he's already suspicious
of his wife?

390
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,040
How interesting.

391
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,750
Can we walk slowly?
And you let go of my hand.

392
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,680
I feel dizzy.

393
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,580
Honey, the employees are watching.

394
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,790
What's going on between you and him?

395
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,260
Last time, you two supposedly
ran into each other by chance,

396
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,430
and now, he got a job
here at the in-house clinic.

397
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,460
How am I supposed to take this?

398
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,330
What are you getting at?

399
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,560
I don't understand...

400
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,570
how you can flirt with another man
after your father passed away.

401
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,870
I got dizzy because of anemia
on my way to your office.

402
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,240
Dr. Kim was there,

403
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,070
so I went to his office
to get iron supplements.

404
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,040
Things have been hectic lately,

405
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,480
so I had forgotten to take
iron supplements...

406
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,980
as recommended by my doctor.

407
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,450
Even so, who does he think he is
to give you flowers?

408
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,080
His intentions don't seem straight.

409
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,420
What intention?

410
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,690
Don't say such nonsense
that he likes me as a woman.

411
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,960
How is that nonsense?

412
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,860
Even married women are still women.

413
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,290
I'm pregnant!

414
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,700
Stop it.

415
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,970
I don't want our child to hear this.

416
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,300
Go home.

417
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,340
I'll talk to you there.

418
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,140
I have to go to a meeting.

419
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,820
An affair?

420
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,620
Who's having an affair?

421
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,790
You brat.

422
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,090
You already know everything.
How dare you lie to my face?

423
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,090
That's what the deity says.

424
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,700
Why are you asking me?
You already know.

425
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,900
But you probably didn't know this.

426
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,900
It's not just one of them.
They're both having an affair.

427
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,740
This couple is having lots of fun.

428
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,480
They're only married on paper.
Their hearts are elsewhere.

429
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,110
Wait, are you saying...

430
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,880
my daughter-in-law is
also having an affair?

431
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,420
Is she no longer supernatural?

432
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,690
What is this nonsense?

433
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,420
Shut your mouth!

434
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,060
That was my deity speaking.

435
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,200
(D...)

436
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,940
(Death)

437
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,740
What does this mean?

438
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,050
It's the character that means death.

439
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,220
Your second son killed someone.

440
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,220
What? That is utter nonsense.

441
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,990
No, that's not true.

442
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,460
You should at least ask him.

443
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,760
The victim is
related to his in-laws,

444
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,230
so you'll have to sever ties...

445
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,430
with your daughter-in-law
before he gets caught.

446
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,030
Get them divorced.

447
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,970
That's the only way
your son will live.

448
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,040
Why would
my perfectly healthy son die?

449
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,810
You keep saying the weirdest things.

450
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,580
Look. Look at this. Death.

451
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,820
What goes around
always comes around.

452
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,620
If he killed someone,
he must die, too.

453
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,020
You must do as I say
if you want him to live.

454
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,220
You said my daughter-in-law was
the biggest luck for our family...

455
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,290
and told us to make sure
we keep her around.

456
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,190
Why are you
suddenly telling me this?

457
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,230
You need to blame your son.

458
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,870
Don't get mad at me
for telling you how he can live.

459
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,000
Well, ma'am.

460
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,240
My daughter-in-law is
pregnant with their second child.

461
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,780
How can I make them divorce?

462
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,680
Can we use talismans
or hold a ritual?

463
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,180
Please hold a ritual
and stop everything from happening.

464
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,580
- I can pay you as much as...
- Do you want...

465
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,120
your son to die?

466
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,350
I would've told you to hold a ritual
if it could work.

467
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,090
You don't even know if the child is
really this family's blood.

468
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,030
Who's more important?
Your son or the kid?

469
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,130
My deity is telling me...

470
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,170
that your son also has
another child out of wedlock.

471
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,940
Well, I wouldn't know.

472
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,110
That kid is something.

473
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,720
He's a very smart one
who'll become a great man.

474
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,790
In ancient days,

475
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,960
he would've made you
the grand queen dowager.

476
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,460
Make sure you treat him well.

477
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,310
Hey, it's me.

478
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,140
Why didn't you come
to the chairman's funeral?

479
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,880
I thought you'd be here.

480
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,150
Something urgent came up,
so I couldn't be there.

481
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,350
- Did the burial end well?
- Yes.

482
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,890
Dad, you're not feeling unwell,
are you?

483
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm fine.

484
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,790
I'm busy right now,
so let's talk later. Bye.

485
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,270
I felt too ashamed...

486
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,440
to say goodbye to him one last time.

487
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,320
This is a surprise.

488
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,220
I didn't see you at the funeral,
so I called to check in.

489
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,990
Are you doing all right?

490
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,350
Why do you ask?

491
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,560
Do you not want me to do well?

492
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,690
Why wouldn't I want you to be well?

493
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,230
You probably want to take
whatever inheritance I leave behind.

494
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,700
Father, that thought
never crossed my mind.

495
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,070
You better not.

496
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,640
I don't have anything
to leave behind,

497
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,470
but even if I do,
I won't leave it for you.

498
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,380
If you're the head of your family,
act like one.

499
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,210
Get yourself together
and live a better life.

500
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,150
If you have nothing more to say,
I'm hanging up.

501
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,390
Man, come on.

502
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,420
Why is everyone hating on me?

503
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,960
What did I do so wrong?

504
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,060
Do you all think I'm a joke?

505
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,110
Ms. Choi did the killing,

506
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
but I still couldn't say
Gi Chan was completely innocent.

507
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,050
But how is the blame on Gi Chan?

508
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,250
It's probably just wrong.

509
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,820
And they're both having affairs?

510
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
Something doesn't seem right.

511
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,030
Who do you think you are?

512
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,800
Who do you think you are, Yu Gyeong?

513
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,600
He's doing that again.

514
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,840
Good grief. If he got drunk,
he should just go to sleep.

515
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,110
Be quiet.

516
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,150
That's enough.
Get inside and go to sleep.

517
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,910
What's enough?

518
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,960
Eun Ho is in this house,
and so is Jae In.

519
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,160
Stop acting like a fool
and go inside.

520
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,900
Hey, did you
just call your husband a fool?

521
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,000
Did you call me a fool?

522
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,340
Will you be really late?

523
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,310
I have a lot of work to catch up on.

524
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,640
I'll call you when I leave.

525
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,740
Okay.

526
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,880
Who do you think you are
to order me around?

527
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,090
Darn it.

528
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,090
You should be grateful
that I still keep you around,

529
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,890
even though you can't have a child.

530
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,030
Why are you harassing me?

531
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,360
You need to stop!

532
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,000
What do you think you're doing?

533
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,140
Are you okay, Yu Gyeong?

534
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,710
Gi Man, have you gone crazy?

535
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,710
How can you use violence
on your wife?

536
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,910
Who did?

537
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,110
Me? I did that?

538
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,320
Yes, you did that.

539
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,250
This is
unbelievably nasty and vulgar.

540
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,690
Goodness. My gosh.

541
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,690
My goodness. What's going on?

542
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,600
Jae In, how can you say
such a brutal thing?

543
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,970
He never acts like this.

544
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,940
You.
Pull yourself together, you punk.

545
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,900
No, let go of me.

546
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,970
Goodness, Jae In. Calm down.

547
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,780
You don't have to raise your voice.
It's not a big deal.

548
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,310
It's a mistake. Yes.

549
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,810
People make mistakes...

550
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,220
every now and then in life, right?

551
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,490
A mistake or an accident,
he still can't resort to violence.

552
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,750
It is a big deal. This is a crime.

553
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,930
Goodness, a crime?
You're making me scared.

554
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,830
I'm sure it is so if you say so.

555
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,370
Yes, you're right. I think so.

556
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,570
But still, we're family.

557
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,240
Aren't we? Just let it go.

558
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,740
Her mother is in prison,

559
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,680
and her father is dead.

560
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,650
So, why is she acting so haughty?

561
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,180
Let's have a seat, Yu Gyeong.

562
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,280
Right here. Be careful.

563
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,290
I'll report him first.

564
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,820
Report him?

565
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,890
We need to make sure
this never happens again.

566
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
I can't just let it go
just because he's family.

567
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,060
It'll happen again.

568
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,800
Goodness, no. What do I do?

569
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,440
- No. Give me that.
- What are you doing, Mother?

570
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,540
- Give it back.
- Darn it.

571
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,640
My gosh! My goodness!

572
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,740
Goodness, Jae In.

573
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,310
I mean, it's not like
he always beats her up.

574
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,780
This was his first time.

575
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,950
If he did this all the time,
why would Yu Gyeong stay...

576
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,960
as someone who had
a good career as a doctor?

577
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,260
Isn't that so?

578
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,790
Just let it go. Okay?

579
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,660
Hey, Jae In. You know me, right?

580
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,700
I'll reprimand him
and teach him a lesson...

581
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,830
so that he never does this again.

582
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,500
Please don't do this
and let it go for my sake.

583
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,910
- Mother.
- You should go inside and rest.

584
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,810
- Goodness.
- Jeez.

585
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,230
Yu Gyeong, my...

586
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,240
Can you... Can you save my baby?

587
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,670
Can you save my baby?

588
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,840
Jae In!

589
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,010
Wake up, Jae In!

590
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,880
Wake up, Jae In!

591
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,220
Jae In!

592
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,760
(Queen's House)

593
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,560
Jae In. Jae In!

594
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,270
And you already know
who'll treasure you...

595
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,870
the most, right?

596
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,070
My gosh. That hurts.

597
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,470
No way.

598
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,880
Aren't you Na Ra's mom?

599
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,580
It's you, right?

600
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:38,010
I need to know what's on your mind
to figure out everything.

601
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,550
Which one of them will it be?

602
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,490
Or do you want to live
with both of them?

603
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,120
What is it?

604
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,260
Did you kill someone?

605
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,990
Did you or didn't you?
