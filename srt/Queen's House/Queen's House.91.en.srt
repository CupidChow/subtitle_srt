(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,040
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,710
(Episode 91)

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,650
The six million dollars you blew
on that land deal.

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,720
This is it! You con artist!

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,190
This money...

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,960
It's that same money?

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,830
Oh Seong, you tell me.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,560
Is it really my money?

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,300
Was it all a con?

12
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,100
That's right.
This is your six million dollars.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,110
You pulled this whole stunt
with my six million dollars?

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,010
Darn it! What a bunch of scumbags!

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
Are you saying
that you were conned...

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,650
and these people are the ones
who did it?

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,020
Gi Chan, call the police.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,320
They're a family of con artists!
They set me up from the start.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,430
How dare you donate my money?

20
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,130
A donation? Who gave you the right!

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,200
How is this your money?

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,430
The seed money for your fortune
in the first place.

23
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,740
Where did that money come from?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,070
Well... That was from...

25
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,440
Some of it was what my husband
left behind.

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,810
You said your husband went bankrupt,
drank to death, and left you broke!

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,550
You begged me for a single room...

28
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,520
where you and your kids can live.

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,520
Listen up, all of you.

30
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,920
Everything you've eaten and drunk,

31
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,190
the whole life of luxury
you've been living...

32
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,660
was paid...

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,860
for with my husband's life!

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,910
Ms. Hwang Na Ra.

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,940
Because of a fire
you accidentally started as a child,

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,550
your house burned down,
and you were traumatized, right?

37
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,380
And that your mother,
Ms. Noh, told you...

38
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,850
that no one died in that accident.
Is that correct?

39
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,290
My mom was clear.

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,830
She was positive that no one died.

41
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,030
Right, Mom?

42
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
No.

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,900
In that fire,

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,630
my father died.

45
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,740
Your mother, Noh Sook Ja,

46
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,670
took the fire insurance payout
in my father's name,

47
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,580
and the life insurance, then ran off
in the middle of the night.

48
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,580
If she had just called for help
when the fire started,

49
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,380
my brother-in-law would have lived.

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,720
And if she had just left
the insurance money alone,

51
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,620
my sister wouldn't have had
to struggle to raise her kids.

52
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,130
Just thinking of the way
you and your family lived...

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,100
makes me want
to set a fire myself too.

54
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,130
But you should be darn grateful
I'm holding myself back.

55
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,130
If you want to call the police,
go ahead.

56
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,740
But there's no proof
that Ms. Noh was scammed.

57
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,380
There are only records
of her depositing the money herself.

58
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,710
And it was the account
for my father's foundation.

59
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,680
Even if you do report it,

60
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,490
I doubt they'd believe it was a scam
when you donated the money yourself.

61
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,520
You little...

62
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,990
And I've already told the press.
By tomorrow morning,

63
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,870
people will know what kind of family
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan comes from.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's enough. Let's go.

65
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,300
I've seen enough
of these disgusting faces.

66
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,970
My eyes will rot.

67
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,480
Because of me,

68
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,180
someone died?

69
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,420
Na Ra, are you okay?

70
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,190
My money.

71
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,590
My money!

72
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,260
My money!

73
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,010
My money.

74
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,810
My money.

75
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,910
Mom, please say something.

76
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,650
Is what they said before all true?

77
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,020
Mom!

78
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
Gi Chan.

79
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,790
What am I going to do
about my money?

80
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,890
What a waste. What will I do?

81
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,430
You're worried
about money right now?

82
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,600
Is it true or not?

83
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
What about the fire?

84
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,870
Did you really steal
the insurance money too?

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,440
Are you out of your mind?

86
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,410
The insurance money? How could you?

87
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,770
This is so humiliating.

88
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,410
Why does my family always have to be
the one dragging me down?

89
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,480
Do you think I did that
just for myself?

90
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,120
It was all for the three of you.

91
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,320
But still,
how could you commit a crime?

92
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,190
Do you know how hard a widow has it
to raise three kids on her own?

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,530
I never had much of an education.

94
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,570
And I had no skills.

95
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,630
Living in a rented room
in the shantytown.

96
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,070
It was nothing more than a roof
over our heads.

97
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,470
We were basically beggars.

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,110
You kids had no idea
we were out of rice.

99
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,250
You were always whining
about being hungry.

100
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,220
You'd whine about being cold,
not knowing we were out of coal.

101
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,120
After I barely managed
to feed the three of you,

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,420
I'd fill my own stomach
with tap water.

103
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,190
But still...

104
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,630
Na Ra was so hungry that she snuck
into a place to steal some food,

105
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,600
and she knocked over
the portable stove.

106
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,070
A fire started in an instant,

107
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,600
and I was terrified
I was going to die too.

108
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,670
I barely made it out with Na Ra.

109
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,110
Was it wrong for me
to fight to survive?

110
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,650
Should we have just died in there?

111
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,020
Fine. I stole the insurance money.

112
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,050
When I saw a chance to get money,
I couldn't see straight.

113
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,520
If it wasn't for that money,
all three of you would be dead.

114
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,090
Without it,
I couldn't have sent you to school.

115
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,530
Law school, becoming a prosecutor...

116
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,530
you couldn't have even
dreamed of it.

117
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,500
I'm so sick and tired of being poor.

118
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,740
That's why I fought tooth and nail
to survive.

119
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,670
I did bad things and broke the law.

120
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,180
Just to survive.

121
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,950
Was it wrong for me
to live like that for you?

122
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,790
My money!

123
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,820
My money!

124
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,690
My hard-earned money!

125
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,670
Na Ra, what's wrong?

126
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,210
Are you crying?

127
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,650
Are you okay?

128
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,000
I thought you went to sleep early
after preschool,

129
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,940
but I guess the noise woke you up.

130
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,670
Yes, I want to go play
with Gi Man now.

131
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,910
Ji Ho, you want to play with me?

132
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,820
Ji Ho.

133
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,420
Besides this toy,
is there anything else you want?

134
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,090
A toy?

135
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,490
Ji Ho?

136
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,490
Dad.

137
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
What are you doing in Ji Ho's room?

138
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,040
He seemed bored by himself,
so I was keeping him company.

139
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,240
What's he doing in here?

140
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,580
He was looking after Ji Ho for me.

141
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,610
And where's the rest of the family?

142
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,450
Something came up.

143
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,050
Ji Ho, did you have fun
playing with him?

144
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,990
Yes, it was fun.

145
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,190
Ji Ho. Let's play again sometime.

146
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
I should get going.

147
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,570
Just hearing about it
is so satisfying.

148
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,170
You know that saying,
"What goes around, comes around?"

149
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,740
Eventually,
you get what's coming to you.

150
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,610
Yun Hee, I feel like a weight
I've carried for 50 years is gone.

151
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,720
I won't have to feign a smile
in front of Noh Sook Ja anymore.

152
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,490
My face would cramp up
from faking it.

153
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,660
I know you've been through a lot.

154
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,030
Your brother-in-law will thank you.

155
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,330
You think so?

156
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,930
Brother-in-law, don't mention it.
I just did what had to be done.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,130
Just buy me a drink
next time you see me.

158
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,140
It's good to see you smile.

159
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,010
Mother, today is a good day.

160
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,680
You finally brought justice
for Father.

161
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,380
You're right.
The grudge is done. What a good day.

162
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,020
Right, did you tell them
you met Tae Oh?

163
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,060
I think he's staying
at Hwang Gi Chan's place.

164
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,930
Of all places, why that house?

165
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,260
I heard he dated Kang Se Ri, right?

166
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,230
You think there's still
something between them?

167
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,670
I don't think so.

168
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
No.

169
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,810
You should head in.

170
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,410
It's close by. I'll give you a ride.

171
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,980
I think that'd be best.

172
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,420
Ms. Jung may not show it,

173
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,850
but she must be going through a lot.

174
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,760
Losing Do Hee must have been
devastating enough,

175
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,290
but her husband dying like that...

176
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,730
I can't imagine how difficult it is.

177
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,430
Please be there for her.

178
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,300
Thanks for looking after Bo Ram
so well today.

179
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,970
If anything, I should be the one
thanking Bo Ram.

180
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,940
Being with Bo Ram is so therapeutic.

181
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,410
She puts me at ease.

182
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,310
About Lee Tae Oh...

183
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,320
Do you know why he's staying
at Hwang Gi Chan's place?

184
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,490
No.

185
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,760
I have a hunch,
but I'm not entirely sure.

186
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,090
What is it?

187
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,630
I'm not positive.

188
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,330
I'll tell you when I know for sure.

189
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,570
You should get going.

190
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,630
Okay.

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,710
Jae In.

192
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,280
I think Tae Oh said something
about you being his "destiny."

193
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,880
Is there a story behind that?

194
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,420
It's nothing.
There's no story behind it.

195
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,660
Why the sudden question?

196
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,530
No reason.

197
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,830
I was just curious.

198
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm so furious.

199
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,770
It's so unfair!

200
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,670
I was so upset
that I couldn't sleep a wink.

201
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,410
It's all false information.

202
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,750
Tell them it's all
completely baseless.

203
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,580
The arson, the insurance fraud...

204
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,820
All of it!

205
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm telling you to kill every one
of those articles.

206
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,920
Did those jerks really
get the press to publish all that?

207
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,490
The statute of limitations,
whatever,

208
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,930
has already expired for all that,

209
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,130
and it's not that big of a deal.

210
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,570
Besides, I was a victim
of the fraud too.

211
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,670
If anyone should be punished,
it's them.

212
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,700
This isn't about
whether or not we get punished.

213
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,610
This is Kim Do Yun's family
we're dealing with!

214
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,910
We've just handed DH Holdings
the perfect excuse to come after us.

215
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,350
We look like fools to Lee Tae Oh.
What is this mess?

216
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,780
Mr. Lee...

217
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,350
wouldn't back out of selling
the paintings over this, would he?

218
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,120
He didn't say anything
when he left for work, though.

219
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,630
If he does ask you anything,

220
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,790
just tell him it never happened,

221
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,360
that you're the victim
who was framed.

222
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,430
Okay.

223
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,970
Ugly lady.

224
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,000
Why are you still crying today?

225
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,180
Don't cry. You'll look even uglier.

226
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Gi Man.

227
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,520
It's all my fault.

228
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,290
Because I started the fire,

229
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,490
someone died.

230
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,760
But I'm not dead.

231
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,860
I really had no idea.

232
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,800
I really didn't know
someone had died.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,240
I didn't even know
my mom took the insurance money.

234
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,340
What am I supposed to do, Gi Man?

235
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,610
I'm so scared.

236
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,850
What am I going to do?

237
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,500
Mom, these are all presents for you!

238
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,430
So, what I have here...

239
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,100
are almonds and walnuts,

240
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,610
so you have to eat them every day.
Don't forget, okay?

241
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,240
That's what will make you healthy.

242
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
Here.

243
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,260
How is it? Good, right?

244
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Yes.

245
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
It's delicious.

246
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,970
And this is a jigsaw puzzle.

247
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,170
You like art, don't you, Mom?

248
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,010
It turns into an amazing picture
when you finish it.

249
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,740
Do you want to do it together?

250
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,210
I don't want to.

251
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,280
Maybe later.

252
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,280
Why not? Let's play it together.

253
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,320
Go to work.

254
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,920
What are you going to do
if you're late?

255
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,720
If Dad scolds me, so be it.
I have you, Mom.

256
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,730
Mom.

257
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,270
I love you more than anyone
in the world, Mom.

258
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,300
I'm not kidding.
I really, really love you.

259
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,940
So, Mom,

260
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,850
you can't get sick, okay?

261
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,150
You have to stay healthy.

262
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,220
And you can't forget me.

263
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,320
I would be so heartbroken
if you did.

264
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,490
Seung Woo...

265
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,300
Mom, promise me one thing.

266
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,370
Since I'm your son,

267
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,270
and I'm going to protect you
until the very end,

268
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,670
please stay by my side
for a long, long time.

269
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Come on.

270
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,020
Like this.

271
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,050
We made a promise.

272
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,800
Seung Woo is gone.

273
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,870
Yes.

274
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,110
Do you remember
that Seung Woo was just here?

275
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,150
Does Seung Woo know
about my condition?

276
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
Yes.

277
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,530
So, I guess everyone knows now.

278
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,100
I suppose I can't hide it anymore.

279
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,970
Lately, Seung Woo...

280
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,870
comes to see you every day
before work.

281
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,370
He brings snacks,

282
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,210
flowers, and books.

283
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,810
I always thought
he was just an immature kid,

284
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,450
but he's turned out so well.

285
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,590
You did a wonderful job raising him.

286
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,260
It's not just the PR Team.

287
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,100
The company's phone lines
are blowing up.

288
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,430
They're just rumors.

289
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,370
We'll find a way
to make them die down.

290
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,110
Are you trying to gaslight me
into thinking this is fake news?

291
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,880
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

292
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,620
that won't work. I know too much
about you and your family.

293
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,090
Do you really think you can
pull the wool over my eyes?

294
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,890
There's a limit to the family issues
of an owner we can tolerate.

295
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,790
Stop tarnishing
YL Group's reputation,

296
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,360
and at this point, shouldn't you
have the decency to step down?

297
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,230
Don't just pay lip service
to doing what's best for YL Group.

298
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,900
Stepping down
is the right thing to do.

299
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,930
Have you no sense of responsibility?

300
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,610
I will find a way to contain this.

301
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,110
Suit yourself.

302
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,650
I can already see how this is going
to end anyway.

303
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,680
Go ahead and put up
one last desperate fight.

304
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,790
There's no point in talking to you.
I'm leaving.

305
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,490
I'm sorry, Aunt.

306
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,490
This is a place of business.

307
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,490
Address me by my proper title.

308
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,500
That word, "Aunt,"

309
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,100
refrain from using it
in my presence.

310
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,130
Oh, right.

311
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,540
I've received...

312
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,470
Designer L's final design proposal.

313
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,310
Apparently, she wants
to terminate her project contract...

314
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,680
with YL Group.

315
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,510
Extend it.

316
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,610
Arrange for her
to take on a new project.

317
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,190
As long as Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
is at YL Group,

318
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,790
she made it very clear that
she will not sign another contract.

319
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,510
Jae In knows, by the way,
that you're staying at that house.

320
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,970
I didn't see any reason to hide it.

321
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,680
Is that a problem?

322
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,980
It's not so much a problem
as something to be careful about.

323
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,420
You know that we're investigating
Kang Se Ri, correct?

324
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,350
Look, I can take a hint.
I have no intention of being a spy.

325
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,660
I haven't said a single word
to Kang Se Ri about this.

326
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,500
You may not trust me,
but you trust Jae In, don't you?

327
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,830
I trust Kang Jae In too.

328
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,570
You have a point.

329
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,800
I trust Kang Jae In too.

330
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,870
I trust Jae In too.

331
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,510
Okay.

332
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,740
Now that you know our position,
please be careful.

333
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,750
Will do.

334
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,780
- Well, I have a meeting to get to.
- Right, go ahead.

335
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Jae In.

336
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,230
Where are you off to?

337
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,830
To a meeting. Where are you off to?

338
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,000
To the office.

339
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,230
I just submitted
the final design proposal,

340
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,470
and my contract with YL Group
ends this week.

341
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,410
Does that mean you'll be working out
of our office now?

342
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,970
That's the plan.

343
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,140
Starting next week.

344
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,110
Why?

345
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,320
I'm just happy I'll get to see you
every day.

346
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,650
Was it that obvious?

347
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,370
You're going to be late
for your meeting. Go on.

348
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,040
All right, I'm going.

349
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,340
Okay.

350
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,430
What are you doing?

351
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,700
Let go of me.

352
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,570
Let go!

353
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,140
What do you think you're doing?

354
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,470
And what about you?

355
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,970
This is the office.

356
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,710
It's not a place for you
to be dating.

357
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,540
Don't you have more to worry
about than me?

358
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,950
Your mother
is really something else.

359
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,550
She just watched someone die
without trying to save them,

360
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,990
and then she had the nerve to steal
the life insurance money?

361
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,250
Is that what Kim Do Yun told you?

362
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,160
Don't believe a word that guy says.

363
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,860
That was over 20 years ago.

364
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,360
How do you know he isn't just making
baseless accusations?

365
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,430
Noh Sook Ja and Hwang Na Ra.
They're witnesses. Is that baseless?

366
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,530
You're the one making
baseless claims.

367
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,740
So you're just going to believe...

368
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,840
everything Kim Do Yun says?

369
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,270
What is he to you?

370
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,310
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

371
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,810
I told you that I love you.

372
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,950
And I made myself clear.

373
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,950
Don't you dare say that to me.

374
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,520
You don't have the right
to say those words.

375
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,090
Doesn't that mean
he doesn't have the right either?

376
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,330
Setting aside the fire incident,

377
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,560
his own sibling died,

378
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,360
and yet he's obsessed with you.
Is that normal?

379
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,700
The guy's insane.

380
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,140
Think about why he approached you.
To investigate Kim Do Hee's death,

381
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,700
or to get his revenge.

382
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,770
That's not exactly pure love, is it?

383
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,810
Am I wrong?

384
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,350
I loved you.

385
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,580
If it hadn't been for your mother...

386
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,520
If I hadn't been so disrespected,

387
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,960
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

388
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,930
So you're saying
this is all my mom's fault?

389
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,100
You're wrong.
Don't try to shift the blame.

390
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,630
My mom tried to accept you.

391
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,470
She did before we got married,

392
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,100
and she made it clear to me
even after.

393
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,810
If I were to have regrets...

394
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,810
I do have regrets.

395
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,080
I do regret it.

396
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,550
I, too,

397
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,190
deserve to love you.

398
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,730
You psycho.

399
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,160
Leaving all that aside,
do you know why...

400
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,130
Do Yun is qualified, and you're not?

401
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,540
At least,
Do Yun isn't a married man.

402
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,410
Because I'm not Kang Se Ri.

403
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,480
I don't have a twisted hobby
of stealing what isn't mine.

404
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,240
Why did you call for me?

405
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,170
It's exciting when you call for me.

406
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,380
You must be having a hard time
because of your mother.

407
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,780
I heard Na Ra and Gi Man
talking this morning.

408
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,820
The statute of limitations
has expired.

409
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,350
She should've just denied it.

410
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,950
Your mother is so naive sometimes.

411
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,160
It just made things more difficult
for you for no reason.

412
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,490
Honey, people will forget
all about this in time.

413
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,890
Don't worry too much.

414
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Let's get a divorce.

415
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,430
I said, let's get a divorce.

416
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,130
Honey.

417
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,100
Leave Ji Ho here. I'll raise him.

418
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden?

419
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,270
Why do you take your anger
over your mother out on me?

420
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,910
I did nothing wrong.

421
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,840
You know full well
this isn't sudden.

422
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,180
We just happen to live
in the same house.

423
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,620
We haven't been a real couple
for a long time.

424
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,520
Let's just finalize this
with an uncontested divorce.

425
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,050
I can't divorce you.

426
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,160
How could you possibly raise Ji Ho
by yourself?

427
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,990
I'm going to try to start over
with Jae In.

428
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:17,560
Is that what Kang Jae In told you?

429
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,430
Did she tell you to divorce me
and get back together with her?

430
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,830
Snap out of it, Hwang Gi Chan!

431
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,700
Do you think you two can get back
together just because you want to?

432
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,870
Kang Jae In can't stand
the sight of you.

433
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,580
You know that better than anyone.

434
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,280
- Be realistic.
- I don't care.

435
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,480
I'll make her come back to me
one way or another.

436
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,720
All I have to do is make it happen.

437
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,180
I can't get a divorce.

438
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,920
No, I won't.

439
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,550
So you two can be happy?

440
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,260
It'll be better for you
to end this on good terms.

441
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,630
I've said my piece.

442
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,230
You can go now.

443
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,270
See Kang Jae In all you want.

444
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,440
Then, she gets to be
the other woman this time.

445
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,280
I am never divorcing you.

446
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,090
You're still up?

447
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,930
I couldn't get to sleep.

448
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,330
I saw the light on
and thought I'd come in.

449
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,430
Well then, care for a drink?

450
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,970
I'm sorry for all the chaos
in the house these past two days.

451
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Everything you've seen and heard
is not true.

452
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,310
There's no evidence,

453
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,350
and if anything,
we're the ones who were defrauded.

454
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,850
You don't need to explain yourself
to me.

455
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,890
I don't really pay attention
to gossip.

456
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,220
That's very wise of you.

457
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,060
I heard you decided to collaborate
with Designer L?

458
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,270
Yes. It looks like I'll be staying
in Korea longer because of it.

459
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,610
I was just having a drink
with Chairman Hwang.

460
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,110
Why don't you join us?

461
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,920
Honey, your stomach is upset.
Don't drink too much.

462
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,430
I can take care of myself. I'm fine.

463
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,260
I heard that CEO Jung Oh Seong
of DH Holdings found his son,

464
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,630
did you know?

465
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,800
Yes, I know.

466
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,670
He didn't even know his son existed,

467
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,670
but he's found out recently.

468
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,880
I heard he was overjoyed,
knowing he had a son was enough.

469
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,880
Well, he's his son.

470
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,880
It's hard to explain,

471
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,650
but there's something
about a blood connection.

472
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,050
It's like a magnetic pull.

473
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,120
A magnetic pull?

474
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,160
Exactly. I think that's it.

475
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,060
Actually, I only just found out
you have a son.

476
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,100
A son?

477
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,970
You mean your son?

478
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Yes.

479
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,700
It's a case similar to CEO Jung's.

480
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,210
I truly had no idea, but a son...

481
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
is out there.

482
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,020
So it was my first love,
and she got married.

483
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,620
The man she married believes
the boy is his own son.

484
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,960
If you were in my shoes,
what would you do?

485
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,170
Should I tell them
I'm the real father?

486
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,200
Well...

487
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,140
If you didn't know,
that would be one thing,

488
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,470
but now you do,
shouldn't you tell them?

489
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,280
What do you think I should do?

490
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,440
Should I tell them?

491
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,350
You have to think this
through carefully.

492
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,350
Your selfish ways
could ruin a family.

493
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,420
Your son could end up miserable.

494
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,620
A love built on a lie like that
is wrong from the start.

495
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,260
If she'd been honest at first,
it'd be different.

496
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,430
A family built on a lie like that
won't last.

497
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,430
The truth is bound
to come out eventually,

498
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,870
so it's best to tell him soon.

499
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,600
I see.

500
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,270
This is helping me clear my head.

501
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,250
I'm heading out.
Keep an eye on the house.

502
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,690
Okay. Will you be back late?

503
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
I don't know.

504
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,830
My mind is in turmoil.
I need to go pray with all my heart.

505
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,060
- What about Na Ra?
- She's in her room, not coming out.

506
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,670
Gi Man, what are you doing?

507
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,340
Mom, can't I stay home?

508
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,010
Doing the 108 bows is too hard.

509
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,180
My legs hurt, my head hurts,
and my knees hurt too.

510
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,750
You have to pray with devotion
so that the deities will be moved...

511
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,350
and maybe fix
that messed-up head of yours.

512
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,420
You should've been more careful.
Why did you have to miss a step?

513
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,130
Mom, I wasn't going down the stairs.

514
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,190
- I was pushed.
- Not this again.

515
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,830
But it's true.

516
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,970
Right?

517
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Isn't that right?

518
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,800
How would I know?

519
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,670
You're the one who pushed me.

520
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,080
She really pushed you?

521
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,350
Yes, in my dream, a witch pushed me.

522
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,220
For goodness' sake.

523
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,590
Come on.

524
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,160
Mom, you're like a leopard.

525
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,090
Since I was treated to such a great
home-cooked meal,

526
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,830
today is definitely on me.

527
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,970
What would you like?
I heard something here is amazing.

528
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,210
Kang Seung Woo.

529
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,270
Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

530
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,580
Listen.

531
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,550
What I'm trying to say is...

532
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,850
I'm...

533
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,190
I'm your father.

534
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,500
This again?
You're practicing for acting, right?

535
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,270
That performance felt so real.

536
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,900
Is the date for the play set?

537
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,440
When can I come see it?

538
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,040
Well, it's definitely the real deal.

539
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,380
Sorry.

540
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,050
I'm late, aren't I?

541
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,090
I didn't know you were coming too.

542
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,020
What's going on here?

543
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,030
Something smells fishy.

544
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,930
Are you two dating?

545
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,940
We are dating.

546
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
No way!

547
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,810
Then shouldn't you two
be buying me dinner?

548
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,080
You haven't told him yet, have you?

549
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,680
Do you want me to?

550
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,190
No.

551
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

552
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,060
I'm not rehearsing for a play,

553
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,030
and I'm not messing with you.

554
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,300
I am...

555
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,100
I'm really your father.

556
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,480
Let me introduce myself properly.

557
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,350
It's nice to finally meet you.

558
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,020
Son.

559
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,330
Is this for real?

560
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,230
I know this is a huge shock.

561
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,930
I was too.

562
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,470
That I had a son,

563
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,540
and that he was you.

564
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,110
I've only recently found out myself.

565
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,520
Honestly, I never saw this coming.

566
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,590
I mean, I thought you two
might have a history, but...

567
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,830
I'm sorry.

568
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,300
I just don't know what to say
right now.

569
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,530
There's no rush.

570
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,430
I don't want
to pressure you, either.

571
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,900
Just say what's on your mind
when you're ready.

572
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,830
You're so smart.

573
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,000
Then, where should I put mine?

574
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,530
I can't just leave him like this.

575
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,880
Ji Ho, go have a snack and play.
That coffee is for Tae Oh, okay?

576
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Okay.

577
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,060
Mom, he fell asleep reading to me.

578
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,430
He must've been very tired.

579
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,330
Ji Ho, why don't you
go watch cartoons...

580
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,230
so he can get some rest?

581
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,640
When he wakes up,
tell him I'm watching cartoons.

582
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,110
Okay.

583
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,220
(Queen's House)

584
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,990
I really didn't know.

585
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,260
I didn't know anyone was being hurt
because of what I did.

586
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,190
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

587
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,760
It belongs to Hwang Na Ra.

588
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,600
I guess there's at least
one sane person in that family.

589
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,230
How could it all have been a lie?

590
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,240
You jerk. You absolute monster!

591
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,340
Say something!
I said, say something!

592
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,240
- Did you ever even love me?
- And I'm not at all sorry to say,

593
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,610
but there was never a single moment
I had feelings for you.

594
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,450
Tae Oh isn't here either.

595
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,120
Where did he go?

596
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,790
If you're so curious, why don't you
call and ask him yourself?

597
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,360
