(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,790
(Episode 18)

5
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,590
Is my baby okay?

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,530
There's no problem, right?

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,360
You should gather yourself first.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,930
We can talk later. Okay?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,740
She should've been careful.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,140
Mother.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,440
She'll find out anyway. Shushing me
won't stop her from finding out.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,080
Jae In, Eun Ho's younger sibling...

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,520
is not with us anymore. Goodness.

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,520
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,060
My baby, I'm sorry. No...

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,930
Mommy's sorry.

17
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,900
I'm sorry, my baby.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,400
I'm sorry...

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,470
What happened?

20
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,600
Honey...

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,840
What do we do? Our baby...

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,450
I'm such an awful mother.

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,850
I didn't give it
a baby bump nickname.

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,690
Things have been hectic,
but that can't be my excuse.

25
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,290
What kind of an awful mother am I?

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,520
Honey...

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,600
Honey...

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,870
What happened?

29
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,400
Well, the thing is...

30
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,140
Yu Gyeong is the problem. It's her.

31
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,410
- Mother.
- I'm not wrong.

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,010
You should've done a better job
at serving your husband.

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,410
He always blows up in despair...

34
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,880
because you treat him like dirt
all the time.

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,090
Who cares if you're a doctor? Gosh.

36
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,720
There are
millions of doctors out there,

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,320
and clinics are in every corner.

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,490
You were the one
who treated him like dirt.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,460
You only call him your eldest son,
but you never treat him like one.

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,830
That's not the real problem.

41
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,300
You pushed Jae In...

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,500
Shut your mouth!

43
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,130
How dare you slander me?

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,110
Honey.

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,030
No.

46
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,060
Jae In. Jae In!

47
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,150
Mother is waiting for you.
You should go home.

48
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,950
You need to look after Eun Ho, too.

49
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,950
Then, please take care of her.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,690
- I'll be back in the morning.
- All right. Goodbye.

51
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,940
Hey, Yu Gyeong.
Jae In wouldn't pick up her phone.

52
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,600
I was worried,
thinking something had happened.

53
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,240
You're so shameless.

54
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,040
Are you really worried about her?

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Jae In lost her baby
and got hospitalized.

56
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,210
She can't come to the phone.
Goodbye.

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,320
Who was that?

58
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,690
It was Se Ri.

59
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,130
Jae In, the more I get to know her,

60
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,090
the less trustworthy she seems
as a friend.

61
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,100
You should keep a distance.

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,700
You two were only close
when you were much younger.

63
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,510
I'm sorry for waking you up.
Go back to sleep.

64
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,150
Have I been too nice to her?
Does she think she's above me?

65
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,250
How dare she scream at me like that?

66
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,380
Jae In also has quite a temper.

67
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,490
Good grief.

68
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,420
Goodnight.

69
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,060
Have a seat for a moment.

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,590
I have to check something with you.

71
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,430
What is it?

72
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,500
Did you kill someone?

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,340
I killed someone?

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,870
Who said that?

75
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,940
Did you or didn't you?

76
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,840
I heard it was someone involved
with Jae In's family.

77
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,280
Is that right?

78
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,480
Who told you this nonsense?

79
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,950
Who was it?

80
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,520
Well, I had a talk with my shaman,

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,120
and she said you killed someone.

82
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,860
I wondered if I should buy talismans
or hold a ritual if it were true,

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,530
but it mustn't be true.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,760
Go to sleep.

85
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,200
She even guessed that
you had a child out of wedlock,

86
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,200
so I thought it could be true.

87
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,140
She knew you were having an affair
and that you had a son...

88
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,740
with that woman.

89
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,650
So, she must have
supernatural powers.

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,880
But she also said
you two were both cheating.

91
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,790
Both you and Jae In.

92
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,290
She said you two were
each having fun elsewhere.

93
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,660
I have no business with her
if her power is no longer steady.

94
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,590
I should find a better one.

95
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,500
You should get the talisman.

96
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,000
What?

97
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,400
Get the talisman.

98
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,340
I mean, why not?

99
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,970
What?

100
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,050
The shaman must've been right.

101
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,020
The victim is
related to his in-laws,

102
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,720
so you'll have to sever ties...

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,450
with your daughter-in-law
before he gets caught.

104
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,890
Get them divorced.

105
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,190
That's the only way
your son will live.

106
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,260
- What are you doing, Mom?
- My gosh!

107
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,960
Clear your throat or something.

108
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,700
You surprised me to death.

109
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,240
I woke up and came out to get water.
Why are you mad at me?

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,370
Jeez. You need to throw out
that white nightdress.

111
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,410
It's hard to tell
if you're a human or a ghost.

112
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,610
Gosh, this will be the death of me.

113
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,020
Wait, why should I die?

114
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,080
I'll live a healthy life
in this wonderful world...

115
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,320
until I'm well over 100.

116
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,520
But I have to save my son
to save myself, too.

117
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,390
What do I do?

118
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,660
(Somang Forest Memorial Park)

119
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,340
(The late Kim Do Hee)

120
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,110
I don't know who this is,
but it's nice to know...

121
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,750
someone remembers you.
I feel grateful.

122
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,450
Bo Ram is doing well.

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,860
Look at her.
She's grown a lot, right?

124
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,960
(The late Kim Do Hee)

125
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,290
She's been doing well
at her kindergarten,

126
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,530
and she's been taking
art lessons, too.

127
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,600
She drew you.

128
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,470
Isn't she talented?

129
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,140
I remember how
you once wanted to study art, too.

130
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,580
She must've taken after you.

131
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,570
What?

132
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,440
Where...

133
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,080
(Kim)

134
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,920
Hello?

135
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,490
Hello?

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,800
Yes, Kim.

137
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,500
Isn't this Ms. Kang's phone?

138
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,070
She's not here right now.
She left her phone.

139
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,710
Who should I tell her it was
once she returns?

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,080
It's all right.
I'll call her back later.

141
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,550
- Please excuse me.
- Hello? Please don't hang up...

142
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
What was that?
He hung up in a hurry.

143
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,520
Who could it be?

144
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,730
I don't think
he's Eun Ho's kindergarten teacher.

145
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,500
You don't even know if the child is
really this family's blood.

146
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,570
Who's more important?
Your son or the kid?

147
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,240
This means the kid
wasn't Gi Chan's baby.

148
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,470
This is why people say
you can't trust anybody.

149
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,650
She always acted like she was the nicest
and most upright person,

150
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,310
yet she was doing things
behind my back!

151
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,880
Gosh, I'm so furious.

152
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,120
This girl...

153
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,420
Mother.

154
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,130
Where's Gi Chan?

155
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,330
He's at work.

156
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,600
Let me have that.

157
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,740
Were you expecting
an important call?

158
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,210
The first thing you want
after you return home is your phone.

159
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,170
Whose call is it?

160
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,080
I thought Seung Woo might call.

161
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,420
I'm sorry, Mother.

162
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,790
For what?

163
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,760
Did you do something
you should apologize for?

164
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,320
It's all my fault.

165
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,290
You always wanted to see
Eun Ho's younger sibling,

166
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,160
but I hadn't been paying
enough attention.

167
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,970
You must feel grieved over the loss.
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,740
You don't seem well.
You should go and get some rest.

169
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,510
I have to get ready to go out.

170
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,150
That little...

171
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,430
We're at work, but let me discuss
something more private.

172
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,530
Sure.

173
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,060
Aren't you worried about Seung Woo?

174
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Even after all this,
he still is Jae In's brother.

175
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,200
He's a grown man.

176
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,610
He may lose his way for a while,

177
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,510
but it's not a big deal...

178
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,940
What's a bigger deal right now
than Seung Woo, who left home?

179
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,810
Jae In lost our baby last night.

180
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,820
Where is she right now?

181
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,550
Is she at the hospital?

182
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,760
The doctor said
she should stay longer,

183
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,760
but she refused and got discharged.

184
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,760
You should've called me.

185
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,160
Things happened too quickly.

186
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,600
She thinks all recent events were...

187
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,600
So, she became
even more stressed out...

188
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,430
after she had...

189
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,500
a miscarriage.

190
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,840
I was too sensitive. I'm sorry.

191
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,810
It's all right.

192
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,280
I've been looking for Seung Woo,

193
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,510
so don't worry too much.

194
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,220
And as you know,
the chairman's office is vacant.

195
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,860
It may cause an inconvenience
in doing business outside,

196
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,190
so there will be
an extraordinary board meeting soon.

197
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,860
Before we elect the actual chairman,

198
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,560
someone will have to take office
as the acting chairperson.

199
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,430
I want to ask for your support.

200
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,640
I thought it should be
either you or me.

201
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,910
It should be someone in the family.

202
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,350
It's just an acting chairperson,
but if you want to take office,

203
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,520
I'll show you my support.

204
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,590
No, I don't think
that position is for me.

205
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,420
But you'll have to convince
the other board members.

206
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,990
I will.

207
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,760
It's just awful.

208
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,770
- Goodness.
- My gosh. That hurts.

209
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,200
My gosh. Are you hurt?

210
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,700
You need to watch
where you're going!

211
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,840
What were you looking at?

212
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,970
I'm so sorry.
I must've missed you as I rushed out.

213
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,110
It's fine. Forget it.

214
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,480
Let me see you. Did you get hurt?

215
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,310
- Stop it.
- Will you turn around?

216
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,080
I said I was fine. What's with you?

217
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,150
- Will you turn...
- Jeez.

218
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,720
Darn it.

219
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,890
"Darn it?"

220
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,320
Aren't you Na Ra's mom?

221
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,030
It's you, right?

222
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,560
You have the wrong person.

223
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,430
By any chance, did you live
in Changsi-dong long ago?

224
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
It's been about 30 years now.

225
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,340
That woman
used to say that all the time.

226
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,840
"Darn it."

227
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,900
Darn...

228
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,440
No, I've never heard
of such a rundown neighborhood.

229
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,710
Excuse me.

230
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,480
She looks like her.

231
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,920
Maybe not.

232
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,320
How did she know the neighborhood
was rundown? I didn't even say it.

233
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,860
It was Na Ra's mom.

234
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,290
I heard she became a success.
So, she's trying to forget her past.

235
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,490
If she wants to be a stranger,

236
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,960
then I shall
let her remain a stranger.

237
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,170
Darn it.

238
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,210
Why did that woman suddenly show up
only to give me a headache?

239
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,780
Gosh, she was really strong,
like a wrestling champion.

240
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,950
But she used to be
such a docile woman.

241
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,320
She seemed to have become
very unsophisticated.

242
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,360
And where did this punk go
after locking up the business?

243
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,560
Hello, Mother.

244
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,600
Good grief. I have a headache.

245
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,570
My life is now filled with
a series of incidents and accidents.

246
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,110
What kind of a bomb
are you here to drop today?

247
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,470
I was worried about Gi Chan.

248
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,540
You need to see this first.

249
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,710
What?

250
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,020
He's the man who saved Eun Ho
when he got kidnapped.

251
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,450
They must've been in touch
since that time.

252
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,420
I took that photo by chance
last time.

253
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,490
YL Group recently established
an in-house medical team,

254
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,200
and he became a part of it.

255
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,900
He's a doctor.

256
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,970
Doesn't it seem odd?

257
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,500
Why would a doctor
choose to work for a company?

258
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,470
I also found it odd
that they kept seeing each other.

259
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,010
I have no idea what they're up to.

260
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,250
What if Jae In
demands a divorce first?

261
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,920
- Divorce?
- Yes.

262
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,120
Gi Chan may end up with nothing
if she divorces him.

263
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,960
Everything the shaman said was true.

264
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,290
Because I already bribed
that shaman.

265
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,730
My son won't go down that easily.

266
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,600
Exactly.

267
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,870
We should do it first
before anything happens to him.

268
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,470
Mother.

269
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,970
Don't you want Gi Chan to become
the chairman of YL Group?

270
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,950
People who become overly ambitious
never end well,

271
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,320
but I'll hear you out.

272
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,790
Gi Chan held out despite
the humiliation and trouble...

273
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,990
his in-laws gave him
to protect YL Group.

274
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,090
Think of how tough
that must have been.

275
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,800
And I was the one
who was there for him.

276
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm ready to give my life...

277
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,470
to make him YL's chairman.

278
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,770
No, I can even sacrifice my life...

279
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,340
for his sake.

280
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,530
Hello, Dr. Do Yu Gyeong.

281
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,130
Hey, come on in.

282
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,270
What brings you here?

283
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,110
I had a seminar nearby,
so I thought I'd stop by.

284
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,110
I fell and hurt myself.

285
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,380
Let me see that.

286
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,680
I always carry around first aid.

287
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,190
Hey, it's all right. I'll do it.

288
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,390
I'll do it for you.

289
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,290
Show me your hand.

290
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,510
All done.

291
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,240
Hey, Yu Gyeong.

292
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,810
Thanks.

293
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,020
I should thank you.

294
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,350
Thank you.

295
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,760
When Do Hee got into that accident,

296
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,190
you were there quietly...

297
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,590
to support me and help me...

298
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,830
throughout her funeral.

299
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,870
Once everything was over,
I realized you were such a great help.

300
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,070
Thank you.

301
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,340
You don't have to say that.

302
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,910
It's only natural.

303
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,110
I hope I can be
a friend like that to you, too.

304
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,080
Let me know whenever you need help.

305
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,250
I'll make myself available
around the clock.

306
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,950
And...

307
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,190
you already know
who'll treasure you...

308
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,820
the most, right?

309
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,730
It's you.

310
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,670
It feels reassuring
just to hear you say that.

311
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,270
Thanks.

312
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,610
So, which hospital
are you working at now?

313
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,440
Oh, I...

314
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,180
Honey.

315
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,180
I'm here.

316
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,190
Hello.
You must be Yu Gyeong's husband.

317
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,350
It's nice to meet you.

318
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:07,260
Yes, hello. It's nice to meet you, too.

319
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,200
- How dare you kidnap a child?
- Wait!

320
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,070
Wait. Those two over there.

321
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,340
She wasn't just a friend
to Kang Jae In.

322
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,450
He's here, so I'll go.

323
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,910
Okay. Let's stay in touch.

324
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,280
Okay.

325
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,050
Goodbye.

326
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,730
He didn't recognize me.

327
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:48,130
He was the guy
who helped Eun Ho, right?

328
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,470
I ran into him at the park back then,
but he didn't recognize me.

329
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,310
He now knows
Jae In and I are in-laws.

330
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,540
(Director of Planning Hwang Gi Chan)

331
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,490
I said we'd talk at home.
Why are you here?

332
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,820
Because I was
more desperate to talk to you.

333
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,020
Come and have a seat.

334
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,230
What is it?

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,340
I need to know what's on your mind
to figure out everything.

336
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,910
Which one of them will it be?

337
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,870
Or do you want to live
with both of them?

338
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,950
I don't know what you
or Jae In are thinking.

339
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,380
Jae In is seeing another man, right?

340
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,650
My shaman said...

341
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,150
the baby she was pregnant with
wasn't yours.

342
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,020
She wouldn't do that.

343
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,560
It doesn't matter.

344
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,460
You're over her anyway.

345
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,730
The miscarriage may have been fate.

346
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,430
I don't trust people,

347
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,900
not even my own children.

348
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,540
The fact you cheated on her first
is an unchangeable fact.

349
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,710
There's only one thing I trust.
Money.

350
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,380
Your father-in-law died,

351
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,980
and your mother-in-law is locked up.

352
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,620
Either you or Jae In are...

353
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,250
the only ones
worthy of this huge company.

354
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,890
So, who should have it?

355
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,920
Will you live the rest of your life
as their servant?

356
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,190
Don't you know me?

357
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,260
I do. You're my son.

358
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,160
You and I are the same
in our thirst for money.

359
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,900
So, now what?

360
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,830
I'll take it.

361
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,470
All of YL Group is mine.

362
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,870
I won't let anyone else have it.

363
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,210
Good. I'll handle everything else,

364
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,710
so do your thing.

365
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,050
Let's eat.

366
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,490
Come and join me.

367
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,390
I'm all right.

368
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,760
Just come already.

369
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,370
People our age need to eat well.

370
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,640
Come on.

371
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,280
I understand you felt troubled
after a close acquaintance passed away,

372
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,050
but your daughter would be worried sick
if you didn't eat.

373
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,380
You should think of her,
eat something, and come to yourself.

374
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,420
Thank you.

375
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,730
Again?

376
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,260
It seemed like
the flowers were a weekly thing.

377
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,500
I have no idea
when that person comes by,

378
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,270
although I wanted to thank them.

379
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,800
I wonder who it is.

380
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,470
Can you think of anyone?

381
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,870
No, but it must be a close friend.

382
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,610
Let's take a family photo
and leave it there.

383
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,410
Her picture looked so lonely
all by herself.

384
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,420
I'm sorry, Jae In.

385
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,320
It's all my fault.

386
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,860
What are you doing, Yu Gyeong?
It's your turn.

387
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,800
I'm sorry, Jae In.

388
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,770
Jae In, you got their apologies.

389
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,570
Please don't be mad anymore.

390
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,110
I didn't think it was their fault.

391
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,410
It's all on me.

392
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,250
Many things had happened
in and out of our families.

393
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,650
I'm sure it played
the biggest part in this.

394
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,850
You're right.

395
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,220
I wouldn't have been
in my right mind if I were you.

396
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,890
I would've gone crazy.

397
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,700
Your mother thought
her son-in-law was having an affair...

398
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,800
and killed
an innocent female employee.

399
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,230
Then, your father passed away
from the shock.

400
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,210
Jae In, hang in there.

401
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,640
Miscarriages have
as big an impact as childbirth.

402
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,980
Think of me as your real mother,

403
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,780
and let me take care of you.

404
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,600
It's the contract
for the share transfer.

405
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,500
I signed it, too.

406
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,840
You'll need more power
as a major shareholder...

407
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,540
to convince the board
even as an acting chairman.

408
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,780
Are you sure about this?

409
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,110
Your mother
wouldn't approve of this.

410
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,280
I don't need
her permission to do this.

411
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,350
We're a married couple,
and we should move as one.

412
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,020
This is a lot of help.

413
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,130
I was wondering what I could say...

414
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,730
to convince them
at the meeting tomorrow.

415
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,000
I also want to return to my job.

416
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,300
Why?

417
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,230
I thought
I could support you better...

418
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,400
if I were reinstated.

419
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,270
I had given up on it
after I found out about my pregnancy,

420
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,280
but I'll go back now.

421
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,980
For now,
you should focus on getting better.

422
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,920
You heard my mother.

423
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,350
Hey, Eun Ho.

424
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,420
- I'm sleepy, Mommy.
- Yes?

425
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,960
Can you read me a book?

426
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,930
Let me read it for you.

427
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,430
Get some rest, okay?

428
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,460
Eun Ho, let's go.

429
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,970
- Goodnight.
- Night.

430
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,770
Let's go.

431
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,650
Dad, I'll live a happy life.

432
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,080
Please keep watching over me.

433
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,550
Come on out, Jae In.

434
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,020
Yes? What is it, Mother?

435
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,590
Are you going out?

436
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,530
I'm going to work.

437
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
I need you to wash the bedding.

438
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,900
The washing machine doesn't get
the dirt out, so use your hands.

439
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,940
The sun is bright,
so it'll dry quickly out in the yard.

440
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,570
Once it dries,
make sure you iron everything.

441
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,640
All by myself?

442
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,310
I don't see anyone else.

443
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,690
This is a part of the plan
to help you get well.

444
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,690
You have to move around...

445
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,590
to feel less bloated
and get better blood circulation...

446
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,030
to help with your health.
Do you understand?

447
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,030
Why won't you say anything?

448
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,970
Okay.

449
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,970
Then, I'm going to work.

450
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,670
Right.

451
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,940
How about shrimp doenjang soup for dinner?
Do you like it?

452
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Yes, I do.

453
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,680
Then, make it delicious for us.

454
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,380
I'll look forward to it.

455
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,330
I'll do the rest.

456
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,870
No, Yu Gyeong.
You worked all day. Have a seat.

457
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,200
You don't have to do that.

458
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,200
Okay.

459
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
I said we could do it together
once I came home,

460
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,710
but you did it all by yourself.

461
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,350
Good work, Jae In.

462
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,510
Let's eat, everyone.

463
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,850
- Okay.
- Good.

464
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,220
Here.

465
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,550
Grab this.

466
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,890
It tastes great.

467
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,290
She's a better cook than Yu Gyeong.

468
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,660
Then, Jae In, why don't you...

469
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,590
continue to cook for us?

470
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,360
Okay, I'll do that.

471
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,400
All right. It looks good. Let's eat.

472
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,220
What's wrong, Mom?

473
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,490
It's shrimp!

474
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,560
She said she wanted
shrimp doenjang soup.

475
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,670
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

476
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,480
I took my medication. I'll be fine.

477
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,640
I'm okay, right?

478
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,450
Yes.

479
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,620
Jae In must be out of her mind.

480
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,380
You're allergic to shellfish.

481
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,190
Why would you ask
for shrimp doenjang soup?

482
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,150
It must've been a mistake.

483
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,260
I clearly remember telling her
about my shrimp allergy,

484
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,790
but she heard it the wrong way.

485
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,800
She had been out of it
since the miscarriage.

486
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,170
Still, how can she get that wrong?

487
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,770
Yu Gyeong did the same soon after
we got married. Do you remember?

488
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,140
She almost passed away back then.

489
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,670
Yes, I remember it
just like yesterday.

490
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,410
I need to get some rest.

491
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,180
Stop making a fuss and get out.

492
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,650
Okay. Get a good rest.

493
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,860
Goodness.

494
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,160
Hey, how's Mother?

495
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,730
She calmed down
after Yu Gyeong gave her medication.

496
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,070
You believe me, right? She...

497
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,170
That's enough.

498
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,100
If you made a mistake, just say so.

499
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,570
Why do you keep blaming her?

500
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,210
She knows about her allergy.

501
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,910
Why would she ask you to use shrimp?

502
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,080
I must've heard her wrong.

503
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,080
All she worries about is you.

504
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,290
Make sure you apologize tomorrow.

505
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,950
Okay.

506
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,530
Did you get another perfume?

507
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,060
It smells like women's perfume.

508
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
Has your jealousy
become delusional, too?

509
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,670
What perfume?

510
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,830
Stop talking nonsense...

511
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,240
and grab my underwear.
I need to wash up.

512
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,270
Okay.

513
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,550
Jae In, are you done
ironing my outfit?

514
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,720
Jae In!

515
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,390
What is this?
What are you going to do?

516
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,690
I'm sorry, Na Ra.

517
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,600
I must've dozed off.

518
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,300
This is my favorite shirt,
and it was limited edition.

519
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,470
What are you going to do? Darn it.

520
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,340
- Na Ra...
- What's with her?

521
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,270
Jae In.

522
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,340
You should have this.

523
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,350
You have to be healthy physically
to be healthy mentally.

524
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,520
You keep saying
I said something I didn't say,

525
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,750
so I thought
you were under a lot of stress.

526
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,590
So, I ordered
the best medicine for you.

527
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,890
Have some.

528
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,460
You should take it instead of me...

529
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,860
I'm almost too healthy.

530
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,660
You need to be in full health...

531
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,400
to brighten up our family again.

532
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,300
My biggest concern
at this moment is...

533
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,770
no one other than you.

534
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,040
Come on. My arms hurt.

535
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,150
You have to take it
every morning and evening...

536
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,920
without skipping a day.

537
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,690
Only then will it take effect.

538
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,460
Okay. Thank you, Mother.

539
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,900
May I go out in the afternoon?

540
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,600
Of course.

541
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,600
You've finished cleaning today.
You should go.

542
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,740
Congratulations.

543
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,450
The board was
mesmerized by your leadership.

544
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,950
It's nothing to celebrate.
I'm here only as an acting chairman.

545
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,050
I'll do my best
to stabilize the business...

546
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,120
before the actual chairman
is elected.

547
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,060
That's probably what Father wants.

548
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,490
- You should do that.
- Right.

549
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,930
I found out where Seung Woo was.

550
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,460
- Where is he?
- He's at a hotel.

551
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,130
Men will want to go into their cave
when things become tough.

552
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,540
He'll come back
once he figures everything out.

553
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,840
I put a tail on him,
so don't worry too much.

554
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,940
I know you probably
don't want to see me here.

555
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,210
I knew that, yet I came back.

556
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,210
I said I'd live the rest of my life
with a sense of guilt in me.

557
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,380
(The late Kim Do Hee)

558
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,350
I know I don't deserve to be happy.

559
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,750
I shouldn't want that.

560
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,220
But I wanted to be happy.

561
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,860
I must be getting punished
for my greed.

562
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,700
I'm sorry.

563
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,140
I'm so sorry.

564
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,780
(The late Kim Do Hee)

565
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,520
Are you all right?

566
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,950
Yes.

567
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,520
Here.

568
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,930
Hey.

569
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,830
It's you again.

570
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,930
I shouldn't say I'm happy to see you
at a place like this.

571
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,130
What brings you here?

572
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,170
Hey. Are you okay?

573
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,740
Yes, I got a little dizzy.

574
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,140
I'm fine.

575
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,310
Let me walk you to your car.
Let's go.

576
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,950
I didn't drive.

577
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,950
I'm sorry,

578
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,520
but can you call a taxi for me?

579
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,670
You can just take the car.
Why did you get off?

580
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,670
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

581
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,340
(Mom)

582
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,350
(Queen's House)

583
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,010
What were you and Se Ri doing?

584
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,520
How many times have you said
you ran into him by chance?

585
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,550
Was it really a coincidence?

586
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,560
Goodness, forget it.

587
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,690
I imagined the weirdest thing.

588
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,360
I guess I still have a tough time
accepting my sister's death.

589
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,700
I wanted to know
why she had to die so unfairly.

590
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,700
The culprit was already caught.

591
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,070
Getting a job at YL Group
won't change anything.

592
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,200
Did you say you wanted to be happy?

593
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,240
You want to be happy?

594
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,580
I won't forgive both you...

595
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,450
and your mother.
