1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,910
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,380
Our deal was...

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,280
to give you a job here
as the winner of the contest,

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,950
and only that.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,320
I know. Thanks.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,390
You don't have to thank me
for something you blackmailed me for.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,360
I don't know how long...

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,290
Chairman Hwang and Ms. Kang will
condone you,

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,960
but don't dream of using me
as your connection...

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,900
when you face
any kind of disadvantage.

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,100
- Sure.
- But it changes if YL is at stake.

14
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,670
Make sure you don't cause
any negative impact on the group.

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,170
I won't let you get away with it...

16
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,210
if you cause any problems.
Remember that.

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,150
Just treat me like
every other employees.

18
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,280
Then, there shouldn't be
any problems.

19
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,320
Starting now,
you're just one of the employees.

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,650
Nothing more, nothing less.

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,290
That's what I want.

22
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,290
You may leave.

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,830
Please excuse me,
Managing Director Kang Mi Ran.

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,680
So what? You'll let her work here?

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,250
She was officially chosen
as the winner of our contest.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,850
I don't have a good reason
to kick her out right away.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,220
I would've done whatever I could
if we hadn't announced this,

28
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,820
but I was too late.

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,590
Why do you think
Jae In is trying to return here?

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,230
She wants to mess with us.

31
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,860
You know that,
yet you won't do anything?

32
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,970
I may be the chairman here,
but I can't kick someone out...

33
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,800
without a reasonable excuse
in this day and age.

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,470
If the press found out,
I'd be criticized for overusing my power.

35
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,040
People already gossip about me,
so I don't want to make it worse.

36
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,240
I'd only end up giving a reason
for people to protest against me.

37
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,880
I have to keep facing her
in the same office.

38
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,580
How am I going to deal with that?

39
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,750
Honey, this is stifling.

40
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,290
I might end up dying
from the stress.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,860
Just give it time.

42
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,630
I don't plan
on having her around here for long.

43
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,340
You're driving me crazy.

44
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,840
Why did you have to get a job here?

45
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,410
It's my dad's company.

46
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,750
So what?

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,150
Do you dread the thought of it
becoming mine? Do you?

48
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,160
(Team Leader Kang Se Ri)

49
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,660
Jae In, you won't last long...

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,670
as long as I'm here.

51
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,770
Ms. Kang Jae In,
bring me a cup of coffee.

52
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,880
Come in.

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,280
Geum Ja, let's get some coffee...

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,750
What?

55
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,520
Are you looking for Geum Ja?

56
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,190
Good morning, Dr. Kim.

57
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,290
Where's Geum Ja?

58
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,460
She quit.

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,760
What? She quit her job? Why?

60
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,370
It was for personal reasons.
I don't know the details.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,040
We were good friends,
but she left without saying goodbye?

62
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,970
So, Geum Ja's seat is now open?

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,010
Yes, until I find another counselor.

64
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,940
Does that mean I can come here?

65
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,550
Sure, as long as you're certified
as a counselor.

66
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,980
What? Certified as a counselor?

67
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,050
I can't work here
if I'm not certified?

68
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,450
No, you can't.

69
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,460
Jeez.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,500
Bring me another one.

71
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,670
I don't drink coffee
with floral notes.

72
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,170
It's not my taste.

73
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,270
Didn't you hear me?

74
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,280
Bring me another cup of coffee.

75
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,690
Bring me another one.

76
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,860
What's the problem this time?

77
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,930
The balance is completely off.

78
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,240
I don't see any crema, either.

79
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,540
How am I going to drink
this kind of garbage?

80
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,480
Tell me the fragrance,
taste, bean type,

81
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,380
and strength of the coffee
exactly as you like...

82
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,750
unless you're doing this
only to harass me.

83
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,180
What are you saying?

84
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,280
Hey, Ms. Kang Jae In.

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,890
Do you think I hold this position
to joke around with you?

86
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,860
Just do as your boss says.
Stop nitpicking over everything.

87
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,160
- I'm not nitpicking over...
- Apologize for not figuring out...

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,300
your direct superior's taste
in coffee.

89
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,170
I still didn't get my coffee
because of you,

90
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,670
and it's having a huge impact
on my job right now.

91
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,840
You didn't hire a barista.

92
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,170
I thought we picked out a designer.

93
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,680
If you don't like her coffee,
make one yourself.

94
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,850
Mr. Kang, don't you know
that I'm your boss?

95
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,550
So what if you're my boss?

96
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,480
Act like one
if you want to be treated like one.

97
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,290
Mr. Kang, it was my mistake.

98
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,850
That's enough.

99
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,330
I apologize for causing
a disruption to your work.

100
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,830
I'll bring another one.

101
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,770
I hope you like it this time.

102
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,560
Where's your pride?

103
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,290
You know
she's doing that on purpose.

104
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,630
- Jae In.
- We're at work.

105
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,960
Yes, we are.

106
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,500
And you didn't get your job
to get coffee for that woman.

107
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,700
She's my team leader
and my immediate superior.

108
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,440
I'm just doing my job.

109
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,340
How is getting her coffee
a part of your job?

110
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,310
It's considered a power trip
to make employees do this.

111
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,450
You can even report this
to the labor office.

112
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,250
I see. That's probably possible.

113
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,350
Report her.

114
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,420
Why? What?

115
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,030
Mr. Kang,
thank you for your concern,

116
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,160
but I decline.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,960
I've been out in the real world
much longer than you have.

118
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,670
I'll manage.

119
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,600
And if I may give you another tip,

120
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,670
it's better to hide your intentions
and feelings when you're at work,

121
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,910
especially when you aren't sure...

122
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,940
if someone is your foe or friend.

123
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,280
What was that?

124
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,620
Why is she complaining
that I'm worried about her?

125
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,660
My gosh!

126
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,460
No, you surprised me even more.

127
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,460
Why are you out here
instead of working?

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,170
Mom, this can't happen,
not even over my dead body.

129
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,240
I can't have...

130
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,100
that young man, the gigolo
who's way too young for you,

131
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,970
as my stepfather. Okay?

132
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,340
Dang it.

133
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,410
What are you doing?
I'm talking to you.

134
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,840
I'm looking for something
to kill you.

135
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,950
How come I don't see any weapons?

136
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,150
Why would you do that?

137
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,350
I'll do it over your dead body.

138
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,350
- What? Mom!
- My goodness!

139
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,350
Stop yelling at me.
You'll even scare a kid.

140
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,420
You even want a kid?

141
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,590
Have you really become senile?

142
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,030
Shut that mouth.

143
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't you ever bring up
even S of the word senile.

144
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,740
What?

145
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
Is she not home?

146
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,840
Okay. Bye.

147
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,640
Call Yu Gyeong.

148
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,180
She should run home and make dinner
as soon as she gets off work.

149
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,450
Tell her to go home already.

150
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,090
- The receiver blocked your...
- She won't pick up?

151
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,590
She blocked my number.

152
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,760
Wait, is she protesting?

153
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,660
Why is she the one protesting?

154
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,560
She went around telling people
you kidnapped your nephew...

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,300
- Come on, Mom. Be quiet.
- My gosh.

156
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,440
Okay.

157
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,870
Anyway, how dare she
block my number?

158
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,480
- Darn it, Mom!
- What?

159
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,580
Good grief. You're impossible.

160
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,220
Darn it. What is this?
We don't have anything to eat.

161
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,720
Man, this is so annoying.
I'm starving to death,

162
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,190
but Yu Gyeong won't even pick up.

163
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,760
Whatever.
I'm ordering delivery food.

164
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,600
What should I get?

165
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,940
What's the occasion?
We're having a feast.

166
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,840
It was Jae In's first day at work,

167
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,310
so I prepared some food
in case she was exhausted.

168
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,940
You need to eat lots of protein
to relieve your fatigue.

169
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,180
What's wrong?

170
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,680
I felt sorry.

171
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,390
It's nothing to be sorry for.

172
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,620
Eat up.

173
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,760
Okay. Thank you.

174
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,930
Bo Ram.

175
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,360
Eat up.

176
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,960
Okay.

177
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,970
Uncle, Grandma, enjoy your dinner.

178
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,230
What about me?

179
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,070
You always enjoy your food,
Little Grandpa. So, I won't say it.

180
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,970
For real?
Hey, is that appropriate? For real?

181
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,910
All right, Uncle. Enjoy your dinner.

182
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,450
My nephew's the best.

183
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,890
How was your first day?
Did you do a great job?

184
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,920
I haven't worked for a while,
so I was a bit clumsy.

185
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,920
You'll get used to it.

186
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,260
Don't worry about it, and cheer up.

187
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,990
Where are you working?

188
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,700
Well, it's YL Group.

189
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,800
I see. That place?

190
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,170
That's a good company.

191
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,240
There's a long history of bad blood
between YL Group and us.

192
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,710
Why did you pinch me?
I didn't say anything.

193
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,410
I just said there was bad blood.

194
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,050
The soup is getting cold.

195
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,850
You should eat.

196
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,990
Okay.

197
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,470
Hello.

198
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,640
It wasn't my fault. No.

199
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,570
No.

200
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,280
What's wrong?

201
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,380
Don't come.

202
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,980
Go away. Get away from me!

203
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,760
Ms. Choi?

204
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,830
What's wrong?

205
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,200
It's a ghost.

206
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,530
- A ghost.
- It's not a ghost. It's Yu Gyeong.

207
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,800
Look.

208
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,780
Were you shocked?

209
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,560
You should've said hello
when you got here.

210
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,160
I said hello when she came out,

211
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,560
but she suddenly screamed.

212
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,500
Anyway, that's that.
Why are you here at this hour?

213
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,100
I came to sleep here.

214
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,270
Did you fight with Gi Man?

215
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,840
Does he know that you're here?

216
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,970
Did you get Ms. Noh's permission?

217
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,440
That's enough, Dad.

218
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,380
I had a fight with Gi Man.

219
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,810
I came because I wanted to relax.

220
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,520
Then, you should've told me.

221
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,360
I would've made you a bed.

222
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,920
Where?

223
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,130
Jae In's mom is using that room,

224
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,430
and I can't take yours.

225
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,830
I'll just take a blanket
and sleep here.

226
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
Go inside and sleep.
I'll sleep out here.

227
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,800
Come on, Dad.

228
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,870
I'm tired.

229
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,040
Just let me sleep in peace.

230
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,950
Goodnight.

231
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,340
You're up.

232
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,280
Have a seat. Breakfast is ready.

233
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,780
Try some, Ms. Choi.
I made seaweed soup.

234
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,520
It's not even someone's birthday.
Why did you make this?

235
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,360
Because I like it.

236
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,060
It tastes too fishy.

237
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,500
Give me some water.

238
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,330
I need to rinse out my mouth.

239
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,240
Dad, stay there.

240
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,870
Ms. Choi.

241
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,540
Are you talking to me?

242
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,080
You're no longer
the gallery director.

243
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,980
You're Jae In's mother,
so I could call you mother,

244
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,410
but I don't want to do that.

245
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,950
You're my friend's mom,
so I should call you Ms. Choi.

246
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,590
Sure, you can address me
however you want to.

247
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,490
Ms. Choi, get your own water.

248
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,960
My dad already made breakfast.

249
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,430
You must've acted like this
while you stayed here,

250
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,300
but are you even paying
for the living expenses?

251
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,430
Yu Gyeong, that was rude.

252
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,570
Don't say that.

253
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,070
Did it bother you that much
to hear me ask for water?

254
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,440
Yes, it bothered me very much.

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,610
You should sit down.
I'll get you water.

256
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,280
You heard him.

257
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,620
He offered to bring it to me.

258
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,760
Don't stick around for too long
without paying a penny.

259
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,690
If you're going to stay here,

260
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,090
you need to pay him
for your expenses.

261
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,630
Otherwise, you can leave.

262
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,730
You need to stop.

263
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,660
I said it was fine.
What's wrong with you?

264
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,430
I'm not fine with this.

265
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,000
How would I be happy
to see her order you around...

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,340
like you were her servant?

267
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,010
You don't work for YL anymore.

268
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,270
Why are you groveling?

269
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,340
I never said I wouldn't pay.

270
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,980
I'll pay him.

271
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,810
I never wanted to stay here.

272
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,680
I'm only staying
because he pleaded with me.

273
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,660
Director Do, isn't that right?

274
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,290
Yes.

275
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,830
You can stay here
until you find another place.

276
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,230
I brought her here...

277
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,870
and asked her to stay.

278
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,070
Don't say anything else
about this matter again.

279
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,600
It's not your problem.

280
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,370
You heard him.

281
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,680
I'm his guest,
and this is his place.

282
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,440
I'm staying here
because he wants me to.

283
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,180
Happy now?

284
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,450
I don't have an appetite.

285
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,190
I'm going to work.

286
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,600
Hey, why isn't breakfast ready?

287
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,840
Why don't I smell anything...

288
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,280
What's all this? It's so gross.

289
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,380
What's Yu Gyeong doing?
Why hasn't she cleaned this up...

290
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,920
or made breakfast? Get her.

291
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,420
She's not here. She never came home.

292
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,720
What?

293
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,420
She stayed out all night?

294
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,190
Yes, she left home.

295
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,930
She won't pick up her phone,
and she left my text on read.

296
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,460
I can't believe this girl.

297
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,600
Who does she think she is
to leave home?

298
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,040
She's trying to act like
she's above me.

299
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,770
She's the one who'll suffer, not us.

300
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,410
Call her
and tell her never to come back.

301
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,110
She won't pick up her phone.

302
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,980
She blocked my number.

303
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,620
Gosh, who's going to clean this up?

304
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,690
Let's go. Be careful.

305
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,430
I'm going to the kindergarten,
Grandma.

306
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,530
All right.

307
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,000
Stop right there, lady.

308
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,640
I've watched you babysit him
whenever you came over to work,

309
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,380
and you seemed rather shrewd.

310
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,040
You need to help out with the chores
as you babysit him.

311
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,480
I'll pay you more
if you do a good job.

312
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,050
Please do not call me a lady.

313
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,950
I'm his private tutor.

314
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,350
Tu... What?

315
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,660
I chose to work for this place
among many families...

316
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,960
that want their children
to study with me...

317
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,730
because I was guaranteed
to receive...

318
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,360
the best pay and benefits
in the industry.

319
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,560
So, please watch your words.

320
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,000
Excuse me.

321
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,340
Good grief.
How much did Se Ri pay...

322
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,410
to hire that tuner or whatever...

323
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,780
to babysit her kid?

324
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,450
If she had enough money to waste,

325
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,250
she should've hired a housekeeper.

326
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,090
Who are you?

327
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,300
Ms. Kang, I want coffee.

328
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,770
Add another shot,

329
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,530
and you know that
I'm lactose intolerant, right?

330
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,400
I want it
with low-fat lacto-free milk...

331
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,310
and ground ice instead of ice cubes.

332
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,770
Don't forget to add
a pump of vanilla syrup.

333
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,880
And I hate paper straws,

334
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,180
so bring me something else.

335
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,420
Hey, honey.

336
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,490
I'm her only family,

337
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,100
and she's my only niece, too.

338
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,870
My sister asked me to look after her
until she let out her last breath.

339
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,740
I heard much later
that she got married...

340
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,540
and was so heartbroken.

341
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,740
I didn't know she had an aunt.

342
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,210
We had a small wedding,
so we didn't invite anyone...

343
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,380
Oh, my. Anyone?

344
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,990
Gi Chan, didn't you hear
what I just said?

345
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,320
I'm Jae In's...

346
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,490
No, she's Se Ri now.

347
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,760
I'm Se Ri's aunt.

348
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,760
I'm just like her mother.
How can you call me just anyone?

349
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,000
That wasn't what I meant.

350
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,700
We'll hold a proper wedding
once everything settles down.

351
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,600
We'll invite you at that time.

352
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,710
Yes, of course, you will.

353
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,110
Se Ri must've chosen
a great man to marry.

354
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,650
She was really popular with guys
since when she was young.

355
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,680
And she was
the nicest girl in the world, too.

356
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,490
Then, in high school,
she became a rebellious teen...

357
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,260
- Aunt.
- Se Ri.

358
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,760
Have you been well?

359
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,830
How have you been?

360
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,330
Gosh, you brat...

361
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,470
You should've called me
and said you got married.

362
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,000
You aren't even an orphan.

363
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,410
Why did you
hold the wedding by yourself?

364
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,940
I cried a river after hearing
that you got married.

365
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
What brings you here?

366
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,380
What do you mean?

367
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,720
I missed you, my dear niece.

368
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,720
Right. Where was I?

369
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,290
That she became rebellious
in high school.

370
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,760
Yes, right.

371
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,990
Once she hit puberty,
she became so rebellious.

372
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,530
You gave your mom
such a hard time back then.

373
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Everyone's like that
when they're teenagers.

374
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,540
Once she got into university,

375
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,770
she began to study so hard,

376
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,580
so my sister always showed her off.

377
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,880
Anyway, I have your college diploma.
Do you want me to bring it over?

378
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,820
I'll go there and pick it up.

379
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,380
I'm so sorry for not reaching out
through all these years.

380
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,020
Life was so hectic in America.

381
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,590
He's a busy man,
so we can't sit with him for long.

382
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,220
Let's go outside and talk.

383
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,990
We can grab a bite to eat, too.

384
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,600
Why don't the three of us
go out for lunch?

385
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,460
That'd be better than the two of us.

386
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,770
I'm sorry,
but I have to be at a meeting.

387
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,700
I'll arrange for us to meet
another time.

388
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,070
I'm sorry, honey.

389
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,170
- Let's go, Aunt.
- What? Okay.

390
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,980
It was nice to meet you, Gi Chan.
See you next time.

391
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,180
- Yes, goodbye.
- Bye.

392
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,730
- Come quickly, Aunt.
- Go slowly. I'm about to fall.

393
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,260
Ms. Kang, what about your coffee?

394
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,830
Leave it on my desk.

395
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,100
Come, Aunt.

396
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,270
Wait.

397
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,470
Isn't she that girl,
the daughter of YL Group?

398
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,940
She went to high school with you.

399
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,140
You're right.

400
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,640
I'm Kang Jae In,
Se Ri's high school friend.

401
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,010
Do you know me?

402
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,850
I knew it.

403
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,010
Yes, of course, I know you.

404
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,220
My sister used to work
as a housekeeper for your...

405
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,480
That's enough, Aunt.

406
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,350
Mind your own business.

407
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,220
And stop calling yourself
YL Group's daughter.

408
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,470
My gosh.

409
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,170
What's with you, girl? My arm hurts.

410
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,000
You should be treating me
to a nice meal.

411
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,570
Why did you bring me here?

412
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,610
You and I finally reunited
as each other's only family.

413
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,440
Why aren't you happy to see me?

414
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,840
Don't be so harsh.

415
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,780
It's the two of us now,
so just be honest.

416
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,320
You didn't come
because you missed me.

417
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,590
You never reached out once
after my mom died.

418
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,760
So? How much do you need?

419
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,530
Well, I came to see you, too.

420
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,930
A reporter reached out to me.

421
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,400
A reporter? What did they say?

422
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,300
They somehow found out
I was your aunt...

423
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,440
and asked if I knew that
you married YL Group's chairman.

424
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,840
Then, they asked
if I knew anything about your past.

425
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,710
But I couldn't just let anyone...

426
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,950
have such information
about my own blood.

427
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,220
So, I came here to talk to you.

428
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,920
The reporter also said
they'd compensate handsomely.

429
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,330
I'll give you twice as much.
Happy now?

430
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,960
So? Who's the reporter?

431
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,370
I don't know.
I received a text message...

432
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,230
from a restricted number.

433
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,670
They didn't even mention
their name or affiliation.

434
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,170
If they said they were a reporter,
they must be, right?

435
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,570
Who could it be?

436
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,810
How did they find my aunt?

437
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,210
Do you still have everything...

438
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,320
that belonged to me and my mom?

439
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,050
Of course,
how can I throw those out?

440
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,590
I still keep those around...

441
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,560
in my tiny little place.

442
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,490
Gosh, my life is just awful.

443
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,430
Consider everything your money.

444
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,600
So, bring everything,
including every piece of paper...

445
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,370
and speck of dust.

446
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,900
Don't try to stall for time,
and bring everything by tomorrow.

447
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,580
Why are you here
instead of at your business?

448
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,080
I closed it briefly.

449
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,050
Do Yun said he had to do
lots of paperwork at the clinic...

450
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,450
and had to make do with coffee,
so I made him lunch.

451
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,960
Hey, call Do Yun
and ask him for the address.

452
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,130
I'll drop it off.

453
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,560
Hey, give it to me. I'll go.

454
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,100
It won't take long on my motorcycle.

455
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,930
You'll have to pick up
Bo Ram soon, too.

456
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
Will you do that?

457
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,900
Thanks, then. Give me a moment.

458
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,440
Don't worry. I'm disguised.
No one will notice me.

459
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,320
I think I'm at the lounge.
Where do I have to go?

460
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,590
You'll come here?
Okay. I'll see you soon.

461
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,500
Have you been somewhere?

462
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,900
I had a meeting outside.

463
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,470
Jae In.

464
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,440
Once again, you should behave well
instead of acting out.

465
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,080
Seung Woo seems
quite concerned about you.

466
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,210
Don't cause him any harm.

467
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,150
Of course, he'd be concerned
if he considered me his family.

468
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,280
That's what we call family.

469
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,590
You probably wouldn't know that.

470
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,760
You're worse than a stranger to me.

471
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,190
Please excuse me.

472
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,980
Ms. Kang's aunt was...

473
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,180
Kang Mi Ran?

474
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,180
You haven't met him?

475
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,120
He left a while ago.

476
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,450
Do Yun, your uncle is here.
Let's hang up for now.

477
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,330
Didn't you deliver lunch to Do Yun?
What happened?

478
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,260
He called you,
but you didn't answer.

479
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,730
I wanted to let him eat
something I made at home.

480
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,200
I said I'd go,
but you insisted on doing this.

481
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,610
Good grief. Look at the time.

482
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,210
Where have you been all along?

483
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,080
Grandma, don't be angry.

484
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,810
Little Grandpa must've forgotten.

485
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,030
Hey! I'll bring your lunch!

486
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,230
I'll be there, so come out!

487
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,870
What's with you?

488
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,710
He'll get off work soon.
Why would you do that?

489
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,040
I'll give it to him. I will.

490
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,280
Hey, Oh Seong!

491
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,510
My goodness. He's impossible.

492
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,050
He's so weird.

493
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,990
I'm home.

494
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,250
You need to turn back around
and go grocery shopping.

495
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,760
All we have at home are greens.

496
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,530
Get some groceries
and make dinner...

497
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,990
before the entire family starves.

498
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,400
- Me?
- Then, what? Should I do it?

499
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,930
I'll need to pay money
to hire someone.

500
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,730
While we're on the subject,

501
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,100
how much are you paying that lady
who babysits Ji Ho?

502
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,510
She was so arrogant,

503
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,410
even though
she was just a babysitter.

504
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,810
Mother, you didn't hurt her,
did you?

505
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,080
What's with you?

506
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,820
I can't even kill an ant.

507
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,050
Everyone is dying
to hire that tutor.

508
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,390
Kids who studied with her
became gifted students,

509
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,190
went to prestigious universities,
and became a big success.

510
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
She was very expensive to hire,

511
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,700
so I finally managed to get her
after Gi Chan became the chairman.

512
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,400
Ji Ho is his only blood,

513
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,100
so I must support him with my best.

514
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,900
Jeez.

515
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,910
Anyway, you're paying her
instead of hiring a housekeeper,

516
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,840
so you need to handle
the chores at home.

517
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,480
Mother, I have a full-time job.

518
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,280
Even Yu Gyeong had no problem
doing chores at home,

519
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,750
even though
she was busier as a doctor.

520
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,750
I guess you didn't know this,

521
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,760
but it'd be more embarrassing...

522
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,590
for people in our position
not to hire helping hands.

523
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,930
We must give our money
back to society.

524
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,660
Why would I give back
my precious money?

525
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,170
I don't do charity work.

526
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,300
Mother, my life is
already hectic enough...

527
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,140
without doing chores.

528
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,240
Do you know who came back to work?

529
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,410
Kang Jae In.

530
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,510
Why did she suddenly show up?

531
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,650
She won the contest and got the job.

532
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,390
I'm sure her aunt,
Director Kang Mi Ran, helped.

533
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,550
You already know...

534
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,320
how sly Jae In is.

535
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,660
Of course, I do.

536
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,930
She's the sliest...

537
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,930
and the nastiest girl.

538
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,000
Are you in your right mind?

539
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,270
Of all people,

540
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,780
she's the daughter
of the woman who killed Do Hee.

541
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,640
Have you known from the start?

542
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,050
Tell me!

543
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,190
Was this why you stopped me
from finding out...

544
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,760
the murderer's daughter?

545
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,960
Because you already knew?

546
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,160
Have you gone crazy?

547
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,730
How would your sister...

548
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,530
and your mom feel
if they found out about this?

549
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,040
She'd collapse from the shock.
Don't you know that?

550
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,100
Don't you?

551
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,110
I'm sorry.

552
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,820
Kang Jae In knows, doesn't she?

553
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,590
At first, she didn't.

554
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,220
She only found out recently.

555
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,590
Yes, so she knows now!

556
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,160
You two humiliated
my sister, Bo Ram,

557
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,560
and the deceased, Do Hee!

558
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,270
Uncle Oh Seong,
it's a misunderstanding.

559
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,570
I didn't want
to let her stay at our place.

560
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,370
My mom made the offer first,

561
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,340
and at that time,
Jae In didn't know.

562
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,840
Forget it, you punk.

563
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,540
I don't need to hear your excuses.

564
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,450
Kick her out
before Yun Hee finds out.

565
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,150
Give me some time.

566
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,150
Time? You punk.

567
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,450
I never imagined...

568
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,260
you, of all people,
would do something like this!

569
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,960
Wait, do you have...

570
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,130
feelings for her?

571
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,400
Was that why you lost it?

572
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,900
Is that why you don't care
about your mom or sister?

573
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,910
No, it's not that.

574
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,640
You already know
why I'm working for YL Group.

575
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,750
It's unrelated to this incident.

576
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,080
You know there are lots of mysteries
surrounding Do Hee's death.

577
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,080
Ms. Kang may also be...

578
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,990
a victim.

579
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,760
I don't care if she's a victim.

580
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,960
She's still our enemy.

581
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,860
That doesn't change the fact
that she's the murderer's daughter.

582
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,900
Kick her out immediately.

583
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,670
If you don't do it, I will.

584
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,010
Uncle Oh Seong!

585
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,120
You're home.

586
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,990
Dinner's almost ready,
so please wash your hands and come.

587
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,960
Ms. Kang, you need to leave.

588
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,630
You need to leave this house now.

589
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,630
Stop it, Uncle Oh Seong.

590
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,400
I asked you for some time.

591
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,770
Why do you need time?

592
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,470
You know who that woman is.

593
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,770
It makes no sense
for her to stay in this house.

594
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,140
You can't be this shameless.

595
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,840
Did you move in here
knowing whose house this was?

596
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,780
Get out. Get out of here!

597
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,550
What on earth
are you doing, Oh Seong?

598
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,140
(Queen's House)

599
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,510
I set up a blind date for you
this Saturday.

600
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,640
Mom, I'm not interested.

601
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,350
Is it because you
and that punk hit it off?

602
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,980
Mom, don't call him a punk.

603
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,020
He's a doctor. A doctor in medicine.

604
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,490
Who is this guy?

605
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,290
CEO Patrick Jung
of DH Holdings is here.

606
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,430
The CEO came here himself?

607
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,700
Geum Ja, why didn't you
pick up your phone?

608
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,930
I was worried about you.

609
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,030
Where are you?

610
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,770
I'm at home.

611
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,140
You're home? Where do you live?

612
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,400
Hello?
