1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,120
Gi Chan.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,490
Gi Chan!

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,860
Gi Chan.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,030
I'm glad you're okay.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,640
Don't move. It's dangerous.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,970
An ambulance is on its way.
Just hang in there, okay?

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,980
My wish came true.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,280
In my final moments,

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,590
I wished you would be by my side.

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,790
I'm so selfish, right?

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,400
But that's the kind of guy
I've always been.

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,530
Don't say anything, please.

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,970
Just stay still.

17
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,380
Take this.

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,820
Our Eun Ho...

19
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,960
I wish I could see him
just one more time.

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,000
Do you think I'll get the chance?

21
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,070
Jae In.

22
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,810
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,250
I'm so sorry, Jae In.

24
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
Gi Chan.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Gi Chan.

26
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,830
Gi Chan. Hwang Gi Chan!

27
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,800
Gi Chan!

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,510
Gi Chan! Eun Ho's dad!

29
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,670
Hwang Gi Chan!

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,210
Gi Chan!

31
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,880
Hwang Gi Chan!

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,880
Gi Chan!

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,550
Gi Chan!

34
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,130
Gi Chan.

35
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,410
Darn it.

36
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,510
How could a funeral...

37
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,280
not have a single person show up?

38
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,320
He was the chairman of YL Group,
for goodness' sake.

39
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,020
What a waste of money.

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,760
We could barely afford the funeral.

41
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,460
Mom, are you out of your mind?

42
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,870
Our brother died for nothing,
and you care about funeral costs?

43
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,300
That darn money!
Is that all you care about, Mom?

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,670
That's right.
Money is all I care about.

45
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,910
First, money. Second, money.

46
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,610
And third, money!

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,320
Money is king!
You have a problem with that?

48
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,750
Gi Chan.

49
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,790
Mom and Na Ra are fighting again.

50
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,990
Gi Chan.

51
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,660
I miss you, Gi Chan.

52
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,180
Gi Chan...

53
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,150
(The Defendant's Stand)

54
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,290
This is the reason why
we requested this joint trial.

55
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,790
Besides murdering Mr. Hwang Gi Chan,
the defendant, Kang Se Ri,

56
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,960
arranged Hwang Eun Ho's hit-and-run
and the driver's contract killing,

57
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,160
tried to murder Ms. Kang Jae In,
held Ms. Choi Ja Young captive,

58
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,330
and committed numerous other crimes.

59
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,740
That's crazy.

60
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,140
While the one who killed Kim Do Hee,

61
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,740
Mr. Hwang Gi Chan, is deceased,

62
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,340
Kang Se Ri must also be punished
as an accomplice.

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,750
Besides the criminal charges,

64
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,250
she also faces
multiple civil suits...

65
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,450
for impersonation and embezzlement.
Please take that into account.

66
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,490
Defendant,

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,060
do you admit to the charges
that were just presented?

68
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,830
No.

69
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,460
I only admit to hitting my husband
with my car.

70
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,170
But that only happened because I saw
my husband with his ex-wife,

71
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,300
and I just snapped.

72
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,200
It was a mistake.

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,870
How could Hwang Gi Chan...

74
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,210
Your Honor!

75
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,010
I call Mr. Hwang Gi Chan
as a witness.

76
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,980
But isn't he dead?

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,020
Mr. Hwang Gi Chan is deceased,
is he not?

78
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,890
How can he testify?

79
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,260
Hwang Gi Chan's confession,
testimony, and evidence...

80
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,630
are all right here.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,670
Wait, how is that possible?

82
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,170
I'm terminally ill,
and I'm recording this video,

83
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,310
in case my health fails
and I can't testify in person.

84
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,210
This video serves as my testimony.

85
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
I, Hwang Gi Chan,

86
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,250
swear to speak from my conscience
without omission or embellishment,

87
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,620
to tell only the facts as they are,

88
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,490
and if I lie, I'll face the penalty
for perjury.

89
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,770
The person who...

90
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,540
hit and killed Ms. Kim Do Hee
with a car...

91
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,240
was me, Hwang Gi Chan.

92
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,780
Furthermore, through our affiliate,
H and K Company,

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,950
I embezzled YL Group's funds
to create a slush fund.

94
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,490
The CEO of H and K Company
was listed as Catherine,

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,220
an alias for Kang Se Ri.

96
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,000
She was the one
who managed the slush fund.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,300
Kang Se Ri is also the murderer...

98
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,440
who killed my son, Eun Ho.

99
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,580
On the USB drive
containing this video,

100
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,510
you will find my correspondence...

101
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,280
with Detective Baek Mun Su
and Hong Man Su,

102
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,190
as well as detailed records
of all cash and valuables I gave them.

103
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,390
Finally,

104
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,390
to Ms. Kim Do Hee...

105
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,090
and to her family,

106
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,000
I offer my sincerest apologies.

107
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,310
What's happening?

108
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,650
That crazy jerk.

109
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,550
On the cell phone
Kang Se Ri regularly used,

110
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,390
there's the original dashcam footage
from Ms. Kim Do Hee's accident.

111
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,130
And a forensic analysis of
a flip phone owned by Kang Se Ri...

112
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,360
revealed she framed Ms. Kang Jae In
to Ms. Kim's family.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,470
She also told loan shark Hong Man Su
to commit and cover up her crimes.

114
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:49,040
We confirmed the number was used
to pose as a cop and call Ms. Kang.

115
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,040
Upon hearing of Kang Se Ri's arrest,

116
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,250
Hong Man Su also confessed
to all his crimes.

117
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,180
No. That's not true.

118
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,920
Therefore, the prosecution...

119
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,720
demands the death penalty
for Defendant Kang Se Ri...

120
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,390
on murder and solicitation charges...

121
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,330
in the premeditated car accident,

122
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,530
and kidnapping, false imprisonment,
and attempted murder.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,270
No! That's not true!

124
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,240
The death penalty? Why me?

125
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,540
No!

126
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
Kang Jae In.

127
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,980
Kang Jae In, this is all your fault!

128
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,350
This is all because of you!

129
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,220
Kang Jae In,
you should've been the one to die!

130
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,950
Why should I have to die?

131
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,190
- This is all your fault!
- Order in the court!

132
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,120
- You! It's all your fault!
- Order!

133
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,730
Remove the defendant.
I order her removed from the court.

134
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,530
Hey!

135
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,300
Let go! I'm not the one
who should die!

136
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,810
What on earth is this?

137
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,680
(Certificate of Insurance)

138
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,180
That witch, Kang Se Ri,
tried to change the beneficiary.

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,710
I'm so glad I changed it right back.

140
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,120
He's gone now,

141
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,320
but the living must go on.

142
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Gi Chan.

143
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,900
I'll put this to good use.
Thank you.

144
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,210
First, I have to get out
of this filthy dump.

145
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,180
Hello,
is this the insurance company?

146
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Well...

147
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,220
I'm calling to claim
a life insurance benefit.

148
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,860
I was wondering
what documents I'll need.

149
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,700
The insurance is for Hwang Gi Chan.

150
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,170
His date of birth...

151
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,640
is 880824.

152
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,610
My name is Noh Sook Ja.

153
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,310
Excuse me?

154
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,810
What do you mean by that?

155
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,920
Wait.
If I'm not the beneficiary, who is?

156
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,490
Yes, Teo.
I'm so glad Ji Ho's adjusting well.

157
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,900
It's all thanks to you, Jae In.
Thanks for calling so often...

158
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,360
and being so thoughtful.

159
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,870
- How have you been?
- Great, thanks to you.

160
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,470
The gallery you designed
just finished construction,

161
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,070
and an exhibition is opening soon.

162
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,510
I'd like to invite you.
Do you want to come visit the gallery?

163
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,250
I'd love to.
Let me know when the date is set.

164
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,410
Okay. Talk to you later.

165
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,390
You wench!
Give me the money for my son's life!

166
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,390
Who are you to steal my son's money?

167
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,990
Get away from me!

168
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,200
What do you think you're doing?

169
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,500
Stay out of this! She's a thief!

170
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,740
She pocketed the money
from my son's death.

171
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,240
How can you say that
when you stole my father's life?

172
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,080
You think she's a monster?

173
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,010
- Your son,
- What...

174
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,310
Hwang Gi Chan, transferred
the rights. What's it to you?

175
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,650
Apologize to her right now.

176
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,520
That's crazy! Why would my son
give the rights to her?

177
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,060
It's the price of his life.
When his own mother is still here?

178
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,590
He gave it to her?

179
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,760
You've got to be kidding me!

180
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,730
This is Gi Chan's will.
It was even notarized.

181
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,030
His stocks, property,
and his life insurance payout...

182
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,740
are to be entrusted to me.
Here, see for yourself.

183
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,150
You think I'm going to believe
this scrap of paper?

184
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,850
You think I can't tell it's a fake?

185
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,590
Give me my money!

186
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,160
Give me the price of my son's life!

187
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,030
Darn.

188
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,870
Mom, what's wrong?

189
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,210
That crazy jerk!

190
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,910
How could he be so blinded
by a girl...

191
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,950
that he'd mistreat his own mother,
even in death?

192
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,250
You're the most ungrateful son
who ever lived!

193
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,890
Rot in the fiery pit!

194
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,490
After everything I did for him!

195
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,060
I gave him the world!

196
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,900
Of all people,

197
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,570
how could he give it to Kang Jae In?

198
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,740
When his own mother
is standing right here?

199
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,310
You're no son of mine!

200
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,850
You're not my son!

201
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,860
Did Gi Chan really
leave the insurance money to you?

202
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes, he did.

203
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,670
My mom's furious about it.
She's completely losing her mind.

204
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,970
She won't stop cursing him out.
It's a total nightmare.

205
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,710
So, listen.

206
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,080
That money...

207
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,390
Can't you give it to my mom?

208
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,420
I can't do that.

209
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,330
I'm begging you.
My mom has completely lost her mind.

210
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,500
I was so scared she was going
to take it out on me again,

211
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,230
so I just panicked and ran away.

212
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,840
The money from your brother
wasn't for me.

213
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,610
He wanted me to use it
for you and Gi Man.

214
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,710
That's why he appointed me
as your legal guardian.

215
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,450
Why?

216
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,220
So your mother
couldn't get the insurance money,

217
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,050
and to protect you and Gi Man.

218
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,920
That was his final wish.

219
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,130
That's why I asked to see you.

220
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,500
Don't just drift aimlessly.
Think about what to do next,

221
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,070
and if there's anything
you're passionate about.

222
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,030
I'll support you
in whatever you choose.

223
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,880
I'm finding a center for Gi Man
where he can get physical therapy.

224
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,550
I think it's better he lives there.

225
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,150
Of course,

226
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,750
only if you agree, Na Ra.

227
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,420
And...

228
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,190
once you can stand on your own feet
as a productive member of society,

229
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,430
I'll turn over the full amount
to you.

230
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,400
Do you understand what I'm saying?

231
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,130
You mean my brother...

232
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,570
did this for us?
Because he was worried about us?

233
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,210
That's right.

234
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,580
Oh, Gi Chan...

235
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,930
Na Ra.

236
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,000
Go make us some noodles.

237
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,800
Hwang Na Ra.

238
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,640
Honestly, this girl.
The sun's high in the sky,

239
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,480
and she won't even get up? Na Ra!

240
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,280
Hwang Na Ra!

241
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,620
Good grief.

242
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,590
Mom, don't look for me. Take care.

243
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,130
Na Ra.

244
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,570
Goodness. Oh, no.

245
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,210
I can't believe I raised
such ungrateful kids.

246
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,490
Mom, I'm hungry.
Give me something to eat.

247
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,860
I'm stuck with this dimwit.

248
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,830
How am I supposed to survive
on my own?

249
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,630
Oh, dear...

250
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,600
Oh, dear.

251
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,180
Right. The house.

252
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,180
The security deposit.

253
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,620
(The 65th YL Group Shareholders' Meeting)

254
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
(Agenda: Election of the New Chairman)

255
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,870
Regarding the election
of the new chairman of YL Group,

256
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,000
I will now announce
the results of the vote.

257
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,940
The next chairman of YL Group is...

258
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,680
Kang Jae In,
head of our Design Team.

259
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,810
Congratulations!

260
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,840
Hello, everyone. I'm Kang Jae In.

261
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,310
I take this role with a great sense
of responsibility.

262
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,480
I'll honor our late chairman's legacy,
Kang Gyu Cheol.

263
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,020
By providing the highest quality
and exceptional service,

264
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,250
we will expand beyond Korea
and onto the world stage.

265
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,720
I will do my best to lead YL Group
toward that future.

266
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,730
Thank you.

267
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,870
You've heard of
Doctors Without Borders, right?

268
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,570
Yes. Why do you ask all of a sudden?

269
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,150
That's right.

270
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,020
I've decided to volunteer abroad.
I leave tomorrow.

271
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,990
So soon?

272
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,160
Does your family know?

273
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,660
I've told my uncle,
and I'll to tell my mom today.

274
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,200
I dropped a few hints,
but I doubt she caught on.

275
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,170
Why the sudden decision?

276
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,400
Is it because of me?

277
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,110
So much has happened this year,
it's been overwhelming.

278
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,880
I just need to clear my head.

279
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,820
Of course, my feelings for you
are a factor too.

280
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,390
I'm not saying I'm giving up on you.

281
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,490
I just want to take some time
to do some soul-searching.

282
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,300
Along the way, I lost my composure
and got too hasty.

283
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,070
If you came to be with me
only because I pressured you,

284
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,170
we'd both just end up miserable,
wouldn't we?

285
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,570
I'll be gone for about a year.

286
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,180
I need to find some peace
and get my thoughts in order.

287
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,650
I'll be ready for your answer then.

288
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,690
You take your time and think too.

289
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,130
Wait.
This is where the princess lives.

290
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,500
Gi Man. Listen.

291
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,170
Stay right here, okay?

292
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,940
I'll go get you
your favorite ice cream.

293
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,640
Okay.

294
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,340
He's not a normal kid,

295
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,910
so they won't let him starve,
will they?

296
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,620
Goodbye, Gi Man.

297
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,520
Go live with that princess
you love so much.

298
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,460
Look. I'm leaving now.

299
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,020
You just stay right here.

300
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,970
Oh, it's you, Princess!

301
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,170
I didn't come here
to see you, Princess.

302
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,780
I won't cause you any trouble.

303
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,320
We'll take good care of him.
Don't you worry.

304
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,630
How could she just abandon
her own son?

305
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,210
This was in Gi Man's bag.
A note asking me to care for him.

306
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,450
It's a good thing I had someone
tailing her, just in case.

307
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,450
Sister...

308
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,950
Force of habit.

309
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,420
So, Hwang Na Ra
went to study abroad?

310
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,490
She said
she wanted to study fashion.

311
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,420
An opening came up,
so she had to go.

312
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,890
I told her to.

313
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,800
Is Gi Man staying
at the community center?

314
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Yes. There's a doctor on-site,

315
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,340
He can get rehab, so he'll be okay.
Don't worry too much.

316
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,170
Okay.

317
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,080
Getting him away from Noh Sook Ja
is a relief in itself.

318
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,050
I hope Noh Sook Ja
gets what's coming to her.

319
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,490
I'm not tied down anymore.

320
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,030
I'm Noh Sook Ja.
With this deposit money,

321
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,030
turning it into 10 or 20 times the amount
is a piece of cake.

322
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,370
Thief! Stop him! My money!

323
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,140
Darn it!

324
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,080
My money!

325
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,450
My money.

326
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,060
Medical volunteer work,
all of a sudden?

327
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,960
And you're leaving tomorrow?

328
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,260
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

329
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,460
I was afraid you'd be against it.

330
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,400
But still...

331
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,400
What's the big rush?

332
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,800
It all happened so fast.

333
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,510
The doctor there got sick and left,

334
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,180
and they couldn't leave
the position open.

335
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,780
You've long wanted to volunteer,
and done it occasionally,

336
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,050
so I had a feeling
this might happen.

337
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,850
But is this because of Jae In?

338
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,250
No.

339
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,620
You just said it yourself, Mom.

340
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,090
I've thought of this since college,
and this seems like a good chance.

341
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,900
It's not a dangerous place, is it?

342
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,830
No, it's not.

343
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,540
Even though it's volunteer work,
I'm mostly going to get some rest.

344
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,440
All right.

345
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,280
If you're so set on it,

346
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,840
then I guess you have to go.

347
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,440
(Chairman Kang Jae In)

348
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,810
Dad.

349
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,080
I've finally taken back YL Group.

350
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,150
From this position that you built,

351
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,350
I'll prove to everyone...

352
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,490
that YL Group is still going strong.

353
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,370
(1 year later)

354
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,640
Do it right!

355
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,580
Level 3, not 1.
Fill the whole space, top to bottom.

356
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,790
Lunchtime!

357
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,690
Chair.

358
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,410
You've got to eat
to keep your strength up.

359
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,720
Thank you.

360
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,890
Eat up!

361
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,640
Ta-da!

362
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,880
I won an award
at the Draw Your Dream Contest.

363
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,150
"Designer Kim Bo Ram, Designer?"
Gosh.

364
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,380
So your dream is to be a designer,
Bo Ram.

365
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,890
Yes. Just like Ms. Jae In,

366
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,760
I'm going to be a great designer.

367
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,260
Grandma Ja Young,
did I do a good job?

368
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,330
You did a wonderful job.

369
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,270
You could be a designer already.

370
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,470
- Want to see my other drawings?
- Sure.

371
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,610
Your mother seems to be doing
much better.

372
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,650
Yes, it's all thanks to Bo Ram.
She visits so often.

373
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,150
Having her as company
while she writes and draws...

374
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,450
seems to be helping.

375
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,250
That's such a relief.

376
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,890
Ja Young.
We're moving into a new house soon,

377
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,760
so you, Seung Woo, and Jae In
have to come to our housewarming.

378
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,060
Okay?

379
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,630
Of course.

380
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,830
Then I guess we'll need
to buy a housewarming gift for you.

381
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,770
You coming is the best gift.

382
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,140
Really?

383
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,060
Yes, Jae In. I'm on my way now.

384
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,500
That's right. Just wait there.

385
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,530
I'll be there soon.

386
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,110
Just wait a little longer, Jae In.

387
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,410
I've got a big surprise for you.

388
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,850
How about going
for a round of golf sometime?

389
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,320
I've never played.
I wonder if I'd be any good.

390
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,390
I can teach you.

391
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,460
Then maybe I'll take you up on that.

392
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,490
Your temp for the day is here!

393
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,600
Hey. Thanks to you,
I can play golf today.

394
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,070
Thanks.

395
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,040
Don't mention it.
Call me anytime I have a day off.

396
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,700
Okay, I appreciate it.

397
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,870
- I'll get going.
- Okay, have fun.

398
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,350
So, what should I start with?

399
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,120
Seung Woo!

400
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,420
Na Ra, I thought you were studying
in the States.

401
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm on break and came back for a bit
to see my brother.

402
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,160
My brother was craving the chicken
from here.

403
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,160
Half fried, half seasoned.

404
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,500
A Coke for me,
and a Coke Zero for my ugly sister.

405
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,200
I'll have that right out for you.

406
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,570
You guys go ahead and catch up.

407
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,310
Have a seat over here.

408
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,010
So, how is studying in the States?

409
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,720
It must be tough,
everything being so new.

410
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,420
The first few months
were a bit tough,

411
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,750
but I'm fine now.

412
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,250
You're still at the same company, right,
Seung Woo?

413
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,220
We have more new employees now,
and I'm their mentor.

414
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:51,160
I chew them out until they're bawling,

415
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,430
then I buy them coffee to make up.

416
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,000
I guess I'm a real adult now.

417
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,320
I'll bring back lots of yummy snacks
for you.

418
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,090
- Chocolate.
- Oh, sure.

419
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,620
- The last one was so good.
- Got it.

420
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,190
What's wrong? Aren't you coming?

421
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,230
Poor thing.

422
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,540
Here, get yourself something to eat.

423
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,170
Let's go.

424
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,950
Oh, dear.

425
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,260
("YL's Kang Jae In
Named Businessperson of the Year")

426
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,200
Those were the best of my gory days.

427
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,240
It's glory days, not gory days.

428
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,910
Don't use words you don't know.

429
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,870
Darn it. Shut your mouth.

430
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,880
How many times do I have to say it?

431
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,180
I'm telling you, that Kang Jae In
was my daughter-in-law.

432
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,750
My late son was supposed to be
the chairman of YL Group,

433
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,390
but that wicked Kang Jae In
tricked him and stole it all!

434
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,420
Really? My son is the chairman
of Samdong Group.

435
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,160
And you know my daughter
is the chairwoman of Sinnara Group, right?

436
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,330
You're all full of nonsense.

437
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,930
All of you, shut your mouth.

438
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's been a while.

439
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Have you been well?

440
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,270
You're back?

441
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,470
Yes.

442
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,950
Jae In, can I...

443
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,020
try to win your heart from now?

444
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,330
I missed you...

445
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,730
so much.

446
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,070
(We'd like to thank all our viewers
for supporting Queen's House.)
