1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,840
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,410
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,080
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,350
You just denied my late dad...

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,350
by denying my existence.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,350
And I can't forgive you anymore.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,260
Watch what you say.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,590
You just declared war against me.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,860
That's right.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,430
Like mother, like daughter.
You don't know who your superior is.

11
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,430
You should be ashamed of yourself.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,140
No, that's what I want to ask.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You made fake news seem real.

14
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,610
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,170
Not at all.

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,240
I must let the media know.

17
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,410
Were you behind that streamer?

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,320
If it were me,
I would've done it myself.

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,450
And if I had,
this wouldn't have happened.

20
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,450
People won't believe me...

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,990
even if I stepped in now.

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,160
And if I call reporters,
you'll stop them from reporting.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,130
If I bring my family registrar,

24
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,470
it's obvious you'll claim
the files were all fabricated.

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,100
If you know that, give up.

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,740
At times, giving up is
the wisest thing you can do.

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,140
Is that all you have to say?

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,540
Let me know if you need money.
I'll help you.

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
I don't need hush money.

30
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,910
Both you and your mom
kept coming here,

31
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,450
so I thought
it was because of money.

32
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,780
If you don't want it, never mind.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,320
Don't ever set foot in here again.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,720
I'm not here for you and your mother
to vent your feelings.

35
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,930
Do you understand?

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,530
I can't promise you that.

37
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,800
My dad...

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,630
and grandpa shed their blood
and sweat for this business,

39
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,470
so I plan to take it back.

40
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,170
I'll also make sure
I take my position back.

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,210
I'll show you...

42
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,110
that I'm Kang Jae In.

43
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,850
And it begins now.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Why are you here?

45
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,330
I came to see Aunt Mi Ran.

46
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,540
You probably don't want to see me.
Goodbye.

47
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,450
I heard you went
and had a go at Mom.

48
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,980
I'm glad you did that.

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,620
I would've done much worse
if I were you.

50
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,660
I'm severing my ties
with Aunt Mi Ran.

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,360
So what?

52
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,330
Are you asking me to side with you?

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,100
No, I thought you should know.

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,570
But what became of my relationship
with her doesn't really matter.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,540
I still feel the same way about you.

56
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,170
It doesn't matter
if you choose to accept it or not.

57
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,310
I'm just saying.

58
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,750
I just wanted to tell you that.

59
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,150
Take care.

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,630
Are you still not over my husband?

61
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,430
You show up
whenever something happens,

62
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,940
so it seems like
you're still not over him.

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,770
Not at all.

64
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,340
Why would I be attached
to someone who killed my son?

65
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,780
He didn't kill anyone!

66
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,310
He got into the accident
after he left to meet you.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,410
I see.

68
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,420
That's right.

69
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,380
Then, let's just say
I'm not over him.

70
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,750
I'm not over my dead son, Eun Ho.

71
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,260
So, why does that lingering feeling
keep leading me back here?

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,860
You're trying to shift the blame.

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,330
You want to frame us...

74
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,160
for the sense of guilt
you're feeling.

75
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,430
But nothing you do will work.

76
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,930
Can't you see?

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,140
Congratulations, Jae In.

78
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,010
This time,
you really became Kang Jae In.

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,540
What are you talking about?

80
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,740
I had always been Kang Jae In.

81
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,950
Back in school, I was Kang Jae In A,
and you were Kang Jae In B.

82
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,310
That was how we were addressed.

83
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,320
You may have stolen my place,

84
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,120
but you'll always be
just Kang Jae In B.

85
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,160
See you around, Kang Jae In B.

86
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,930
You! I'm Kang Jae In!

87
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,160
There's no reason
for us to see each other!

88
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,360
Don't ever return here again!

89
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,240
I just saw the news article.
What's going on?

90
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,110
Seung Woo.

91
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,010
She's not my sister.

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,210
You need
to publish a correction now!

93
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,980
I had to do it for the business.

94
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,550
That streamer incident had
a huge impact on our company.

95
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,420
So, you chose to spread fake news?

96
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,260
That's crazy!

97
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,590
If YL Group collapses,

98
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,730
everything I sacrificed to protect
will come crashing down, too.

99
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,100
I had to stop this scandal first,

100
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,600
and I did it for you.

101
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,070
How am I going to face Jae In now?

102
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,700
You don't have to see her again!

103
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,670
Aunt Mi Ran.

104
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,940
That was too harsh of me.

105
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,650
You don't have to do that.

106
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,650
Jae In just stopped by,

107
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,480
so she found out
I did this all alone.

108
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,420
You don't have to feel guilty
about this.

109
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,620
Seung Woo,
let me tell you once again...

110
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,660
that I'll be the villain.

111
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,390
All you need to do is
focus on your work...

112
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,730
to grow this business bigger.

113
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,800
That's the best you can do...

114
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,530
for your late father.
Do you understand?

115
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,500
Do you think
Dad would've agreed with you?

116
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,040
He'll thank me
as soon as we turn over...

117
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,210
this tough corner.

118
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,710
That woman will be
sick in bed for days.

119
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,750
People even suggested
I should be a shot put athlete...

120
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,650
back in elementary school.

121
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,420
Oh, my.

122
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,560
Did he shave his face because of me?

123
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,900
What happened to you?
Your hair is a mess...

124
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,540
Some crazy woman...

125
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,670
suddenly attacked me.

126
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,210
I was frightened out of my mind.

127
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,380
Oh Seong, why are you still here?

128
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,680
My gosh. Did someone
pull out your hair in a fight?

129
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,320
I only suffered from an attack.

130
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,660
Even hearing the word fight...

131
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,390
makes me scared.

132
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,390
A stranger
suddenly picked a fight with her.

133
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,960
This world is a scary place.

134
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,200
You should be careful, too.

135
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,400
Okay.

136
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,640
Oh, my.

137
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,340
We're tracking down the uploader,

138
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,840
but the IP address was overseas,

139
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,910
and they used VPNs...

140
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,150
to reroute many different times
to erase their trace...

141
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,650
to avoid getting chased.

142
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,750
That person was
determined to come after me.

143
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,750
I must get rid of them
before things get more troublesome.

144
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,460
Yes, I'll find whatever trace I can.

145
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,760
Also, Ms. Kim Do Hee's
bereaved family is...

146
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,060
going around
looking for leads to the incident.

147
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,800
I thought you should know.

148
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,970
They're digging into a case
that was closed ages ago?

149
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,370
Did they find out
about Choi Ja Young's release?

150
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,040
I know you're busy,
but please keep an eye on that, too.

151
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,210
Sure.

152
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,190
Mommy, are you in a good mood?

153
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,020
Do I look like it?

154
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,460
Yes, I'm in a great mood.

155
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,230
That must be Grandma.

156
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,900
- Bring her here for dinner.
- Okay.

157
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,640
Goodness, what a feast.

158
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,440
I didn't prepare it myself, though.

159
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,780
I bought it at a famous restaurant.
Please have some meat.

160
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Where's Gi Chan?

161
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,380
He has a dinner thing,
so he'll be late.

162
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,380
Gosh, this looks great.

163
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,020
Everything here is high in calories.

164
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,430
Se Ri, water, please.

165
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,460
I'm trying to lose weight,
so I can't eat these.

166
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,570
I'll just drink water, too.

167
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,370
I have to lose weight.

168
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,170
Mom, think of your age.

169
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,970
You're going to collapse
if you starve yourself.

170
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,470
If something goes wrong,
you'll go to the other side,

171
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:30,780
so eat.

172
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,410
Is that so?
Maybe I'll have just one bite.

173
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,620
Here.

174
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,190
Gosh, my chin hurts.

175
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,560
Be careful, Mom.
The thread will pop.

176
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,920
Where's my water, Se Ri?

177
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,860
You can get it yourself.

178
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,290
I'm trying to feed Ji Ho.

179
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,830
Do you have to get on the good side
of Ms. Jung at the chicken place?

180
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,770
You're always there these days.
What's going on?

181
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,880
You both have done a great job
at growing into decent people...

182
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,110
without a dad.

183
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,650
You'll have a new dad soon.

184
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,490
Grandma, you'll have a dad soon?

185
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,150
What?

186
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,020
No, not my dad.

187
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,390
My husband. He'll be your grandpa.

188
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,900
Gosh.

189
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,170
Mom, how many fingers do you see?

190
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,970
What are you talking about?

191
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,910
I was wondering if you had dementia.

192
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,270
What do you mean
we'll suddenly have a dad soon?

193
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,840
That's just crazy.

194
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,010
Why? I can always get married.

195
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,650
My gosh.

196
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,010
Have you been dating someone?

197
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,280
Oh, my gosh.

198
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,950
No way, Mom.
I'm getting married first.

199
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,350
You can marry someone after me.

200
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,750
Don't be ridiculous.

201
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,960
There's a proper order
to everything in this world.

202
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,090
I'm getting married first.

203
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,230
I'm home.

204
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,890
You're back, Yu Gyeong.

205
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,160
- Come and join us.
- I don't have an appetite.

206
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,300
Can we talk after you're done?

207
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,530
I'm done. I'll be there.

208
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,410
What is it?

209
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,520
I heard
you got into a fight with Gi Man.

210
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,820
Is that it?

211
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,150
That's my problem,
and I'll handle it.

212
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,750
Why do you live your life like that?

213
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,760
You need to help me understand...

214
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
before you
suddenly throw that at me.

215
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,030
I saw the news article.

216
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,800
Are you happy
now that you have become Jae In?

217
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,430
Oh, that?

218
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,330
I had to do it reluctantly
because of the business.

219
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,270
And it wasn't just my decision.

220
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,700
Don't you remember
when we were in high school?

221
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,070
You went around doing bad things
by using her name,

222
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,180
and things still seem the same.

223
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,980
You better be careful.

224
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes, I'll be careful,
my sister-in-law.

225
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,750
And make sure
it doesn't impact me in any way.

226
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,130
I'm Kang Jae In now,

227
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,400
so I'll show her mercy.

228
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,200
She even released
her niece's name, Kang Jae In.

229
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,100
But are you saying
the woman in the photo...

230
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,240
isn't the real Kang Jae In?

231
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,370
Why would her aunt do this?

232
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,410
It must be for the business.

233
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,480
The stock price
flopped pretty badly.

234
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,280
But still, this is...

235
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,580
Then, where's the real Kang Jae In?

236
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,750
Doesn't she feel wronged?

237
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,620
She should step up...

238
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,060
and reclaim her identity
in this situation.

239
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,030
Darn it.
This is giving me a headache.

240
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,600
Whatever. I'm going to sleep.

241
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,670
I get what you're saying,
but everything sounds complicated.

242
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,770
Goodnight.
I have some more work to do.

243
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,340
Where are you going?

244
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,740
To the living room.

245
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,070
You can turn the lights off
and go to sleep.

246
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,480
Goodnight, Ms. Kang.

247
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,250
All right. Goodnight, Bo Ram.

248
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,480
- Goodnight.
- You should get back to work.

249
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,650
Uncle Do Yun, goodnight.

250
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,190
Hey, goodnight.

251
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,690
Let's go.

252
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,660
I had to catch up on more work,
so I came to do it here.

253
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,460
Do you want some coffee?
I just began to boil water.

254
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,730
Sure.

255
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,660
It'll take a while
for the water to boil. Have a seat.

256
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,870
You look exhausted.

257
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,340
I had a lot to worry about.

258
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,280
What did your aunt say?

259
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,320
I think she's with Gi Chan.

260
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,120
It must've been the case
since the general meeting.

261
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,690
Were the photos in the news
all Photoshopped?

262
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,990
No.

263
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,430
She took a shot with us
when we took our wedding photos.

264
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,260
Only my face was
swapped out with Se Ri's face.

265
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,730
So, there must be
an original of that photo.

266
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,600
My aunt probably has it.

267
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,700
Everything that had to do with me
all disappeared...

268
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,470
as soon as I got locked up
in the mental hospital.

269
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,270
He married Se Ri now,

270
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,940
so he must've thrown out
all our photos.

271
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,450
Why do you think
your aunt is taking things this far?

272
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,750
Hwang Gi Chan is a stranger,
but you're her family.

273
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,820
The water must be boiling.

274
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,920
Wait.

275
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,260
Let me do it.

276
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,630
Hey...

277
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,650
Gosh, that just woke me up.

278
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,590
No, that's impossible.

279
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,030
No way.

280
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,560
I must've gotten confused because
I haven't dated in a long time.

281
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,070
Of course, he can
put a blanket over her. Yes.

282
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes, of course.

283
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,570
But can he?

284
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,580
Goodness. My gosh.

285
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,850
You should see a doctor.

286
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,550
Let me escort you.

287
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,180
I'm fine.

288
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,090
A local clinic won't run
any effective exams anyway.

289
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
There isn't much difference...

290
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,020
between big hospitals
and clinics nowadays.

291
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,430
I'll manage.

292
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,200
If it hurts, I'll see a doctor.
You should get to work.

293
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,230
All right. Please excuse me.

294
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,370
There are some side dishes
in the refrigerator,

295
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,010
- so just warm up the rice...
- How am I going to do that?

296
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,380
All right. You should go.

297
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,850
Goodbye.

298
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,790
Gosh, I'm in so much pain.

299
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,960
Is she made of rock?

300
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,060
How can she beat me that cruelly?

301
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,560
She's such an ignorant woman.

302
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,800
Ouch.

303
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,370
Should I see a doctor?

304
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,300
I can't go outside
looking like this.

305
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,680
It's me, Doctor.

306
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,060
(Contest Application)

307
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,360
(Your contest application
has been accepted.)

308
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,030
I have to win this contest.

309
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,580
I'm on my way to the design team,
so get everything ready.

310
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,580
Hello.

311
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,860
Well, I have a question.

312
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,390
I heard you married
your friend's husband.

313
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,360
I saw it on YouTube.

314
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,500
Is this true?

315
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,730
Did you and your friend's husband
really hit it off...

316
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,340
You had an affair, right?

317
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,510
Why can't you take a hint?

318
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,640
If you saw the YouTube video,
you must know who my husband is.

319
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,240
Of course, I do.

320
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,350
He's the chairman of YL Group.

321
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,220
So, where's his ex-wife,

322
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,080
the real wife he was married to?

323
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,260
I'm a counselor,
so I wanted to provide my service.

324
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,060
You don't know?

325
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,460
Shouldn't you know
if you're her friend?

326
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,960
Hey, Ms. Lee Geum Ja.

327
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,800
Take a hint.

328
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,300
You'll lose your job
if you keep speaking such nonsense.

329
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,070
Have some common sense.

330
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,540
I was just curious,
so I thought I'd ask.

331
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,740
I can't hold back my curiosity.

332
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,450
I'm his real wife,
and I am Kang Jae In.

333
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,880
Do you understand?

334
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,980
It's bad manners to sit in an empty office
without permission.

335
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,810
Don't you know that?

336
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,980
I do.

337
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,910
No one was at the office,

338
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,220
and I couldn't ask anyone,
so I came in.

339
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,390
I was going to call you anyway.

340
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,350
Take the money you left here.

341
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,960
Why are you staring at me?

342
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,860
I saw the news article.

343
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,130
Your niece, Kang Jae In,

344
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,370
is the daughter of the gallery director
who killed my niece, right?

345
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,400
I wanted to know...

346
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,240
why she suddenly showed herself
after years of hiding.

347
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,240
I don't have to explain this
to someone completely unrelated.

348
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,910
Would I still be unrelated
if I harassed her?

349
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,880
Don't ruin your life
by getting personal revenge.

350
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,390
Are you pretending
to worry about me?

351
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,250
I'm worried about my niece.

352
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,190
But I do feel
a little bad about you.

353
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,440
Take this.

354
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,810
I apologize
for what happened to your niece.

355
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,710
It wasn't my fault,
but it was my family affair,

356
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,340
so I apologize
on behalf of everyone.

357
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,910
I'm truly sorry.

358
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,450
Dragging this on will
only leave everyone with scars.

359
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,480
Let's end it amicably at this point.

360
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,220
We must scrape out
everything that's festered...

361
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,090
to prevent infection,
even if it may leave scars.

362
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,530
So, you don't want
an apology or money?

363
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,490
Would it take
someone's death to end this?

364
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,900
My brother died.

365
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,730
Your brother's death had
nothing to do with us.

366
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,900
Don't blame us for that.

367
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,200
You aren't completely free
from responsibility!

368
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,440
He was stressed out of his mind
because of that incident.

369
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,210
Hey, Ms. Kang Mi Ran.

370
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,010
We also suffered...

371
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,450
from lots of stress
after Do Hee died.

372
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,350
Who would be tortured more?

373
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,050
The victim's family
or the perpetrator's?

374
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,990
Don't you think you're shameless?

375
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,290
You can't say something like that
before my family.

376
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,630
Just tell me why you're here.

377
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,530
It's Kang Jae In.

378
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,840
Is the woman in the picture
the real Kang Jae In?

379
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,140
You'd know if you read the article.

380
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,580
I won't have to ask anymore.

381
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,920
I'll never come and see you again
on personal business.

382
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,620
Take this.

383
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,660
You can't call this off
by paying me this kind of money.

384
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,700
How much do you want?

385
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,430
YL Group.

386
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,740
No? Never mind, then.

387
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,120
So? Are you growing the business
into a world-renowned corporation?

388
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,690
I'm all ready to eat my hat.

389
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,260
No one can
turn a business global overnight.

390
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,760
Just wait.

391
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,330
Okay. If the owner of YL Group is
completely sure about this,

392
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,730
then I'll wait.

393
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,100
Who are you calling
the owner of this company?

394
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,970
Well, this man.

395
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,810
See you around, my friend.

396
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,110
Mr. Kang, who was that man?

397
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,450
No idea.
If you want to know, ask Ms. Kang.

398
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,890
Those were just scratches,

399
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,690
so you'll be fine
after a few days of rest.

400
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,660
If you have sore muscles,

401
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,360
I'll send you some prescribed drugs.

402
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,460
Do that.

403
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,470
So, you're staying
at a place like this?

404
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,670
It's a temporary place.

405
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,010
I'm trying to hide myself
from the media.

406
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,880
Right. I see.

407
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,610
What about the whistle-blower?

408
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,550
Have you not found them yet?

409
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,150
Did I forget to tell you?

410
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,450
He quit right away
after blowing the whistle.

411
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,960
Who was that punk?

412
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,820
Where is that person now?

413
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,890
Please drink this during your shift.

414
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,060
Thanks for the coffee.

415
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,370
Oh, my. It's already past 4 p.m.

416
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,770
I'm free tonight.

417
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,670
- If you want to thank me...
- Where's Kim Do Yun?

418
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,210
Wait, Ms. Choi...

419
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,080
I heard it was you.

420
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,010
You told the media all about it.

421
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,280
Why won't you say anything?

422
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,920
You were the whistle-blower.

423
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,220
Yes.

424
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,320
It was me.

425
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,030
Who's behind you?

426
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,760
Who was it?

427
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,530
I know. You're working here,
making the answer obvious.

428
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,830
Gi Chan
must've stabbed me in the back...

429
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,570
and given you a job here.

430
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,940
You're on the wrong track.

431
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,480
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol was
the one who hired me.

432
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,780
What? That's crazy.

433
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,780
Why would he do that?

434
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,920
Geum Ja, call the police.

435
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,450
I did the interview
and got the job fairly.

436
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
What's wrong with that?

437
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,720
If you got a job here
in return for your sister's life,

438
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,130
you should've kept your mouth shut.

439
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,960
Is this how you repay our kindness?

440
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,830
Kindness?

441
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,370
My sister died!

442
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,270
How can you call that kindness?

443
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,900
No one in their right mind
would say anything like that.

444
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,370
Get out of here now!

445
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,310
How dare you scream at me?

446
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,140
Let go of me. Let go!

447
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,950
Hello? Is this the police?

448
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,350
We need you here now.

449
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,420
- This is...
- Wait, Na Ra.

450
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,030
I heard you were still
waiting for your trial.

451
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,000
Will you be okay
if the police get here?

452
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,670
There are witnesses here,
so you can't deny it this time.

453
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,500
You may end up detained
for interfering with business...

454
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,670
and assault.

455
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,740
What should I do?

456
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,510
I'll find evidence...

457
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,620
that you and Gi Chan
colluded with each other, so wait.

458
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,290
Are you okay, Dr. Kim?
That must've been shocking.

459
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,790
I'm fine.

460
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,090
I'm glad you're here.
I was going to call you.

461
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,390
Don't you ever feel sorry
or have a sense of guilt?

462
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,960
How can you do something
that irrational?

463
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,860
What did Dr. Kim do wrong
to deserve a beating?

464
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,000
How did you know that?

465
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,970
It must've been that stupid girl,
Gi Chan's sister,

466
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,440
who blabbed such nonsense to you.

467
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,810
Dr. Kim has
nothing to do with Gi Chan,

468
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,240
so don't go back there
and make a scene.

469
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,810
Both you and I shouldn't treat him
with such disrespect.

470
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,950
Do you have any idea
what he has done?

471
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,950
How can my child berate me
even before hearing me out?

472
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,920
Who is he anyway?
Why do you side with him?

473
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,620
- Mom.
- I'm in this mess because of him.

474
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,490
I wouldn't have fallen like this
if he hadn't blown the whistle...

475
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,760
at the hospital.

476
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,830
And your dad would still be here.

477
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,860
What now? Don't make a scene there?

478
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,070
Did you ask why I slapped him?

479
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,930
You can't say these things to me.

480
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,370
You're at fault.

481
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,270
I didn't do anything wrong.

482
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,280
Do you really not know
what you did wrong?

483
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,910
No, I don't.

484
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,210
What did I do so wrong?

485
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Who had an affair with Gi Chan?

486
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,750
It was Se Ri.

487
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,320
So what?

488
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,950
Don't you know
who Dr. Kim's sister is?

489
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,860
You killed an innocent woman.

490
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,760
That was because
Kang Se Ri deceived me...

491
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,000
Mom, please!

492
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,200
Please just admit it.

493
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,740
Even if you were deceived,
you chose to kill Ms. Kim.

494
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,540
That's the fact.

495
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,040
I'm tired.

496
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,580
I'm going to sleep, so go.

497
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,490
You're here, Jae In.

498
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,200
You killed an innocent woman.

499
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,000
You chose to kill Ms. Kim.

500
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,840
That's the fact.

501
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,220
Are you unwell?

502
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,450
Ms. Choi didn't seem so well,

503
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,650
so I got some medicine
and came home early.

504
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,790
Thank you for looking after her.

505
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,130
I should do that
for a guest who's staying here.

506
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,760
You don't have to mind it.

507
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,470
Anyway, I have something to say.

508
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,670
Sure. Please say it.

509
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,240
I'll side
with Gi Chan for a while...

510
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,080
for your sake.

511
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,710
Mr. Do.

512
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,920
I'll relay
whatever I know about you...

513
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,620
and Ms. Choi for a while.

514
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,220
That way, he'll trust me...

515
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,130
and show me his true colors.

516
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,560
You can use me as you like...

517
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,830
when you have to deal with him.

518
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,100
Thank you, Mr. Do.

519
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,740
Actually, there was something
I wanted to ask you to do.

520
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,040
But I kept feeling like
I was a huge nuisance.

521
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,840
Please go ahead.

522
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,410
What can I help you with?

523
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,010
It's Kang Se Ri.

524
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,650
You know she went to high school
with Yu Gyeong and me, right?

525
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,050
Her real name was Kang Jae In,
the same as me.

526
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,590
Please do some digging on her.

527
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,160
I thought I knew all about her,

528
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,800
but it seemed like
I didn't know anything.

529
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,670
Are you all right after that slap?

530
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,880
Yes, I don't look it,
but I can take a beating like that.

531
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,080
I'm sorry.

532
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,550
Let me apologize on her behalf.

533
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,820
Let me apologize, too.

534
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,420
I don't regret blowing the whistle
on the false diagnosis,

535
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,100
but I made you
run into those reporters on purpose,

536
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,730
and you almost collapsed
on that day.

537
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,170
It was because you wanted me...

538
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,600
to be miserable
as my mom's daughter.

539
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,640
I understand.

540
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,140
I'm sorry.

541
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,210
My anger shouldn't have been
directed toward you.

542
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,220
You can resent me,
hate me, and blame me.

543
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,650
I didn't have
a clean slate before you.

544
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,890
I don't blame you.

545
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,560
She must be punished
for what she has done wrong.

546
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,460
I'm glad you blew the whistle.

547
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,370
You only did what you had to.

548
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,640
Darn it. The more I think about it,
the angrier I am.

549
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:41,240
How can Ms. Choi slap Dr. Kim
just like that?

550
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,380
Na Ra, what are you talking about?

551
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,580
No idea. She suddenly barged in,

552
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,280
called Dr. Kim a whistle-blower,

553
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,020
slapped him,
and screamed at him, too.

554
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,390
Right. His younger sister died.

555
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,230
She called it revenge or something.

556
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,700
His younger sister died?

557
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,030
What's his sister's name?

558
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,500
How would I know that?

559
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,540
It's Kim Do Hee.

560
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:12,740
What did you just say?

561
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,010
Ms. Kim Do Hee was
Dr. Kim Do Yun's younger sister.

562
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,250
Didn't Se Ri tell you?

563
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,590
She had known for a long time.

564
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,970
(Queen's House)

565
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,670
Isn't Jae In also named Kang Jae In?

566
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,870
Why do you ask?

567
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,640
Why did you volunteer
to get a job at YL Group,

568
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,450
the company of a family
that killed your sister?

569
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,880
Why do you suddenly want to move?

570
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,220
Let me get the place.
I'm a very affluent man,

571
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,420
much bigger than
anything you can imagine.

572
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,420
Hello, Patrick.

573
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,660
This is Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
of YL Group calling.

574
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,060
See?

575
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,860
In the end, Director Kang Mi Ran is
one of the Kangs,

576
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,430
and she's on Jae In's side.

577
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,530
Kim Do Yun.

578
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,230
I must get rid of that man
before the ticking bomb goes off.
