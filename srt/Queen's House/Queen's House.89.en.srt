00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,950
(Episode 89)

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,280
By any chance,
is this person's name Catherine?

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
Tae Ho?

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,660
No.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,570
This woman is not my sister.

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,100
I don't know what's going on,

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,440
but why are you asking
about my sister?

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,970
Please don't get the wrong idea.
It's not your sister,

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,710
it's this woman
we want to know about.

13
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,210
This woman
is posing as your sister, Catherine.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,820
It's a case of identity theft.
We must find her link to Catherine.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,220
That's what we want to find out.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,820
I wonder.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,090
Do you think she was close
to Catherine?

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
No.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,430
Kang Se Ri.

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,300
That woman...

21
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,440
We dated briefly.

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,950
Is Lee Tae Ho
in the office building?

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Yes.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,020
But I haven't even sent him
the catalogue or the contract.

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,590
He must be on his way up, then.

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,930
Actually, I don't think he's here
to see you, sir.

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,570
He went to DH Holdings' Investment
and Development Team a while ago.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,770
We'd like to know more
about Kang Se Ri.

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,370
Could you tell us about her?

30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,110
I'm sorry,
but that's a private matter.

31
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,420
I'm not even sure
what's going on myself.

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,680
It looks like
I need to do my own digging.

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,490
We can talk again after that.

34
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,960
All right.
I'm sorry if we were too personal.

35
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,730
Not at all.

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,100
Anyway, our purpose was to meet
with Designer L, wasn't it?

37
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,240
I'll email you the proposal
we discussed on the way over.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,840
Okay.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,640
I need you to review it favorably.

40
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,040
If we showcase an exhibition hall
revamped with Designer L's style,

41
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,480
I think it will be a meaningful gift
for the visitors.

42
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,950
My whole team is really excited
about it.

43
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
I'll think it over.

44
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,220
Well, I should get going.

45
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,960
Should we meet separately tomorrow?

46
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,960
No, we got the answer we needed.

47
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,870
We'll see you around.

48
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,430
Take care.

49
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,740
Hello.

50
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,640
I heard you were in the building
and came to say hello.

51
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,150
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Not at all.

52
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,450
We had just finished up
and were about to see him out.

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,180
Goodbye, then.

54
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,520
Please let me know
about the proposal.

55
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,520
Yes, I'll be in touch.

56
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,560
Please come to my office.

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,200
Thank you, but I'm only here
to meet Designer L,

58
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
which is why
I didn't contact you beforehand.

59
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,370
It's about the project I mentioned,
the one I want to work with L on.

60
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,710
I came to propose it
to her in person.

61
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,880
Of course, this is scheduled
for after my YL Group contract ends,

62
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,550
so you don't need
to concern yourself.

63
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,620
May I ask...

64
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,220
what your meeting
with DH Holdings was about?

65
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,720
It turns out Patrick is good friends
with a long-time U.S. client.

66
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,890
I guess he heard I was coming here
and reached out to Patrick himself.

67
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,830
You seem to have a great deal
of interest in my affairs.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,130
Please don't get the wrong idea.

69
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,600
I was simply curious.

70
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,210
I see. Well, I'll see you soon.

71
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,120
Mi Sook? What brings you here?

72
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,390
I came to talk.

73
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,030
I'm glad you came here.
Please have a seat.

74
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,470
Actually, after your acquittal
and the news of the reinvestigation,

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,570
I was hoping that
while you can still remember,

76
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,780
I wanted to have a good, long talk
and clear the air.

77
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,050
I'm sorry I was acquitted.

78
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,120
How can you say that?

79
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,050
Even though it was
all a misunderstanding,

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,450
and even though I didn't kill
Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee,

81
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,360
the things I said to her
because I was mistaken,

82
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
and my actions...

83
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:55,100
I can't take any of it back
or undo it.

84
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,970
So I still feel guilty,
and I am truly sorry.

85
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,010
Thank you for apologizing.

86
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,980
I know my Do Hee better than anyone.

87
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,150
She would accept a sincere apology
and knew how to forgive.

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,390
Would you like to go with me
to see her sometime?

89
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,590
- I can?
- Of course.

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,860
I'll tell her that her mom
has made a new, close friend.

91
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,440
Now, you and Mr. Kang Seung Woo...

92
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,900
are free from the false accusations.

93
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,810
All that's left is
to put the real culprit away.

94
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,440
So it's such a relief.

95
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,980
I can finally breathe again.

96
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,750
Seung Woo?

97
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,790
I have to go see my Seung Woo.

98
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,560
It's his first office job,
so he must feel out of place.

99
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,030
I'll go with you.

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,460
If you're going, I'm going with you.

101
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,730
The number you've called
is unavailable.

102
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,830
Connecting to voicemail...

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,500
Why isn't Ms. Choi
answering her phone?

104
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,490
Son, are you okay?

105
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,350
Are your superiors
giving you a hard time?

106
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,120
Honestly,
your father is just too much.

107
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,130
As if making Jae In start
as a regular staffer wasn't enough,

108
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,730
you have to suffer like this too?

109
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,030
No, Mom.
I'm actually really happy with it.

110
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,970
I already made Assistant Manager.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Really?

112
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,880
Then again, my son can do anything.

113
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,110
We were having a nice chat,

114
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,450
and I guess she
suddenly thought of you.

115
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,820
Now that she's found you,
I'll get going.

116
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,460
Okay.
Thank you for bringing my mom here.

117
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,160
I'll take it from here.

118
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,630
Mom, you know
that flower cafe you like?

119
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,870
Do you want to go grab a cup
of coffee there?

120
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,910
Oh, I'd love that!

121
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Yun Hee!

122
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,060
What brings you here
without calling first?

123
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,960
Ja Young came by my place,
and we talked for a bit.

124
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,460
But then she got a bit
disoriented again.

125
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,500
She said she had to see her son,
but I couldn't just let her go alone.

126
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,870
You did the right thing.

127
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,340
Anyway, time to get back to work.

128
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,250
Bring him home for a visit sometime.

129
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,120
Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo.

130
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,950
Really?

131
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,750
He grew up oblivious to everything.
How is any of this his fault?

132
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,620
Bring him over.
I'll make him a home-cooked meal.

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I'm off.

134
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,740
It looks like your mother's starting
to warm up to him.

135
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Right?

136
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,310
(Executive Director Kang Mi Ran)

137
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,920
Did Ja Young stop by
while I was in my meeting?

138
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,150
Yes, I was just on my way back
after taking her home.

139
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,920
Director Do is watching her at home.

140
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,260
Good.

141
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,230
From now on,

142
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,370
she'll probably come looking for me
whenever she's not doing well.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sure she will.

144
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,440
And I plan on checking in on her
more often too.

145
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,280
And eventually,

146
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,410
if a time comes...

147
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,250
when she can no longer manage
on her own,

148
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,650
I'm even considering
moving in with her.

149
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,130
To me, she will always...

150
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,360
be my mom.

151
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,530
That's one thing
that will never change.

152
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,240
She's the one who raised me
and loved me.

153
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,240
That's because she was my mom.

154
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,470
So now, it's my turn to give back...

155
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,480
all the love she has given me.

156
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,680
That's what it means to be
a decent human being and a son.

157
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,190
Seung Woo.

158
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,320
You're right.

159
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,630
I know exactly
where you're coming from.

160
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,000
I know you were worried about me,

161
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,600
but I'm okay.

162
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,370
You should do whatever
you want to do.

163
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,400
Whatever you want...

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,140
is what I want too.

165
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,910
That's all that matters to me.

166
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,510
You know, even though my mother
is still alive,

167
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,220
my birth mother may be
Choi Ja Young,

168
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,690
but today,
I really wanted to say this to you.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you.

170
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,970
Mom.

171
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,810
I should get going.

172
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,140
(YL group)

173
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,180
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

174
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,010
I have very high expectations.

175
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,890
First, I'd like to take
a close look at the pieces.

176
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,590
By all means.

177
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,920
You'll be even more impressed
by the artistry...

178
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,230
when you see it in person.

179
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,100
It's been a while
since you were last in Korea.

180
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,900
Have you had a chance to do
any sightseeing?

181
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,570
You know, Korea is more dynamic
than any other country.

182
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,240
I came here to rest,
but work has just piled up.

183
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,870
To be honest,
more than seeing the tourist sites,

184
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,110
I've been more curious
about what a Korean home is like.

185
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,350
Like the way people live,

186
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,920
home-cooked meals and their diet,
you know.

187
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
I see.

188
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,790
I suppose it's because
of my Korean roots.

189
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,190
I don't have any relatives here,
so I haven't had the chance.

190
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,400
It's much better to have a home base
when you're working.

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,130
Staying in a hotel
just doesn't feel very grounding.

192
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,530
Maybe that's why
I've been struggling a bit lately.

193
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,770
Well then, how would you like
to stay at my home for a while?

194
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,910
That's all right.
I couldn't possibly impose.

195
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,780
Nonsense, it's no imposition at all.

196
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,810
We have a spare room,

197
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,680
and we can easily set another plate.

198
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,820
In fact, why not come over today?

199
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,920
Really? Would that be all right?

200
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,690
Of course. I invited you, didn't I?

201
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,560
Please make yourself at home.

202
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Excuse me.

203
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,970
Oh, Tae Ho?

204
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,040
What brings you here?

205
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,840
Do you have a moment?

206
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,610
There's something
I could use your help with.

207
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,680
Could we maybe talk outside?

208
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,550
It looks like it's about time
for lunch.

209
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Sure.

210
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,950
Mr. Kang, go get some lunch.
I'm heading out for some too.

211
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
A toy?

212
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,090
It's not for me.

213
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,890
I'm going to be staying
at an acquaintance's home for a bit,

214
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,500
and they have a child.

215
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,860
I'd like to get them a small gift,

216
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,270
but I'm not sure what to get.

217
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,340
How old is the kid?

218
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,970
Seven.

219
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,110
Let's go.
You bought lunch, so let me help.

220
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,850
You'd do that?

221
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,950
Thanks.

222
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,220
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

223
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,160
We're not home.
Stop waltzing in and out.

224
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,200
Look at this.

225
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm not interested.

226
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,600
Just look at it.

227
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Look.

228
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,110
See?

229
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,840
Do you think a woman like that
would ever come back to you?

230
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,110
Kang Jae In
has absolutely no interest in you.

231
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,120
Get over her.

232
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,150
That meeting wasn't about Jae In.
It was business with a Designer L.

233
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,620
Are you out of your mind?

234
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,630
How can you possibly defend her?

235
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,130
Just go home early today.

236
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,400
We have an important guest coming over,
so get dinner ready.

237
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,340
I guess he still sees me
as his wife after all.

238
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,180
Fine. You'll see just how perfect
a wife I can be for you.

239
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,050
Who is this person, anyway?

240
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,380
What's all the fuss about?

241
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,680
Who is this person
we have to impress?

242
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,420
Yes. He's staying with us
for a while.

243
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,190
Mother, be on your best behavior.

244
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,320
A single word from him
can move fortunes.

245
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,790
He must be quite the big shot.

246
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Excuse me.

247
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Welcome, come in.

248
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,070
Welcome.

249
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,770
You know, you look familiar.

250
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,040
Have we met somewhere before?

251
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,850
Ji Ho, you should say hello.

252
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,050
Hello.

253
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,490
Well, hello.

254
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,820
Is your name Ji Ho?

255
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,230
Yes.

256
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,600
Ta-da!

257
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,240
A present for you.

258
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,470
This is my favorite!

259
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,240
Thank you!

260
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,280
Let's get your bags settled
before we eat.

261
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,050
Honey, I'll show him to his room.

262
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,450
You stay here with Ji Ho.

263
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,090
Okay, sure.

264
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,220
Once you're unpacked,
come on down and we'll have dinner.

265
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,790
Okay. Thank you for having me.

266
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,530
What do you think you're doing?

267
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,470
I told you not to pull any stunts!

268
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,240
I haven't done a thing.

269
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,870
You're the one
who's been pulling stunts.

270
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,310
Why would you do that?

271
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,920
- That's what I'm here to find out.
- What is that supposed to mean?

272
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,750
What exactly have I done?

273
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,060
- Lee Tae Ho.
- Catherine.

274
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,760
What have you been doing
using my sister's name?

275
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,900
- I can explain that.
- Hwang Ji Ho.

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,300
How long were you planning
to hide the fact that he's my son?

277
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,140
What? What are you talking about?

278
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,210
Who says he's your son?

279
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,580
That's not true.

280
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,580
Mom, Dad says to hurry down.

281
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,730
Okay. Go on downstairs, Ji Ho.

282
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,260
Ji Ho.

283
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,530
How about we go downstairs together?

284
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,250
Please enjoy your meal, Mr. Lee.

285
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,120
A spread like this is...

286
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,390
what's called
a Korean royal feast, right?

287
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,090
I told Mom you're an honored guest,
so it looks like she went all out.

288
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,200
I only used the very best
ingredients and seasonings.

289
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,670
I'm just asking out
of artistic curiosity,

290
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,240
what's the most expensive painting
you've ever sold?

291
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,710
Well, I don't really keep a ranking.

292
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
If you mean the most expensive piece
I've brokered recently...

293
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,850
It was around
a hundred million dollars.

294
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,460
A hundred million dollars?

295
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,990
How much
is a hundred million dollars?

296
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Around 100 billion won.

297
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,370
Oh my gosh.

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,340
Here, please, eat up, Mr. Lee.

299
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,110
It's customary
to introduce everyone.

300
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
Shall I introduce my family?

301
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,550
That'd be great.

302
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,150
This is the homewrecker.

303
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,690
Gi Man.

304
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,820
What?
It's how the online videos say.

305
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,960
My brother's wife, the homewrecker,
stole her friend's husband.

306
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,190
Is that correct?

307
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,930
Hey, Gi Man.

308
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,000
You should probably just eat.

309
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,370
I can't eat fast. I get indigestion.
You should eat slowly and chew well.

310
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,970
Okay, fine. Slowly then.

311
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,640
Please can we just eat first?

312
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,370
Okay.

313
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,780
As you've probably figured out,

314
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,350
my brother suffered a head injury
in an accident.

315
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,020
So he's a little...

316
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,990
Please bear with him.

317
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,420
I'm so down.
Maybe fillers would cheer me up.

318
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,890
And I do need
to get another facelift.

319
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,260
What's your game?

320
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,400
I told you he was not your son.
He's not.

321
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,970
Should we get a paternity test?

322
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,800
Fine.

323
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,170
He may be your son, biologically.

324
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,710
But he's grown up his whole life
believing Gi Chan is his father.

325
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
And you told him I was dead?

326
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,250
I did.
After we split, you were dead to me.

327
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,390
Let's be honest.
We were both dirt-poor.

328
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,890
We were in no position
to have and raise a child,

329
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,260
and I didn't want to have the baby.

330
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,430
I didn't want to pass my poverty on
to my child.

331
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,370
And then I met a man
who could provide for my child.

332
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,830
My husband.

333
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,370
Our Ji Ho has grown up wanting
for nothing.

334
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,570
I've given him everything
he could ever want.

335
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,810
I'm not going to
let our family fall apart.

336
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,010
I'm not just going to stand by
and watch.

337
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,190
If you do anything to hurt my Ji Ho,

338
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,290
I will make you regret it.

339
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,230
I'll kill you.

340
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,060
So just tell me.

341
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
What is it you want?

342
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Tell me!

343
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,210
I have no intention...

344
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,870
of turning a happy kid's life
upside down.

345
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,940
Do you really mean that?

346
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,510
I do, as long as you
and your family...

347
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,220
are a good influence on Ji Ho.

348
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,690
What's that supposed to mean?

349
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,520
Don't get so defensive.

350
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,060
If you're a mother who can face her child
with a clear conscience,

351
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,730
then I have no desire to interfere.

352
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,260
What is that supposed to mean?

353
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,760
What do I have to be ashamed of?

354
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,230
Well...

355
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,300
I don't have all the details
just yet.

356
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,040
Then why would you say something
like that?

357
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,470
Is that what Kang Jae In said?
That I should be ashamed of myself?

358
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:49,850
You know the Korean saying,

359
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,980
"A guilty conscience
needs no accuser."

360
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,720
Because that's certainly
what it sounds like to me.

361
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,290
Let's not go over this again.

362
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,020
If you're truly a fit mother,

363
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,760
I'll go right back to the U.S.

364
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,900
Deal?

365
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,190
Hard at work, I see.

366
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,220
I'm a hard worker by nature.

367
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,590
Are you free this evening?

368
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,260
I was hoping we could have dinner.

369
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,430
Is it for the drink you gave me
for the detective the other day?

370
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,070
I did promise it'd be my treat.
Sure.

371
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,470
Okay, let's meet up after work.

372
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,210
Sounds good.

373
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,580
I'm just going to grab some coffee.

374
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,380
Why do you have to
report that to me?

375
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,850
I have no intention of getting
in the way of an office romance.

376
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,350
I guess that's what you mean, right?

377
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,870
We don't have anything work-related
to talk about today, do we?

378
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,440
Oh, this isn't about work.

379
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,180
Did I mention Yun Hee wanted to have
Seung Woo over?

380
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,780
Yes, and you also mentioned
you told her he was your son.

381
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,390
I'm planning on taking him to dinner
with them tonight.

382
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,860
Are you sure that's okay
with taking only Mr. Kang Seung Woo?

383
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,900
Seung Woo has done nothing wrong.

384
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,630
If Seung Woo
can only meet them first,

385
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,770
and it's a chance to naturally
get closer to your family,

386
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,200
that would be wonderful.

387
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,810
Next time we get a chance,

388
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,310
the three of us can go together.

389
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,050
Don't worry about me,

390
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,350
I hope you two have a nice,
cozy dinner.

391
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,230
How do you know when my break is?

392
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,000
How do you always show up the second
I step out for coffee?

393
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,970
I can't really explain it.
I just think of you, and you appear.

394
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,010
It's like you're sending me signals
or something.

395
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,080
I'm definitely not sending you
any signals.

396
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,350
I'm on your side, no matter what.

397
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,420
I know Gi Chan was completely
in the wrong.

398
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,290
I don't know much, but he did cheat
and treat Jae In terribly.

399
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,190
But that has nothing to do with me.
I've never taken his side.

400
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,630
I swear.

401
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,630
Besides, once I get married,
I'm out of that family anyway.

402
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,100
So I'm telling you
I will always be on your side.

403
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,140
I'll put it in writing right now
if you want.

404
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,510
What will you do
if I actually have it notarized?

405
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,580
I wouldn't care.
It's what my heart wants.

406
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:10,480
How can you be so sure about this?

407
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,420
Because you're the one I like.

408
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,220
I believe in making clear
whose side you're on.

409
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,390
Especially when it's about someone
I care about,

410
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,760
they need to know, without a doubt,
that I'm on their side.

411
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,170
All right, here we are.

412
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,010
Come on in.

413
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,540
Hello.

414
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,250
This is for you.

415
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,720
Thank you.

416
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,050
Thank you so much for having me.

417
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,190
Patrick invited me over
for a home-cooked meal.

418
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,690
We're glad you could make it.

419
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,190
We've all been looking forward to
meeting you.

420
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,460
Bo Ram, say hello.

421
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,470
Hi, handsome! I'm Kim Bo Ram.

422
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,440
Bo Ram,
I wouldn't call him handsome.

423
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,270
He's on par with me.

424
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,670
Kids don't lie.

425
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,510
He's way more handsome than you.

426
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,280
Like by this much!

427
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,980
I like him.

428
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,620
- Please have a seat. Okay?
- Oh, sure.

429
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,290
- Let's sit.
- Right this way.

430
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,190
It's not much, but please enjoy.

431
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,760
Did you really make all this for me?

432
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,700
I wasn't sure what you'd like.

433
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,400
I hope the seasoning is okay.

434
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,450
This is absolutely delicious.

435
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,720
This is nothing.
My sister's a master at cooking.

436
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,390
Here, try one.
It'll knock your socks off.

437
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
Here you go.

438
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,770
Good!

439
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,270
See?

440
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,340
You have some too, Do Yun.

441
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,080
You enjoy your food too, Bo Ram.

442
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,380
Okay.

443
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,020
All right. Mom, you eat up too!

444
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,390
Oh, goodness, all right.

445
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,790
Honestly, you'd think
we were doing the wave.

446
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,930
Hey, you eat too.

447
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,360
Oh, right.
Here, Bo Ram, have some of this too.

448
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,830
Come on.

449
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,040
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

450
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,370
- How is it? Is it good?
- It's delicious.

451
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,710
Good. Eat up, everyone.

452
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,450
Did they leave all right?

453
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,790
Yes, at first,
he was dragging his feet,

454
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:07,820
but he must've had a good time.

455
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,030
He asked to be invited again.

456
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,590
Thanks, Yun Hee.

457
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,460
He's really grown up well.

458
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,200
Even if Ja Young said
she resented him,

459
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,470
you can see she raised him lovingly.

460
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,500
You can tell
if a child was raised with love...

461
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,970
or without it.

462
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,510
Oh Seong.

463
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,440
He'll find out anyway,
so just tell him.

464
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,150
Putting it off won't solve anything.

465
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,220
He'll be so shocked.
You need to be there for him.

466
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,750
Right?

467
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,550
I tell myself I have to tell him,
but the words just won't come out.

468
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,890
You're making it complicated
by overthinking things.

469
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,890
Stop thinking and just tell him.

470
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,600
That saying,
"blood is thicker than water."

471
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,730
I saw that today.

472
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,930
You two look alike.

473
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,470
We do?

474
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,670
So we do look alike.

475
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,580
Ms. Jae In? It's Bo Ram.

476
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,150
What are you doing?

477
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,590
Bo Ram, you shouldn't call
when she's busy.

478
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,130
I called because I missed you.

479
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,860
My uncle is here with me too.

480
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,300
He's working.

481
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,300
Okay. Bye, Ms. Jae In.

482
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,770
Uncle Do Yun, "working overtime"
means working really late, right?

483
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,280
Yes. How do you know that word?

484
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,980
Mom used to say that at her company.

485
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,990
Ms. Jae In is working at her office
right now, right?

486
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,960
Probably.

487
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,330
But it's scary and dangerous
for her to go home alone at night.

488
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,560
Let's go meet her.

489
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,230
What?

490
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,900
Come on, please?

491
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,140
Should we?

492
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,910
- Ms. Jae In!
- Bo Ram!

493
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,380
- Hi! Have you been okay?
- Yes.

494
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,650
Have you been waiting long?

495
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,290
No, I just came down.

496
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,420
- How about work? All done?
- Yes.

497
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,530
- Bo Ram, I missed you so much.
- Me too.

498
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,730
- Okay.
- What should we get to eat?

499
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,870
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream?

500
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,270
Hey, you already had one
on the way here.

501
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,550
Honey!

502
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
Eun Ho!

503
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,550
This is so good.

504
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,830
Uncle, who's that man?

505
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,060
Why is he taking Ms. Jae In?

506
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:37,900
Well, I guess she had other plans.

507
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,110
Are you crazy?

508
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,650
Stop the car.

509
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,690
I said stop! Stop the car!

510
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,160
Hwang Gi Chan!

511
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,020
What do you think you're doing?

512
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,220
A kidnapping?
What's wrong with you?

513
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,960
I don't even know
why I'm doing this.

514
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,030
- How can you not know?
- I don't know! I just don't!

515
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,070
I think I can't live without you.

516
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,700
I can't stand seeing you
with some other guy!

517
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,410
I guess I'm still in love with you.

518
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:38,220
(Queen's House)

519
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,960
What do you think you're doing?

520
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,630
Don't you dare lay a hand
on Jae In again.

521
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,600
- Who do you think you are?
- Because I love Jae In.

522
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,600
Just a year before Ji Ho came along,

523
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,070
didn't you say you'd rather
not have kids?

524
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:57,010
That's what Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
told me.

525
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,880
- Well, you see...
- A year before Ji Ho came along?

526
