1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,980
(Episode 15)

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,760
Hey, did you see the doctor?

6
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,260
I wanted to come with you.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,360
Where are you now?

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,460
I'm almost here.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,800
Then, come to the chairman's office.
Let's meet with Father, too.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,430
All right.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,300
Hey.

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,370
Hello. What brings you here?

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,540
Hello.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,510
I applied for the clinic job here,
and I got it.

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,080
So, will you work here now?

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,520
Yes, I'm officially starting
next week.

17
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,080
What about the hospital?

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,420
I resigned.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,420
My life began to feel stagnant,
so I wanted a new challenge.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,890
Anyway, what brings you here?

21
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,060
My husband works here.

22
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,960
I see. Is that so?

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,230
Hey.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,470
Does it look good?

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,870
We keep running into each other.

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,540
It feels like our paths were
meant to cross in many ways.

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,310
Right? There must be
many different types of fate.

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,780
I wonder
what this relationship is like.

29
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,920
I called you today
to confirm something.

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,690
Is there anything you want to say...

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,060
regarding the double contract
with H and K Company?

32
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,870
Did you really do it?

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,680
Good grief.

34
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,250
An apology is due.

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,520
I always trusted you.

36
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,450
I must be getting older.

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,860
My judgment isn't like
what it used to be.

38
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,060
I blindly believed Director Hwang...

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,590
and let you go...

40
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,260
without a proper investigation.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,800
I truly apologize.

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,670
It's all right.

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Everything is in the past,

44
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:13,740
and I am already over it.

45
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,440
Who do you think is behind this?

46
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,680
Can you tell me honestly?

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,850
Ms. Kim Do Hee
of the Strategy Planning Team...

48
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,120
probably has
more detailed information than I do.

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,720
Ms. Kim Do Hee?

50
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,160
She died.

51
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,270
Sorry? Ms. Kim died?

52
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,640
Wait, how did that happen?

53
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,880
Ms. Kim had been
suspicious of Director Hwang.

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,180
So, Ms. Kim was the one...

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,450
who told you about this?

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,150
Yes, sir.

57
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,190
Can you do me a favor?

58
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,230
Can you hold an investigation
on H and K Company?

59
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,140
And on Director Hwang Gi Chan.

60
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,440
Actually,

61
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,240
I got something like this.

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,650
(Director Do Min Jun is innocent!
Look into H and K Company.)

63
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,120
Who sent you this?

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,960
(Chairman's Office)

65
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,560
Why are you out here?

66
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,230
Hey, I wanted to go in with you.

67
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,730
I see.

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,010
I'm here, Dad.

69
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,280
- Hello.
- Hey, there.

70
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,850
I heard you moved
into your in-laws' home.

71
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,090
Ask Yu Gyeong to help you out.

72
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,350
She's been a great help.

73
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,620
Have you been well?

74
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,090
Yes, thanks to you.

75
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,000
Please excuse me.

76
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,660
All right. Let's meet again soon.

77
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,230
Yes, sir. I'll reach out to you.

78
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,800
Bye.

79
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,010
Why don't you have a seat?

80
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,610
So? What brings you here?

81
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,220
I went to see the doctor
and stopped by before I went home.

82
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,790
Did Mom return quietly?

83
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,320
Yes.

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,260
What did the doctor say?

85
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,960
I'm in danger of a miscarriage,
so I have to be careful.

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,930
Hey, be more careful.

87
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,770
I will.

88
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,610
Your friend
who visited us at home last time.

89
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,240
Was she named Designer Kang Se Ri?

90
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,180
You're right.

91
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,250
How's she doing at work?

92
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,190
He wouldn't know.
They aren't on the same team.

93
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,060
Aunt Mi Ran works with her,
so she should know.

94
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,120
We don't run into each other,

95
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,960
so like Jae In said, I'm not sure.

96
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,800
I see. I guess that's true.

97
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,770
The judiciary must stop kneeling
before money and power!

98
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,470
- Stop kneeling!
- Stop kneeling!

99
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,510
The judiciary does not work
for YL Group as a subcontractor!

100
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,210
- Wake up!
- Wake up!

101
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,920
What were you thinking?

102
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,290
I'm sure you didn't quit your job
at the hospital...

103
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,490
to work there with a simple plan.

104
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,860
You had to study long and hard
to become a doctor.

105
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,060
Stop having other thoughts,
go back to the hospital,

106
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,370
and focus on your career.

107
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,370
Leave Do Hee's business to me.

108
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,640
Why you?

109
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,710
She's my niece.

110
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,810
She's my little sister.

111
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,880
How can I sit quietly
after my only sibling's unfair death?

112
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,180
I already know that.

113
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,110
That's why I'm protesting
and doing these things.

114
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,750
That's not enough
to make them repent.

115
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,320
These people aren't built like that.

116
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,380
I completely understand
how you feel,

117
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,220
but what about your mom?

118
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,590
What would she say if she found out
you quit your job to do this?

119
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,130
Do you think she'll be proud?

120
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,630
No, she'll collapse and fall ill.

121
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,660
Don't say anything...

122
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,160
to her.

123
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,030
We're home!

124
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,000
Take off your backpack.

125
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,770
Hey, it's Uncle Do Yun!

126
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,610
- Uncle!
- Hello, my princess.

127
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,640
- Had fun at the kindergarten?
- Yes.

128
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,950
Let's play, Uncle Do Yun.

129
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,480
- Is it your day off?
- Yes.

130
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,180
Why don't we go to the playground?

131
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,720
Okay. I want to go.

132
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,390
We'll go out and play.

133
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,260
We'll go out and play.

134
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,360
Stop copying me.

135
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,390
Did you two have a fight?

136
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,560
Why would we fight?

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,930
It wouldn't be right for a nephew...

138
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,070
to fight against his uncle.

139
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,540
What are these?

140
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,340
(YL Group, an abusive employer,
and a group of murderers)

141
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,510
Have you been protesting
at their office?

142
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,680
I was contacted by a civic group.

143
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,980
They said the victim's family
should take part and help,

144
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,580
so I joined them.

145
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,080
I should be out there protesting,
not you.

146
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,190
What if you get hurt?

147
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,590
Don't do it.

148
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,490
Why would I get hurt? I'm fine.

149
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,800
YL Group is the archenemy
of both you and Do Hee.

150
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,970
I should've stopped her
from working there from the start.

151
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,070
You need to stop now.

152
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,540
I'll keep an eye on the trial...

153
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,840
and protest later if I must,
so you need to stay out of this.

154
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,210
I'm protesting to make sure
the trial is done fairly.

155
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,680
Look at these affluent families.

156
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,010
They never get punished...

157
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,220
even after doing wrong things
with their money and power.

158
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,950
How is it a fair country
if it only sides with the rich?

159
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,860
They won't do that this time.

160
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,760
It just can't happen.

161
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,360
Even if Do Yun tries to do something,
you must stop him.

162
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,200
Both of you will stay out of this.

163
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,600
Otherwise, it'll kill me.

164
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,930
Fine.

165
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,770
My dad was at the office?

166
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,670
Yes, it was great to see them
sitting together.

167
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,580
I think they'll meet again soon.

168
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,280
Why don't we find a day
for our families to dine together?

169
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,920
What do you think?

170
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,820
Okay. Let's do that.

171
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,190
I'm home.

172
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,390
- You're home, Mother.
- Hey.

173
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,290
That looks like a new bag.

174
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,590
Did you get a new one?

175
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,200
No, she didn't buy it. Gi Chan's...

176
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,600
Did that hurt?

177
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,500
No, I'm fine.

178
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,900
Did Gi Chan give it to you?

179
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,410
Yes.

180
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,040
My little son got it for me...

181
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,610
because he must've felt bad...

182
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,110
that I always went around
carrying the same bag.

183
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,980
My eldest son,
you should learn from him.

184
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,150
Do you mean it?

185
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,420
I don't think...

186
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,660
I should learn that from him.

187
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,430
It's impossible
to work with you as a team.

188
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,330
I'm tired.

189
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,760
Bring me water with honey.

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,060
I'll do it, Mother.

191
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,370
No, you can't overwork yourself.

192
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,600
Please don't do anything.

193
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,540
What are you waiting for?
I need water with honey.

194
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,610
Gosh.

195
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,590
What did he give to Director Do?

196
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,800
(Catherine)

197
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,000
Daddy, Catherine is calling you.

198
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,930
Right.

199
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,270
(Catherine)

200
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,380
(I can't...)

201
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,010
I can't be there today.

202
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,760
- Hello?
- Gi Chan.

203
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,990
Do you want to see me lose my mind?

204
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,690
Do you take me for a joke?

205
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,230
You said you'd come!

206
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,860
You need to come now.

207
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,500
If you don't,
that'll be the end of us.

208
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,400
You got the wrong number.

209
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,110
Hey, Eun Ho. It's time for bed.

210
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,710
Come with me. I'll tuck you in.

211
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,350
- Mommy, I can sleep alone now.
- Yes?

212
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,850
I'm a big boy now,
so I want to sleep alone.

213
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,950
Oh, my.

214
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,820
Mommy, Daddy, goodnight.

215
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,360
Goodness, my son.

216
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,890
- All right.
- Goodnight.

217
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,060
Goodnight, Eun Ho.

218
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,190
Goodnight.

219
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,730
Bye.

220
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,070
Don't you think
Eun Ho has become mature?

221
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,640
Is it because he knows
about his younger sibling?

222
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,510
I guess so.
It feels like he's already grown.

223
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,050
I should be glad,
but I was kind of disappointed, too.

224
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,580
You can't keep him
under your wings forever.

225
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,420
We should help him
become independent, too.

226
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,750
And yes. Do you remember
the man who saved Eun Ho?

227
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,660
You know, that doctor.

228
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,590
Yes, I know him. Why?

229
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,890
I ran into him at the office today.

230
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,800
He came as the doctor
for our in-house clinic.

231
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,900
Really?

232
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,970
There's a high chance
I'll end up taking a backlash.

233
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,340
I can't let that happen.

234
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,470
You cannot go inside.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,440
You can't do this
without prior notification!

236
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,540
Stop them, everyone!

237
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,210
- You cannot go inside.
- Do not go inside.

238
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,510
- You can't do this.
- You can't do this!

239
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,420
What?

240
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,090
After a whistleblower's report...

241
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,730
on alleged tax evasion
and stock manipulation,

242
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,560
the prosecution,
the Financial Supervisory Service,

243
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,200
and the National Tax Service
launched...

244
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
a tax investigation at YL Group
by securing all files...

245
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,140
related to taxes and accounting.

246
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,300
The National Tax Service
confirmed...

247
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,070
plans to conduct
a thorough investigation,

248
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,510
starting with Chairman Kang's
personal tax evasion.

249
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,710
Choi Ja Young, the director
of JY Gallery and Kang's wife,

250
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,810
is currently in custody
over a hit-and-run incident.

251
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,750
She has stirred controversy
for receiving special treatment...

252
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,890
when she was hospitalized...

253
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,320
with a fake medical diagnosis.

254
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,950
Authorities stated that
Chairman Kang...

255
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,860
will be summoned
for questioning soon.

256
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,060
Hooray for Korea.

257
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,030
Gosh, I finally feel much better.

258
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,970
I guess the country has changed
while I was away.

259
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,870
I thought money solved
all of life's problems.

260
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,770
Gosh.

261
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,880
Where's Dad?

262
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,150
He seemed quite distressed,
so I suggested he go home.

263
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,890
This is all because of your mom.

264
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,630
Don't worry.
I'll patch it up somehow.

265
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,530
Hello?

266
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,540
Let them in.
Don't mention the chairman, though.

267
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,940
There's a ruckus
after that report in the media.

268
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,340
It must be someone from our partner.

269
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:02,180
I'll go. I need to see Dad.

270
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,710
I'll get you a cab.

271
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,220
I drove here.

272
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,490
Thank you, honey.

273
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,390
I'm so relieved you're here.

274
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,360
Don't worry about anything,

275
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,530
and take good care of yourself.

276
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,830
You ran your business
with such transparency...

277
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,500
that you were known
as the incorruptible businessman.

278
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,210
But a search and seizure,
along with a questioning?

279
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,980
Do you still not understand
who planned all this?

280
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,280
It had to be Hwang Gi Chan.

281
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,250
We fell right into his trap!

282
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,750
Why do you think Gi Chan is
also behind this incident?

283
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,720
There aren't many people...

284
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,190
who can hand over
crucial information...

285
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,460
to move the police
and the prosecution.

286
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,100
You're suspicious of him, too.

287
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,440
He might have approached Jae In...

288
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,900
with this plan in his heart
from the start.

289
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,280
Have we all been deceived?

290
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,150
It's all your fault.

291
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,780
We wouldn't be here today...

292
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,890
if you had sided with me
when I protested against their marriage.

293
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,560
You ruined both my life...

294
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,960
and my daughter's life!

295
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,210
I'm here, Mr. Chairman.

296
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,810
(Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)

297
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,010
What do you think you're doing?

298
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,850
Why are you sitting there?

299
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,750
You aren't even a part of YL now.

300
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,720
Why do you find this so unpleasant?

301
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,190
Right. I forgot.

302
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,030
You were
my father-in-law's right-hand man.

303
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,030
Give me that.

304
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,930
This isn't for you.

305
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,940
Isn't it a report you put together
on H and K Company?

306
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,080
Director Do.

307
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,880
No, my in-law, Mr. Do.

308
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,880
You need to hand that over
and not say a word...

309
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,550
if you don't want
any harm to find Yu Gyeong.

310
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,920
Are you threatening me?

311
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,990
I can put up with you once,
but never twice.

312
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,670
I never threaten anyone.

313
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,670
I always make deals.

314
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,370
A threat was something
exquisitely done...

315
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,240
No.

316
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,910
Something humiliatingly done
by my older brother.

317
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,080
Do you remember
Eun Ho's kidnapping incident?

318
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,980
My brother was the culprit.

319
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,520
I already know
the culprit was caught.

320
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,890
They only carried out the action.
The head,

321
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,020
the real culprit,

322
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,520
was my brother and your son-in-law.

323
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,890
It may be hard to believe,
but it's true.

324
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,000
You may confirm it with Gi Man.
I don't mind.

325
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,600
However,

326
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,000
what if my father-in-law,
the chairman, found out?

327
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,740
What will happen?

328
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,270
And what will happen to Yu Gyeong?

329
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,710
Not only
will her happy marriage fall apart,

330
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,050
but it'll also have an impact...

331
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,880
on your history, too.

332
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,290
You can either give me that...

333
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,190
or give it to the chairman.

334
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,660
The choice is yours.

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,130
What will it be?

336
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,370
I feel heavy-hearted.

337
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,640
And I personally feel sorry, too.

338
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,280
I was his closest associate...

339
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,920
and his son-in-law,
so it wasn't easy to report on...

340
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,550
my father-in-law's corruption.

341
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,620
There was a lot of pressure,
so thank you very much...

342
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,760
for keeping me anonymous.

343
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,190
Yes.

344
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,030
I'll schedule a dinner meeting soon.

345
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,030
Yes. Goodbye.

346
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,810
Why did you tell me to come
during working hours?

347
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,440
I thought our relationship was
only professional now.

348
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,080
If it's about work, we can do it
in the office, Director Hwang.

349
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,950
I've been busy out of my mind
in the last few days.

350
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,050
Everything was so urgent that
I had to keep it quiet from you.

351
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,990
What does that have to do with me?

352
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,530
My father-in-law
had been digging up my back...

353
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,560
and investigating H and K Company.

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,130
What do you mean?

355
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,870
The chairman?

356
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,630
How did he know?

357
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,640
That's what I want to know.

358
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,840
Someone might be watching me.

359
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,580
Are you suspicious of anyone?

360
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,080
How would I know if you don't?

361
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,220
So? Did he find out everything?

362
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,050
I trampled on him
before he got to me.

363
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,760
Who did you think was
the whistleblower?

364
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,490
You're such a genius.

365
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,060
That means we're free.

366
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,400
Are you not mad anymore?

367
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,700
I only have a little more to go.

368
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,210
YL Group will be ours soon.

369
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,110
Ours?

370
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,250
Yes, ours.

371
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,210
Give me just a little more time.

372
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,420
Gi Chan.

373
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,450
I love you.

374
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,070
The sun hasn't even set,
yet you're drinking again?

375
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,370
I made some food.
Come and eat first.

376
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,680
I don't have an appetite.

377
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,880
If you think of Mom...

378
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,050
If you really think of Mom,

379
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,420
you need to stop harassing yourself.

380
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,120
She'd want you to stop, too.

381
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,090
And do it for me, too.

382
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,890
Be better to yourself, Seung Woo.

383
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,360
I want to get some rest.

384
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,500
I'll eat later.

385
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,370
You're home.

386
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,610
Hey, you're here.

387
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,580
Have you been somewhere?

388
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,010
Your phone was turned off, too.

389
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,620
I went to see your mother.

390
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,550
I had to ask her something, too.

391
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,260
Dad, I trust you.

392
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,790
You ran your business
with complete transparency.

393
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,760
The truth will come out
through the investigation.

394
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,600
Something like this
can't topple me over.

395
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,230
Don't worry about me.

396
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,000
Gi Chan said he'd find a way
to prove the truth.

397
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,140
I know it's tough,
but please hang in there.

398
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,810
You'll find a way.

399
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,010
You haven't eaten, right?

400
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,160
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

401
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,820
Let's eat.

402
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,460
Okay.

403
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,540
Gosh, this is nice.

404
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,910
It feels like it's been a long time
since I had a home-cooked meal.

405
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,440
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,910
It feels like
I was only focused on my happiness.

407
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,880
Mom wasn't around,

408
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,950
and I moved out, too.

409
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,790
So, I thought
you must've felt lonely.

410
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,020
Well, I'm more worried...

411
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,660
about Seung Woo than myself.

412
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,030
While we're on the subject,

413
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,340
why don't you...

414
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,870
move back here?

415
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,910
I think it's about time
I shared the truth...

416
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,080
with Seung Woo.

417
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,020
I can't put it off for much longer.

418
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,120
If he could depend on his sibling,

419
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,090
I thought it'd help him...

420
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,390
get back on his two feet.

421
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,430
I must be getting older.

422
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,840
I also want to depend on someone.

423
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,740
Many things will unfold from now on,

424
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,380
and you'll fall into danger
if you keep staying there.

425
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,220
I need to keep you
within my protection.

426
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,390
I'm the only one...

427
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,250
who can keep my daughter safe.

428
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,060
I thought of you...

429
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,260
when I built this house.

430
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,530
You were
still in your mom's womb then.

431
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,030
Jae In.

432
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,770
You're the rightful owner
of this house.

433
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,840
I hope you'll keep this place safe.

434
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,310
Will you do that?

435
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll talk to my mother-in-law.

436
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,420
She'll be disappointed...

437
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,690
if I move out as soon as I moved in.

438
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,990
Please give me some time.

439
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,300
I'm home.

440
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,110
- Where's Jae In?
- Well...

441
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,770
She went to Changpyeong-dong.

442
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,510
Were you at work until this hour?

443
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,510
Didn't you see the news?

444
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,350
I had the biggest headache
all day long...

445
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,250
because of YL Group.

446
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,090
What if the business goes down?

447
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,620
They're rich,

448
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,320
so they won't end up
homeless even if they go down.

449
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,630
But you should probably pocket
whatever asset you can find.

450
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,130
It won't go down.
Don't worry about it.

451
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,200
How can I not worry?

452
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,840
Your in-laws' fortune is
as good as your fortune.

453
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,410
Why are you laughing?

454
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,010
I was worried sick.

455
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,240
Call Jae In right now...

456
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,740
and tell her to bring
whatever is worth money.

457
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,450
It's just as you said.

458
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,020
- Everything is mine.
- What?

459
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,320
This country or anyone else
can't take it from me,

460
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,850
so don't worry about it
and go to sleep.

461
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,720
Do we have a drink at home?

462
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,930
Something smells fishy.

463
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,000
Well, if my son says so,
then it must be true.

464
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,070
I'll go to sleep in peace.

465
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,990
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

466
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,120
I was busy today,

467
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,490
so I forgot
about your visit yesterday.

468
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,930
I heard you were here.

469
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,270
Yes, sir.

470
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,040
Have you found some evidence?

471
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,010
Hello?

472
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,780
Mr. Do?

473
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,150
I haven't found
any evidence yet, sir.

474
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,220
I'll need some more time.

475
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,820
I see. All right.

476
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,760
I'm sure
he covered it up completely.

477
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,260
Mr. Do, you have my trust.

478
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:02,830
Yes, sir.

479
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,270
(Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)

480
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,610
These are Ms. Kang Se Ri's whereabouts
last week.

481
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,790
(Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)

482
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,270
I found out
who the whistleblower was...

483
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,970
through our connection
in the prosecution.

484
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,580
It was Director Hwang Gi Chan.

485
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,120
Yes, you've reached Hwang Gi Chan.

486
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,520
The chairman wants to see you.

487
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,960
All right.

488
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,130
If I get asked for help,

489
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,200
should I throw him
a useless tactic first?

490
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,360
Did you want to see me, sir?

491
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,030
I want to ask
about the double contract...

492
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,370
with H and K Company.

493
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,410
Was it you?

494
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,640
I thought it was Director Do.

495
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,980
And were you
also the whistleblower...

496
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,550
for this recent corruption report?

497
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,120
It's a misunderstanding.

498
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,520
Why would I do that?

499
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,920
It wasn't Ms. Kim Do Hee,

500
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,260
but that designer, Ms. Kang Se Ri.

501
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,260
Your other woman.

502
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,730
Go ahead and make more excuses.

503
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,300
Do it!

504
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,980
I'm sorry, Father. I'm truly sorry.

505
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,980
It was my mistake.
Please show me mercy this once.

506
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,220
A mistake is
something I can always correct.

507
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,920
But what you did wasn't a mistake.

508
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,020
Everything you did was intentional.

509
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,230
Did you want to take over my family?

510
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,300
Were you after my fortune?

511
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:50,970
No.

512
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,240
I truly loved Jae In.

513
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,740
Loved?

514
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,470
So, it's in the past.

515
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,310
That means
you don't love her anymore.

516
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,510
Did you want to take a fortune
because of that? Did you?

517
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,480
You seem to twist
everything I have to say,

518
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,890
so I can't say anything.

519
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,490
Twisted or not twisted,
your fate has been sealed.

520
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,690
Take full responsibility
and back down from everything.

521
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,760
And divorce Jae In quietly.

522
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,100
She'll raise Eun Ho,

523
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,600
so you'll give up
on his custody and parental rights!

524
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,500
You better not try
to take this to court.

525
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,510
If you do, I'll expose...

526
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,910
every corruption you committed
to the world.

527
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,610
Do you want to know
why I'm letting it go quietly?

528
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,780
If Eun Ho found out
his father was a criminal,

529
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,390
it'd only torture him
for the rest of his life.

530
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,390
But you will tell the full truth...

531
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,590
to Jae In!

532
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,430
That's the only way
things will move quickly.

533
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,100
That's all I have to say.

534
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,370
I don't want to see you here,
so get lost immediately!

535
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,440
Stop pretending like
you're so upright.

536
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,950
You're just like me.

537
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,090
What did you say?

538
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,320
You had Seung Woo
with another woman.

539
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,990
You get to enjoy everything
even after having an affair.

540
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,730
Why can't I do that?

541
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,100
Take back what you said...

542
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,170
about divorcing her
for Jae In's sake.

543
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,970
Stop talking nonsense!

544
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,470
I'll protect my daughter.

545
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,770
I can't let her live
with a filthy man like you.

546
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,540
Just wrap up everything quietly
as you were told.

547
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,780
That's all I have to say.

548
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,680
I do not want to see you anymore.
Get out of here now!

549
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,990
But you have no problem
living with another filthy woman.

550
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,190
According to your logic,

551
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,560
your wife is
the filthiest of them all.

552
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,200
A scumbag who killed someone
without even blinking.

553
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,070
She wouldn't have done that
if it hadn't been for you.

554
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,070
This is why couples are
just like each other.

555
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,740
Mother blamed another
for her unhappy life...

556
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,110
and killed Ms Kim,

557
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,680
and you're just like her.

558
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,350
Get out of here, you punk.

559
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,650
Or I'll call the police.

560
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,050
I'm sorry.

561
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,390
Jae In and I are complete opposites,

562
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,620
so I won't sit around
and take this like an idiot.

563
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,390
What did you say?

564
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,660
What the heck are you talking about?

565
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,130
I dedicated my life...

566
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,700
to YL Group after marrying Jae In.

567
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,400
I need decent compensation.

568
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,170
I'm not like a breeding horse
who came here just for a job.

569
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,180
Did you think you could
kick me out just like that?

570
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,810
Get out. Leave!

571
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,450
I am not backing down like this!

572
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,990
Go. Get out!

573
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,130
No.

574
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,700
No, you punk! Give it back!

575
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,140
You.

576
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,450
No.

577
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,420
My daughter. Jae In... No...

578
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,320
No...

579
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:21,300
(Queen's House)

580
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,570
I always meant to give it to you,
but I kept forgetting.

581
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,980
Does your husband know...

582
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,650
you're having an affair
with your friend's husband?

583
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,950
Dad.

584
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,850
Dad!

585
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:37,950
It's me, Kang Mi Ran.

586
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,460
I want to talk to you in person.

587
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,460
I have no time or reason to see you.

588
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,030
He's the guy who helped
when Eun Ho got kidnapped.

589
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,800
I see.

590
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,330
It takes a woman
to understand another woman.

591
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,670
He seemed a bit too close to her
to call him...

592
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,040
just a guy who once helped her.
