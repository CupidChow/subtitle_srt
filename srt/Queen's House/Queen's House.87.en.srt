00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,070
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,840
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,480
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,010
(Episode 87)

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,390
I know you have a busy schedule.

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,120
Thank you for making time for me.

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,030
Actually, I was already interested
in YL Group,

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,160
so when you reached out first,
I felt like it was meant to be.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,370
Hello.

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,010
I'm Kang Se Ri, representing
Director Noh Sook Ja of JY Gallery.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,180
I'm also Gi Chan's wife.

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,380
It's a pleasure to meet you.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,330
So, you're interested in YL Group?

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,530
Yes, I was looking into a project
with Designer L,

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,530
and I heard she's working
with YL Group.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,270
Yes, that's correct.

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,640
She's collaborating with us
right now.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,540
I guess Designer L is as famous
as they say.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,180
She's sensational.
And she's very in demand.

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,950
Your Korean is very good.

21
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,760
My wife came here
to interpret for us, though.

22
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,560
My parents always told me
never to forget that I'm Korean.

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,330
It felt like their dying wish,
so I put in a lot of effort.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,470
Plus, I dated a Korean girl
a long time ago.

25
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,780
I've said too much about my life.
I'm not usually one to overshare.

26
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,550
Shall we get down to business?

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,690
I hear you want not only new artists
but new pieces as well.

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,830
So, I'd like to have
our gallery's paintings appraised,

29
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,130
and potentially sell them
if the opportunity is right.

30
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,300
I'd like to entrust you with this.
What do you say?

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,310
I believe the first step would be
for me to see the collection.

32
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,150
It wouldn't be right to make
a rash promise...

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,420
and then back out, would it?

34
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,720
I completely understand.

35
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,820
Let's set a time to view the art.

36
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,420
Sounds good.

37
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,260
I have another meeting to attend.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,900
I'll be in touch soon
to schedule a date.

39
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,670
Okay.

40
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,580
Aren't you leaving?

41
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,950
No, you go ahead.
I have a meeting at Ji Ho's school.

42
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,750
I have to be there on time,

43
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,390
so I'll just finish my drink and go.

44
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,820
Whatever else is going on,

45
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,990
make sure the meeting goes well.

46
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,630
Okay.

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,010
It's been a long time.

48
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,780
Looks like you made it
as an art dealer.

49
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,490
Thanks to you.

50
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,290
What did I do?

51
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,060
Forget it.

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,960
If you're worried I'll tell him,
don't be.

53
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,730
It's all in the past.

54
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,200
Thank you.

55
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,070
I was worried about
what I'd have to say to convince you.

56
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,940
I'm glad you're being so cool
about this.

57
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,540
Let's keep it that way.

58
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,280
It would be strange
to have any lingering feelings...

59
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,480
for someone who left
without so much as a goodbye.

60
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,520
Well, I guess we're done then.
I'll be going.

61
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,590
Just one more thing.

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,490
Be honest with me.

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,730
The baby you were carrying back then.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,630
What happened to the baby?

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,370
What are you talking about?

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,670
- A baby?
- When you left,

67
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,740
I packed your things,

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,970
and I found a pregnancy test
and an ultrasound photo.

69
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,110
I thought you didn't know.

70
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,810
You did know.

71
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,250
Our baby...

72
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,150
is no longer with us.

73
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,290
I miscarried not long
after I left you.

74
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,060
And it's not like raising
a child alone is easy.

75
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,130
I was struggling mentally back then,

76
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,970
so I think it was for the best.

77
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,470
Anything else you want to ask?

78
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,040
No.

79
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,180
Stick to what you said earlier.

80
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,080
Let's be cool and just move on.

81
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,850
I'm leaving.

82
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,470
Here are the files you asked for.

83
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,540
You should've had Seung Woo
bring them.

84
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,710
He's in a meeting with the PR team.

85
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,240
And Kang Se Ri took a half-day.

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,880
Since Kang Se Ri got a desk job,

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,980
she's just been getting paid
for doing nothing.

88
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,990
Right, how was dinner last night?

89
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,720
It went as expected.
They weren't happy to see me.

90
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,830
I guess I just have to try harder.

91
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,430
They'll come around soon.
Hang in there.

92
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,170
Okay. Thanks.

93
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,070
Don't you think we should tell
Seung Woo...

94
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,910
about Mr. Jung?

95
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,210
I've been thinking about it,

96
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,910
but he's only recently found out
I'm his mother,

97
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,850
so I'm trying to be cautious.

98
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,820
Besides, Oh Seong said
he needed more time.

99
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,960
But still, why don't you
talk it over with Mr. Jung?

100
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,820
Time isn't going to solve this
on its own.

101
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,900
You're right.
I have to face it sooner or later.

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,370
I sent the anonymous dashcam footage
for forensic analysis.

103
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Good.

104
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,910
How long did they say it would take?

105
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,940
It seems it'll take a while
for a thorough job.

106
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,950
But we need it done right
without any mistakes.

107
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,350
Kang Seung Woo's car,
the one Jae In's mother was driving,

108
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,550
we must ensure it didn't hit Do Hee,
not even a graze.

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,220
We have to be absolutely sure.

110
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,460
I already requested that.

111
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,830
(DH Holdings)

112
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,200
- I'm going to get some fresh air.
- Sure, go ahead.

113
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,710
Last night must have been
hard on you.

114
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,520
I don't see it as a hardship.

115
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,950
It's nothing compared to the pain
I put you through.

116
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,620
I'm just going to be patient,
keep trying, and wait.

117
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,030
But about Seung Woo...

118
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,760
What? Did something happen
to Seung Woo again?

119
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,570
- How did you hold it in?
- What?

120
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,510
You're bursting with fatherly love
at the mention of his name.

121
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,540
Aren't you going to tell him?

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,380
Seung Woo has a right to know.

123
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,550
You can't keep it a secret forever.

124
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,920
Of course, he has to know.

125
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,820
Just think about it.

126
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,960
I will.

127
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,670
I've sent the footage
of Do Hee's accident...

128
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,600
for expert analysis.

129
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,340
That's great.
The recording of Do Hee's call...

130
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,770
was a huge help in getting
to the bottom of the case.

131
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,950
Hopefully, the dashcam footage
will give us something, too.

132
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,210
We'll just have to have faith
and wait.

133
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,920
By the way.

134
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,620
(YL Planning and Design Team)

135
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,820
This is for you.

136
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,130
I'm glad
I could finally give it to you.

137
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,330
You know,

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,670
it feels like it's been a long time
since we could talk face-to-face.

139
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,300
I was worried...

140
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,540
I made you uneasy
by bringing all that up.

141
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,910
It's been bothering me.

142
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,980
No, not at all.

143
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,380
You were so careful
and considerate...

144
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,650
when you gathered
the courage to tell me.

145
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,590
Your sincerity really came through.

146
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,150
It's not awkward at all.

147
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
That's a relief.

148
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,790
I'm really good at waiting.

149
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,460
So please, don't worry about me,

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,930
and just treat me
like you always have.

151
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,130
Thank you.

152
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,420
I am your father.

153
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,890
No, that's not right.

154
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,330
I'm your dad.

155
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,160
Hi, my son!

156
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,730
That's definitely not it either...

157
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,500
I should be feeling
a rush of emotion.

158
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,980
Son, it's good to see you.

159
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,850
Yes, it's good to see you too,
Father.

160
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,490
Sir, what are you doing?

161
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,360
Well, you see...

162
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,760
I was just...

163
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,130
Oh, I get it.

164
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,160
It was for a theater club, right?

165
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,930
I heard those are popular
these days with office workers.

166
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,470
What?

167
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,600
Right, it was something like that.

168
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,710
You're into acting too?

169
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,040
You're full of surprises.

170
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,710
When's the show?
Just let me know, and I'll be there.

171
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
Sure.

172
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,220
Break a leg!

173
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,450
Break a leg.

174
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,040
- I'm home.
- Yun Hee, I'm home too.

175
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,510
Uncle!

176
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,150
You guys haven't eaten yet, right?

177
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,250
I just have to heat up the soup.

178
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,380
Go change and come on out.

179
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,260
There's nothing like your cooking.

180
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm telling you,
it's the best in the world.

181
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,970
Why don't you go
on one of those cooking shows?

182
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,440
There are many cooking competitions
these days.

183
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,770
You'd win first place.

184
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,070
No one else would stand a chance.

185
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,740
- You should really do it!
- Stop buttering me up.

186
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,880
Just go get changed.

187
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,550
No, I'm serious. I really mean it.

188
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,910
Even Mi Ran says...

189
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,120
she'll never forget the food
you made for her back then.

190
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,690
And she said that
it was all so delicious.

191
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,950
She would've fainted
from the sheer deliciousness...

192
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,090
if she ate this.

193
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,030
I'd be the one fainting
if she came over.

194
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,430
Tell her to forget it.
She's never eating my food again.

195
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Wait...

196
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,780
- Uncle.
- Hey!

197
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,580
I figured out how Jae In
could keep living with us!

198
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,550
Really? Okay, let's hear it.

199
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,750
She just has to become my aunt.

200
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,620
Your aunt?

201
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,790
Yes, you and Jae In
have to get married.

202
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,760
Then, she'll be my aunt.

203
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,370
- Hey, should we go out for dinner?
- Okay.

204
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,840
Can't they just tell by looking?

205
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,080
I'm so classy and elegant.

206
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,010
I'm better than Choi Ja Young
in every way.

207
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,780
But that pretty boy...

208
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,080
only talks about Choi Ja Young,
calling her "director."

209
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,450
And all those biddies keep saying,
"Choi Ja Young would never do that."

210
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,190
"She's always been so dignified."

211
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,590
Honestly, are they all blind?

212
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,230
She hasn't even been acquitted yet.

213
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,930
Don't tell me she's actually going
to be found innocent.

214
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,470
No.

215
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,370
All I have to do is trust
the young master.

216
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,910
I'm home.

217
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,970
Okay.

218
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,180
Right! The other day...

219
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,880
Didn't you say
Choi Ja Young was sick?

220
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,450
That's right.

221
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,490
What's wrong with her?
How sick is she?

222
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,290
Is it something terminal?

223
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,990
With her pride,
she probably wishes she were dead.

224
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,590
It's Alzheimer's.

225
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,590
What? What is that?

226
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,930
So, is it a terminal illness or not?

227
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,360
Put it in simple terms.

228
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,040
- Dementia.
- What? Dementia?

229
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,340
Oh my goodness.

230
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,470
You're sure it's dementia?

231
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,610
Yes. I'm heading out.

232
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,880
Oh my goodness.

233
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,450
No wonder she kept repeating herself
over and over,

234
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,220
I thought she was just trying
to drive me crazy.

235
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:12,690
This is why they say it isn't over
until it's over.

236
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,730
This is just priceless.

237
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Ji Ho.

238
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,940
Mom, I drew a picture.

239
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,380
That's nice.
But try to draw a little better.

240
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,150
Your lines are all wobbly. Okay?

241
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,250
Okay.

242
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,020
Mom, at preschool,
we get to visit our parents' jobs.

243
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,060
Woo Ju and Min Woo got to visit
their dads' offices.

244
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,560
I want to do it too.

245
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,830
All right.
I'll talk to Daddy about it.

246
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,230
Do you want me to take a look
at your drawing too?

247
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,140
Ji Ho, go draw with your uncle.
I'll change and be right back.

248
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,860
You made a show of boldly canceling
your contract with DH Holdings,

249
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,600
but now you've gone awfully quiet.

250
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,730
And from what I hear,
the deal with your new investor...

251
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,730
seems to have fallen through.

252
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,770
Are you mocking me?

253
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,470
You set me up and made a fool of me.
What are you trying to pull?

254
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,880
Let's get something straight.

255
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,910
You are the one
who saw DH Holdings' weakness...

256
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,950
as an opportunity to terminate
the investment contract.

257
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,580
Don't you remember?

258
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,620
If you want to end the contract,
we won't stand in your way,

259
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,790
but we will have to
recall our investment,

260
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,690
and YL Group
will take a massive hit.

261
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,260
After all the work we put into
growing this company together,

262
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,430
I'd hate to be the one
to push it off a cliff.

263
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
So, I'll give you a chance.

264
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,470
That won't be necessary.

265
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,640
Just get out of YL Group,
like I said.

266
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,170
Please disregard
what Chairman Hwang just said.

267
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,740
Director Kang.

268
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,780
Our board of directors has decided
to stick with DH Holdings...

269
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,250
and honor
the original investment contract.

270
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,720
The board has already
reached a decision,

271
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,190
so don't you say another word.

272
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,460
Chairman Hwang,
there's a registered letter for you.

273
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,630
It's from the court,
so only you can sign for it.

274
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,970
Please come in.

275
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,130
(Summons)

276
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,480
Looks like something else
isn't going your way.

277
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,610
Oh, that's right!

278
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,980
Chairman Hwang,
I'm sure you know him well too.

279
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,850
I mean the chief prosecutor
who was up for Prosecutor General.

280
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,620
We did a little digging on him,

281
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,690
and it turned out to be a gold mine.

282
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,200
We compiled proof of his dirty deals
and handed it all over,

283
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,030
so he'll be stripped
of his nomination any day now.

284
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,900
What have you done?

285
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,210
What a shame.

286
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,610
Seems you’re flying solo now,
Chairman Hwang.

287
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,340
And now, at last,

288
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,210
a proper investigation
can finally begin.

289
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,630
What?

290
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,560
The lead prosecutor was replaced?

291
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,300
Set up a meeting
with the new prosecutor for me.

292
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,630
I'll find a way
to wrap him around my finger.

293
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,970
Besides, it’s not like there’s evidence
pointing to someone else.

294
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,370
Okay, I'm counting on you.

295
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
Director Hwang.

296
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,450
Please spare my life.

297
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,950
Please let me...

298
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,250
Please let me live.

299
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,230
Pull yourself together.
Will you ruin everything like this?

300
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,030
In case you were wondering.

301
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,210
Here's why you were identified
as the new prime suspect.

302
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,940
So?

303
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,410
Does it make sense now?

304
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,210
How...

305
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
How could that be?

306
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,250
I turned it all over
to the prosecution as evidence.

307
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,090
Stop playing your dirty games
and just face the investigation.

308
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,870
Hello, Princess.

309
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,010
What's all that?

310
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,340
I'm here to protect you, Princess.

311
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,510
If any bad guys show up,
I'll fight them all off for you.

312
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,820
Stay back.
You can't come any closer.

313
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,200
And he's not exactly
all there himself.

314
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,820
It's been a while.

315
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,090
Who does Ms. Noh think she is,
inviting me?

316
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,120
Noh Sook Ja?

317
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,660
We're all getting together
for tea at Ms. Noh's place.

318
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,130
Okay.

319
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,200
If she wants to meet me so badly,
I'll go.

320
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,170
See you in a bit.

321
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,770
Now what are they scheming?

322
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,610
It's time for your medicine.

323
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,250
- Where are you going?
- Noh Sook Ja invited me out.

324
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,880
You're actually going?

325
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,790
I think you'd be better off
just ignoring her.

326
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,220
Why wouldn't I? It's not like
I have anything to hide.

327
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,830
She's like a leech.

328
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,830
The more I avoid her,
the more she'll cling.

329
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,900
If anything should happen,
you have to call me.

330
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
I will. Don't worry.

331
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,400
Take your medicine before you go.

332
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,810
Welcome to my house.

333
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,490
I've really been enjoying
the Impressionists lately.

334
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,490
Director Noh,
who's your favorite Impressionist painter?

335
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,060
"The Impressionists?"

336
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,530
Do you even know what the term
"Impressionist" means?

337
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,970
Of course, I do.

338
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,070
I guess it means they paint
with very stern expressions?

339
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,210
Or am I wrong?

340
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,680
Frédéric Bazille,
Camille Pissarro, Berthe Morisot.

341
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,480
Among the Impressionist painters,

342
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,190
there are quite a few great pieces
from lesser-known artists as well.

343
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,830
You really know your stuff,
Ms. Choi.

344
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,060
Director Noh,
could you acquire a piece...

345
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,400
by the artist Demian?

346
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,640
Of course, I can get one.

347
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,110
The only piece by Demian
that was recently up for auction...

348
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,910
was sold to an American millionaire
at the end of last year,

349
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,380
and is barred from resale
for several years.

350
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,780
How exactly were you planning
on getting it?

351
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,380
It must have slipped my mind.

352
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,230
She said that old hag had dementia,
so why is she sharp as a tack?

353
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,230
She's just like her old self.

354
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,100
Did that Kang Se Ri lie
to mess with me?

355
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,310
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

356
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,380
What now?

357
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,210
Why are you taking it out on me?

358
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,450
Hwang Na Ra. This is the office.
Watch your mouth.

359
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,420
The driver just brought Ji Ho
from preschool.

360
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,660
Is it "Bring Your Kid to Work Day"
or something?

361
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,930
Call Se Ri.

362
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,300
I'll head down as soon as I'm done.

363
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,130
- Go keep an eye on Ji Ho.
- What, Mr. Chairman?

364
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,930
That's not in my job description.

365
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,340
Fine. I'll go, all right?

366
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,780
I know you must be busy.
You don't have to accompany me.

367
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,510
- I can meet them on my own.
- It's okay.

368
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,980
- Did you arrange to meet here?
- Yes.

369
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,720
I reached out to them personally.

370
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,460
It's about Director Choi Ja Young
and her daughter, Kang Jae In,

371
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,830
you asked me about last time.

372
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,300
And what did you find out?

373
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,470
Yes. It was a big scandal in Korea,
so it was easy to find information.

374
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,700
Well, for starters, the daughter,
Kang Jae In, is divorced.

375
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,540
She's the ex-wife of Hwang Gi Chan,
the current chairman of YL Group.

376
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,540
Is that so?

377
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,910
And it's not just the gallery.
The director position, too,

378
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,380
has been turned over to Noh Sook Ja,
Chairman Hwang's birth mother.

379
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,450
The gallery, too?

380
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,450
That sounds highly unusual.

381
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,560
Well, it's kind of a long story.

382
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,930
Here.

383
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,670
Ji Ho, sit right here.

384
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,010
There you go.

385
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,380
Ji Ho, Mom and Dad
will be here soon.

386
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm going to get some ice cream
and a drink,

387
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,050
- so you read your storybook, okay?
- Okay.

388
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,220
You're so cute.

389
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,320
Stay right here. Don't go anywhere.
If you need to leave, call me.

390
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,960
- Okay.
- Good.

391
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,890
Ji Ho!

392
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,090
Dad! Mom!

393
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,060
There you are.
What has my little guy been up to?

394
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,630
I was reading a storybook.

395
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
You were? Was it fun?

396
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,770
Yes!

397
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,870
- You want some ice cream?
- Okay!

398
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,350
I played the recording
for Hwang Gi Chan.

399
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,220
- How did he react?
- He was completely flustered.

400
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
He must've never seen that coming.

401
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,560
Don't engage with him
when you're alone with him.

402
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,430
There's no point in provoking him.

403
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,060
It's dangerous.

404
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,000
I'll be careful.

405
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,500
I forgot I have somewhere to be.
I should get going now.

406
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,940
Take Ji Ho and show him
around the showroom.

407
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,780
Aren't you coming with us?

408
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,850
Ji Ho, I'll come when I'm done.
So go on ahead with Mom.

409
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,450
- Okay!
- All finished? Ready to go?

410
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,720
Let's go, Ji Ho.

411
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,400
Hello? This is Designer L.

412
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,200
I've just arrived at the cafe.

413
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,270
Something's come up suddenly.
I was hoping we could reschedule.

414
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,770
I'm so sorry.
I should have contacted you sooner.

415
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,410
Oh, I see. All right.

416
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,530
Ma'am, after seeing you again
in person,

417
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,360
I'm more convinced than ever
that you're innocent.

418
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,670
I just called because I wanted
to tell you to hang in there.

419
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,440
Is that right?

420
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,540
Thank you for calling me yourself.

421
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,210
And with news of a reinvestigation,

422
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,010
the truth is bound to come out soon.

423
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,050
"A reinvestigation?"

424
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,080
- There's news of a reinvestigation?
- Oh my, you hadn't heard?

425
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,420
I'll send you a link
to the news story.

426
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,310
I got one for you when I was
getting mine. Please have it.

427
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,940
Thank you.

428
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,110
Perfect timing. I was tired.
Afternoons do that to me.

429
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,710
(Managing Director, Kang Mi Ran)

430
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,050
About my biological father...

431
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,660
- It's nothing. I'll be on my way.
- Seung Woo.

432
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,930
Are you curious about him?

433
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,630
I'm of two minds about it.

434
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,600
He's probably married
with a family of his own,

435
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,040
and I could break up his family
if I just showed up.

436
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,680
That's not true.

437
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,850
What makes you think
you'd be ruining anything?

438
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,120
You're his son.

439
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
And,

440
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,950
he's not...

441
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,720
Hold on.

442
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,360
Hello?

443
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,830
I'm right outside.

444
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,730
I have to step out for a minute.

445
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,610
You were in there?

446
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,140
Yes. So, what is this about?

447
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,710
Hey, do you remember
Detective Son Wang Sik...

448
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,210
you met at the police station?

449
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,550
Did you ever thank him for his help?

450
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,520
No, I haven't.

451
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,820
I figured as much.

452
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,090
When someone helps you out,
you need to thank them properly.

453
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,030
Go give him this and say thank you.

454
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,500
Thank you.

455
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,670
To me?

456
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,500
For the advice.

457
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,270
You know, my father always used
to say something to me.

458
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,410
Never forget what's precious
and always be grateful.

459
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,110
You're just as admirable
as my father.

460
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,190
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol
certainly raised him well.

461
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,090
Sir.

462
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,290
I'll treat you to a meal next time.

463
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,030
Seung Woo,
let's have a coffee break.

464
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,500
I actually have to stop
by the police station.

465
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,600
Here, you can have mine.

466
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,940
You don't mind, do you?

467
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,270
Well...

468
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,580
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.

469
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,760
YL Group, Planning and Design.

470
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,130
Mr. Kang Seung Woo?

471
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,700
He's not at his desk now.

472
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,700
Oh, is this Ms. Choi Ja Young?

473
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,630
Hello, this is Hwang Na Ra.

474
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,470
He went to the police station.

475
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,070
Hello?

476
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,080
Did we get cut off?

477
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
Hello?

478
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,380
Thank you so much
for your help the other day.

479
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,750
It was the right thing to do.

480
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,760
You know,
there's quite a resemblance.

481
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,260
Like who?

482
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,700
Don't!

483
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:40,340
No, Seung Woo
didn't do anything wrong.

484
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,110
He doesn't know anything.

485
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,810
I...

486
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,340
I...

487
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,140
I'm the one who killed her.

488
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,210
I killed Kim Do Hee!

489
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,460
(Queen's House)

490
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,690
Mister...

491
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
My mom...

492
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:42,300
My mom's been acting strange.

493
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,570
My father and Kim Do Hee...

494
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,170
Are you saying it was all on
Hwang Gi Chan's orders?

495
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,680
You may not remember,

496
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,710
but we were once married.

497
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,650
Yun Hee, don't freak out,
but listen carefully.

498
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,980
I have a kid.

499
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,690
I'm going to ask you one last time.

500
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,760
The baby you were carrying...

501
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,320
Is the baby really dead?
