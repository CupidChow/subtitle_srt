1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,580
(Episode 42)

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,460
I finally get to meet
the CEO of DH Holdings,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,760
the guy I couldn't even look at
the last time we met.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,770
DH Holdings and YL Group are
as good as one now.

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,770
This investment will
make YL Group global.

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,840
There's Mr. Patrick Jung.

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,820
Nice to meet you.
My name is Patrick.

11
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,490
What about the director?

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,830
Yes, there he is.

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,650
Please introduce yourself.

14
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm Director Kim Do Yun
of DH Holdings.

15
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,680
Do Yun and your uncle
went to work at YL Group today.

16
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,350
I gave them permission,
but was it the right thing to do?

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,380
I'm still not sure.

18
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,720
I feel like I pushed Do Yun
into the depths of vice,

19
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,490
and it keeps bothering me.

20
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,690
Do Hee.

21
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,360
Please keep an eye on Do Yun.

22
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,170
Keep him safe.

23
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,780
The air in here is kind of odd.

24
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,990
I thought you planned
to welcome us here.

25
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,120
It's about Mr. Kim Do Yun.

26
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,830
He's the director
of the Korean branch of DH Holdings.

27
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,160
He's not just Mr. Kim Do Yun.

28
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,070
He's the only man in Korea
I can trust and work with.

29
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,740
Do you have all the information
regarding Director Kim's background?

30
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,140
It sounds like you mean
there's a problem. Is that right?

31
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,580
No.

32
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,080
I'm not doubting your decision.

33
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,720
But I do consider
this agreement important,

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,950
so please allow me to speak frankly.

35
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,490
As you wish.

36
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,360
I'm not sure if you know,

37
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,090
but Director Kim had
only worked as a doctor.

38
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,260
I honestly don't understand
how he's in charge of YL Group,

39
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,630
a man who has no history
in investment or interior design.

40
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,340
On top of that, there was
an unfortunate event at work.

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,640
Are you aware of that?

42
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,010
Are you talking about
the sexual assault? I do.

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,980
Yet you still confide in him?

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,710
This feels like
a complete disregard for YL Group,

45
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,980
and it's quite unpleasant.

46
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,980
I agree with him.

47
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,950
It's nonsense for you to ask us
to work with an undeserving man.

48
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,590
It'll only increase our risks.

49
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,220
I cannot condone him.

50
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,660
I believe YL Group already comes with
its share of risks.

51
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,400
YL will go down miserably
if you only focus on the risks.

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,470
That's why we want to decrease
the possibilities of such risks.

53
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,870
I don't think Director Kim Do Yun is
someone who can work with us.

54
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,810
I'm a cold-hearted investor.

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,240
You're sorely mistaken
if you think I accept...

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,550
and confide in just anyone.

57
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,950
Mr. Jung, I think
it's my turn to step in.

58
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,590
First of all, I thought
we decided to remain neutral...

59
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,290
on my personal issue
until the judgment was made.

60
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,960
Isn't that so, Director Kang?

61
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,530
Even without that problem,

62
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,900
I still can't accept you
as the director in charge...

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,800
while disregarding my doubts
about your qualifications.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,130
Let me clear those doubts for you.

65
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,940
This is an in-depth analysis
of YL Group.

66
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,510
Start with the financial analysis
and the summary of performance.

67
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,110
The results of the 2nd quarter
in the year 2025 showed...

68
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,650
a 14 percent decrease on average
compared to the previous year,

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,720
including sales, operating profit,
and net income.

70
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,790
It's quite low
even compared to the competitors'.

71
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,660
The key cause of the issue was...

72
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,660
the failure to employ
solid management experts.

73
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,530
Simply put, everything worsened
after Chairman Hwang took office.

74
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,570
Why are you bringing this up?

75
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,770
I'm proving...

76
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,900
that I am not a risk for YL Group.

77
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,310
In the very back,
you'll find the investment plan...

78
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,580
and the expected results.

79
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,480
This investment collaboration is
the only way...

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,120
to surpass your competitors
and make YL the most profitable company.

81
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,690
As you can see,
Director Kim Do Yun was the one...

82
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,960
who analyzed YL Group
and made the investment plan...

83
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,590
from the beginning to the end.

84
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,860
Yet you want the investment,

85
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,730
but you cannot accept Director Kim,
who's in charge of everything?

86
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,230
There's no reason
for me to invest in YL Group...

87
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,800
if it weren't for Director Kim.

88
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,570
Are you aware that
it's a breach of contract...

89
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,680
to violate my authority
over human resources?

90
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,750
Feel free to pay the compensation
and call the contract off.

91
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,780
We won't lose anything.

92
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,350
What do you want to do?

93
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,720
We'll have to finish up...

94
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,260
putting together the office
for DH Holdings, Mr. Chairman.

95
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,060
Mr. Patrick Jung,
may I speak to you in private?

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,840
Let's have a good run,

97
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,510
Director Kim Do Yun.

98
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,640
Of course.

99
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,990
Oh, no. I'm late.

100
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,690
Hey, Dr. Kim!

101
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,930
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

102
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,860
I was worried sick about you.

103
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,400
You look so great today.

104
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,870
Did you get dressed up
to get permission from Gi Chan?

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,140
Did you do this for me?

106
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,510
Let's go together
and ask him to let us be together.

107
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,740
I just saw him.

108
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,510
What did Gi Chan say?
Did he give you his permission?

109
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,720
It's all right.

110
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,320
We can elope
somewhere overseas and live there.

111
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,190
You can make a living overseas
as a doctor.

112
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,260
Ms. Hwang.

113
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,160
I have zero interest in you.

114
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,430
Are you mad because of my brother?

115
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,700
You don't have to mind
anything he says.

116
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,230
I don't need his permission.

117
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,540
All I need is you. I mean it.

118
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,170
I never had
any romantic interest in you.

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,340
Stop lying.

120
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,180
Then, why did you tell me
to get my brother's permission?

121
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,020
Because I knew he'd be against it.

122
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,090
So, why were you nice to me?

123
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,990
I was just kind to you
as one of your colleagues.

124
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,630
I apologize
if you took anything the wrong way.

125
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,500
I thought you'd understand
if I beat around the bush.

126
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,470
I didn't know
you couldn't pick up on social cues.

127
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,000
I hope you won't press me
into doing anything...

128
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,910
You jerk. You're awful!

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,060
You should wipe your face.

130
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry...

131
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,040
for going into your room
that one time.

132
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,810
As you know,
my life became overly dynamic.

133
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,180
I was out of it
and missed my chance to apologize.

134
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,450
I apologized.

135
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,500
Kim Do Yun!

136
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,400
I was so nice to you.

137
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,540
I refused to meet a rich man...

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,740
and thought of marrying him,
even though he was broke.

139
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,210
If he didn't come to see me,

140
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,420
why did he dress up
and come here after he got fired?

141
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,830
What's your intention?

142
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,460
I came here...

143
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,300
on my official business
as the CEO of DH Holdings.

144
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,470
Shouldn't we stay within the lines,
Director Kang Mi Ran?

145
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,340
It wouldn't matter if you were
just Ms. Kim's uncle.

146
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,880
But what if you're here
to determine YL Group's future?

147
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,920
When I asked what you wanted
instead of monetary compensation,

148
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,420
you clearly said YL Group.

149
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,850
I did?

150
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,920
I must be getting old.
I don't remember saying that.

151
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,130
Are you trying to ruin my company?

152
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,530
Is this revenge for Ms. Kim
or against me?

153
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,970
What are you scheming?

154
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,670
Try to think rationally.

155
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,400
Who would invest in a company
only to make it go down?

156
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,740
It'd pull me down with it.

157
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,710
It'd make more sense if you thought
I'd make it thrive to take it over.

158
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Jung Oh Seong.

159
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,680
Excuse me, Director Kang Mi Ran.

160
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,520
Today is the last day you cross the line
with our private matter.

161
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,350
I do not wish to talk to you
about any personal business,

162
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,390
but only to associate
as the CEO of the investment firm...

163
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,990
and the director of YL Group
from now on.

164
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,500
Let us stay true to our roles.

165
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,000
Is that clear to you?

166
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,270
Why did Gi Chan summon Jae In again?

167
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,350
Are you ready to eat your hat?

168
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,660
Let's find out
which one of us eats it first.

169
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,160
I'm looking forward to it.

170
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,930
What's with that man?

171
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,410
Why was that man here again?

172
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,920
Who?

173
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,650
The guy who just left.

174
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,490
I saw him all dressed up. Who is he?

175
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,360
Tell me what he has on you.

176
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,630
Only then can I handle it.

177
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,300
Nothing is going on.

178
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,770
Yet you can't say a word to him
and let him have his way?

179
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,200
And it's weird
how you keep seeing him.

180
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,540
This isn't who you are.

181
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,270
You can be honest with me.

182
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,180
Who is he?

183
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,950
Patrick Jung,
the CEO of DH Holdings.

184
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,820
You'll see him more often now,
so show him good manners.

185
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,850
He's the CEO of DH Holdings?

186
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,350
Not just some thug?

187
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,590
Watch what you say.

188
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,320
You need to learn to show manners
as the future owner,

189
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,190
whether you want to or not.

190
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,330
Why should I show manners to a man
who tells me to eat my hat?

191
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,600
I don't want to.

192
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,410
Do you have
so much free time on your hands...

193
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,110
that you called
a mere employee to talk to you?

194
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,720
You knew Kim Do Yun would
return here as the director...

195
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,450
of DH Holdings, didn't you?

196
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,120
If this isn't about my job,
please excuse me.

197
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,460
I'm asking you. Answer me.

198
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,860
No comment.

199
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,900
It doesn't matter if I knew or not.
That's my personal business.

200
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
I have no reason to tell you.

201
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,970
I already know you two are
always together.

202
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,400
There's no way you didn't know.

203
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,100
I know both you and Kim Do Yun...

204
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,670
returned here to get revenge on me.

205
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,340
Tell him to stop wasting his time
and give up.

206
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,340
You need to persuade him.

207
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,010
Well, I hold a grudge against you,
but that's that.

208
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,350
You seem to feel guilty.

209
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,650
That means Director Kim Do Yun must
have a reason to get revenge on you.

210
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,190
What could it be?
I'm getting curious.

211
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,960
Are you involved
in Ms. Kim Do Hee's accident...

212
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,360
What is this nonsense?

213
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,800
Your mother killed her, not me.

214
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,930
It was caught
on the dash cam footage.

215
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,730
Then, why are you
so anxious and afraid of?

216
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,940
If you despise him so much,

217
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,310
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan the Great
can always kick him out.

218
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,780
Isn't that so?

219
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,080
Right. The investment
from DH Holdings...

220
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,250
must be crucial for YL Group
at this point in time.

221
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,990
Then, take a hint
and grovel before him...

222
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,420
instead of keeping
that useless pride.

223
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,370
You came much later than I thought.

224
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,270
You're so determined.

225
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,250
Why did you summon her here?

226
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,420
Take a hint and grovel before him?

227
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,690
Did something go wrong
because of her?

228
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,160
Kim Do Yun came
as the director of DH Holdings.

229
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,590
How? What did he do?

230
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,360
I have no idea.

231
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,260
I'll look into it.

232
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,910
How come
that tiny little restaurant needs...

233
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,710
so many ingredients?

234
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,980
These are so heavy.

235
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,580
Anyway, wait.

236
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,980
Is this the right way...

237
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,990
to the restaurant?

238
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,930
It's taking Mi Sook forever
to get the groceries.

239
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,060
What's taking her so long?

240
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:59,000
Is Min Jun having a good time
at lunch with his son-in-law?

241
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,340
The coffee smells great, Father.

242
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,250
Excuse me. It's Yu Gyeong.

243
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,610
- You should take it.
- Yes.

244
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,080
Hey, honey.

245
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,820
If it's too hard to give injections
to yourself, don't do it.

246
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,820
It's really hard
to put a syringe into your body.

247
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,990
Just watching you doing it...

248
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,460
made me scared and gave me chills.

249
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,130
You're more precious to me
than the baby,

250
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,940
so don't overdo anything
if it's too much.

251
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,510
Yes, I'm taking care of myself, too.

252
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,340
Father is waiting. I have to go.

253
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,850
Are you two trying for a baby again?

254
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,580
Yes.

255
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Honestly speaking,

256
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,550
I already like the idea
of life just between us two.

257
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,420
It'd be nice
to enjoy your life alone.

258
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,660
But you'll learn the joy
of having a child, too.

259
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,860
I was also worried
this would harm her physically...

260
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,930
and mentally.

261
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,400
She's on the weaker side,
but there isn't a huge problem.

262
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,740
You don't have to worry
this early on.

263
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,080
You two should rely on each other
as you get ready.

264
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,980
The baby would be adorable
if it takes after you two.

265
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,250
Yes, of course.

266
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,820
The baby would be adorable.

267
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,990
Excuse me.

268
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,960
- Yes, Ms. Choi.
- Director Do.

269
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,000
It must be
because this is my first time.

270
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,670
I can't find my way
back to the restaurant.

271
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,300
Can you tell me what you see?

272
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,580
(Pureundeul Park)

273
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,640
It says Pureundeul Park.

274
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,750
That's near the restaurant.

275
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,020
Do you remember the main road
where we walked to get to work?

276
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,390
Go out through the gates
and walk out to the main road.

277
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,550
You'll see the restaurant soon.

278
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,860
I used to go everywhere
with a personal chauffeur.

279
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,990
How would I know
if you just say the main road?

280
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,500
And I've only come to work
a few times in these alleyways.

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,900
You should stay there.
I'll come and get you.

282
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,610
It doesn't even take ten minutes
to get here from the park.

283
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,310
She has no trouble coming to work
by herself. That was odd.

284
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,330
Hey, Yu Gyeong!
Where the heck are you?

285
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,700
Yes, Mother! I'm over here.

286
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,910
Were you asleep?

287
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,340
I dozed off for a bit.

288
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,280
The superovulation injections
must be making me...

289
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,610
more exhausted and sleepy.

290
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,980
How are you going to have a kid...

291
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,280
if you're already feeling weak
after a few injections?

292
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,490
If you couldn't get pregnant
when you were younger,

293
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,620
there's no way it'll happen now.

294
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,360
Mother, the doctor told me...

295
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,660
keeping a peaceful mind was
the most important.

296
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,760
I was told to stay away from stress.

297
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,300
Are you trying to tell me...

298
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,000
I made you feel uncomfortable
and stressed you out?

299
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,540
As I asked you,

300
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,070
please just watch me quietly
for a year without a word.

301
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,440
You have such a roundabout way...

302
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
of telling your mother-in-law
to keep her mouth shut.

303
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,480
We should eat dinner.

304
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,920
I'm craving some fritters
griddled nicely in oil.

305
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,420
Make some fritters
with different ingredients.

306
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,720
We have to let go of the notion...

307
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,990
that the holiday food is
only for the holidays.

308
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,470
Come on in. Did anything happen?

309
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,800
Are you okay?

310
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,000
Were you hurt?

311
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,270
Yun Hee,
we didn't go there to fight.

312
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,640
It was as good as a fight.

313
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,380
How many times did I tell you
that we have the upper hand?

314
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,610
Who am I?
The CEO of the investment firm.

315
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,220
No one can mess with me,

316
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,650
so don't even worry about it.

317
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,950
You must've been worried.

318
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,460
I'm sorry that I didn't call.

319
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,930
We just met each other today,
and then we worked at Uncle's office.

320
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,260
It's all good if everything is okay.

321
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,200
- Uncle Do Yun!
- Hey.

322
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,600
Uncle Do Yun, Little Grandpa.

323
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,600
You're home.

324
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,440
I'm back.

325
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,270
Ms. Kang, you're home.

326
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,740
Did you have fun with your friends
at the kindergarten?

327
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,780
Yes.

328
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,080
- Have a seat. Let's eat dinner.
- Yes.

329
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,990
That doctor or whatever
who's close to Jae In...

330
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,290
returned to your company?

331
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,990
I thought he was a sex offender.

332
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,260
How can that scumbag
dare to return there?

333
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
What has this world come to?

334
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,500
Darn it. It's as if
that company is made of criminals.

335
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,370
Is there another criminal?
Who is it?

336
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,810
What?

337
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,680
Isn't it obvious? It's Jae In.

338
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,210
Eun Ho died, and you know,

339
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,980
her mother killed
that female employee.

340
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,490
That's enough.

341
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,990
It's nothing great.

342
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,990
All right.

343
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,090
Anyway, is that
investment company...

344
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,200
that prestigious?

345
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,600
How can they insist on having him
even after you said no?

346
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,400
How rich are they?

347
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,870
It's probably
beyond our expectations.

348
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,770
It's known globally.

349
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,870
It's called Globally?

350
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,780
No, that's not the name
of the company.

351
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
It's a famous investment firm
all around the world.

352
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,420
Good grief.

353
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,920
Jae In must have
good skills in capturing men.

354
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,490
She found herself the best guy.

355
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,860
If I had known, I would've had him
as Na Ra's spouse...

356
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,330
Mom.

357
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,200
Goodness, I just blurted that out
without thinking.

358
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,400
I should step in.

359
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,240
They'll lose their spirit...

360
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,140
as soon as they get a taste
of my temper.

361
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,480
I'll be there tomorrow
to teach them a lesson.

362
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,240
Do not come to the office,

363
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,950
and do not cause a scene.

364
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,650
No?

365
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,520
The problem will worsen
if DH Holdings...

366
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,280
uses that as an excuse
to back out of the investment.

367
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,990
Okay. I won't be there,
so don't worry about it.

368
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,990
Kim Do Yun, you jerk.

369
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,860
Why won't you accept me?

370
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,130
Look at that.

371
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,400
Gi Man was quiet for a while,

372
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,070
so she became hammered instead.

373
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,840
Hey! Get yourself together,
go upstairs, and go to sleep.

374
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,340
You're so loud.

375
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,780
Hey, lady. Highballs, please. One.

376
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,320
Two. Three. Four.

377
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,120
- What's with you?
- Four glasses, please.

378
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,720
My gosh, you brat.

379
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,560
Jeez.

380
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Good grief. Look at her.

381
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,940
Your office is nearby?

382
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,370
Yes, he probably couldn't have me
near the chairman's office,

383
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,140
so it means Director Kang Mi Ran
will keep me nearby to watch me.

384
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,110
She can check in on me
as she comes and goes.

385
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,420
He's working with DH Holdings,
but you two are his concerns, too.

386
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,490
He probably couldn't imagine
you'd show up as the director.

387
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,590
He seemed very disconcerted.

388
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,130
Dr. Kim?

389
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,660
You should probably change
how you address me.

390
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,930
I'm not a doctor anymore,
so it's weird to hear that.

391
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,170
Then, Director Kim?

392
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,700
No, you can be more casual.

393
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,710
I call you Jae In, anyway.

394
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,340
I'll do that from now on, Do Yun.

395
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,250
I can call you Do Yun, right?

396
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,490
Yes, okay.

397
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,260
I need to practice.

398
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,730
I haven't done that before,
so it's a little awkward.

399
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,130
Do Yun.

400
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Do Yun?

401
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,270
You must be tired, right?

402
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,770
- You should get some rest.
- Okay.

403
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,880
Do Yun?

404
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,550
What was that? What's with me?

405
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,620
Maybe I shouldn't have told her
to call me that.

406
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,600
- Call you what?
- My gosh!

407
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,530
It's nothing.

408
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,830
Why didn't you say you were here?

409
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,600
Hey, we share a room here.

410
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,740
Do I have to announce myself
every time I come in?

411
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,410
Don't be so cold.
Are you saying this is your room?

412
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,340
Don't be like that, Uncle Oh Seong.

413
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,550
Just let me know when you're here.

414
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,350
All right. If you want to apologize,

415
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,790
why don't we grab
some ice-cold beer?

416
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,090
Okay.

417
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,160
Let's go.

418
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,160
Detective Baek, I sent you some
pocket money. Are you enjoying it?

419
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,170
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

420
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,700
You should check the file I sent.

421
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,070
Patrick Jung of DH Holdings.

422
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,170
Find out
everything he did overseas...

423
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,980
and whatever else you can find.

424
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,140
Do it as soon as possible.

425
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,050
For our next special event,
we'll have a showroom...

426
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,990
displaying many different designs
for different types of families.

427
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,420
We'll also drop Ms. Kang's design,
the one she won the contest with.

428
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,490
Yes.

429
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,060
It was a benefit from the contest,
but we should keep it out.

430
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,570
This is a presentation
for our customers,

431
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,070
so she may end up
humiliating herself.

432
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,400
If that happens, the evaluation
for the overall event...

433
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,240
may plummet with her design.

434
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,410
Can you do this?

435
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,210
If you can't,
you need to give up now.

436
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,780
I'll do it.

437
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,110
I already made changes to the floor plan
and handed it over,

438
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,950
and the 3D revisions are
almost done, too.

439
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,220
I can have it installed
within the time frame.

440
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,720
It's not going to be easy
to work on the special event.

441
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,890
This time,
you can assist my project...

442
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,830
Director Kang, I can do it.

443
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,290
And Ms. Kang.

444
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,800
Address me properly
as Designer Kang.

445
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,300
It looks good as is.

446
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,000
The theme looks solid, too.

447
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,200
I'd like to live in a place like this
if I had to live alone.

448
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,610
We need this to show
different types of families.

449
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,380
There are so many
one-person households.

450
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,140
You need to do this right.

451
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,280
One mistake can demean
the overall quality of the project.

452
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,080
Yes.

453
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,550
That's all for the meeting.
Let's get to work.

454
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,560
Make sure you do a good job
without lowering the quality.

455
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,730
Thanks, Mr. Kang,

456
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,270
for siding with me.

457
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,170
I didn't.

458
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,140
I just told everyone what I thought.

459
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,850
This is for you, Grandma.

460
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,850
This is for you, Uncle Do Yun.

461
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,920
- Gosh.
- It looks so pretty.

462
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,690
It’s too precious to eat.

463
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,990
All right. Let me try this.

464
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,600
Bo Ram, you should be a cook.

465
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,200
It's so good. You're the best.

466
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,140
Uncle Do Yun, my teacher said...

467
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,440
people who bake cookies and cakes...

468
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,980
are called patissiers, not cooks.

469
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,440
Is that so? A patissier?

470
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,350
Then, Patissier Bo Ram,
it was delicious. You're the best!

471
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,850
What's wrong, Bo Ram?

472
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,760
Do you want to go somewhere?

473
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,620
Where's Ms. Kang?

474
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,230
She called and said
she'd be late today.

475
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,690
She's running late?

476
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,900
Yes, she has to work overtime...

477
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,200
for the contest she won.

478
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,740
Grandma, can we go and see her?

479
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,510
I can't give her my cookies
if she comes in late.

480
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,910
I'd be asleep by then.

481
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,210
I can give it to her...

482
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,410
and tell her that you made it.

483
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,610
I want to give it to her myself.

484
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,220
Grandma, can we go and see her?

485
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,990
No?

486
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,790
Bo Ram, I'll take you there.
Let's go.

487
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,260
Really?

488
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,430
Yes, really.

489
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,800
Okay. Give me some time.

490
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,360
I have to change
into pretty clothes.

491
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,570
Can she go there?

492
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,610
It's past working hours,
so everyone should be gone by now.

493
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,410
We'll leave right away
after she gives her the snack.

494
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,320
Ms. Kang!

495
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,990
Bo Ram, how did you get here?

496
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,220
She came with me.

497
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,090
She said there was something
she wanted to give you today.

498
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,990
Look! I made these.

499
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,330
It's my present.

500
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,860
Oh, my. Really?

501
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,870
These look so pretty.

502
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,570
Did you really bake these?

503
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:20,640
Yes, I made those.

504
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:24,040
You're good at everything, Bo Ram.

505
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,940
Thank you for the cookies.

506
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,010
Sure.

507
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,580
I tried them,
and they were delicious.

508
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,080
- Right?
- Yes.

509
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,580
Which flavor is this?

510
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,290
I'll pick up the files and go home,
so you may leave.

511
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,590
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,990
It looks good.

513
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,860
- Grape flavor?
- It's walnut flavor.

514
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,560
- It looks good.
- Have you had dinner?

515
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,700
You should eat. I got sushi.

516
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,530
Have you eaten, Bo Ram?

517
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,970
Do you want to eat with me?

518
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,400
Yes, okay.

519
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,740
You already had dinner.

520
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,150
Find out where Jae In is staying.

521
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,850
Yes, ma'am.

522
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,700
Shouldn't we have a desk for you?

523
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,400
No, I turned it down.

524
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,440
I have to manage
my other investments, too.

525
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,170
It's easier for me
to work at my office.

526
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,310
But I'll come by often,
so don't worry about it.

527
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,180
I have to be at a meeting.

528
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,410
- Good luck.
- Okay.

529
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,550
Come in.

530
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,990
Where's your uncle...
I mean, where's CEO Jung?

531
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,730
He had to leave on business.

532
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,630
I brought coffee.

533
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,140
It's finally the beginning.

534
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,440
Yes, it's the beginning.

535
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,620
What are you two doing
during working hours?

536
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,520
It's still 8:55am.

537
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,720
We still have five minutes.

538
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,990
I stopped by to ask
if you liked your office,

539
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,200
but I feel like an uninvited guest.

540
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,530
It's all right.
I was about to visit you.

541
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,770
I'm glad you're here.

542
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,470
I have a present for you.

543
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,900
A present?

544
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,340
It's this.

545
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,510
You seemed to have lost this,
so I wanted to return it.

546
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,010
(Queen's House)

547
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,310
I heard Mr. Kim Do Yun came
as the director of DH Holdings.

548
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,150
You have a knack for hitting on men.

549
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,720
No matter how good I am,
I can never surpass you.

550
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,990
You're an adulteress who hit on
a married man with a child.

551
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,990
You win.

552
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,460
I thought that lady, Mi Sook,
wasn't so good at her job.

553
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,730
But she seems quite witty.

554
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,330
It's her first time working a job
like this, so she's a bit lost.

555
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,560
But the way she handled
obnoxious customers today...

556
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,230
made me think I could leave
the business with her very soon.

557
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,070
Gosh, Ms. Kang.
Did you lie about your education?

558
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:15,710
What are you talking about?

559
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,710
Take a look at this yourself.

560
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,180
You're watching Exposé World,

561
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,610
exposing the dirtiest and most
disgusting scumbags of the earth.

562
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,520
I brought the latest news
on the darkest history...

563
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,050
of the worst scumbag.

564
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,620
This crazy jerk is doing this again?

565
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,950
I am candidate one, Sook Ja,
running as the president...

566
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,420
of the shopping arcade co-op.
