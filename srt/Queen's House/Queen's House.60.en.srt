1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,150
(Episode 60)

5
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,300
(Road closed, detour)

6
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,030
Jae In!

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,330
Wake up, Jae In!

8
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,370
Jae In!

9
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,210
Jae In!

10
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,210
Isn't your doctor too talkative?

11
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,750
He's a good friend
who's nicknamed Chatterbox.

12
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,610
Do you get how talkative he is?

13
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,550
But he helped you...

14
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,520
receive treatment safely,

15
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,990
so I'm grateful to him.

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,700
Jae In.

17
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,870
You're listening to me, right?

18
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,640
I couldn't tell anyone
you were still alive.

19
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,410
Someone clearly tried to kill you.

20
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,120
Someone lured you out there
pretending to be a detective,

21
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,060
and then you got into the accident
with the brake failure.

22
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,060
I didn't know
what people would do...

23
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,560
if they found out
you were still here,

24
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,230
so I had to keep it a secret.

25
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,540
You must've been exhausted,
so you probably needed to rest.

26
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,110
I know.

27
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,180
I do.

28
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,910
But it's been two weeks.

29
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,250
I hope you wake up soon.

30
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,300
Did you know that
you have a stunning smile?

31
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,200
I want to see that smile once again.

32
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,210
Will you do that for me?

33
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,990
He was late yesterday, too.

34
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,900
Bo Ram,
you need to tell your uncle...

35
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,960
to come home early.

36
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,340
Uncle Do Yun!

37
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,610
- Uncle Do Yun!
- Yes?

38
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,240
What is it, Bo Ram?

39
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,040
Grandma, Uncle Do Yun.

40
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,250
Have a seat.

41
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,450
Okay.

42
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Hold each other's hands.

43
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,770
Now, give each other a hug.

44
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,170
Hey, Bo Ram.

45
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,740
Come on. Do it now.

46
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,140
Grandma is worried about you,

47
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,240
and you're worried about her, too.

48
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,480
Why do you keep asking me
to relay your word?

49
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,780
My teacher said...

50
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,220
you had to talk about
why you got mad, apologize,

51
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,090
and make up with each other
when you're angry with someone.

52
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,960
Come on!

53
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,830
Gosh, Bo Ram is
much more mature than her elders.

54
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,190
What are you waiting for?

55
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,130
Didn't you hear Ms. Kim Bo Ram?
Time to make up with each other.

56
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,880
You've been coming home too late.

57
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,380
I'm sorry. I'll try to come earlier.

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,250
I'm not having awful thoughts,
so don't worry about me.

59
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,360
All right! Great job.

60
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,670
I need you to share the files
Ms. Kang Jae In was in charge of.

61
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,800
Do that now.

62
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
What do you think you're doing?

63
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,910
Mr. Kang,
you must address your superior...

64
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,970
as Team Leader Kang
before you ask a question.

65
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,610
You resigned.

66
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,910
I was reinstated.

67
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,010
I'm in charge of that project
from now on.

68
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,490
Didn't you hear me, Mr. Kang?

69
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,690
I have nothing to do
with that project,

70
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,960
so go to the investors
and ask them to share the files...

71
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,200
if you need something.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,430
What's with the commotion
this early?

73
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,140
If you two disagree,
talk it out first.

74
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,120
How can she be reinstated?

75
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,590
She lost the contest.

76
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,820
Director Kang!

77
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,860
I thought it'd be better
for someone in the know...

78
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,430
to join the project
to end it successfully,

79
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,360
so I had her come back.

80
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,670
You can't do this
if you think of Jae In.

81
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,640
She was the person in charge,
and she's no longer with us.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,340
It was inevitable.

83
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,510
I understand how you feel,

84
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,550
but keep your feelings away.
Work is work.

85
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,310
What about me?

86
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,550
You treated me like a nephew
for over 27 years.

87
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,390
Then, my dad suddenly passed away,

88
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,690
my mom got locked up in prison,
my sister got divorced,

89
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,260
and even Eun Ho died.

90
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,400
Why did you tell me the truth
while I was in the biggest mess?

91
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,800
What are you after?

92
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,110
It's because you're my son...

93
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,210
Just...

94
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,310
be honest.

95
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,280
You only want to use me
to take YL Group over!

96
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,720
I thought you blurted that out
in your drunken mind.

97
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,090
Do you really think
I'm taking advantage of you...

98
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,230
just to satisfy my greed?

99
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,230
No.

100
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,400
I could bet everything I have
to prove what I said was true.

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,310
I thought my son was
brought up in love,

102
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,710
but you seemed to be
in so much pain.

103
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,410
So, I wanted to tell you
that you were worthy of love.

104
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,720
I don't care what the excuse is.

105
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,290
That's how it seems to me.

106
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,740
That punk.

107
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,470
Do you have any idea
what I had to put up with?

108
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,990
Do I have an upset stomach?

109
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,900
I'm taking these.

110
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,070
Jae In lived a short life,
but she must've been happy.

111
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,510
- What did you say?
- It was a blessing to be born rich,

112
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,010
and you were
always there to protect her.

113
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,750
She must've passed away
to a good place.

114
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,080
I don't think
that's something for you to say.

115
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm just hoping you'll stay strong,
no matter how tough this is.

116
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,090
I'm also in distress
after saying goodbye to a friend.

117
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,090
Please excuse me.

118
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,940
That was a lot more than I thought.

119
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,510
Hey, do you want some coffee?

120
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,150
Do Yun.

121
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,990
What's on your mind?
Didn't you hear me call you?

122
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,060
Uncle Oh Seong.

123
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,730
When you said you'd set up a meeting
with a detective for Jae In,

124
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,730
there were only the three of us.

125
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,900
How do you think someone found out
and had a fake detective call?

126
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,140
You're right.

127
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,510
That's been bothering me, too.

128
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,910
How did they know?

129
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,290
What?

130
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,350
What is this?

131
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,350
It's a bugging device.

132
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,730
It was installed in the office
that YL Group prepared for us.

133
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,800
Is that so?

134
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,530
You don't seem alarmed.

135
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,400
I don't think
this is a simple matter.

136
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,270
How are we supposed to trust
YL Group after something like this?

137
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,210
How can we
confide in your business...

138
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,280
and continue to invest?

139
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,180
First, please calm down.

140
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,750
We can talk this through.

141
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,280
Is there a point in talking...

142
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,220
if common sense
means nothing to you?

143
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,850
You're surveilling your investors...

144
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
with this dirty trick
in an attempt to find our weakness.

145
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm starting to get offended.

146
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,230
It has nothing to do with me,
and it could've been an outsider.

147
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,840
You're nitpicking over this
like I'm behind it.

148
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,910
After I found this bug,

149
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,210
I began to think...

150
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,610
Ms. Kang Jae In's death
may not have been a simple vehicle defect.

151
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,390
Do you still not know anything?

152
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,760
Don't let your imagination run wild.

153
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,730
After all, it happened
within the office building,

154
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,300
so I'll pay more attention.

155
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,630
And? Should I put up some CCTVs?

156
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,470
Are you kidding me?

157
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,110
We just found a bug.
Did you say CCTVs?

158
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,210
If you don't want them, never mind.

159
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,640
All we know at this point is
that you found a bug.

160
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,480
You don't have any evidence...

161
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,010
on who, when,
and why someone did this.

162
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,720
Come back and talk to me
when you have hard proof.

163
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,890
Thanks for blowing this up.

164
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,100
You'll face
many interesting events from now on.

165
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,690
What did he say?

166
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,830
He flatly denied it.

167
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,730
He could do that again and more.

168
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,670
Let's heighten our security.

169
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,330
Okay.

170
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,470
Your suspicions were correct.

171
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,010
I looked into ES Agency...

172
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,070
and found a connection
with H and K Company.

173
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,680
We tracked its funds
and approval process...

174
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,610
and found out Catherine
had the final say.

175
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,380
This is great.
It's yet another card we can play.

176
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,050
Do you want to grab a drink
after work today?

177
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,690
I thought you quit drinking.

178
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,330
It's the kind of day
when you want to relapse.

179
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,230
Let's take a rain check.

180
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,160
Hey, you should say yes
when your elder invites you...

181
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,530
to a drink.

182
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,470
I'm not trying to console you,
but you'll feel better...

183
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,640
if you get hammered and vent
what you have on the inside.

184
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,810
I have to be somewhere tonight.

185
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,440
Where? I'll go with you.

186
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm not a kid, Uncle Oh Seong.

187
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,550
You can't joke your way out of this.

188
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,950
You've been acting
very weird lately.

189
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,380
I don't know
where you go after work these days,

190
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,720
but you've returned past midnight
and even stayed the night out.

191
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,120
Don't say it's because of work.

192
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,590
In that case, I'd already know.

193
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,530
You can talk to me
if something is bothering you.

194
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,330
Your mother is worried sick.

195
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,560
Nothing is going on.

196
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,930
I've been getting some fresh air
to change things up,

197
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,000
meeting my old friends
from the hospital and stuff.

198
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,640
I mean it.

199
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,010
Hey, Mom.

200
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,880
Me? I'm at a new hospital.

201
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,080
I hear the plastic surgeon here is
really good at facial contouring.

202
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,880
Goodness.

203
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,690
Fine. I won't get it done.

204
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,390
I just want to know
how much it'll cost. Okay?

205
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,630
- Na Ra! Did you walk out?
- Is that Dr. Kim...

206
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,630
You can get fillers
and make incisions, but not bones!

207
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay, fine. I get it.

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,540
I'm leaving.

209
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm home.

210
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,540
I'm home, too.

211
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,310
What? Where's Gi Chan?

212
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,880
He's making a call downstairs.

213
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,180
Why?

214
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,790
I was wondering
if I should tell him about Dr. Kim.

215
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,960
I think he might quit his job
at the investment firm...

216
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,060
and return as a doctor.

217
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,030
He'll work as a doctor again?

218
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,630
Yes, I ran into him
at a hospital I went to.

219
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,900
Kim Do Yun was at a hospital?

220
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,480
You need to pay me up front
as your cameraman.

221
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,310
What did I tell you?

222
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,250
I said I'd pay
when the videos make money.

223
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,620
You don't get paid automatically
just by uploading videos.

224
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,390
You need lots of view counts...

225
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,790
to become eligible and be monetized.

226
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,620
It's a complicated process!

227
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,290
If you want to get paid,

228
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,560
you can handle
that complicated process.

229
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,030
Get ready for the shoot.

230
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,370
This one is ugly.

231
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,230
All right. Standby.

232
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,940
Ready, action!

233
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,050
Ji Ho. The music, please.

234
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,200
All right. Come downstairs, Na Ra.

235
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,450
Gosh. I'll have a nightmare
if I see them in my dream.

236
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,710
They're so frightening.

237
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,620
You need to see only good things.

238
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,390
Kim Do Yun found the bug?

239
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,720
All he found was
just one bugging device.

240
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,630
He can't do anything with that.

241
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,030
You're right.

242
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,100
He doesn't
have proof that I put it there.

243
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,930
I'm not commending you,
so don't be so proud.

244
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,540
Do not make another move
without my permission.

245
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,200
Discard all devices
that were connected to the bug...

246
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,740
to prevent future problems.

247
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,390
I heard she was closing early today.

248
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,320
Is that so?

249
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,330
But I have a key.

250
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,030
Does she give a key
to her regular customers?

251
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,370
Well, something like that.

252
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,470
I'm here to grab a drink,

253
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,100
and I don't like drinking alone.

254
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,970
If you want to join me, come on in.

255
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,080
You know, mister.

256
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,420
No, Mr. Patrick.

257
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,020
I'm a really selfish kid.

258
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,200
All I care about is me.
I'm the most selfish punk...

259
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,770
this world has ever seen.

260
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,270
You didn't have to tell me.
I can tell.

261
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,510
All I cared about was my pain.

262
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,180
That seemed like
the biggest trouble,

263
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,580
so I had no idea...

264
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,960
and was mean to my sister,
until her misery...

265
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,530
tortured her
and ruined her completely...

266
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,190
from the inside.

267
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,970
In dramas and films,

268
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,770
there's always someone who regrets
only after someone dies.

269
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,380
I always thought they were pathetic
whenever I saw that.

270
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,710
"Why did they
take them for granted?"

271
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,220
"It serves them right."

272
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,090
But...

273
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,990
But...

274
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,060
that was me.

275
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,900
I didn't know I'd be like this.

276
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,140
I was just deeply heartbroken...

277
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,910
to know that
we weren't really siblings,

278
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,340
that I wasn't her real brother.

279
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,210
Ms. Kang wasn't your real sister?

280
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,620
It's been a while since I found out.

281
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,990
Just as I was slowly...

282
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,960
getting used to everything,

283
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,960
I met someone who gave birth to me.

284
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,070
It wasn't Jae In's fault...

285
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,570
that I was that woman's son,

286
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,010
but I only got mad at her.

287
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,520
I regret that so much.

288
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,290
That's the thing
with younger brothers.

289
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,290
I'd get myself into trouble,
only to regret it later.

290
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,560
I often made
my older sister cry a river...

291
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,960
back in my heyday.

292
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,740
Actually, I've also done
something recently.

293
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,180
But don't be so hard on yourself.

294
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,250
Ms. Kang wouldn't want you
to feel so devastated.

295
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,440
It's another great day.
Have some coffee.

296
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
Thanks.

297
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,510
You came late last night...

298
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,480
after telling me to come early.
Was this revenge?

299
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,980
Don't even get me started.

300
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,390
I had to stash someone in a cab
before I came. It wasn't easy.

301
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,390
Anyway, did you know
Ms. Kang and Mr. Kang...

302
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,890
weren't actually siblings?

303
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,560
Mr. Kang isn't Jae In's brother?

304
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,230
You didn't know, either.
Apparently so.

305
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,770
At first, Kang Seung Woo was
arrested as Do Hee's murderer,

306
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,840
then Choi Ja Young...

307
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,340
I mean, Jae In's mother was
arrested as the real culprit.

308
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,180
We thought that was suspicious,

309
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,480
wondering if the mother
took the blame for her son.

310
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,610
Come to think about it now,

311
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,550
she must've tried to frame
Kang Seung Woo for what she did.

312
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,820
He wasn't her real son.

313
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,290
I must leave for an appointment.

314
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,960
Mr. Do.

315
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,690
Yes?

316
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't Jae In and Seung Woo...

317
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,830
look alike?

318
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,200
Sorry?

319
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,410
Why did Gyu Cheol do that to me?

320
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,640
I wanted to ask him, but I couldn't.

321
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,610
I was afraid...

322
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,320
he'd bring up another woman's name.

323
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,650
Ms. Choi.

324
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,060
I shouldn't have said that.

325
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,230
Just pretend like
you didn't hear that.

326
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,630
Sure. Goodbye.

327
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,640
Why hasn't Jae In called me?

328
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,710
Oh, my. I'm so out of it.

329
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,450
I forgot to go to work. Oh, no.

330
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,720
Goodbye.

331
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,760
What is this?

332
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,030
I thought you'd be having
a tough time after Jae In passed,

333
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,290
so I came to console you.

334
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,260
Honey.

335
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,500
Excuse me, Mr. Hwang Gi Man.

336
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,170
We're strangers,
so do not call me honey.

337
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,600
Then, should I call you
Ms. Yu Gyeong?

338
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,670
It'd feel much friendlier
to call you just Yu Gyeong, right?

339
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,380
Are you a stalker?

340
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,580
Do not say my name,
and do not come to see me.

341
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,110
I got a job. Don't you want to know?

342
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,760
The flowers aren't at fault.

343
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,930
I'll come again.

344
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,030
Take this with you!

345
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,770
These tables are all crooked.

346
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,380
What do you think you're doing?

347
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,450
Can't you see?
I'm straightening the tables.

348
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,420
The place needs to look tidy
when customers walk in...

349
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,050
to leave an impression
as a neat restaurant...

350
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,390
that cares about sanitation.

351
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,620
People take things that far.

352
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,790
Is this a joke?

353
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,360
Ms. Jung,
is something bothering you?

354
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,700
I don't know what it is,
but please feel better.

355
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,400
Come to think of it,
I haven't eaten anything.

356
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,170
I'm hungry.
Can I have something to eat?

357
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,440
Get out.

358
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,150
Is this a new trick
to make me angry?

359
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,020
How can you be so brazen?

360
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,720
How dare you come here?

361
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,730
Ms. Choi, please stand up.

362
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,060
You need to come with me.

363
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,100
Ms. Jung, it's me.

364
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,030
Don't you know?

365
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,240
Why don't you recognize me?

366
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,270
It's not like you've lost your mind.

367
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,610
Are you unwell?

368
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,250
I can't stand this anymore.

369
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,250
You must want to blame me.

370
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,850
But I didn't kill her!

371
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,350
Did I?

372
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,660
I don't want to talk to you,
so just leave!

373
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,660
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

374
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,660
Yu Gyeong, doesn't she seem weird?

375
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,470
She should be examined.

376
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,840
Ms. Jung, did you kill someone?

377
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,150
Ms. Choi, you need to get up.

378
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,280
Let's go.

379
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,080
I didn't kill anyone. You did!

380
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,990
You killed my daughter, Do Hee!

381
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,990
How dare you come here
and make this scene?

382
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,930
Do Hee?

383
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,630
Ms. Kim Do Hee?

384
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,870
Let's go, Ms. Choi.

385
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,600
I'm sorry.

386
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,300
Let's go.

387
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,110
Goodness.

388
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,790
My goodness.

389
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,500
My gosh.

390
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,870
What has Director Do done to me?

391
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,240
Did you know about this?

392
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,640
Jae In doesn't know anything, right?

393
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,920
Ms. Choi, don't you remember
what happened to Jae In?

394
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,550
What happened to her?

395
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,620
Anyway, call her
and tell her to come and see me.

396
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,760
She needs to know.

397
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,260
I told you to call her.
Why are you staring at me?

398
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,130
Ms. Choi,

399
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,740
I have to tell you something.

400
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,070
Please don't be alarmed.

401
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,640
Don't you remember
Jae In's car accident?

402
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,050
Jae In got into a car accident?

403
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,950
When? Is she badly hurt?

404
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,190
Let's go to the hospital. Now.

405
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,090
Ms. Choi,
do you really not remember?

406
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,760
She's not with us anymore.

407
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,370
What are you...

408
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,110
Where am I?

409
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,430
It's okay, Ms. Choi.

410
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,830
Let's go home together. Okay?

411
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,950
Have some.

412
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,990
Jae In would've wanted you
to get examined right away.

413
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,000
She's not with us now,

414
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,570
so I should probably ask.

415
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,840
Will you get examined?

416
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,570
No.

417
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,480
Ms. Choi, you need this.

418
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,310
You don't have to be ashamed.

419
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,920
I already did.

420
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,930
Did Jae In know?

421
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,870
She was busy with her business,
so I couldn't say anything to her.

422
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,470
I'm glad I didn't.

423
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,880
If she knew I had dementia,

424
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,580
she couldn't have
passed away in peace.

425
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,480
I'll contact the hospital
you went to...

426
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,320
and find out some more.

427
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,950
Yu Gyeong.

428
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,060
Do not tell anyone.

429
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,690
Please keep it a secret.

430
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,070
Yes, but you must
take your medicine,

431
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,770
and do not skip meals
or your workouts.

432
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,280
That's the only way
I can face Jae In again later.

433
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,580
Can you promise me?

434
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,590
Should I take
some digestive medicine?

435
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,790
I don't feel well.

436
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,100
Wait.

437
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,830
How long has it been
since I had my last period?

438
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,800
(June)

439
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,040
(July)

440
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,280
My cycle is irregular,
but it's been too long.

441
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,210
Could I be...

442
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,320
Director Kim Do Yun was
seen at a hospital?

443
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,260
What am I thinking?

444
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,460
Jae In is dead.

445
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,070
We had her funeral already.

446
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,380
But I'd better check to make sure.

447
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,240
(Room 6510)

448
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,400
(Queen's House)

449
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,440
I wanted to suggest
a major shake-up.

450
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,680
I'd like to propose
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's dismissal.

451
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,140
I want to know if he shared the fact
that we found a bugging device...

452
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,710
in the investment firm's office.

453
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,250
If your position seems
too good for you,

454
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,680
it's only right
for you to step down.

455
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,050
It's like messing
with a ticking time bomb.

456
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,320
I'm pregnant.

457
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,920
She has dementia?

458
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,960
That woman has dementia?

459
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,430
Where's Jae In?

460
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,960
I'll let you meet her.

461
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,000
Kneel and beg me
to let you meet her.

462
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,970
I'm right here.

463
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,500
I'm now Kang Jae In.
