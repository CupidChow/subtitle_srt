00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,630
(Room 6510)

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,050
What brings you here,
Ms. Kang Se Ri?

8
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,290
Because I had to, don't you think?

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,390
Who are you?

10
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,940
He mustn't be your acquaintance.
What do you think you're doing?

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,310
Have you been tailing me?

12
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,940
I must've been out of my mind.

13
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,310
I saw you at this hospital,

14
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,710
so I was deluded into thinking
I'd meet Jae In if I followed you.

15
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,850
Do you call that an excuse?

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,950
It's not an excuse.

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,150
I'm saying that was how I felt.

18
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,150
Anyway, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,820
Please excuse my behavior.

20
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,830
I hear the plastic surgeon here is
really good at facial contouring.

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,370
I just want to know
how much it'll cost. Okay?

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,080
Is that Dr. Kim...

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,220
Hey, did you do as I asked?

24
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,350
Okay.

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,490
Are we good now?

26
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,060
Yes.

27
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,530
You make me do the weirdest things.

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
You suddenly wanted
to change her hospital room...

29
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,870
and have me lie here
like I was a patient.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,870
It's like I'm in a spy film.

31
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,210
Who's that woman?
Why did she follow you?

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,010
I'll tell you later. Thanks a lot.

33
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,950
It must be
something you can't share.

34
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,650
Be careful.

35
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,100
I'm here.

36
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,300
I found a new hospital room for you.

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,240
It's not bad, right?

38
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,840
I heard from my uncle today...

39
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,480
that Mr. Kang Seung Woo
wasn't your biological brother.

40
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,780
You were always concerned about him,
so I never noticed.

41
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,220
I was often reminded of Do Hee...

42
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,890
whenever I saw you two.

43
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,120
I'd get both jealous and angry.

44
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,530
I knew it wasn't your fault,
but I still felt that way.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,370
I'm such a fool, aren't I?

46
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,640
When you wake up,
feel free to call me petty.

47
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,310
Call me whatever you want.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,740
I'll hear out everything,

49
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,040
so wake up.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
You should wake up soon
to give a big hug to your brother.

51
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,890
He's having a tough time,

52
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,450
thinking you've already passed away.

53
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,630
So, you have to wake up.

54
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,100
Please do, Jae In.

55
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,440
I don't think we're close enough
to meet outside after work.

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,350
You said you had something to say.

57
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,820
Why did you call me out here
to talk to me? Say it.

58
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,900
You can talk to me
when you've made up your mind.

59
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,130
Bye.

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,670
I'm pregnant.

61
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,480
I mean, I think I'm pregnant.

62
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,790
Don't take it too seriously.

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,530
I told you because I thought
that was the right thing to do.

64
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,700
- I won't ask you to take...
- I have to take responsibility.

65
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,770
I will.

66
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,980
Well, I don't mean...

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,910
that you have to have the baby.

68
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,110
If you want to have the baby,
I'll take responsibility.

69
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,620
If you don't think
you can have the baby,

70
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,850
I'll do whatever I can
and do my part.

71
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,790
Well, what I mean is this.
No matter what you choose to do,

72
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,460
I'll respect your decision.

73
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,860
I don't get to persuade you
in this matter,

74
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,600
so you can choose to do
whatever you want.

75
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,800
Right. Yes.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,640
First, I should go to a clinic
for an examination.

77
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,310
I'm on the older side now.

78
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,210
A clinic? Why?

79
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,580
I have to get examined by an OB-GYN.

80
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,450
Right. An OB-GYN.

81
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,020
Yes.

82
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,790
Would it be better
if we went together instead of you alone?

83
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,590
Yes, let's go together.

84
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,030
That sounds much better. Yes.

85
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,100
When should we go?

86
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,270
She has dementia?

87
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,180
Ms. Choi is suffering from dementia?

88
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,620
Yes.

89
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,750
She must've gone to a doctor alone
to get examined.

90
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,660
Her condition seems to have worsened
after Jae In's death.

91
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,360
I thought you should know.

92
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,830
I never noticed,
although she was living here.

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,830
How can I face Chairman Kang
and Jae In later on?

94
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,600
You protected her
and looked after her.

95
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,240
It's not easy to do that...

96
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,510
for someone who isn't family.

97
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,810
Both Chairman Kang
and Jae In would be grateful.

98
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,150
What about Seung Woo?
Have you told him?

99
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,320
Not yet.

100
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,520
I don't know
if I should tell him or not.

101
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,960
His aunt is also involved,

102
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,760
so I've been wondering
what Jae In would've done.

103
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,030
She should receive regular checkups.

104
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,230
Is there anything else I need to do?

105
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,740
You're doing fine.

106
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,810
You always treat her warmly.

107
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,580
It's important to make sure
she doesn't feel anxious.

108
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,920
A colleague from my navigator days
is the same age as I am,

109
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,220
and he recently
got someone pregnant.

110
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,820
Really? Good for him.
That's great news.

111
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,490
Do you think so?

112
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,460
He became a father at a late age,
so he must be happy.

113
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,500
Is he not?

114
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,160
No, of course, he's happy.
It's a great thing.

115
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,830
He said...

116
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,340
he began to think realistically.

117
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,900
As you know,
there is so much freedom...

118
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,110
when you work as a navigator.

119
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,740
He lived so freely until now,
but he suddenly has a kid now.

120
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,180
He'll have to get married
and settle down, too.

121
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,050
At my... I mean, at his age,

122
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,750
he wasn't sure
if he could handle everything.

123
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,920
He sounds like an old man
who hasn't learned his life lesson.

124
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,520
If he said he wasn't sure
he could handle his kid,

125
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,960
he makes it sound like
the child was a punishment.

126
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,560
A child is the gift of life.

127
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,100
If he became a father
that late in his life,

128
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,070
he should just be grateful.

129
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,870
Tell him he'll find out
once he starts raising the child.

130
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,440
What do you mean by that?

131
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,540
"I must've lived my life
for my child."

132
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,280
"I lived such a great life.
I'm thankful for that."

133
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,980
He'll feel that way.

134
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,720
If he's the same age as you,

135
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,190
the woman must be on the older side.

136
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
Yes, they're about the same age.
She's like two years younger.

137
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,360
My gosh. That's a miracle.

138
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,330
It's amazing
that she got pregnant at that age.

139
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,230
Even younger people have
a lot of trouble with pregnancy.

140
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,970
Tell your friend to be good to her
if he can spare time to worry.

141
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,370
Pregnancy isn't easy.

142
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,840
It must be harder at her age.

143
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,780
Okay. I'll tell him that.

144
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,120
I hear DH Holdings has
a proposal to make.

145
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,920
Please tell us.

146
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,630
I wanted to suggest
a major shake-up.

147
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,960
Please refrain from using
ambiguous language to prevent confusion.

148
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,130
Director Kim Do Yun,

149
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,540
please tell him loud and clear,
just the way he wants.

150
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,070
DH Holdings
would like to propose...

151
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,010
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's dismissal.

152
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,020
I'd like to ask YL Group's board
if you were aware...

153
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,420
of Chairman Hwang's abuse
of personnel appointment.

154
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,720
He reversed the contest result
and reinstated his wife.

155
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,330
- Did you know?
- I didn't.

156
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,100
I want to know if he shared the fact
that we found a bugging device...

157
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,100
in the investment firm's office.

158
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,270
He refused to open an investigation
and only tried to cover it up.

159
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,000
It didn't sit right with me.

160
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,140
I also believe
Chairman Hwang chose the agency...

161
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,310
to carry out the business
for the Koreatown apartment complex.

162
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,710
A previous subcontractor
that became the reason...

163
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,310
for a director-level
employee's dismissal...

164
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,380
turned out to be the parent company
of that agency.

165
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,990
Hence, all profit will
go to that subcontractor.

166
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,220
I thought it was odd that
the agency was established recently.

167
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,960
Did you receive a rebate
from the subcontractor?

168
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,300
The working-level employees
looked over them and decided.

169
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,930
All I did was give my approval.

170
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,630
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan...

171
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,770
has already become
an untrustworthy partner.

172
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,740
In order to improve our cooperation
in investment in the future,

173
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,580
please consider...

174
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,380
his dismissal.

175
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,920
Director Kim, there's a line
you should never cross.

176
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,520
Do you think an investment firm can
dismiss the chairman with one word?

177
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,290
It's not something
for the investors to meddle with.

178
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,160
If the chairman
poses another risk...

179
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,190
to shake the very foundation
of our company yet again,

180
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,330
YL Group will be
the first to propose...

181
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,070
the chairman's dismissal
from the inside.

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,140
YL Group does not exist
to benefit one person.

183
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,240
We will keep a close eye on him
to cultivate a continuous...

184
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,350
and amicable cooperation
with DH Holdings,

185
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,810
so why don't we call it a day today?

186
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,220
That was too much.

187
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,060
I know you wanted to humor them,
but that wasn't the right situation.

188
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,730
If you sit there
and agree with DH Holdings,

189
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,270
what does that make me?

190
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,340
Did you think I said all those
just to humor DH Holdings?

191
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,140
Ms. Kang.

192
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,470
I put up with you to this day...

193
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,210
because I made a deal with you
to make Seung Woo the successor.

194
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,120
If your position continues to seem
too good for you,

195
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,920
it's only right
for you to step down.

196
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,120
The board is waiting, so I must go.

197
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,830
Do not cause more trouble
and make me patch up your mistakes.

198
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,220
(Director Kim Do Yun)

199
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,780
Have you talked to the board?

200
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,020
Yes.

201
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,420
For now, it's just a yellow card.

202
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,620
I don't think
they can sack him right away.

203
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,860
We can kick him out
if we push them one or two more times.

204
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,260
Why don't we expose
H and K Company for what it is?

205
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,870
That's too dangerous.

206
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,040
We need hard evidence
to kick him out with one go,

207
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,140
but if it goes wrong,
it may backfire.

208
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,280
Do Yun.

209
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,880
You must feel anxious because of Jae In,
but keep your cool.

210
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,080
You have to think of Do Hee
as well as Jae In.

211
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,590
I'm sorry for acting hasty.

212
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,560
It's okay. As they say,
revenge is best served cold.

213
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,290
Yes, I'll find out if there are
other instances of corruption.

214
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,730
Okay.

215
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,560
Do you have a meeting coming up?

216
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,530
No, why?

217
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,330
You keep checking the time.

218
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,630
I don't have anything.

219
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,740
Hey, Do Yun.

220
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,410
Do you think
I can be a father at this age?

221
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,350
I'd be over 70 years old
by the time my kid hits 20.

222
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,220
Well, that's a problem
for the future.

223
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,120
My wife... The mother of my child...

224
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,660
would be around my age, right?

225
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,860
Let's say she got pregnant.

226
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,230
Would it be medically okay?

227
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,800
Do you think
everything will be fine?

228
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,770
Uncle Oh Seong, make the baby first.

229
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,840
You don't have to get ahead of yourself
and start worrying.

230
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,810
People in their fifties these days
aren't like people back in the day.

231
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,640
You're in your early fifties,
so you'd be like someone...

232
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,880
in their late thirties
or early forties back then.

233
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,410
That's how old you'd be.

234
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,850
You're still young.

235
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,880
Right? I still got my game, right?

236
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,630
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

237
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,730
Come in.

238
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,500
Wait.

239
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,640
You can't drink coffee.

240
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,070
It's herbal tea.

241
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,510
I see. Right.

242
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,050
I thought
we were meeting at the clinic.

243
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,750
I thought of doing that,

244
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,850
but it could be dangerous
for you to drive alone.

245
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,390
What's that?

246
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,720
This?

247
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,660
You didn't seem to eat well.

248
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,230
You might feel sick
if you get in a car on an empty stomach.

249
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,030
Everything is organic.

250
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,640
This is nice.
I'm finding my appetite.

251
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,270
Really?

252
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,210
Do you like it? I can get more.

253
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,780
It's okay.
Let's go to the clinic first.

254
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,650
Are you done with the exams?

255
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,720
I told you so.

256
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,660
- Ms. Kang Mi Ran?
- Yes?

257
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,230
You're done with the exams.

258
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,540
Let me share the results along with
the questionnaire you filled out.

259
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,110
You said you had trouble sleeping.

260
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,510
I felt exhausted lately,

261
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,810
and my joints began to hurt, too.

262
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,120
Has your period ever been irregular?

263
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,520
Yes, my cycle has been irregular,

264
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,220
but this time,
my symptoms were different.

265
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,360
It's been about two months.

266
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm worried because she's older.
Is she all right?

267
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,170
She'll need
a thorough examination, but...

268
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,730
A thorough examination? Why?

269
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,300
Is she in bad condition?

270
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,600
She's still talking.

271
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,240
Yes, right.

272
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,410
Please continue.

273
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,040
Your symptoms show...

274
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,010
you've hit your climacteric.

275
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,980
Your period stops
and the cycle becomes irregular...

276
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,450
when you reach your climacteric.

277
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,820
It's the early stage of menopause.

278
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,100
I felt a little dizzy, nauseated,

279
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,800
and didn't feel well.

280
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,140
Some people mistake
the symptoms for pregnancy...

281
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,100
when climacteric symptoms are
too severe.

282
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,640
Wait.

283
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,110
What's climacteric?

284
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,550
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,920
What? Mi Ran.

286
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,860
She's in dire need of your comfort.

287
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,530
What she needs now is
her husband's kind words.

288
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,440
I've been too pathetic
and lame like a loser to this day.

289
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,640
That's why Yu Gyeong forgot
all about my charms.

290
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,510
A man must come
in sleek fashion and good hair,

291
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,150
as well as equipped with eloquence.

292
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,950
When it comes to words,
I'm the best.

293
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,220
I've attracted so many clients
with this mouth.

294
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,790
Okay. Hoo-ha! Okay.

295
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,420
Hello? Is this the police?

296
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,050
All right. Be confident. Charge!

297
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,690
I love you, Yu Gyeong! Okay. Good.

298
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,790
Whoa.

299
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,890
I told you to stop coming.

300
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,360
Are you testing my patience?

301
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,800
Leave. Now.

302
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,600
Yu Gyeong, do you know
what I did best in this life?

303
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,640
It's that I loved you.

304
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,570
Yu Gyeong, can we
work things out one more time?

305
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,040
This time, I'll be good to you.

306
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,780
Please consider this
the last time and...

307
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,380
What's wrong, Yu Gyeong?
Are you unwell?

308
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,150
Do not touch my body.

309
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,720
I called the police, so leave.
Leave now!

310
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,320
It's not like that, Yu Gyeong. I...

311
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,620
Enough is enough!
She doesn't want you to do this.

312
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,190
Don't do that.
I have to talk to her.

313
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,260
Please hear me out, Yu Gyeong.

314
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,160
It's not that. Hear me out...

315
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,600
- What?
- We received a report.

316
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,500
It's him.

317
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
Please stop him from coming here.

318
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,000
Please hear me out, Yu Gyeong...

319
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,470
Please calm down,
and we'll talk at the police station.

320
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,770
What? The police station?

321
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,780
Please take the flowers!
You have to take them!

322
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,480
Why would I go
to the police station?

323
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,680
Wait, stop!

324
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,860
Are you sure you're okay?

325
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,720
Are you hurt?

326
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,930
I'm fine. You stopped him for me.

327
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,160
You won't let him
keep doing this, right?

328
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,930
He's not in his right mind.

329
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,300
You need to take strong action.

330
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,900
I put up with him,
thinking he needed some time,

331
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,910
but I can't do this anymore.

332
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,980
I'm filing for a restraining order
against him.

333
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,680
Are you all right?

334
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,420
I've been bracing myself.

335
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,050
Jae In would've wanted that from me.

336
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,020
You're a big boy now.

337
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,690
She must be proud.

338
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,900
Of course.

339
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm not 7 anymore. I'm 27.

340
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:39,310
Everyone, I turned on
the live stream...

341
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,140
to share some tea with you.

342
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,880
Do you see this?

343
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,420
This is black tea
from a very hot country.

344
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,790
It cost 2,000 dollars per kilogram.

345
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,160
I'm home.

346
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,100
Hey. My son is home.

347
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Where have you been, my son?

348
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,270
Yu Gyeong reported me,
so I was at the police station.

349
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,240
What now?

350
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,310
She put me on a restraining order.

351
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,880
Can you get an attorney
and lift that?

352
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,320
How can you be so ridiculous?

353
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,450
You two are over already,
so I told you to stop messing with her!

354
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,620
- Mom, you're streaming live.
- Oh, my. What do I do?

355
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,590
My gosh. Get over here!

356
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,430
You ruined everything!

357
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,100
Get back here!

358
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,840
("L, a Korean Designer,
Wins the S.Dot Design Award")

359
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,140
(L, a Korean, wins the Grand Prize
in the world-renowned...)

360
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,720
Are you busy?

361
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,220
You should have some tea.

362
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,520
What happened
to your participation...

363
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,090
in the S.Dot Design Award?

364
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,060
It's such a world-renowned contest.

365
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,930
It's almost impossible
for a Korean to win alone.

366
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,070
Impossible?

367
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,830
There's a news article...

368
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,700
about a Korean named L
winning the Grand Prize.

369
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,910
I had to prepare in a hurry,

370
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,140
so I decided
to put meaning in participation.

371
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,010
Don't be so foolish.

372
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,080
You need to do your part
to assist me.

373
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,280
Why won't you do anything?

374
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,880
Kim Do Yun and Patrick Jung
tried to kick me out today.

375
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,290
On top of that,
Director Kang sided with them.

376
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,820
Why would they do that
without Jae In around?

377
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,690
Because she died.

378
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,490
And he's Kim Do Hee's older brother.

379
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,300
Why did you do
something that reckless?

380
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,340
You messed with a ticking time bomb.

381
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,640
What will you do now?

382
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,110
I need to kick them out
before Director Kang sides with them.

383
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,840
Do you have a plan?

384
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,010
I need to find a new investor.

385
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,120
I have a lot to do, so leave.

386
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,330
Jae In.

387
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,130
You're already dead, so get lost.
Please.

388
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,040
(Ricept)

389
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,650
(Pharmacy)

390
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,320
This drug delays
dementia progression.

391
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,790
She has dementia?

392
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,230
That woman has dementia?

393
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,680
I should go and see.

394
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,480
Jeez. I should ventilate the store
while the business is slow.

395
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,850
It's so hot today.

396
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,660
Ms. Jung,
did you come out to see me?

397
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,400
Is this fun to you? Is this a joke?

398
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,130
Why are you doing this?

399
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,140
Why do you keep showing
your horrible face and making me furious?

400
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,540
Ms. Jung,
may I have a word with you?

401
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,480
Ms. Choi, can you stay
in the chicken place for a moment?

402
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,530
Hello. Please have a seat.

403
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,230
Don't you know me?

404
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,800
Who are you?

405
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,310
Hello, Ms. Choi.

406
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,080
I'm Jae In's friend.

407
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,650
- You're Jae In's friend?
- Yes.

408
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,820
You must be deeply grieved.

409
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,620
Who would've known
Jae In would die like that?

410
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,290
What are you talking about?

411
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,730
Who died?

412
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,130
Don't you remember?

413
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,430
So, this is what dementia is like.

414
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,140
Jae In.

415
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,340
Your daughter, Kang Jae In, died.

416
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,380
What are you talking about?

417
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,850
Why would she die?

418
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,320
No, that's impossible.

419
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,220
Hey, lady.
You were at her funeral, too.

420
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,290
Don't you remember that?

421
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,600
Do you want to meet her?

422
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,700
I can let you meet her.

423
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,480
Where's Jae In?

424
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,410
Then, kneel and beg me...

425
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,580
to let you meet her.

426
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,150
I'll make it happen.

427
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,690
Please let me see my daughter,

428
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,900
my Jae In.

429
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,140
So,

430
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,050
she's slowly losing her mind
because of dementia?

431
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,650
Yes, her condition...

432
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,820
recently worsened
after Jae In's death.

433
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,330
Her daughter died,
so it must've been tough.

434
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,240
I want to see Jae In.

435
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,080
I'm right here. I'm Kang Jae In.

436
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,350
Your daughter, Kang Jae In, is dead.

437
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,950
I'm now Kang Jae In.

438
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:35,160
I'm the real Kang Jae In!

439
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,660
No!

440
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,530
Why would Jae In die?

441
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,000
No!

442
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,100
No!

443
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,340
What do you think you're doing?

444
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,540
What have you done?

445
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,110
I didn't do anything.

446
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,340
She was looking for Jae In,

447
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,340
so I told her she was dead.

448
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,780
Is that a fault?

449
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,210
No!

450
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,090
Jae In! No!

451
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,020
Jae In!

452
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,730
No! Jae In...

453
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,330
(Queen's House)

454
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,930
Jae In.
I was worried sick about you.

455
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,600
Who are you?

456
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,330
Is the baby okay?

457
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,800
She's suffering from RA.
Retrograde amnesia.

458
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,640
Her brain instinctively paused
her memories to protect itself.

459
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,170
Do you not remember anything?

460
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,140
It's not 2018 right now. It's 2025.

461
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,610
She went back to the days
when she felt the safest and happiest.

462
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,910
You know who my husband is, right?

463
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,980
Please take me to him.

464
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,520
I miss him.

465
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,490
Jae In?

466
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,890
Have you lost your mind?
You lied and said she was dead?

467
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,230
Who do you think you are
to want to protect her?

468
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,530
She had her funeral already.
How can she be alive?

469
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,660
This is nonsense!

470
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,900
She's really alive?

471
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,270
My mom doesn't know...

472
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,700
you tried to kill Jae In, right?

473
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,600
I just want to go home.

474
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,500
I don't want to stay away from you.

475
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,410
I need to bring Jae In home.

476
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,140
Are you telling me to move out?

477
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Why should I?

478
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,150
This is my house!
