1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,170
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,340
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,450
I know I don't deserve to be happy.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,290
I shouldn't want that.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,960
But I wanted to be happy.

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,800
I must be getting punished
for my greed.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,870
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,170
I'm so sorry.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,040
Did you say you wanted to be happy?

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,010
You want to be happy?

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,910
How can you even bring that up
in front of my sister,

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,550
who died at your mother's hands?

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,850
You don't deserve to be happy.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,650
My sister will never come back...

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,960
even if you apologize
tens of thousands of times.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,130
How can you be forgiven?

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,430
I won't forgive both you...

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,000
and your mother.

20
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,880
You're up.

21
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,810
What happened?

22
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,680
Don't you remember?

23
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,520
I offered to give you a ride
in return for a fare.

24
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,120
Yes, I do remember.

25
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,660
So, why are we here?

26
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,930
I also got tired,
so I stopped to take a nap,

27
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,130
but a lot of time had passed.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,960
I got out to get some air
and to wake up.

29
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,730
I see.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,040
I'm all right, really.

31
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,940
You looked cold.

32
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,240
Don't worry about it.

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,450
I called you a few days ago,

34
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,990
but someone else picked up.

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,290
Didn't she tell you?

36
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,930
I didn't know.

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,660
Why did you call?

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,960
Because of the box of articles
the chairman left behind.

39
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,970
I was going to stop by
and pick it up,

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,600
but things were hectic,
so I had forgotten.

41
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,940
- I'll pick it up tomorrow.
- Sure.

42
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,840
I'll keep it safe,

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,740
so come for it once you feel better.

44
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,380
It's this way, right?

45
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,450
Yes.

46
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,820
Jae In.

47
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,020
Did you go out at this hour?

48
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,860
What were you doing here
with my husband?

49
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,200
What do you mean?

50
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,200
What are you trying to say?

51
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,730
Forget that.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,100
Where were you?

53
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,800
I ran into her by coincidence.

54
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,340
She didn't seem to be too well,
so I just gave her a ride.

55
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,210
Coincidence?

56
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,480
That's right.

57
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,510
So, why was Se Ri with you...

58
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,680
Are you okay?

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,750
Do you still feel dizzy?

60
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,950
A little.

61
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,160
Take your hands off her.

62
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,770
Thank you for congratulating me.

63
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,470
- You can take the car.
- Sure.

64
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,040
Jae In, let me clear this up
in case you take it the wrong way.

65
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,880
Something was on his face,

66
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,850
so I blew it off...

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,080
instead of touching his face.

68
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,780
She wouldn't take
something like that the wrong way.

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,180
You should go.

70
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,320
Okay.

71
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,020
I'll call you, Jae In. Bye.

72
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,270
You should go, too.

73
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,390
If you weren't well,
you should've stayed at home.

74
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,320
Why were you out there?

75
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,920
And why do you keep seeing him?

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,830
Is something going on
between you two?

77
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,400
What were you and Se Ri doing?

78
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,070
Do what?

79
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,600
We had a drink during team dinner,

80
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,540
and I couldn't just leave her
because she was your friend.

81
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,070
So, I offered to give her a ride.

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,080
But I was a bit tired,
so I wanted to be dropped off first.

83
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm asking about what happened
in front of the building.

84
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,110
What were you two doing?

85
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,480
I just explained it to you.

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
I became the acting chairman,

87
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,550
so we had a team dinner
to celebrate.

88
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,920
What are you suspicious of?

89
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,530
Do you realize that
you've been acting weird recently?

90
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,060
I understand that
having a miscarriage was tough,

91
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,730
but do you even care
about me or Eun Ho?

92
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,100
I've been trying hard
not to bring this up,

93
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,900
but how many times have you said
you ran into him by chance?

94
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Was it really a coincidence?

95
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,810
Goodness.

96
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,650
Why are you two bickering?

97
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,690
Jae In isn't even in good condition.

98
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,450
Why are you acting irritated?

99
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,090
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,830
Well, I wasn't trying to eavesdrop,

101
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,700
but who's this man?

102
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,960
I kept hearing something
about "him."

103
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,670
It's nothing.

104
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,370
He had a misunderstanding, Mother.

105
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,470
Is that man
the one who's acquainted with you?

106
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,710
Goodness, forget it.

107
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,050
I imagined the weirdest thing.

108
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,250
That's impossible.

109
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,550
You have my full trust.

110
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,160
Anyway, you should get better first.

111
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,460
You have to be in good health
to have another child.

112
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,630
Here, take your medicine.

113
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,460
Right here.

114
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,570
And this.

115
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,010
Make sure you take it...

116
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,140
every morning and evening
to let it take effect.

117
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,790
Your phone had been off for a while,
but I thought I'd try one more time.

118
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,260
I'm glad you picked it up.

119
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,390
You really came.

120
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,200
Where are you staying? At the hotel?

121
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,530
Or a friend's place?

122
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,370
You should go home.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,340
I don't have one.

124
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,440
Yu Gyeong, I'm homeless.

125
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,410
You need to stop drinking.

126
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,010
What do you mean you're homeless?

127
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,480
I'm guessing you don't know...

128
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,450
the secret behind my birth.

129
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,590
I saw everything
at the chairman's funeral.

130
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,750
It must've been shocking.

131
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,490
It felt like
a nuclear bomb flew in...

132
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,300
and blew up over my head.
Do you know what it's like?

133
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,270
My mom declared that
she wasn't my mom,

134
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,870
so it had to be that dramatic
to make it fun.

135
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,010
I understand how Ms. Choi felt
as another woman.

136
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,940
She must've detested the chairman.

137
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,180
I'm sure she was harsher on you
because of that.

138
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,810
I don't know about everything else,
but she truly adored you.

139
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,730
Jae In is worried sick about you.

140
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,690
You should call her.

141
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,000
Do you really think so?

142
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,630
I'm not even her brother anymore.

143
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,700
We're strangers.

144
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,000
She had a miscarriage.

145
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,240
She probably wasn't
as shocked as you were,

146
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,480
but she still suffered
from a huge impact.

147
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,780
Yet all she ever does is
worry about you.

148
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,750
She asked me to let her know...

149
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,220
if I heard from you,
even via text message,

150
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,650
but I didn't call her.

151
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,890
Having a miscarriage is
as painful as giving birth.

152
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,290
She has to look after herself
to recuperate quickly.

153
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,420
Is she okay?

154
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,990
You call her a stranger,
yet you still worry about her?

155
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,730
It's the hospital.
I have to take this outside.

156
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,910
You should check your phone.

157
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,710
It seemed like Jae In had been
texting and leaving voicemails...

158
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,480
every single day.

159
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,580
You'll find out if she thinks of you
as a brother or not...

160
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,880
once you see those.

161
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,890
(No matter what the situation is,
I'm still on your side.)

162
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,130
(Let me know whenever you need me.)

163
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,000
(I understand that you'll need time
to gather yourself.)

164
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,540
(I know you may want to be alone,
but I want to know if you're okay.)

165
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,310
(At least just tell me
where you are.)

166
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,940
(You can come home anytime.
I'll wait for you.)

167
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,540
(Things must've felt complicated.
But you're still my brother.)

168
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,840
(That's an unchanging fact.)

169
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,050
Jae In...

170
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,550
Jae In...

171
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,090
Sorry...

172
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,480
Do Hee.

173
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,680
I can't leave this with you
for a while.

174
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,020
It can get lonely,
but please wait a little longer.

175
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,800
They wouldn't do that out in the open
in front of their home.

176
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,870
I must've seen something wrong.

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,930
Are you up?

178
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,570
Where's Eun Ho, Mother?

179
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,810
He went to the kindergarten.

180
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,070
I didn't think
you'd wake up any time soon,

181
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,640
so I helped him get there.

182
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,340
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,280
I must've slept through my alarm.

184
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,480
Things can happen.

185
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,050
How do you feel?

186
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,750
Do you feel better?

187
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,260
I hope the medicine works.

188
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,260
I think the medicine must be
making me dizzy...

189
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,860
and even dazed.

190
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,900
Is that so?

191
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,930
I think it's working.

192
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,530
Those are the symptoms
you'll experience...

193
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,440
as toxins leave your body.

194
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,340
I'm glad I paid good money for it.

195
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,170
You haven't taken it yet, right?

196
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,740
You have to take it
every morning and evening.

197
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,980
I'll bring some water.

198
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,450
You overslept like a lazy dog,
not even realizing...

199
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,190
your husband was leaving for work.

200
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,590
What a life.

201
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,430
I didn't realize
I was thinking out loud.

202
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,200
I know I'm generous with you,
but you're here with your in-laws.

203
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,540
You need to know
there are lines you need to keep.

204
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,570
Every family has
a different set of customs.

205
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,810
We had customs?

206
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,180
- I never knew that.
- Shut...

207
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,580
I won't let you get the surgery.

208
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,650
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,150
I'm sorry, Mother.

210
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,960
I'll be careful from now on.

211
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,960
You should.

212
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,700
Goodness,
look at how dusty this place is.

213
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,500
You should start
by cleaning the living room.

214
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,040
Wash the curtains...

215
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,200
and clean the floor
with your hands...

216
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,670
instead of using a vacuum cleaner.

217
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,080
Well, may I begin
after I go out briefly?

218
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,750
Again?

219
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,810
You went out yesterday.
You're going out again?

220
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,480
It'll take only an hour or two.

221
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,850
I'll make it quick.

222
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,820
Okay, then.

223
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,990
What are you talking about?

224
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,360
Dr. Kim works at YL Group?

225
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,690
He came as the doctor
for the in-house clinic.

226
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,430
I called to tell you...

227
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,170
that you were delusional
in thinking...

228
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,270
you knew everything about Jae In.

229
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't drag Jae In down with you
just because you live that life.

230
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,810
I thought I warned you.

231
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,840
She was with Dr. Kim last night.

232
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,710
Stop lying.

233
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,610
- You've always made up...
- You can ask those two...

234
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,950
and see if it's a lie or not.

235
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,450
I also want to know...

236
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,020
why they keep seeing each other,

237
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,290
so will you tell me if you find out?

238
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,090
His younger sister died
because of Jae In's mom,

239
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,290
so I thought it was odd that
they were meeting each other.

240
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,760
I have to see a patient.

241
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,560
- Bye.
- Yu Gyeong.

242
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,460
I have no hard feelings with you.

243
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,070
Let's be good friends.

244
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,070
You can call me
whenever you change your mind.

245
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,970
Bye.

246
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,280
Welcome home, Seung Woo.

247
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,150
I'm glad you're here.

248
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,690
I guess I ran late today
to see you here.

249
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,260
Have you had something to eat?

250
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,830
I don't have an appetite.

251
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,470
I'll go upstairs and get some rest.

252
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,900
Yes, okay.
Go upstairs and get some rest.

253
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,070
Then, we can eat together.

254
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,670
What about work?

255
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,810
I can take the day off.

256
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,010
Don't do that.

257
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,440
It feels uncomfortable.

258
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,680
Okay, then.

259
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,520
I'll go to work,
so let's eat dinner together.

260
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,690
Okay.

261
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,190
Seung Woo, you're our family.

262
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,130
That's an unchanging fact.

263
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,330
Hold your head high.

264
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,800
Okay.

265
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,340
Come in.

266
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,650
Do you work here?

267
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,920
They were looking for a doctor
to open this clinic,

268
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,620
so I applied and got the job.

269
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,020
Yes, you're right.

270
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,930
I guess I still have a tough time
accepting my sister's death.

271
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,230
I wanted to know
why she had to die so unfairly.

272
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,000
It was a hit-and-run accident.

273
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,570
I get that you feel wronged,

274
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,300
but the culprit was already caught.

275
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,740
Getting a job at YL Group
won't change anything.

276
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,580
His sister might have died...

277
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,240
in Se Ri's place.

278
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,510
What's wrong?

279
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,680
It's nothing.

280
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,550
Did you not tell me...

281
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,560
because you found out
about Jae In's relationship with me?

282
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,860
Did you think I'd tell her something
as her family?

283
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,490
I was going to tell you
when I visited you last time.

284
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,200
Your husband came,
so I couldn't do it.

285
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,130
You haven't had lunch, right?

286
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,530
Let's eat together.

287
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,570
The cafeteria here makes great food.

288
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,350
Is the workload okay?

289
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,510
Yes, it's not so bad. There are...

290
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,490
- The person you have reached...
- Hello.

291
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,590
is not available...

292
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,950
Hello.

293
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,890
Was everything okay last night?

294
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,790
Yes.

295
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,460
Yu Gyeong.

296
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,000
We're not at home.
You don't need to show me respect.

297
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,940
Hey, Dad.

298
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,210
Are you here for the box?
Do you want me to bring it?

299
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,310
First, I have to be somewhere.
I'll be there.

300
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,450
Sure.

301
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,150
I'll see you at home.

302
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,920
All right. I'll be there now.

303
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,120
I'll have to take a rain check.

304
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,630
Shall we?

305
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,870
Let's eat lunch next time.

306
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,400
Something came up.

307
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,070
Okay, then. Take care.

308
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,270
Bye.

309
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,550
Wait. Give me a second.

310
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,190
I'm getting a call.

311
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,960
I'll be there after work.

312
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,960
You always say that,
but you never come.

313
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,900
Do you know
how heartbroken Ji Ho is?

314
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,470
I had to walk on eggshells
around my wife back then,

315
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,140
but not anymore.

316
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,840
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

317
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,810
Don't be so heartbroken.

318
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,780
Okay.

319
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,950
Oh, my, Jae In.

320
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,590
Are you all right?

321
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,460
You tell me.

322
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,230
How am I supposed to comprehend
what I saw right now?

323
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,930
Something bad happened to her,
so I just comforted her.

324
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,300
That was all.

325
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,270
Why should you do that?

326
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,970
Because she's my friend?

327
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,540
Jae In, this is a misunderstanding.

328
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,380
I talked to him about my husband.

329
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,150
He's a man like him,
so I thought he'd understand.

330
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,250
You must think I'm stupid.

331
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,080
Both you and you.

332
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,020
Yesterday and today...

333
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,490
I already explained
what happened yesterday.

334
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,290
And I just explained this.

335
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,390
Yes, Jae In.

336
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,430
Nothing is going on between us.

337
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,300
Did you just say "us"?

338
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,200
She called you two "us."
Is there really nothing here?

339
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,340
Are you going
to fixate on words now?

340
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,770
What has gotten into you lately?

341
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,610
Are you turning into your mother?

342
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,450
It's a misunderstanding, Jae In.

343
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,850
If you still don't believe me,
let me apologize.

344
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,590
If I must do that
to make you feel better,

345
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,460
then, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

346
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,860
What's going on?

347
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,330
I pat her on the back
to share my consolation,

348
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,070
but she must've thought
I was hugging her.

349
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,170
Anyway, I made a mistake
and caused a misunderstanding.

350
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,370
You two were holding each other.

351
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,740
Jae In.

352
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,280
Did you really think that happened?

353
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,720
Aunt Mi Ran,

354
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,980
I saw them.

355
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,620
I'm sorry, Ms. Kang.

356
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,890
It's all my fault.

357
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,560
I'm sorry, Jae In.

358
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,490
Jae In.

359
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,760
There are lots of eyes around here.
Why would it happen in the office?

360
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,760
It doesn't make any logical sense.

361
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,170
But Aunt Mi Ran...

362
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,100
Jae In,
let's stop talking about this.

363
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,440
Anyway, hey.

364
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,640
Seung Woo came home.

365
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,780
He did?

366
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,580
Yes.

367
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,010
We're going to eat dinner together.
Can you be there?

368
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,980
You should come.

369
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,590
I will.

370
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,820
I have an important meeting
with a buyer.

371
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,360
You should go, then.

372
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,830
It's working hours,
so let's get to work.

373
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,230
Yes.

374
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,600
What do you want to do, Jae In?

375
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,200
Jae In, are you okay?

376
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,340
Aunt Mi Ran, I have to go.

377
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,880
Please don't be alarmed
and hear me out.

378
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,280
I kept thinking and wondering...

379
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,820
if I should share this with you.

380
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,820
But I decided
it was right to tell you.

381
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,360
What is it?
Why do you seem so hesitant?

382
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,990
You can relax and tell me, Dad.

383
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,600
I heard Gi Man staged...

384
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,100
Eun Ho's kidnap.

385
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,700
Who told you that?

386
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,870
Aren't you surprised?

387
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,210
Did you know about this?

388
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,610
Yes.

389
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,680
What about Jae In?

390
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,490
Does she know?

391
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,660
So, she doesn't.

392
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,030
It's not too late
to tell her and apologize.

393
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,000
I can't do that.

394
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,670
How am I going to do that?

395
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,840
You're telling me to be a sinner,
although it wasn't my fault.

396
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,970
I have pride, too.

397
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,010
Then, will you
turn a blind eye to this?

398
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,810
You'll have to live
with a huge load on your chest.

399
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,050
How can you live
the rest of your life with that?

400
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,980
I briefly thought
ignoring this would be...

401
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,350
the best choice
I could make for you,

402
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,190
but we shouldn't do that.

403
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,620
Tell Jae In
and ask for her forgiveness.

404
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,690
Everything must be tough for her.

405
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,000
After what happened to Ms. Choi,

406
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,570
even the chairman passed away.

407
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:42,930
Think of how hard that must be.

408
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,740
Things are hard for me, too.

409
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,600
Why is everyone...

410
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,740
only concerned, worried,

411
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,280
and feeling bad about Jae In?

412
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,550
She's not allowed
to suffer a little,

413
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,050
but it's okay for me to suffer?

414
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,550
Yu Gyeong.

415
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,650
Why is everyone
only worried about Jae In?

416
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,690
Even if everyone else does that,

417
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,560
you should think of me first.

418
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,360
You need to consider me first.

419
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,600
I can't tell her.

420
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,470
If you don't like that,

421
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,210
you can do it yourself.

422
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,320
(We're on a break.
Please wait a little.)

423
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,100
Oh, my.

424
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,230
Are you all right?

425
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,270
I'm sorry.

426
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,700
Hello.

427
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,210
I was going to call you,
but I forgot to do that.

428
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,080
After a while,
I couldn't even find your number.

429
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,710
I'm so sorry.

430
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,180
I have to return your money.

431
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,380
Right.

432
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,490
Hey, do you feel unwell?

433
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,050
You look pale.

434
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,660
I felt a little dizzy.

435
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,660
Then, why don't you come in
and sit down? It's my business.

436
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,230
No, it's okay. I have to go home.

437
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,770
I'll stop by again next time.

438
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,430
Goodbye.

439
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,180
Goodness, she might collapse
on her way home.

440
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,110
She looked awful.

441
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,410
You should lie on your back.

442
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,780
Honey.

443
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,810
Can we talk?

444
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,120
Speak.

445
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,250
I thought about it all day.

446
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,690
Did I see something wrong?

447
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,360
Is there nothing going on?

448
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,960
If you're having an affair,

449
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,130
I'll forgive you.

450
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,900
My mom gave you a hard time,

451
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,270
so I thought you could've had
a moment of weakness.

452
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,800
I'll forgive you.

453
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,470
So, please be honest with me.

454
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,910
I'll believe whatever you say.

455
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,880
As I said in front of your aunt,
it's not true.

456
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,780
If you continue
to be suspicious of me, then...

457
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,790
Never mind.

458
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,290
I really want to believe you.

459
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,100
- What's wrong, Mom?
- What is it?

460
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,140
I just pushed the blanket aside...

461
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,740
to go to sleep, and then I found
my clothes looking like this.

462
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,810
Goodness.

463
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,440
Oh, my gosh.

464
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,380
This is your favorite outfit.

465
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,010
Was it a thief?

466
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,580
Thieves would take money...

467
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,320
instead of turning her clothes
into trash.

468
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,380
Then, who would do this?

469
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,390
It looks more like a grudge.

470
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,290
Was it you?

471
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,790
I think the culprit is
somewhere in this house.

472
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,700
Who was it?

473
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,400
You better speak up
while I'm still nice. Who did this?

474
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,670
If no one will come forward,
I'll have to check this myself.

475
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,510
I need to see your room, Gi Man.

476
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,810
Are you suspicious of us?
It wasn't us.

477
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,980
You should look somewhere else.

478
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,280
Fine. However,

479
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,250
if I find anything in your room,
you won't live to see another day.

480
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,380
Jae In,
I need to see your room first.

481
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,230
Gosh.

482
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,210
My goodness.

483
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,690
Jae In, you need to explain this.

484
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,520
What is this?

485
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,190
I have no idea what this is about.

486
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,700
Then, why did I find this
in your vanity table drawer?

487
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,370
I mean it.

488
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,670
What grudge did you hold against me?

489
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,170
Were you offended
when I asked you...

490
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,910
to wake up a little earlier
to see your husband off?

491
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,180
Or did you resent me
for going shopping alone...

492
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,850
after closing
the pig's feet restaurant?

493
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,380
Or were you disappointed...

494
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,720
when you came to talk to me
about Gi Chan's affair?

495
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,320
Because I denied it...

496
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,020
and said it couldn't be true
and you were delusional?

497
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,490
No, I didn't do it, Mother.

498
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,990
And...

499
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,700
- I didn't talk to you about him...
- My gosh.

500
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,630
My goodness.

501
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,600
I cooked for you
every morning and evening...

502
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,070
and even got medicine for you
to help you get well soon.

503
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,080
I let you boss me around,
unlike anything Yu Gyeong ever did,

504
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,920
but I just figured
you were sad after that miscarriage.

505
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,520
If that wasn't enough,

506
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,960
you began to slander me like this.

507
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,460
No, Mother.

508
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,430
I didn't do that to your clothes.

509
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,630
Are you sure?

510
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,400
You keep forgetting things
these days.

511
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,870
You even forget the things you did.

512
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,900
She's right. You know
you've been odd lately, right?

513
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,210
You spaced out and burnt my outfit.

514
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,480
You seem totally out of it.

515
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,610
Be quiet.

516
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,710
That's just postpartum depression.

517
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,980
No, is it prepartum depression?

518
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,350
Anyway, whatever.

519
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,280
What did you do this afternoon?

520
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,790
I felt dizzy, so I just rested.

521
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,420
Again?

522
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,090
Don't you remember
breaking that dish?

523
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,240
My gosh. You should be more careful.

524
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,780
You broke all my expensive dishes.

525
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,740
I'm sorry.

526
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,150
Let me clean it up.

527
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,550
Do you really not remember?

528
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,490
It was you...

529
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,740
About your next trial...

530
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,870
You can handle that yourself.

531
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,980
Find out if Jae In is doing okay.

532
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,480
I've recently had
a few nightmares...

533
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,810
and had trouble sleeping.

534
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,120
Okay.

535
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,560
Bo Ram, you're a good artist.

536
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,360
She keeps bothering me.

537
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
What is it?

538
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,770
Is something on your mind?

539
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,800
Here.

540
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,540
It's nothing serious.

541
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,770
There was this young lady
I somehow got to know.

542
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,210
I kept missing her
and couldn't return the money...

543
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,410
she paid for the group order,

544
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,780
so she kept staying on my mind.

545
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,120
She reminded me of Do Hee, too.

546
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,890
She'll need the money back,

547
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,390
so I'm sure she'll reach out.

548
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,830
Fire!

549
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,190
There's a fire!

550
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,560
- What?
- Fire!

551
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,930
There's a fire!

552
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,270
What's wrong with the house?

553
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,940
What do you mean?

554
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,440
Jae In, how long
will you be out of it?

555
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,610
What? Me?

556
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:14,910
Yes.

557
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,210
I invited your aunt today,

558
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,050
so you said you wanted to cook,
and I let you do it.

559
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,320
But you almost
burnt the place down to the ground.

560
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,690
Excuse me.

561
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,960
My goodness. What do I do?

562
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,860
What's going on?

563
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,030
So, Jae In...

564
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,470
has been in an unstable condition,

565
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,170
and today, she forgot...

566
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,170
she left something on the stove
and almost caused a fire?

567
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,770
Goodness, Ms. Kang.

568
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,410
I feel so bad for her.

569
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,850
Jae In isn't herself these days.

570
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,750
Jae In.

571
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,260
Are you sure you're okay?

572
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,390
I'm not sure.

573
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,400
I don't remember
putting anything on the stove.

574
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,670
Actually, I didn't even know...

575
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,630
you were going to come.

576
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,470
What's with me?

577
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,740
Hey, you've met him
at our wedding, right?

578
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,010
He was my junior prosecutor,

579
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,980
who now opened an office
and became a big-shot attorney.

580
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,850
Why is an attorney here?

581
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,920
Well,

582
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,620
I also felt anxious
and uneasy about your condition,

583
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,190
so I couldn't take it anymore.

584
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,330
You can read this and sign it.

585
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,210
"Adult Guardian Application?"

586
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,180
It's nothing difficult.

587
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,010
Your father passed away,
and your mother is in prison now,

588
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,520
so you know
there are lots of things to handle.

589
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,220
You haven't been
in good condition lately,

590
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,120
so you're entrusting someone trustworthy
with your rights.

591
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,660
And I'll be that guardian.

592
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,330
You can call this off anytime...

593
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,000
as soon as your condition
gets better.

594
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,630
Do you understand?

595
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,240
Okay.

596
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,480
Thanks.

597
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,980
Please sign this part and this part.

598
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,250
(I, Kang Jae In, had been diagnosed
with schizophrenia.)

599
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,550
(I have lost my ability
to make sound decisions...)

600
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,690
(Requested by: Kang Jae In)

601
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,060
And here.

602
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,830
Right here.

603
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,150
Who are you?

604
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,580
Who are you?

605
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,420
Honey, you need to stop them.

606
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,720
Honey!

607
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,820
I'm doing this all for you.

608
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,860
Honey.

609
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,090
Who are you?

610
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,930
Honey, please, help me!

611
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,060
Honey!

612
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,300
Let go of me. Let go!

613
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,070
Honey!

614
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,470
Eun Ho!

615
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,510
Mother!

616
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,040
Yu Gyeong!

617
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,340
Let go!

618
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,750
Let go of me!

619
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,680
Honey!

620
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,090
(Queen's House)

621
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,960
Grandma, where's my mommy?

622
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,900
Where's the hospital?

623
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,200
The doctor said it'd be better...

624
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,240
- if she didn't accept visitors.
- Please!

625
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,400
- Please open the door!
- It'd be harder to treat her...

626
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,610
if she sees her old family
because they'll bring back...

627
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,640
those painful memories.

628
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,550
Honey, I'm completely fine!

629
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,110
The first mistake you made was...

630
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,250
marrying me.
