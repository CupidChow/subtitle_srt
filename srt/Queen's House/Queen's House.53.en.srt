1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,170
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,780
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,810
- Like this?
- Yes.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,880
It's going to fall over!

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,120
You're back.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,690
- You're home.
- Hey, there.

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,390
Where's Jae In?

9
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,790
She's running late today.

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,890
What's this?

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,790
It was in front of the gate.

12
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,730
It must be for us,
but I don't see an address.

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,200
What is it, Bo Ram?

14
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,640
I'm thirsty.

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,970
Is that so? I'll go with you.

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,520
(Kang Jae In is the daughter
of Kim Do Hee's murderer!)

17
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,190
Were you thirsty?

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,590
Was there anything inside?

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,890
No, it was an empty box.

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,860
Someone must've thrown it away
in front of our place while passing.

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,570
It's really empty.

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,000
That's odd.

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,340
Is someone pulling a prank on us?

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,770
I doubt that.
Someone probably threw it away.

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,340
But it was sealed with tape.

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,080
Grandma, maybe someone forgot
to put something inside.

27
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,450
Is that so?

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,220
Anyway, whatever.

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,550
Bo Ram, do you want
to take a bath with me?

30
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,090
- It's a hot day.
- Okay.

31
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,990
Grandma, may I put on
my swimsuit to take a bath?

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,490
Yes, of course.

33
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,130
You should take her
to a swimming pool on your day off.

34
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,660
Yes, I'll do that.

35
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,730
All right!

36
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,540
Did you send it
to the address I wanted?

37
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,140
Of course.
I saw the lady of that house...

38
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,610
take the box inside, too.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,350
All right. I'll send money
for finishing the job.

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,520
You're so shameless.

41
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,460
You'd better keep the promise...

42
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,960
you made before the contest
unless you want to be humiliated.

43
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,380
(Kang Jae In is the daughter
of Kim Do Hee's murderer!)

44
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,380
You got smart with me,

45
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,520
thinking you were still
YL's daughter,

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,090
but you need to know your place.

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,720
Jae In,
you'll learn a good lesson today.

48
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,970
What's wrong?
Do you have a stomachache?

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,230
It's probably stress.

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,800
Do we have medicine at home?

51
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,200
Do we have stomach medicine?

52
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,940
No, we don't.

53
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,010
Are you in a lot of pain?

54
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,180
Should I get some medicine?

55
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,710
No, I'm fine.

56
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,320
Why didn't you keep
some first aid at home?

57
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,050
His ex-wife...

58
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,720
always had things prepared
before I told her to do so.

59
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,390
Don't be good to him in just words.
Show it with your actions.

60
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,660
I'll do my best.

61
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,690
Why are you sitting here?

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,330
I want to hang out with you.

63
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,030
Do you want to play cards?

64
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,870
You're so low.

65
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,900
Are you that slow?

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,910
I told you to be good to him
through your actions.

67
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,740
What do you want me to do?

68
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,210
Why are you sitting there
while Gi Chan has a stomachache?

69
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,450
Run to the pharmacy right now!

70
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,680
Okay. I'll go.

71
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,750
You know, Mother.
You seem really old-fashioned.

72
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,730
What's she saying?

73
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,430
Old-fashioned?

74
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,000
It probably means something good.

75
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,820
Why won't you leave?

76
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,420
Hey, Mr. Kang Seung Woo.
Why aren't you going home?

77
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,060
I don't have a place to go.

78
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,400
My sister isn't around.
Relax and come in.

79
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,010
Why did he come here?

80
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,570
Did he know about this place?

81
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,540
He must've stopped by in passing,

82
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,440
and it didn't seem like
he knew about it.

83
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,280
He seemed alarmed
when he saw my sister.

84
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,880
They ran into each other?

85
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,980
She runs this place,
so yes, of course.

86
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,220
She welcomed him as a customer
and said nothing else.

87
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,060
He had a hard time when he found out
she was Ms. Kim Do Hee's mother.

88
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,390
They met when she came
to the office last time.

89
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,930
My sister told me about that.

90
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,800
He seemed to have a humane side,

91
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,140
unlike everyone else
in the Kang family.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
He's a soft-hearted and nice kid.

93
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,710
If you didn't say anything
about Ms. Kim Do Hee,

94
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,310
please keep it that way.

95
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,510
Seung Woo. Seung Woo?

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
Why are you here?

97
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,190
Did you call her here?

98
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,000
Your phone rang,

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,630
but you wouldn't wake up,
so I picked it up.

100
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,670
Let's go home, Seung Woo.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,640
What are you doing, Mr. Kang?

102
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,840
You must be an awful drunk.

103
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,670
Do not act like this to your elder,
no matter how drunk you are.

104
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,210
That's enough, Mr. Jung.
This isn't your place.

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,150
Seung Woo, let's go home and...

106
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,050
Stop saying my name!

107
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,780
I said I hated that!

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,290
I hate it!

109
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,090
Seung Woo.

110
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,590
Let go of me! What are you doing?

111
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,120
What can you do by following him?

112
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,690
He's not a kid.

113
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,700
I don't know what this is about,
but give him time.

114
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,260
You don't know anything.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,070
Mind your own business.

116
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,800
Seung Woo!

117
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,400
Look at her temper.

118
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,580
A stranger may see them
and think he is her son.

119
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,680
I'm home.

120
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,050
We need to talk.

121
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,100
Nothing was written on the box?

122
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,260
No, nothing at all.

123
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,000
What's this?

124
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,940
Was this delivered here?

125
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,910
Yes, it was left
in front of the door.

126
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,240
Isn't it yours?

127
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,780
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

128
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,810
(I hope this helps
with the investigation.)

129
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,290
Actually, I've received
an anonymous box before.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,100
When?

131
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,300
At the time
of Do Hee's hit-and-run accident.

132
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,270
The CCTV on the site was outdated,

133
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,370
and it broke down in heavy rain
after getting struck by lightning,

134
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,970
so the police
couldn't find the culprit.

135
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,470
That was when...

136
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,570
I found the box with
the dash cam in front of my place.

137
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,240
Was that the dash cam
that caught the accident?

138
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,220
I wouldn't have known...

140
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,890
your mother was the culprit
without that dash cam footage.

141
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,660
I thought an anonymous person
sent that to reveal the truth,

142
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,200
but it seems weird.

143
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,170
It may just be a déjà vu,
but the situations seem similar.

144
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,140
This time,

145
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,310
the person is kindly telling us that
you're Choi Ja Young's daughter.

146
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,710
It might be a coincidence.

147
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,050
I'm not sure. I don't think
the intention is clear.

148
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,220
I don't know
about what happened then,

149
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,790
but this one is
clearly targeting me.

150
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,690
This person must've known
I was staying here and sent that.

151
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,690
I don't know who it is,

152
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,490
but not a lot of people
hold animosity against me.

153
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,730
It must be one of them.

154
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,100
You should be more careful
from now on.

155
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,540
I'll do that.

156
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,410
All of you treated me like
I was a parasite,

157
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,850
but in reality, you all were
parasites to Yu Gyeong, too.

158
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,050
Why are you mentioning
your ex-wife's name this early...

159
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,920
and ruining my appetite?

160
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,890
Mom, let's get the facts straight.

161
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,760
Why do you think
your appetite is ruined?

162
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,960
You loved to eat breakfast...

163
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,670
every single morning
whenever Yu Gyeong cooked.

164
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,470
We hired someone
to just make dinner now,

165
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,400
so we're all picking on our food
when we eat breakfast. No?

166
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,180
Gi Man, everyone eats
such a simple breakfast overseas.

167
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,510
Se Ri, do you think
everything foreign is great?

168
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,310
We're in Korea, not there.

169
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,180
- Enjoy your food, Ji Ho.
- Okay.

170
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,150
All right, Ji Ho.

171
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,920
It's salad, your favorite food.
Why don't you have a bite?

172
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Here. Try some.

173
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,830
- Eat up, Ji Ho.
- Okay.

174
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,400
Look at you. You aren't even picky.

175
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,940
Come in and take a look.

176
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,510
The pig's feet place is
completely gone.

177
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,650
It looks rather empty
without the products, right?

178
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,690
This place was available for lease,
so I took it right away.

179
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,730
Dad, I hope
you didn't spend too much on this.

180
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,460
I can do this much for you.

181
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,500
The previous renters...

182
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,400
suddenly had to leave
with time left on their lease.

183
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,440
The owner cut down the deposit,

184
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,940
so I got a great deal.

185
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,940
I've never done something like this,
so I'm not sure if I'll do well.

186
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm not telling you
to do everything alone.

187
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,650
I'll be here to help
when I'm not at work.

188
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,090
My workplace is
right across the hall,

189
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,690
so I'll come by whenever I'm free.

190
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,060
You can try something new...

191
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,330
and meet new people
in a new environment.

192
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,660
Then, your mind and heart
will become refreshed,

193
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,200
ready to take in new things.

194
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,940
Okay. Thank you, Dad.

195
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,840
There's no pressure.

196
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,010
You can always go back to
being a doctor if you want.

197
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,710
I can...

198
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,110
always take over and run the place
if you want to quit. Okay?

199
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,250
Okay.

200
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,490
Did I take my medicine this morning?

201
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,230
I think I did.

202
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,300
It's probably better
to take another one just in case.

203
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,840
Do you feel unwell?

204
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,040
No, why?

205
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,540
You were taking medicine.

206
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,280
It's a health supplement.

207
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,380
Health supplement pills are a must
for people our age.

208
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,680
Right? I have to take some,
but I keep forgetting.

209
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,690
Can you recommend something
that worked best?

210
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,890
Vitamin C, calcium...

211
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,860
Vitamin C, calcium...

212
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,630
Vitamin C, calcium, and?

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,070
Isn't your son a doctor?

214
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,240
You should ask him.
Why are you asking me?

215
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,980
I'm in a foul mood, so I'm leaving.

216
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,550
Why is she suddenly so mad?

217
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,320
Did something bad happen?

218
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,660
Seung Woo.

219
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,770
Thank you for reaching out.

220
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,700
I was worried.

221
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,340
I have to tell you something.

222
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,970
I thought you should know, too.

223
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,550
Don't be alarmed.

224
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,450
Well...

225
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,620
My birth mother was...

226
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,820
Aunt Mi Ran.

227
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,730
She gave birth to me.

228
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,600
I know.

229
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,230
You know?

230
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,570
You knew?

231
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,340
Since when?

232
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,740
It was around the time
Eun Ho passed away.

233
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,950
Aunt Mi Ran told me.

234
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,180
Why didn't you say anything?

235
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,320
She said she'd tell you herself.

236
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,190
I thought that was...

237
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,590
the right thing to do
in her situation,

238
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,330
so I couldn't tell you.

239
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,930
You must've had a good laugh.

240
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,170
I went around...

241
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,470
claiming I was YL's owner,
although I was undeserving,

242
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,510
and harassed you.

243
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,010
You should've just told me.

244
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,750
If you had...

245
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,320
- If you had...
- Nothing has changed.

246
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,620
You're still my younger brother.

247
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,430
I still feel the same way about you.

248
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,830
How can you feel the same way?

249
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,860
I'm not your brother.

250
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,770
How am I going to face you now?

251
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,240
- I...
- We spent 27 years...

252
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,140
growing up together
under the same roof.

253
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,780
So, how are you
not my younger brother?

254
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,280
You are my brother.

255
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,710
Mom didn't say that.

256
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,650
She said
she never considered me her son.

257
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,220
Who's my son?

258
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,160
I never gave birth
to a son like you.

259
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,730
You were the one
who tortured me for life.

260
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,430
Do you get it?

261
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,530
She was right.

262
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,840
I was the one who tortured her.

263
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,840
If it hadn't been for me...

264
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,210
It's not your fault.

265
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,640
She just feels like a victim.

266
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,010
I can kind of understand
why Dad made this decision,

267
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,850
but if he had told her,

268
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,820
he could've stopped
this misfortune from breaking out.

269
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,990
What I'm trying to say is...

270
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,890
that it's not on you.

271
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,460
Do you really think so?

272
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,760
So, I'm not at fault?

273
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,840
I'll need more time,

274
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,410
but I'll bring everything back
to its place.

275
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,370
Going to work...

276
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,640
is what you can do right now.

277
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,410
I want my brother
to be more responsible.

278
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,920
Have you talked...

279
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,830
to Aunt Mi Ran?

280
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,300
I just wanted to make sure
that you knew.

281
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,700
I have nothing more to say.

282
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,770
Bye.

283
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,670
Seung Woo. Seung Woo!

284
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,720
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

285
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,850
What do you want?

286
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,550
Feel free to talk to him.

287
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,560
Do you want me to do it?

288
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,290
Gi Chan, I need you
to pay my debt back.

289
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,660
As you know, I have awful luck.

290
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,170
I borrowed money from him
and invested, but everything fell.

291
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,500
You're a rich guy.

292
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,440
You said
this company was as good as yours.

293
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,910
It's not even a drop in the ocean...

294
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,810
No, not even a drop in the universe.

295
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,140
It's not even much.

296
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,680
What's the principal again?

297
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,250
He borrowed 480,000 dollars,
and as for the interest... You know.

298
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,250
Yes, right. The interest.

299
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,420
He said he'd double the interest
when I failed to pay it.

300
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,620
So, it became twice as much,
four times,

301
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,760
eight times, and sixteen times...

302
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,390
What do you think you're doing?

303
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,890
What are brothers for?

304
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,430
Wouldn't it be great to help
each other when times are tough?

305
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:36,470
Think about the meals my wife made
for you while she was with us.

306
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,870
She was in charge of all chores,

307
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,610
including cooking,
cleaning, and doing the laundry.

308
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,710
You know that, right?

309
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,780
Yes.

310
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,850
I let him borrow
such a big amount of money...

311
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,350
because I considered you
to be his guarantor.

312
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,380
Here.

313
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,020
It's a great honor to know
that you'll pay back his debt.

314
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,360
You must've scammed him
with a high interest...

315
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,430
by using the money I gave you.

316
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,030
Take the principal and get lost.

317
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,500
Or you can rot in prison
as the mastermind...

318
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,900
behind the kidnapping
and the hit-and-run case.

319
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,540
I'm sorry, sir.

320
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,570
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,940
I must've lost my mind
because of money.

322
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,710
You're my VVIP client.

323
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,820
I'm worth nothing
if not for my loyalty.

324
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,050
Loyalty!

325
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,290
I'll back down.

326
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,920
The VVIP client? Loyalty?

327
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,820
I'll give you the principal,
so send me your bank account.

328
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,230
Get out of here now.

329
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,660
Yes, sir. Thank you.

330
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,300
You have my loyalty.

331
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,630
Have you been working with him, too?

332
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,030
What's this
about the hit-and-run case?

333
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,810
For the record,
this is the last time.

334
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,750
If you make a scene again,
I'll disown you first...

335
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,580
before Mom does. Got it?

336
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,720
Goodness. Yes, sir.

337
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,420
Did you think I'd be like that?

338
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,320
You're so ignorant.

339
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,090
Did you say you'd disown me?

340
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,200
You can't.
That's legally impossible.

341
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,630
Get lost!

342
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,360
Get out of my face now.

343
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
What? Get lost?

344
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,940
Just get out!

345
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,680
I'll go see my mom
after the meeting at the showroom.

346
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,550
She's at Yu Gyeong's place, and
I haven't paid too much attention.

347
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,520
All right.

348
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,430
What's going on?

349
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,930
He received that box,
but nothing changed?

350
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,710
What is it?

351
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,710
Have some coffee while you work.
You must be tired.

352
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,980
Patrick Jung just called.

353
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,210
He pressured me to fire you.

354
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,890
I even gave you a hint.
What's taking you so long?

355
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,920
Give me some more time.

356
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,960
They could get suspicious
if I made a move right away,

357
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,390
so I've been treading carefully.

358
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,930
Anyway, did you know Kang Seung Woo
hasn't been coming to work lately?

359
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,860
Isn't it weird?

360
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,230
Not only did he
suddenly stop coming,

361
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,430
but both Jae In and Director Kang
seemed concerned.

362
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,200
Something we don't know
must be going on.

363
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,780
She's staying
at Director Do Min Jun's place?

364
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,210
Yes, I believe so.

365
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,650
You may leave.

366
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,490
What is it? You came here
instead of summoning me.

367
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,600
I stopped by in passing,
but I didn't see Mr. Kang here.

368
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,260
Is he out working?

369
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,230
Team Leader Kang
must've told you something.

370
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,170
He's on leave.

371
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,270
Nothing's going on
with my brother-in-law, right?

372
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,340
I was just worried.

373
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,710
If you need someone to talk to,
you can talk to me.

374
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,680
You should show respect
for Team Leader Kang...

375
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,850
and refrain from calling him
your brother-in-law.

376
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,060
Thank you for your concern,
but nothing is going on.

377
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,520
If you have
nothing more important to say,

378
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,590
I must leave to do business
outside of the office.

379
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,530
You should go.

380
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,970
She asked where
Director Choi Ja Young was staying?

381
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,540
Anything else?

382
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,740
All right.

383
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,110
Why did she suddenly ask
about Director Choi Ja Young?

384
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,990
Why are you here?

385
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,990
Director Do isn't here.

386
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,790
I came to see you. Have a seat.

387
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,770
It won't take long,

388
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,100
but I shouldn't say it standing up.

389
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,610
I'm going to put Seung Woo
under my family registrar,

390
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,240
and that's the consent form.
Please sign it.

391
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,890
Signing that won't bring
your dead brother back.

392
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,250
Removing him
from my family registrar...

393
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,490
won't automatically remove
the pain, anger,

394
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,130
humiliation, and devastation...

395
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,900
I felt as I raised him
from my memories.

396
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,270
Everything happened
over 27 long years.

397
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,400
Do you think something like this is
enough to compensate...

398
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,740
for 27 years of my life?

399
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,510
It's not even close.

400
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,640
Stop pretending like
you're the victim.

401
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,780
Then, what about Seung Woo?

402
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,950
He was sacrificed...

403
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,720
by your false love for 27 years.

404
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,850
If that wasn't enough,

405
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,890
you even tried to frame him
for your murder.

406
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,790
What you did to him won't
automatically disappear, either.

407
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,730
Will it automatically erase
what you did to Ms. Kim Do Hee, too?

408
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,630
It wasn't my fault.

409
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,800
Everything is on you and Gyu Cheol.

410
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,810
I have nothing more to say. Goodbye.

411
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,940
I didn't ruin my family. It was you.

412
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,240
It was all your fault!

413
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,350
Who's going to be responsible
for all the pain Seung Woo...

414
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,610
had to go through?

415
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:30,920
Mom!

416
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,990
Are you okay?

417
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,930
Aunt Mi Ran,
what do you think you're doing?

418
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,660
I didn't do anything.

419
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,000
I came to have her...

420
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,230
sign the consent form to put
Seung Woo under my family registrar.

421
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,200
But she refuses unreasonably,
so you should ask her.

422
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,670
I guess
you want to act like his mom now.

423
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,440
Hate him or love him,
the fact is that I raised him.

424
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,010
I resented Seung Woo because
I thought he was a love child.

425
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,080
But now, I know that isn't the case.

426
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:02,490
I plan to continue raising him
as my precious son.

427
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,190
That's crazy.

428
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,990
You can't do that!

429
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,060
Seung Woo is my son!

430
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,560
You already know who he means
when he calls someone his mom.

431
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,800
To him, I'm the mother, not you!

432
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,990
I met with Seung Woo
in the afternoon.

433
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,020
Did you? Where is he staying?

434
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,630
He seemed greatly shocked to know
Aunt Mi Ran was his mother.

435
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,830
You should meet him
and explain the situation.

436
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,430
- Explain what?
- He's refusing to see Aunt Mi Ran.

437
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,740
That's great news.

438
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,910
Jae In, it's finally time
for you to stay on high alert.

439
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,180
Don't let Aunt Mi Ran
take Seung Woo.

440
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,710
Do you understand?

441
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,210
Mom.

442
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,850
I thought you were
worried about him.

443
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,480
I'm more worried about you than him.

444
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,560
I only want to keep him
under my family registrar for you.

445
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,460
If he becomes Mi Ran's son,

446
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,960
it means
she'll take the company, too.

447
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,900
Does that make sense?

448
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,800
Do not let that happen.

449
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,800
He's a soft-hearted kid,

450
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,570
so he may hand over the company
to you if you're nice ot him.

451
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,170
That's what you need to do.

452
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,170
If you can't do that, I will.

453
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,580
Mom, Seung Woo is my brother.

454
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,410
But I don't want to assume that
kind of attitude when I see him.

455
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,010
- You...
- Enough.

456
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,550
I don't want to be disappointed
in you anymore, so please stop.

457
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,100
- Is Bo Ram asleep?
- Yes.

458
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,900
She wanted to read a book
with Jae In when she came home,

459
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,070
but she ended up falling asleep.

460
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Jae In had to be somewhere,
so she said she'd be late.

461
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,180
I see.

462
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,650
"Have you received the box?"

463
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,880
Who is this?

464
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,520
Did someone text you?

465
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,990
Let me see that.

466
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,890
Yes, I don't know this number.
Did they have the wrong number?

467
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,060
(Have you received the box?)

468
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,030
(Kang Jae In is the daughter
of Kim Do Hee's murderer.)

469
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Was that another message?

470
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,840
It's a spam message.
I heard it was...

471
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,180
dangerous to get messages
from unknown numbers.

472
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,810
Let me block it for you.

473
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,010
I'm home.

474
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,650
Hey, there.
Did you have another great day?

475
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,850
Do you want a cup of tea
to relieve your stress?

476
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,590
That sounds wonderful.

477
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,920
I'll prepare the tea.

478
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,160
No, I'll do it.

479
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,860
You should get changed first.

480
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,470
Hey, can I talk to you?

481
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,610
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

482
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,480
Please check and try again.

483
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,680
The number doesn't exist.

484
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,480
I think the number was forged
like spam messages usually do.

485
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,090
The first message asked
if she received the box,

486
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,790
so it has to be
the same person, right?

487
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,920
That text message
reminded me of something.

488
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,360
At the time of Do Hee's accident,

489
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,990
the dash cam footage
wasn't the only thing I got.

490
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,700
This is the driver
who killed your sister...

491
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,370
and her daughter.

492
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,680
I received a photo
and a text message that showed...

493
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,040
you were
Director Choi Ja Young's daughter.

494
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,820
(Restricted Number)

495
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,790
Hello?

496
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,890
Hello.

497
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,890
Did you receive
the photos I sent you last time?

498
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,660
Who's calling?

499
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,260
Isn't it your priority
to find out...

500
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,070
why your sister, Kim Do Hee, died,
more than my identity?

501
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,700
Don't you want to know...

502
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,770
the reason your sister died?

503
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,510
And someone even called
with a distorted voice.

504
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,210
We're now sure I'm the target
of everything that's happening.

505
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
I think someone is trying
to come between my family and you.

506
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,820
If either Gi Chan
or Se Ri is behind this,

507
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,320
they must've found out...

508
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,790
I lived in the same house
with people of DH Holdings.

509
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,030
They'll want to break my wings
and make me fall.

510
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,560
Don't worry.

511
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,770
I won't let you fall alone.

512
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,390
So, if I use this,

513
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,550
it'll help
with my blood circulation, right?

514
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,860
Yes, it has a thermal feature,
so it's good for sore muscles,

515
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,800
and it helps with blood circulation
to help you feel more energetic.

516
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,470
Gosh, this feels so nice.

517
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,810
That was so warm and nice.

518
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,010
It melted away all my muscle pain.

519
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,250
Anyway, I came to celebrate
your grand opening.

520
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,250
I hope I wasn't a big nuisance.

521
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,020
No, you were my first customer.

522
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,190
I'm happy to have you.

523
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,160
Your father told me...

524
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,030
you and Do Yun worked
at the same hospital.

525
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,730
Yes, that's right.

526
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,570
How do you know Dr. Kim?

527
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,740
Goodness, I forgot to mention
the most important thing.

528
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,540
He's my son.

529
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,380
We're neighbors now, so you can
come by often to eat with us.

530
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,150
Take your time to talk to her
before you come.

531
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,720
- Bye.
- Yes, goodbye.

532
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,960
Thank you.

533
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,760
Dad, did you know
she was Do Yun's mother?

534
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,800
How can Jae In's mom work there?

535
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,830
At first, I had no idea.

536
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,870
That was why I got Ms. Choi
to work there.

537
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,870
I've been wondering
what I can say to make her quit.

538
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,440
You should ask her to quit
as soon as possible.

539
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,210
Have you told Jae In?

540
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,580
I didn't want to add more stress,
so I couldn't tell her.

541
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,020
I'll handle this as soon as I can,
so don't worry too much.

542
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,620
Okay.

543
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,440
Welcome...

544
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:02,710
Hello.

545
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,440
No, you should leave.

546
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,710
I don't want to see you.

547
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,750
There's something I must tell you.

548
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,410
What do you have to say?

549
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,680
I have nothing to hear from you.

550
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,120
Do you know who Kang Jae In is?

551
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,660
I have something to tell you
about Kang Jae In.

552
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,360
I heard she has been staying
at your place.

553
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,830
Why do you care
if she's there or not?

554
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,630
- You need to leave.
- She's my niece.

555
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,610
Let me be more precise.

556
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,210
You know Director Choi Ja Young,
the woman who killed Ms. Kim, right?

557
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,980
Choi Ja Young, my brother's ex-wife,
had an only daughter with him,

558
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,120
and she's Kang Jae In.

559
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,230
(Queen's House)

560
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,270
Isn't this enough to bring damage
to YL's chairman, Hwang Gi Chan?

561
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,700
What do you think?

562
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,510
Are you really the Jae In I know?

563
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,180
You're becoming slier as days go by.

564
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,110
This is so hard.

565
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,850
Is this all your love is worth?

566
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,550
I'll protect myself.

567
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,620
You'll only get in my way
with that kind of petty talent.

568
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,360
It took everything I had
to get to this place.

569
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,560
What's your mother's name?

570
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,260
Choi Ja Young.
Is her name Choi Ja Young?

571
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,270
No, Mom!

572
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,230
Do Hee...

573
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,970
I'm so sorry.

574
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,270
Why do you feel so frustrated?

575
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,340
My daughter passed away.

576
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,010
Then, someone who was
as lovely and nice...

577
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,050
as my daughter came into my life.

578
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,210
But she turned out to be...

579
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,380
the daughter of the woman
who killed my daughter.
