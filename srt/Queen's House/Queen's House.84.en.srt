1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,070
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,850
(Episode 84)

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,750
YDB International?

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,620
Isn't it the new investment company
that's been investing aggressively...

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,520
in order to grow their business?

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,790
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,630
One of my acquaintances
works there as a secretary,

10
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,730
so I asked just in case,

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,130
and they wanted to go ahead
and invest in us.

12
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,670
YDB International
should be big enough...

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,600
to minimize damage
when I kick out DH Holdings.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,880
Schedule a meeting to sign
the contract as soon as possible.

15
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,710
I'll do that, sir.

16
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,150
I also have the report you wanted...

17
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,550
regarding the businesses
DH Holdings has invested in.

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,470
- Is this true?
- Yes, sir.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,670
I found evidence that
they had been leaking...

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,410
confidential information and
new technology from their investees.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,120
(Director Kim Do Yun)

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,400
I request full cancellation...

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,630
of our contract with DH Holdings.

24
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,270
Can you take responsibility
for what you just said?

25
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,540
Stop acting like
you're holier-than-thou.

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,240
I know it's hypocrisy
and pretentiousness.

27
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,040
Have some manners when you speak.

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,410
I confirmed that DH Holdings...

29
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,550
has been leaking confidential information
from your investees.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,750
You'd sign a contract
to invest in small businesses,

31
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,020
only to make a dirty move
by leaking out and selling...

32
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,460
the new technologies
those businesses had.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,990
What are you talking about?

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,430
Mr. Jung, this isn't true, is it?

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,260
Well...

36
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,100
We're terminating this contract
because you violated our trust,

37
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,440
so you know we won't have to pay
any penalties, right?

38
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,780
I understand what you mean,
Chairman Hwang.

39
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,050
But you also know
contract termination...

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,680
can't happen instantly
with just one word.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,220
We must look into the situation
and figure this out first,

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,120
so please leave.

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,590
YL Group will sign a contract
with a new investor very soon.

44
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,300
You'd better get a grasp
of the situation before then.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,570
But this isn't going to change.

46
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,900
I won't be the one
who'll leave this business,

47
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,540
but DH Holdings.

48
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,980
He's beginning to feel triumphant
after finding our weakness.

49
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,920
He has no idea he's way behind.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,390
The person in charge
at our headquarters did this alone,

51
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,260
so we've been patching it up
after finding out first.

52
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,730
But in the end, it did happen.
Are you sure we'll be okay?

53
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,800
As soon as he found out
about our weakness,

54
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,800
he ran over
and announced a contract termination.

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,600
It means he'll go ahead and sign
with a new investor in a rush.

56
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,540
All we have to do in that while is
right what we did wrong...

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,580
and get ready to have Hwang Gi Chan
in the palm of our hands.

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,490
Hey, Sook Ja!

59
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,920
I always have time for you. Yes.

60
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,230
Should I come and pick you up?

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,670
Honey.

62
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,240
Get out.

63
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,370
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,240
You sound like a parrot.

65
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,180
I'm sick of hearing
the same thing from you.

66
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,310
Fine. I got Jung Hyeon Su
to work with me...

67
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,450
to kick out Jae In
from the business,

68
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,850
but I didn't do it for you.

69
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,990
It was because
your eyes kept going back to her.

70
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,960
I was afraid I'd lose you.

71
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,660
Don't deny it.

72
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,830
Your feelings have changed.

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,860
Isn't that so?

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,400
See? This was why.

75
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,110
Of course, I'd be furious
to hear my husband...

76
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,110
take his ex-wife's side.

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,310
I'm your wife.

78
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,880
You're having an affair right now.

79
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,710
You're the spouse at fault, not me!

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,450
Stop framing me like that.

81
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,150
This isn't going to justify
the crimes you've committed.

82
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,920
It's still too much for you
to ban me from coming home.

83
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,630
- Get out.
- Honey, please.

84
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,300
One last chance.

85
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,630
Give me just one last chance.

86
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,330
I can't live without you,

87
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,540
and I can do anything for you.
I mean it. Anything.

88
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,040
I told you to stop, Se Ri.

89
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,910
I'm getting fed up!

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,950
Get out.

91
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,320
Honey, please. I'm sorry.

92
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,490
It'd be faster if I left.

93
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,660
Honey.

94
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,040
In the end, Gi Chan
ended up playing the worst move.

95
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,710
He must be determined
to get rid of DH Holdings for good.

96
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,150
That wicked apple won't fall
too far from the tree.

97
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,090
Like mother, like son.

98
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,460
What do you mean?

99
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,630
You know that my father
passed away in a fire, right?

100
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,960
Yes, Ms. Jung told me on the day...

101
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,030
of his memorial service.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,270
Wait, was the fire caused by...

103
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,880
That's not all.

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,510
Noh Sook Ja was the one...

105
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,050
who took the payment
for my dad's life insurance.

106
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,450
How can she do that?

107
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,390
Does Ms. Jung know?

108
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,130
Yes. It wasn't something
we could hide.

109
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,430
It must've been shocking.

110
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,040
And it must've been
hard for you, too.

111
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,840
It almost got covered up,

112
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,810
so I felt relieved
to finally find out the truth,

113
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,110
but at the same time,
I also felt bad for my dad.

114
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,720
Even I feel like this,
so it must be worse for my mom.

115
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,020
Stay strong.

116
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,390
I will.

117
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,330
Noh Sook Ja and Hwang Gi Chan.

118
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,200
I'll never forgive them.

119
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Come on in.

120
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,340
Is anyone here?

121
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,440
They all went to work,
to the kindergarten,

122
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,340
and to get treated.

123
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,310
It's just the two of us.

124
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,210
So, it's just you and me, Sook Ja.

125
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,930
I got some brunch to enjoy with you.

126
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,870
Darn it.
It seemed like a great chance.

127
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,210
Sook Ja and I will make our castle

128
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,850
I want to live every day
Like it was a festival

129
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,650
Oh, my. You have a great voice.
Please continue.

130
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,920
I want to,

131
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,190
but I have to show you
where I'll build that castle.

132
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,620
Look. Do you see this mountain?

133
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,330
They'll construct a highway
right through this mountain.

134
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,700
Sook Ja, you know
this is a state secret, right?

135
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,230
There are only a few
who know about this.

136
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,000
You can't share this with anyone,
not your son or your daughter.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,300
It's a secret.

138
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,110
You've said it enough times.

139
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,340
I haven't told anyone.

140
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,810
I'm glad.

141
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,350
Anyone who hears about this
will try to jump on the bandwagon.

142
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,550
This is where
we'll build our house of love,

143
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,550
so I can't let random people
get their hands on this.

144
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,020
Give me the business card.
I'll buy the land now.

145
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,330
My gosh. I'll give it to you,

146
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,730
but please calm down.

147
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,200
You have to be careful
when you invest.

148
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,300
We're doing this for us,
for our future.

149
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,270
For us, for our future?

150
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,140
You gave me
the best kind of information...

151
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,880
and even became concerned
about investing with caution?

152
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,550
You can't make me
keep falling for you like this.

153
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,220
Gosh.

154
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,070
Why am I here?

155
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,740
Hey, it's Ms. Mi Sook!

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,410
I'm not Mi Sook. I'm Ja Young,

157
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,140
Choi Ja Young.

158
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,250
She's right.
She's also Ms. Ja Young.

159
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,850
All right.

160
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,060
Ms. Ja Young.
Let's play again today.

161
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,190
Gosh? That must've hurt.

162
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,130
Grandma, Ms. Ja Young is hurt.

163
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,800
Can we play after you treat her?

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All right. Let's go home.

165
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,470
We have a first aid kit
that Do Yun uses.

166
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,110
Okay.

167
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,310
Let's go.

168
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,760
Does it hurt a lot?

169
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,230
You must need
lots of care at this age.

170
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,930
I'm sorry.

171
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,770
I'm so sorry.

172
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,940
You're supposed to thank me...

173
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,540
instead of saying you're sorry.

174
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,410
Ta-da.

175
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,010
I drew you, my princess.

176
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,210
Next to you is the prince
who protects the princess,

177
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,780
and it's me.

178
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,550
Follow me.

179
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,560
Where are we going?

180
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,460
Are we getting ice cream?

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,430
What's going on?
Why did you come in here?

182
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,300
I never wanted
to set foot in here again.

183
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,800
You just walked in here yourself.
Stop making an excuse.

184
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,140
Then, get lost!

185
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,010
Keep your son under control
so that I never have to come...

186
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
into this dreadful house ever again.

187
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,380
What now?
Is that all you have to say?

188
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,980
No, I haven't even begun.

189
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,550
Don't let someone who isn't
in their right mind go out alone.

190
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,790
That's negligence,
and it's considered an abuse.

191
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,930
An abuse?

192
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,330
He comes to my store
every single day...

193
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,630
and waits for me.

194
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,070
If I report him,
he'll be punished for stalking.

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,570
Keep him around you at all times
if you don't want to see him...

196
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,470
get arrested.

197
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Things can happen
because he isn't in his right mind!

198
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,340
How dare you
treat him like a criminal?

199
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,850
Committing a crime
and claiming to be unfit...

200
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,480
won't undo that crime.

201
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:28,020
Stop being unreasonable
and keep him under control.

202
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,190
- Wait for me, Princess.
- Hey.

203
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,160
Why do you keep going there?

204
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,470
The wedding photo in circulation
had been Photoshopped?

205
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,900
Everything recently exposed
by Exposé World...

206
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,770
is true.

207
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,270
Even about your niece,
Ms. Kang Jae In?

208
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,680
You're right.
The one behind Exposé World...

209
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,410
is my real niece,
the real Kang Jae In.

210
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,390
I shamefully thought
exposing my family's weakness...

211
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,660
would put YL Group in danger.

212
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,060
So, I used protecting the business
as an excuse...

213
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,600
to make Kang Se Ri,
Chairman Hwang's current wife,

214
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
look like my actual niece...

215
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,870
and released
the Photoshopped picture.

216
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,610
I sent the original
of the untampered photo...

217
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,040
to your email,
so please check that later.

218
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,580
Just as Exposé World claimed,

219
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,680
was Ms. Kang Se Ri
Chairman Kang's other woman?

220
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,250
That's right. Ms. Kang Se Ri...

221
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,230
is an adulteress
who stole my niece's life.

222
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:46,330
Is there a special reason
why you decided to do this interview?

223
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,830
It's to restore the reputation
of my real niece,

224
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,700
Kang Jae In.

225
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,740
Some who have watched
Exposé World...

226
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,340
still believe everything was a lie.

227
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,250
So, I decided to step in
and correct the matter...

228
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,650
as the one who caused the confusion.

229
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,350
I'd like to use this chance...

230
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,660
to deeply apologize
to my niece, Kang Jae In,

231
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,560
for causing all this damage...

232
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,930
because of my short-sighted ideas.

233
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,280
Do you feel okay?

234
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,710
I feel much lighter.

235
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,580
They'll publish
the articles tomorrow.

236
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,080
It'll cause mayhem.

237
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,420
What is it?

238
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm glad you made
this tough decision.

239
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,190
Thanks.

240
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,360
I can't believe I lived long enough
for you to compliment me.

241
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,100
You haven't had dinner, right?

242
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,530
Let's eat something hearty.

243
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,110
I have to go somewhere
before we do that.

244
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,440
Can you take me there?

245
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,780
Thank you, Aunt Mi Ran.

246
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,350
Everything was my fault,
so I should be apologizing.

247
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,190
I did it hoping it would
bring out the truth.

248
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,420
I know. It will happen.

249
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,160
I've been realizing recently
that no secrets last forever.

250
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,800
I wanted to see her before I go,
but you said she was asleep.

251
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,300
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

252
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,270
Gi Chan and Se Ri
may make a huge scene,

253
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,440
so brace yourself.

254
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,110
Okay.

255
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,350
- Is she the woman?
- I think so.

256
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,080
It's her.

257
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,220
Na Ra!

258
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,320
Shut your mouth!

259
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,230
Don't even call my name.
You're such an embarrassment.

260
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,200
My family has always been a mess
ever since you married Gi Chan.

261
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,900
I think my ex-sister-in-law is
at least 100 times, no, 1,000 times,

262
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,870
no, even 10,000 times
better than you.

263
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,740
What is it?
Why are you annoying me this early?

264
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,640
Haven't you seen the news?

265
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,680
Have you lost your mind,
Director Kang?

266
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,380
We had a deal
before we released the photo.

267
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,550
How can you
betray me like this? How?

268
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,360
How dare you act up?

269
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,260
You must've become delusional...

270
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,700
because I associated with you
a few times.

271
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,100
You aren't equal to me.

272
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,240
You know Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
of YL Group is my husband!

273
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,010
My word is enough to get you fired!

274
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,380
Then, go ahead and try.

275
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,080
Know your place.

276
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,990
I wanted to drag you
to a desolate place...

277
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,190
and bury you alive,
but I had to hold myself back.

278
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,660
Don't you dare mess
with my niece, Jae In,

279
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,560
or her mother.

280
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,170
That'll be the last day you breathe.

281
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,500
Do you understand?

282
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,180
Is this security?

283
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,950
Wasn't Ms. Kang Se Ri fired?
Why aren't you doing your job?

284
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,250
Don't you know outsiders are
prohibited from entering?

285
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,220
Get her out now.

286
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,170
Did you confront my aunt...

287
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,530
to ask why she told the truth?

288
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,170
Stop smiling.

289
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,270
Se Ri, it doesn't matter
how hard you try.

290
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,870
You can't be me.

291
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,550
You barely managed
to mimic my life...

292
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,610
because you stole the things I had.

293
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,850
But everything slowly came to light
and showed they weren't yours,

294
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,220
and you became Kang Se Ri again.

295
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,130
One news article is
enough to make you Jae In or not.

296
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,190
Isn't that funny?

297
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,660
So what?

298
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,630
It means nothing that you had
was truly yours.

299
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,300
The name Kang Jae In,
your life as Gi Chan's wife,

300
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,840
and that house you live in.

301
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,240
That's proof you stole
everything that was mine.

302
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,450
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm Kang Jae In, too.

303
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,910
My name is also Kang Jae In!

304
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,720
I don't think I'm the only one
named Kang Jae In.

305
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,660
I'm sure everyone else is
living their lives diligently,

306
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,890
everyone except you.

307
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,530
If you wanted my life that badly,

308
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,000
you should've cultivated yours
instead of stealing mine.

309
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,500
You should've built your own castle
instead of envying mine.

310
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,140
That's how everyone lives...

311
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,170
except for you.

312
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,640
I'm not done yet.

313
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,750
Do you think I'll go down like this?

314
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,650
Not a chance.

315
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,800
Did you see the news?

316
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,030
Yes, and Aunt Mi Ran came yesterday
and told me ahead of time.

317
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,970
You should go inside.

318
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,080
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

319
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,720
What brings you here this early?

320
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,260
Do you have to say something?

321
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,490
No. Are you all right?

322
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,560
Why wouldn't I be?

323
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,470
I'm perfectly fine.

324
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,700
Okay, then.

325
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,800
Please excuse me.

326
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,510
Aunt Mi Ran.

327
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,770
Honey, what is this? Why am I fired?

328
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,300
Fire Director Kang Mi Ran now.

329
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,740
How can she hand out this
press release without telling us?

330
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,610
She had a deal with us!

331
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,540
This is betrayal.
She thought you were a joke!

332
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,550
Why won't you say anything?

333
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,850
Are you going to sit and watch this?

334
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,680
Do you have any idea
how humiliated I was just now?

335
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,050
Everything she said was a fact.
How am I going to fire her?

336
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,020
- Honey.
- Be quiet!

337
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,430
I'm about to sign a contract
with a new investment company.

338
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,560
It's a great chance
to kick out DH Holdings,

339
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,160
so stop acting up.

340
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,770
Do not do anything.
Do you understand?

341
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,340
I was beaten.

342
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,570
Director Kang Mi Ran hit me!

343
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,840
I just said
I was about to sign a contract.

344
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,410
Get out...

345
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,140
and stay quiet.

346
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,980
You got fired,
so don't show yourself at work.

347
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,520
At this moment,
I'm better off without you.

348
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,150
You're my biggest weakness!

349
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,400
You can't abandon me, Gi Chan.
Never.

350
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,770
Jae In, you must've thought
I'd go down that easily.

351
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,780
These are all for me?

352
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,150
I didn't want something bad
to happen again.

353
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,750
But there are so many of them.
I don't think they'll fit in my bag.

354
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,060
I hadn't thought of that.

355
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,690
Thank you.
I'll put one in every bag.

356
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,370
Right. Your mother said Kang Se Ri
asked about the slush fund...

357
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,100
when she was abducted by her, right?

358
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,870
Yes, Gi Chan had the notebook,
so they must've shared that.

359
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,810
I looked up the code
found in the notebook,

360
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,480
and it led me to my dad's account
in the Swiss Bank.

361
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,120
Gi Chan must've noticed
that the account was...

362
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,680
Dad's slush fund.

363
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,790
So, the last voice recording
and notes in the notebook...

364
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,960
must be hints
to the account's passcode,

365
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,260
and neither you nor Hwang Gi Chan
has found anything.

366
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,800
No.

367
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,100
On the one hand,
I'm glad he hid his account securely,

368
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,930
but on the other hand,

369
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm nervous
that they might get to it first.

370
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,410
If they were
unable to find anything,

371
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,210
I'm sure it's something
only you can recognize.

372
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,180
Don't worry too much.

373
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,120
Darn it. Gi Chan will get mad
if he finds out!

374
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,080
What's with all the noise?

375
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,990
You.

376
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,360
Where's my club?

377
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,860
Get out!

378
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,500
Get out!

379
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,230
Enough is enough, all of you!

380
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,030
Are you still out of your mind?

381
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,770
How dare you
yell at your mother-in-law?

382
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,710
Do you have any idea
what your son, Gi Chan, did?

383
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,010
Do you know who he really is?

384
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,640
What?

385
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,510
Follow me.

386
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,220
What were you about to say?

387
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,890
Gi Chan killed someone.

388
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,360
Don't be ridiculous.

389
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,960
I know that shaman took money from you
and talked nonsense.

390
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,900
I was angry enough
when I became suspicious...

391
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,230
of my precious son because of you.

392
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,030
What now? He killed someone?

393
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,230
You can't
just blurt out these things.

394
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,840
Do you know who he killed?

395
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,270
It was Ms. Kim Do Hee.

396
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,010
Gi Chan?

397
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,450
That's nonsense.

398
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,150
Choi Ja Young killed her!

399
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,780
You can't pull this on me!

400
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,850
She only made her scared,
then fled before she hit her.

401
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,120
Gi Chan was the actual culprit
who killed Ms. Kim.

402
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,890
He hit her with his car
and killed her!

403
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,960
Shut your mouth!

404
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,960
And how did I know?

405
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,730
I was in the car next to him.

406
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,810
Mother, what will happen to him
if I open my mouth?

407
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,340
I won't stay silent...

408
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,410
if you try to kick me out
of his life or this house.

409
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,620
I'll tell everyone and their mother.

410
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,290
I'm not going down alone.
I'll take everyone with me.

411
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,420
I was just a passenger,

412
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,190
so only Gi Chan would get punished.

413
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,830
So, all I have to do is
keep you around this house?

414
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,300
Yes.

415
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,540
Stay low and out of Gi Chan's eyes.

416
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,380
If you get caught and kicked out,
that's not on me.

417
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,940
What do you say?

418
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,410
I'll do that.

419
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,450
You're now with me.

420
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,220
Don't treat me
like a piece of garbage...

421
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,720
if you want to keep your son safe.

422
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,490
Fine.

423
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,830
Mother, to the fiery pit I go.

424
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,980
I made an official request
to Detective Wang Sik...

425
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,950
to reinvestigate Do Hee's case.

426
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,420
I heard.

427
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,450
Jae In's mother is still on trial,

428
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,050
so it can take a while.

429
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,660
Yes, so I'll gather the evidence
and send everything to him.

430
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,930
Does this mean
he can actually investigate?

431
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,660
Of course.

432
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,270
He's acquainted with Uncle Oh Seong,
so you can trust him.

433
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Yun Hee, have you been preparing
the thing I asked you to?

434
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,470
Yes, I've been doing it.

435
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,480
Have a seat and eat some breakfast.

436
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,650
My stomach hurts,
so I don't have an appetite.

437
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,350
Have you taken medicine?

438
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,560
Yes, and don't forget
to come to the office on time.

439
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,960
You said you'd sign
with a new investment company...

440
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,330
and say goodbye
to DH Holdings, right?

441
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,000
So, why do I have to go?

442
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,300
I don't know anything.

443
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,870
Their CEO is a woman,

444
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,610
and I hear she's your peer.

445
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,310
We decided to bring a family member
to strengthen our partnership,

446
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,650
so don't be nervous.

447
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,650
I have no one else to go with.

448
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,980
All right.

449
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,990
Also, if it's too hard
for you to look after Ji Ho,

450
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,760
you can find a new tutor.

451
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,760
All right. I'll manage.

452
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,960
See you at the office, then.

453
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,480
Why is he suddenly refusing
DH Holdings' investment?

454
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,150
I'm not sure if it's true
that Gi Chan was the one...

455
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,790
who did that to Oh Seong's niece.

456
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,990
I can never tell
if Se Ri is telling the truth.

457
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,160
Should I just ask?

458
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,560
Choi Ja Young's trial is
still going on,

459
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,330
so it'll only cause a ruckus
if I ask him now.

460
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,570
I'll kick out that sly girl
as soon as the trial is over.

461
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,980
I hope everything works out
so I can put everything behind me...

462
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,080
and live with my love, Oh Seong,
in our lovely home in the meadow.

463
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,620
He's not the only one
who can buy that land.

464
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,760
I have to have something...

465
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,630
to assert my opinions.

466
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,660
Hello?

467
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,670
Is this Number One Jackpot
Real Estate Office?

468
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,050
It must be a lot of work...

469
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,820
to share the model house design
even with us,

470
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,550
- the investment company.
- Not at all.

471
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,620
I also like working on this
with your feedback.

472
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,830
I would hardly call it feedback.

473
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,560
I love it all.

474
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,500
Great work.

475
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,380
Right.

476
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,760
You were here, too, Jae In.

477
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,130
I got a call from the realtor.
She took the bait.

478
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,660
It's about time
this side took the bait, too.

479
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,130
Let's go.

480
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,170
All right. Let's go and see...

481
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,240
the amazing and loaded
new investment company...

482
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,640
Chairman Hwang is meeting.

483
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,680
I escorted your mother
to the meeting room.

484
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,920
The investors will be here soon.
Let's go, Mr. Chairman.

485
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,290
All right.

486
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,720
Do you have the contract
we've reviewed?

487
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,960
Yes, sir.

488
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,660
Then, let's go.

489
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,170
You can relax.

490
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,310
We should hand over
what we've been doing.

491
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,250
We were also curious
about your next investor,

492
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,480
so we came as spectators.

493
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,880
Please don't mind us.

494
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,260
(Meeting Room)

495
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,400
(Queen's House)

496
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,830
Where are you, Yoon? Secretary Yoon!

497
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,230
Did you also accept a bribe,
Chairman Hwang?

498
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,640
What did you say?

499
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,940
Tell me now.

500
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,640
Who's your real wife?

501
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,510
It's not the case in Korea,
but in other countries,

502
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,980
such as parts of the Middle East
and Asia,

503
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,480
the government
still recognizes polygamy.

504
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,420
What did she say to blackmail you?

505
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,750
She said you killed Ms. Kim Do Hee.

506
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,260
A real person
named Catherine exists.

507
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,430
So, she has been using
a different person's identity?

508
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,730
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
