1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,110
Find out quietly
which realtor's office...

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,920
Jae In listed the house for sale.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,050
I need to buy it.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,850
Yes, I'll do that.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,230
That's all I have to say.
Call me when you find out.

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,760
- You may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,970
You got to work early.

11
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,100
I have to go out for work,

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,370
so call me
if anything urgent comes up.

13
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,100
Yes, Ms. Kang. I'll see you later.

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,680
Jae In listed the house for sale?

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,720
He was so stunning.

16
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,630
Mother.

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,360
My gosh. You need to knock.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,400
I got your favorite cakes.
Please have some.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,570
Put those away.
I'm trying to lose weight.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,010
Mother, I have
something to say to you.

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,310
I think this house is...

22
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,420
too crowded and tiny
for a huge family to live in.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,950
It's not easy
to ventilate the place,

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,150
and the air quality is rather poor.

25
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,020
Above all, it's a bit too humble
to call this a home...

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,560
for a chairman of a big corporation.

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,060
So? What's your point?

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,360
You gave birth
to your precious second son.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,530
Shouldn't you live
in a huge mansion...

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,970
where you can live elegantly...

31
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,840
just as you deserve?

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,900
That's true.

33
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,010
I guess I'm on the elegant side.

34
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,780
Precisely.

35
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,580
What kind of a house
would you like to live in?

36
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,250
I don't know.

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,050
Darn it.

38
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,790
Jae In's place was
the only mansion I had ever seen.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,160
How would I know?

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,030
For example, what do you think
about Jae In's place?

41
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,430
You don't even need to ask.

42
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,400
That place is as big as a castle,

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,530
and it shines
in all its luxurious glory.

44
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,870
It'd be great
to live in a place like that.

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,270
We'll move there soon.

46
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,040
Is this a joke?

47
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,550
The interior is rather classical.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,720
Should I have redecorated the place?

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,820
You bought this place?

50
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,850
Don't make me say it again.
Must I repeat myself?

51
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,790
Yes, I own this house,

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,760
so please leave my home.

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,000
- Oh, my.
- Mom, are you serious?

54
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,770
Is this our place now?

55
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,030
Are we going to live here?

56
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,900
Yes, I'm telling you.

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,740
My gosh.

58
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,340
I can't believe
a day like this has come.

59
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,540
Hey, pinch me right here.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,980
No, never mind.

61
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,980
- That hurts, Mom.
- So, this is real.

62
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,860
Hey, Jae In.

63
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,720
Hello.

64
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,430
This is why life is
full of surprises.

65
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,900
The old are gone,

66
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,600
and we, the new,
are here to live here from now on.

67
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,640
Get out of my home.

68
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm calling off the sale.

69
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,910
What now?

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,910
Don't worry, Mother.

71
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,780
I already paid off the balance.
You can't do that.

72
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,680
I don't plan on selling the place,

73
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,450
but if you want to take it back,
I may consider it if you give me...

74
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,690
three times, no,
five times more than what I paid.

75
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,260
Can you do that?

76
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,390
If you can't, get out of here.

77
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,960
Eun Ho will be here soon.
Do you want him to see you get kicked out?

78
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,870
I was too naive.

79
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,340
Everything my mom said
in high school was right.

80
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,440
Did you forget
where your mom ended up...

81
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,040
after living her life
neck-deep in elitism?

82
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,040
Se Ri.

83
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,180
Do you think you can become me
by doing something like this?

84
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,520
No, not at all.

85
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,450
No one can copy me.

86
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,560
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm Kang Jae In, too.

87
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,860
Sure, go ahead
and live in this house.

88
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,260
Then, you'll come
to a painful realization...

89
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,300
that you chose...

90
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,400
to get under my shadow
and live there...

91
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,600
and that you can't become me
just by stealing what you can see.

92
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,270
You and I are...

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,470
different by nature.

94
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,110
Don't be ridiculous!

95
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,880
I didn't copy anyone!

96
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,280
You should be ashamed of yourself
as a murderer's daughter!

97
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,390
You're scaring me, Se Ri.

98
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,560
I'm sorry, Mother.

99
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,500
I felt humiliated and lost my cool.

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,600
She has a knack
for making people feel...

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,900
very irritated.

102
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,300
What's important is
the result, anyway.

103
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,970
In the end, you won, Se Ri.

104
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,210
I feel much better
after hearing you say that.

105
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,750
You're the best, Se Ri.

106
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,490
I was shocked to hear
you were hospitalized.

107
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,260
Are you all right?

108
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,690
People say
misfortunes come in a series.

109
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,430
Too many things happened
in such a short period of time.

110
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,700
I'm doing my best...

111
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,830
to ride it out.

112
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,470
You should.

113
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,370
I wanted to see you today
to tell you something,

114
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,410
although I wasn't sure
if it'd be helpful.

115
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,910
Actually, just before
the chairman passed away,

116
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,250
he asked me to do something quietly.

117
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,480
My dad did that?

118
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,620
He asked me
to dig up dirt on Director Hwang.

119
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,630
That means you were framed
into leaving the company,

120
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,100
and Gi Chan was behind everything.

121
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,140
Have you found out anything...

122
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,670
about H and K Company?

123
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,540
I did come across some files
that were highly relevant.

124
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,080
Wait, did Gi Chan also...

125
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,150
He blackmailed me
by using Yu Gyeong,

126
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,980
so I couldn't do a thing with those.

127
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,550
After all, she's my only family.

128
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,090
I tried to get to those again,

129
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,560
but he must've handled everything.
It all looked spick and span.

130
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,800
There probably are other contracts,

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,870
but I couldn't find the whereabouts
of the woman named Catherine.

132
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,640
It seemed like
Ms. Kim must've found out something.

133
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,980
She worked for YL Group, right?

134
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,440
Do you have her contact information?

135
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,410
You probably know her. It was
Ms. Kim Do Hee of the Planning Team.

136
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,980
It was her.

137
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,990
Actually, Ms. Kim was
the first one...

138
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,790
who shared
Director Hwang's corruption with me.

139
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,630
What I wonder the most is
why Ms. Choi misunderstood...

140
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,400
the relationship
between her and Director Hwang.

141
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,140
I'll keep
looking into Catherine, too.

142
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,710
Feel free to talk to me
whenever you need help.

143
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,110
Thank you, Mr. Do.

144
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,510
I needed someone to seek advice.

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,980
A shareholders' meeting is
coming up very soon,

146
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,590
and the key agenda is
appointing the new chairperson.

147
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,190
There's a high chance
Gi Chan will get it,

148
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,590
but I want to run as a candidate.

149
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,290
Can you help me?

150
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,300
Yes, I should.

151
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,330
Hey, Do Yun.

152
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,000
Were you studying?

153
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,140
What?

154
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:48,040
Weren't you going to get licensed
as an investment manager?

155
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,010
I want to be licensed
as a financial advisor, too.

156
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,440
I'll try doing whatever I can.

157
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,680
It was just as I expected.
You've got the brains.

158
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,550
I was wondering
if you had a picture of her.

159
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,050
You know, YL's chairman's daughter.

160
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,320
Not yet.

161
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,990
But I don't have to meddle with her.
Her life is in ruins anyway.

162
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,990
What? How?

163
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,960
Her mother got locked up in prison,

164
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,560
her father died,

165
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,570
and her husband divorced her
and took all her assets.

166
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,340
Hey, that's awesome.
It's great news.

167
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,040
But it's not just her.

168
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,740
We'll have our true revenge
if we successfully destroy YL Group.

169
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,480
Their shareholders' meeting is
coming up soon.

170
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,320
Their top priority must be
appointing the new chairperson.

171
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,480
That must be the case.

172
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,190
I have some shares with YL Group.
So, what should I do?

173
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,060
Shouldn't we stop
the dead chairman's family...

174
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,260
from becoming the chairperson?

175
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,060
Come on out, Oh Seong.

176
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,230
Try this.

177
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,800
- I want to eat this first.
- Try this one, too.

178
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,200
Hey, what's up?

179
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,850
You have to get married
to settle down.

180
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,250
Doesn't she look nice?
She's a teacher at a kindergarten.

181
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,690
Stop it, Yun Hee. I'm too old...

182
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,550
to date a young woman like her.

183
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,720
She's not young.
She's either 41 or 42 years old.

184
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,130
And I can't marry a random person
just to settle down.

185
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,430
She's not a random person.
I'm telling you about her right now.

186
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,630
She works at a kindergarten,
and she's never been married.

187
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,470
I don't want to hear this.
That's enough.

188
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,770
Why not, Uncle Oh Seong?
She looks beautiful.

189
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,100
Cut it out. I'm not interested.

190
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,410
All these women mean nothing to me.

191
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,810
Are you still not over her?

192
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,280
What?

193
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,850
That woman.

194
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,880
The one who hurt you deeply.

195
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,450
Are you still not over her?

196
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,250
Come on, Yun Hee!
That's ancient history.

197
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,850
I don't even remember who that was.

198
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,890
Anyway, I'll manage my own business,

199
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,960
so please don't mind me.

200
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,200
Someone hurt him deeply?
Who was she?

201
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,200
Hey, don't ask her
something so unnecessary.

202
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,670
You need to get married first.

203
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,830
She's coming at me...

204
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,040
because you won't marry anyone.

205
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,840
You're back.

206
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,080
It's tough to remember
to speak to you with respect.

207
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,720
My dear sister-in-law, you're back.

208
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,990
Things were really hectic today.

209
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,190
I didn't think
moving would be this hard.

210
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,890
The place is too big,
so we should hire a helping hand.

211
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,830
Do you have the number
for the old housekeeper?

212
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,730
Why are you looking at me like that?

213
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,900
You're really something.

214
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,570
Wasn't it enough
to steal her husband from her?

215
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,270
Did you have to take her house, too?

216
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,340
You're talking to me as a friend,
not my sister-in-law, right?

217
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,750
Yu Gyeong, please don't hold
such resentment against me.

218
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,320
As you know,
I was a victim of school violence,

219
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,050
and Jae In's mother was
the perpetrator.

220
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,020
That's not all.

221
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,690
This was nothing
compared to the humiliation...

222
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,060
my mom had to suffer.

223
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,560
It's not enough.

224
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,190
I plan to return
whatever they did to me.

225
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,800
Don't you remember your fault?

226
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,900
Don't you remember
taking advantage of Jae In's name?

227
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,470
That was a mistake.

228
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,670
People can do that
when they're young.

229
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,070
You weren't too young.

230
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,110
High school students know better.

231
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,380
Good for you
that you knew better back then.

232
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,720
But does Jae In know
you prescribed the medicine...

233
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,250
she took?

234
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,490
Yu Gyeong, no,
my dear sister-in-law,

235
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,260
we're on the same boat.

236
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,160
Then, we should cover
for each other's mistakes.

237
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,290
Nothing good can come
from digging up the past.

238
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,430
My dear sister-in-law,
you should know better.

239
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,730
I'm going upstairs to get some rest.

240
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,300
Goodnight.

241
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,420
Come on in.

242
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:55,890
I haven't cleaned up my room.

243
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,490
It looks clean.

244
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,120
I thought it'd be fancier.

245
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,060
I like things
that are natural and simple.

246
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,200
This is where I get my rest.

247
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,250
Jae In, from now on,

248
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,620
I'll be the real Kang Jae In.

249
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,090
Where have you been?

250
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,220
Hey, I went to see my sons sleeping.

251
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,130
It's not champagne.

252
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,100
We should save it for the day
when you become YL's chairman.

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,100
Cheers.

254
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,950
Thank you
for making my wish come true.

255
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,850
I really wanted to have this house.

256
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,990
I said I'd give you
whatever you wanted.

257
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,660
From now on,
this place is a castle...

258
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,160
for you and me.

259
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,000
Your kingdom starts here,

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,570
and it'll spread
all the way to YL Group.

261
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,000
It's a thief!

262
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,740
Where's the thief?

263
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,780
What's going on?

264
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,550
He's in my room. And he climbed...

265
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,180
into my bed!

266
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,320
- What are you doing? Go get him.
- Okay.

267
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,620
- Here.
- Have you lost your mind?

268
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,760
He needs to be careful,
and this is too dangerous.

269
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,460
- You need to go alone.
- I'll be fine.

270
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,590
- Let's go.
- What?

271
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,760
Are you okay?

272
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,470
Wait, isn't he Seung Woo?

273
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,610
What is this?
Why are you all at my place?

274
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,480
Come on. Lie down over here.

275
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,020
Wake up, Seung Woo.

276
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,760
Kang Seung Woo.

277
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,990
Seung Woo.

278
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,830
We should
let him sleep here tonight.

279
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,200
Yu Gyeong, is he a pervert?

280
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,000
Or is he into me?

281
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,240
Your room was his old room,

282
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,670
so he instinctively went there.

283
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,710
But still, this is wrong.

284
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,680
- Make sure you lock your door.
- Okay.

285
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,080
Let's all go to sleep.

286
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,050
He'll leave once he wakes up.

287
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,050
Good grief.

288
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,250
Gosh.

289
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,600
I should get a talisman,
do a ritual,

290
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,800
or splatter some holy water.

291
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,440
I couldn't sleep well last night.

292
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,310
You're probably adapting
to the new place.

293
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,970
It's not that.
I saw Mr. Kang in my sleep.

294
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,010
He kept telling me
to leave his place,

295
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,210
called me a murderer or something,

296
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,820
and choked me with all his might.

297
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,790
Anyway, I was too nice.

298
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,420
I should've said something
when he told me to leave his place.

299
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,660
We bought this place.

300
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,160
This is my home now, not his.
Don't you think so?

301
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,430
Stop talking about the deceased
this early in the morning.

302
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,970
It's bad luck.

303
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,370
You're right.
I shouldn't have said that...

304
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,670
when you had
a whole day ahead of you.

305
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,710
You should eat up
and get to work, my son.

306
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,350
I'm going to work.

307
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,550
- I'm leaving, too, Mother.
- All right.

308
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,590
I'm not sure if it was
the right thing to move in here.

309
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,200
What do you think?

310
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,870
I don't know.

311
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,970
I really don't like you.

312
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,040
Is that all you can say
after I asked you a question?

313
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,740
I have no idea what you're thinking.

314
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,650
I need some water.

315
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,680
Seung Woo.

316
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,050
What?

317
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,190
Yu Gyeong,
why are you here so early?

318
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,160
Have some water and wake up.

319
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,330
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,500
Please excuse me.

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,100
Seung Woo.

322
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,640
You should stay for breakfast.
I made dried pollack soup.

323
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,810
I'm fine.

324
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,370
My gosh.

325
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,970
I need some hangover relief.

326
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,980
This isn't a pharmacy.

327
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,480
You should've kept some in stock
as the in-house clinic.

328
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,520
This is a clinic for the employees'
psychological well-being,

329
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,250
so I'll keep that in mind.

330
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,020
We had met
when the chairman collapsed...

331
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,760
in his office, right?

332
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,430
You're here anyway, so is anything
bothering you psychologically?

333
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,130
Why do you ask?

334
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,570
I just told you.

335
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm here to look after
the employees' psychology.

336
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,270
The chairman's passing
must've been hard for you.

337
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,980
Everything will remain confidential,
so feel free to talk to me.

338
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,480
Whatever happens in our family
cannot be known to outsiders.

339
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,850
If anyone tries to pry,
just ignore them.

340
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,620
Nothing's bothering me.

341
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,440
Are you sure you can do this?

342
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,840
I must win,

343
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,770
and I will.

344
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,840
Of course, you'll win.

345
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,850
But that determination alone isn't enough
for you to take that office.

346
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,450
Your father
may not have been a family man,

347
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,250
but he gave his all to YL Group.

348
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,420
That's the kind of determination
I'm talking about.

349
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,120
I'll do that.

350
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,960
You must remain strong.

351
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,160
Do not be a pushover.

352
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,360
Once you take office,

353
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,900
you must find out who's on your side
among the staff members...

354
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,500
and handle them appropriately.

355
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,570
Also, you must
kick Seung Woo out, too.

356
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,740
Those are my conditions.

357
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,740
Everything else is fine,
but not Seung Woo.

358
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,250
I don't care what you say.
He's my younger brother.

359
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,520
I don't want to begin
a siblings' feud.

360
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,180
Please help me.

361
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,950
Jae In.

362
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,950
I'm on your side.

363
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,490
But even for a moment, you must realize
this world is not a joke...

364
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,630
for you to learn something.

365
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,870
Give me some time to think.

366
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,370
I'll reach out to you.

367
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,950
He seemed like a regular here.

368
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,690
Will he come by today?

369
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,030
I should've asked for his number.

370
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,800
Are you looking for someone?

371
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,400
Yes, the hottie...

372
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,670
My gosh.

373
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,440
My goodness. You surprised me.

374
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,770
Move aside.

375
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,740
Ms. Noh.

376
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,880
How long
will you continue to ignore me?

377
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,010
Don't you remember me?

378
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,150
We lived in the same house long ago.

379
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,320
I'm not Ms. Noh.

380
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,290
What?

381
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,490
Let's continue our business
with the overseas team like this.

382
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,760
All right.

383
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,790
Why don't we wrap up the business?

384
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,800
I'd like to leave you with a word.

385
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,170
Sure, please.

386
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,840
I couldn't understand
the things you had been doing,

387
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,370
but only the couple would know
what happened between you two,

388
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,770
so I didn't think
it was my place to meddle with you.

389
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,510
That was why I stayed quiet
when you suddenly said you'd remarry.

390
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,050
But how did you end up buying
our Changpyeong-dong home?

391
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,090
You kept denying everything
whenever I got suspicious,

392
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,360
but I now began
to be suspicious of you.

393
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,460
Of course, that'd be the case.

394
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,860
I already mentioned this to Jae In,
but it was because of Eun Ho.

395
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,100
Everything changed abruptly for him,

396
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,670
so I thought
he should at least get to live...

397
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,000
in his old home.

398
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,770
Is that really the only reason?

399
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,140
I can't help it
even if you don't believe me,

400
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,780
but I made the choice
as a father for Eun Ho.

401
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,620
Then, sell the house back to me...

402
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,720
after Eun Ho grows up a little.
Can you do that?

403
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,520
Sure, if you want that,
I'll do that.

404
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,960
More importantly, may I ask
what decision you have made...

405
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,260
for the upcoming general meeting...

406
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,870
and the appointment
of the new chairman?

407
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,070
Blood is thicker than water.

408
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,440
You'll make her the chairperson...

409
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,340
just because she's your family?

410
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,480
Jae In has lost all her senses.

411
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,750
Even if she was diagnosed as normal,

412
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,280
she could always suddenly change.

413
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,790
Will it be okay if YL Group loses
its great image we have cultivated?

414
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,660
You already know my ex-mother-in-law
made a big impact on us.

415
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,800
What are you trying to say?

416
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,330
I promise to cultivate
and make the company...

417
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,670
into something you envisioned.

418
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,510
Use me as your tool.

419
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,610
I'll consider this never heard.

420
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,110
Please reconsider
if you truly care about YL Group,

421
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,880
which your father has established.

422
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,260
I'll do my best to make YL Group...

423
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,360
into a world-renowned brand,

424
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,770
just as Chairman Kang wanted.

425
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,540
I promise you.

426
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,810
Thank you for giving me your faith.

427
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,080
I'll see you
at the shareholders' meeting.

428
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,580
Goodbye.

429
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,020
Is it all right
for you to stay at the hotel?

430
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,520
Seung Woo must've been
quite drunk last night.

431
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,320
He slept at Changpyeong-dong.

432
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,820
He must've had the card key.

433
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,760
It's uncomfortable to stay
at a hotel like a wanderer,

434
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,760
so I've been looking for a place.

435
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,730
Jae In.

436
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,200
You know the Kangs
always bequeath the business...

437
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,510
to the eldest son
of the family, right?

438
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,540
Yes, I do.

439
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,080
Then, it'll be easier
to bring this up.

440
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,520
I think Seung Woo should be...

441
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,220
the next chairman of YL Group.

442
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,060
He's been with the company
for just over half a year now.

443
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,360
He isn't even familiar
with the system.

444
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,200
It'll be too burdensome
for him to take the position.

445
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,030
Well, the same thing
applies to you, too.

446
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,030
You don't have enough experience.

447
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,040
I've been with the company
for a long time.

448
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,870
I took a maternity leave,
but I continued to study...

449
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,610
to keep up with everything.

450
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,280
So, you're opposed
to making Seung Woo...

451
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,080
the chairman.

452
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,280
At the moment,
I think that's the right decision.

453
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,090
Jae In.

454
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,260
Do you realize you're trying...

455
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,430
to control the business...

456
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,030
because of personal feelings?

457
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,400
Is that truly the right thing
for YL Group?

458
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,570
I won't deny that hard feelings
and personal vengeance...

459
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,440
are involved.

460
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,840
However, whatever you worry about
won't happen.

461
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,780
I'm also doing this
to protect YL Group.

462
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,210
Please give me your trust,
Aunt Mi Ran.

463
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,050
I'll prove it to you.

464
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,720
If that's what you want,
then I'll accept it.

465
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,330
We don't have much time left,
so do your best.

466
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,900
I will.

472
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,230
All right.

473
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,700
You got here early.

474
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,300
Aunt Mi Ran,
I need to go see my mom.

475
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,330
I got a call from the attorney,
and she told me to come...

476
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,570
for her power of attorney.

477
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,870
I'll go and get it.
You should stay here.

478
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,740
Do not look shaken
before the shareholders.

479
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,340
Make sure you stay confident.

480
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,610
Okay, Aunt Mi Ran.
Please do that for me.

481
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,750
I'll be back.

482
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,390
Hey.

483
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,260
I heard you were recommended
as a chairperson candidate.

484
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,000
You helped me greatly when you said
I had to fight this fight alone.

485
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,540
I'm doing my best to win this.

486
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,100
I hope it goes well.

487
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,270
I'm here
on behalf of an acquaintance.

488
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,910
I feel a little relieved.

489
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,480
You always took my side...

490
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,310
whenever I was in trouble.

491
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,680
It's hard to tell
who's on my side and who isn't.

492
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,550
So, it's nice to know there's one person
who believes me...

493
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,120
and is willing to listen to me.

494
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,960
Right. I should take my seat.

495
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,830
Yes, of course.

496
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,970
Hello. You're here.

497
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,840
Yes, it's great to see you.

There's no need to rush.

500
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,700
I'll only look desperate
if I show up there early.

501
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,300
The problem is that people will side with
Jae In, who looks desperate.

502
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,840
Most board members
who remained neutral...

503
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,370
came in contact with her.

504
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,410
You haven't secured
enough votes on your side.

505
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,240
If Director Kang Mi Ran
and Jae In's mom side with her,

506
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,410
we'll fail to secure
over half of the votes.

507
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,620
It'll all come down to whoever
the minor shareholders side with.

508
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,050
What's your plan?

509
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,660
I must fight this fight.

510
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,560
Right now, Jae In is
nothing but an image.

511
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,190
We'll have to wait
until the cards are dealt.

on an important day like this.

He's bad luck.

00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,670
he's not Gyu Cheol's son?

524
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,340
He could've adopted him.

525
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,510

00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,280
I'll disown him legally so that
he doesn't ruin Jae In's future.

528
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,890
I had the wrong idea about you.

529
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,120
You may have looked cold,
but I thought you were warm inside.

530
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,330
Do you not feel bad at all...

531
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,230
about Seung Woo?

532
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,330
I've shown him enough kindness.

533
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,000
He'd be shameless to want more.

534
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,940
Mi Ran, if you have
enough time to care about him,

535
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,710
you need to focus on Jae In.

536
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,510
YL Group...

537
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,680
must belong to her,
no matter what happens.

538
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,680
It must happen.

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,760
to appoint the next chairperson.

542
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,860
The candidates
for the next chairperson are...

543
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,000
Director Hwang Gi Chan
and Ms. Kang Jae In.

544
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,430
All votes will remain anonymous.

545
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,640

for every shareholder's cooperation.

The vote to appoint...

550

the next chairperson
of YL Group is...

551
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,140
about to end soon.

552
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,510
The ballots will be counted
as soon as the voting is over.

553
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,640
Is Director Kang Mi Ran
not here yet?

554
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,710
What if she doesn't come at all?

555
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,280
Then, Director Hwang would
most likely win,

556
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,220
unless major shareholders vote
for Ms. Kang's side.

557
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,340
I'm a little late.

558
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,250
I have the power of attorney,

559
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,150
and I'll cast my vote now.

please do this for my son.

568

the next chairperson for YL Group.

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,920
Do you still think
you're the daughter of a rich family?

579
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,790
Know your place.

580

My gosh.

581
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,320
Do you know her well?

582
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,030
I know her a little, too.

583
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,230
Mommy, take this.

584
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,500
Take this and don't be sick anymore.
