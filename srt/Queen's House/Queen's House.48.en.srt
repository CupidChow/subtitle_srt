1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,070
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,110
(Episode 48)

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,480
We'll find out who'll leave
on the day of the competition,

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,250
but before we do that,
I want to raise a concern...

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,720
regarding the judge's qualifications.

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,760
Are you talking about us?

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,860
To be exact,

10
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,590
it's Director Kim Do Yun
of DH Holdings.

11
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,860
Did you know that people are
flooding our intranet bulletin?

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,510
(I'm ashamed of this company!
YL Group isn't a prison!)

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,510
(Is DH Holding full of criminals?
Sex offender, Director Kim Do Yun!)

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,180
(Sex offender, Kim Do Yun, leave now!)

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,810
(Hello, I'm a female employee of
YL Group. I write this in fear...)

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,900
This was why I was against
having you here.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,070
I can't stop my employees
if they decide...

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,700
to protest against him.

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,040
As the owner, I must establish trust
between myself and the staff.

20
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,380
Above all, we're about to suffer
from disgrace for having...

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,010
a sex offender at our company.

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,680
At this point, I'm suspicious
of why you invested in my company.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,580
I even heard rumors
that you were a corporate raider.

24
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,050
Shouldn't you make
a wise decision...

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,260
to make your position clear?

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,930
Do not slander him.

27
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,330
I know Director Kim better.

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,230
He wouldn't molest anyone,

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,200
and I believe that case was
made up to frame him.

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,140
Bring your evidence first
before you complain.

31
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,070
And this isn't your place
to step in, Ms. Kang.

32
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,680
It's just as she said.
This isn't your place, Ms. Kang.

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,850
Please have a seat.

34
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,190
I believe
I already made myself clear...

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,920
when it came
to his sexual molestation charge.

36
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,030
I'm starting to wonder
why you're trying so hard...

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,960
to kick Director Kim out.

38
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:09,170
It's more than reasonable for him
to raise a concern as the chairman.

39
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,500
One news article about this is...

40
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,710
enough to damage
our company's image.

41
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,010
You may be the investor,

42
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,940
but it's courteous to refrain
from making assumptions.

43
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,810
Courteous?

44
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,790
All right. I'm sorry.

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,960
However, if Director Kim is
found innocent after the trial,

46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,660
you'd better be ready to apologize.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,500
And you must announce this
in your intranet bulletin, too.

48
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,090
Is it true?

49
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,660
(Resign, Kim Do Yun!)

50
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,030
(Director Kim Do Yun
of DH Holdings must resign.)

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,490
(Be mindful of the female staff.
We cannot work with a sex offender.)

52
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,430
What are you all doing?

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,290
Aren't people of YL
scared of the law?

54
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,620
They're like gangsters.

55
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,760
Think of how desperate they were
to express their opinion.

56
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,860
You must've egged them on.

57
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,700
Why would I?
You already saw the bulletin.

58
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,700
Don't you know what egging on means?

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,440
It means you incite people
into taking a certain kind of action.

60
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,740
Someone must've started
what happened on the bulletin.

61
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,610
I'm here on behalf
of all of YL's employees to relay...

62
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,310
that they cannot accept
Director Kim Do Yun of DH Holdings,

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,680
a sex offender.

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,690
If I may leave you
with a piece of advice,

65
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,520
wouldn't it be best...

66
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,590
to cut out the rotten part
for the sake of DH Holdings as well?

67
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,990
Go tell Chairman Hwang Gi Chan...

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,960
to stop messing with me
by going back to this done deal.

69
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,230
If you're done
with your nonsense, leave.

70
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,740
Nonsense?

71
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,510
Yes, it's nonsense and wasteful
for you to meddle with my business,

72
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,670
so just get out of here!

73
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,150
Are you all right?

74
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,280
I got a little worked up.

75
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,690
I recently told your dad
that I'd protect you.

76
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,220
What is this?

77
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,560
Don't worry about me,
Uncle Oh Seong.

78
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,290
Something like this can't break me.

79
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,930
We'll find a way.

80
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,800
Let's clean up this mess.

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,470
They're giving us
all this extra work.

82
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480
It must've been Gi Chan.

83
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,420
I must find a way.

84
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,990
Reporter Kim,
what's important isn't the truth.

85
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,460
It's how big you can blow this up.

86
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,190
Yes, let's meet to play golf soon.

87
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,630
I'll give you a call.

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,470
The employees are on the move
just as you planned,

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,440
and the story
of his sexual molestation is...

90
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,610
spreading through
the messaging system.

91
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,110
People are
also beginning to question...

92
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,410
the investment from DH Holdings.

93
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,710
A few of them went to their office
to complain, too.

94
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,250
They seem quite flustered.

95
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,820
I told a few reporters
to blow up this case.

96
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,920
After that, it'll become too big
for Patrick to cover for him.

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,020
He'll realize
he must discard Kim Do Yun.

98
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,230
It would've been better
if he had done as you said,

99
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,430
while you were nice.

100
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,460
You should get back to work.

101
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,260
Don't be absent
from your office for too long.

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,000
I was about to leave.

103
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,530
I'll be back after work.

104
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,340
Jae In.

105
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,310
If you wanted to stick
with Kim Do Yun to fight me,

106
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,780
this must've been
enough for you to realize...

107
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,520
that I, Hwang Gi Chan,
am not such an easy fight.

108
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,020
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,290
Are you crazy?

110
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,100
Yes, I'm crazy, you crazy punk!

111
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,500
Oh, no!

112
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,070
Are you drunk?

113
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,340
How dare you act like this
at my office?

114
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,340
Will you continue
to live like a rogue?

115
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,440
This is why Yu Gyeong wants
to divorce you!

116
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,880
Shut up! Don't even consider me
your older brother!

117
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,610
You never treat me like one, anyway.

118
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,050
You jerk.

119
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,750
I was an idiot for trusting you
just because you were my brother.

120
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,620
You both need to stop.

121
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,850
I'm going to tell Mom.

122
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,950
What do you want now?

123
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,890
Are you putting on a show
to get money?

124
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,120
What now?

125
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,760
Hey, you punk.
You told my father-in-law...

126
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,130
that I kidnapped Eun Ho!

127
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,500
How do you call yourself my brother?

128
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,130
That's enough!

129
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,270
You don't deserve to be so shameless
after what you've done.

130
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,740
How can you do this to your family?

131
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,840
I wasn't even lying.
What's wrong with telling the truth?

132
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,910
He was my father.
He was my father-in-law!

133
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,810
So what? Did you kidnap Eun Ho
because he was your nephew?

134
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,780
You shouldn't have done
something like that to begin with!

135
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,990
I only put up with this
because you were my family,

136
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,350
because you were my brother.

137
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,260
How can I forgive you
for kidnapping my son?

138
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,930
I would've sent you to prison
if you weren't my brother!

139
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,200
My father-in-law
told me to divorce her.

140
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,570
Stop blaming me
for your incompetence and indecency.

141
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,100
Leave.

142
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,100
Leave now before I get the guard
to drag you out.

143
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,440
Let's go, Gi Man.
He means that. Let's go.

144
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,810
Hey, you punk.

145
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,180
You were the worst
to both Eun Ho and Jae In, too.

146
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,050
Jae In was always so good to you!

147
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,420
Do you think
you'll live a good life...

148
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,450
after making
that kind woman miserable?

149
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,720
You're shameless.

150
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,050
Get out!

151
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,790
Fine, I'll get out!
I'm leaving because you disgust me!

152
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,060
Let go of me!

153
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,590
Darn it.
What kind of brother is that?

154
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,730
Goodness!

155
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,240
I'm going to the showroom
to meet with our VIP customer.

156
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
Please let Director Kang know
if she is looking for me.

157
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,770
Sure.

158
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,420
Did you get into a fight?

159
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,020
You look awful.

160
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,360
Why? Does it feel great
to see me like this?

161
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,330
The staff will think something is odd
if you walk around like this.

162
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,400
Wipe yourself off
and put some ointment on it.

163
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,740
Do you want me to get one for you?

164
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,970
Why are you
suddenly acting like this?

165
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,040
You always gave me
the death stare whenever you saw me.

166
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,150
Because I hate you to death.

167
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,150
Then, mind your own business.

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,720
Stop acting like
you're still not over me...

169
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,390
and go be with Kim Do Yun.

170
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,250
What if...

171
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,260
I'm still not over you?

172
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,860
What do you think is
on the other side of hatred?

173
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,770
What's on the other side is
why I hated you so much.

174
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,200
Don't let it get infected
and get it treated.

175
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,870
Bye.

176
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,630
Come and have some rice cake.

177
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,700
It's still hot,
so it'll taste delicious.

178
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,840
Try some.

179
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,010
It's chewy and delicious.

180
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,950
I ordered some to give a job
to the mill here...

181
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,450
and to give it out
to everyone else in the arcade.

182
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,620
Isn't it good?

183
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,360
Why are you giving out rice cakes?

184
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,790
Did something good happen?

185
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,890
You already know.

186
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,860
I became the co-op president,
so it's my way of saying thanks.

187
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,500
The co-op president?

188
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,630
You got the job?

189
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,740
Goodness. Stop teasing me.

190
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,410
You're feigning ignorance
on purpose, right?

191
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,840
Ms. Mi Sook...
No, we're going casual now.

192
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,280
You made me the president, Mi Sook.

193
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,710
Mi Sook?

194
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,220
Who's Mi Sook?

195
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,880
Mi Sook.

196
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,520
It's your name.

197
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,960
Goodness, what's with me?
I was somewhere else,

198
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,360
so I got my name confused.

199
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,070
But still,
how can you forget your name?

200
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,940
You need to pull yourself together.

201
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,510
I must.

202
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,110
I need to.

203
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,890
I'm not in good condition,
so I must leave early.

204
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,390
Goodbye.

205
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,790
Did something happen at home?

206
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,900
No.

207
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,370
Director Kang isn't here.

208
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,340
Please leave.

209
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,740
You're in our office.

210
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,610
You must have some common sense
to know that you can't just walk in...

211
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,050
if you aren't authorized.

212
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,260
Come to think of it now,
you two look alike.

213
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,400
Of course, we do.
I'm my father's son.

214
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,700
Are you here to insist
that I'm not even his son?

215
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,140
I'm saying you look just like...

216
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,400
your birth mother.

217
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,010
Don't you want to know...

218
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,910
who your birth mother is?

219
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,680
No.

220
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,450
Not at all.

221
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,920
Even if you know,
I don't want to hear it from you, so go.

222
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,820
- So, you are curious.
- Not at all!

223
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,730
She never reached out to this day
after giving me birth.

224
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,600
To me, that woman
and you are the same,

225
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,000
so I don't want to know.

226
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,280
I'm going to the factory.

227
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,520
It's almost too heartbreaking
to watch this.

228
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,960
Haven't you done enough damage?

229
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,670
What kind of grudge do you hold
to keep messing with him?

230
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,070
Don't you feel bad for him?

231
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,470
Not at all.

232
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,810
Take a look at this...

233
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,450
and see
if I should feel bad for him.

234
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,990
(Kang Mi Ran and Kang Seung Woo are
99.99% related by blood.)

235
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,290
Yes, of course.

236
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,660
You must feel bad for him.

237
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,230
But I feel wronged.

238
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,530
I feel so wronged...

239
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,100
that I want to drag back my dead husband
and demand an answer.

240
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,940
I should've known when you were
overly caring about Seung Woo.

241
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Do you have any right
to denounce me?

242
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,640
You were the one who tortured me
throughout my entire life.

243
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,650
Yet you dare to treat me
like I'm the sinner.

244
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,780
Not only are you shameless,
but you even disgust me.

245
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,820
Things will be interesting
when Seung Woo finds out.

246
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,730
He'll treat you
just like how he treats me.

247
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,730
You heard everything, right?

248
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,130
I'll tell Seung Woo
who his birth mother is...

249
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,540
so you can have
your heartrending reunion.

250
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,800
No.

251
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,110
I'm going to tell him,
so don't do it.

252
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,240
I'm doing it.

253
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,950
It doesn't matter
if I do it or you do it.

254
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,950
I'll do it on your behalf.

255
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,950
I said I'd do it!

256
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,020
I'm going to take some time...

257
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,320
and make sure
he isn't overly shocked.

258
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,890
So, don't do it. I ask of you.

259
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,000
You don't ask for a favor
just with your words.

260
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,670
Think of all those years
I lived in torment.

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,530
My life was sacrificed...

262
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,970
to save your life
and the Kang family.

263
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,580
I feel very wronged,
so I demand compensation.

264
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,010
How much do you want?

265
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,520
How can you calculate the cost
of ruining both my life...

266
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,750
and my daughter's life?

267
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,990
Even millions and billions
of dollars aren't enough,

268
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,320
but I'll still take the money.

269
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,390
I must make a living.

270
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,260
Do your calculations right
and bring me the money.

271
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,160
I'll give you a week.

272
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,420
Mom.

273
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,360
I was about to call you.

274
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,030
Why are you here?

275
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,700
(Investment and Development Team)

276
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,540
I can't believe this.

277
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,510
So, you're working there?

278
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,250
Yes.

279
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,120
And Kim Do Yun or whatever.
Why is he there?

280
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,580
He's my boss.

281
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,090
You need to quit.

282
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,290
Quit your job
and think of starting a business...

283
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,720
because I'll be getting
a large sum of money soon.

284
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,990
How are you going to get money?

285
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,560
You don't have to know that.

286
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,900
But don't be alarmed
at what I'm about to say.

287
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,000
It's Seung Woo.

288
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,240
I found out who his birth mother is.

289
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,750
Do you know who it is?

290
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,450
It's so ridiculous.

291
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,750
It was your aunt, Mi Ran.
She was Seung Woo's mother.

292
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,520
Your father deceived me...

293
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,860
and turned her son into his
to make me raise him.

294
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,930
How can something like this happen?

295
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,330
He may not have had another woman,

296
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,770
but he still betrayed me.

297
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,470
If he had said something to me,

298
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,710
I would've felt less wronged.

299
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,310
But he always felt very bad for you,

300
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,910
and he loved you.

301
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,520
Wait, you already knew...

302
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,450
who Seung Woo's birth mother was?

303
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,750
She told me only recently.

304
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,820
Why didn't you tell me?

305
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,920
She asked me to keep it a secret...

306
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,430
until she told Seung Woo.

307
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,390
So, you didn't tell me?

308
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,530
Aren't you my daughter?

309
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,470
I did it for Seung Woo.

310
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,440
He'll be greatly shocked
by this sudden information,

311
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,900
so he deserves some time.

312
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,870
You need to keep it quiet
until Aunt Mi Ran tells him.

313
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,940
Are you only worried about him?

314
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,010
What about me, your mother?

315
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,350
I do worry about you.

316
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,220
If you had, you should've told me!

317
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,020
You knew
how much I despised your father.

318
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,920
How can you keep this from me?

319
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,390
Your aunt was behind all this.

320
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,930
In the end, your dad...

321
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,100
had to sacrifice because of her.

322
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,540
He couldn't say a word...

323
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,340
even after hearing
all my harsh words.

324
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,980
And for what? The Kang family?

325
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,340
Does it even matter?

326
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,920
Welcome home, Mr. Chairman.

327
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,190
- I'm home.
- I'm home, Mother.

328
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,560
You two must be hungry.

329
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,800
Oh, my. What happened
to my precious chairman's face?

330
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,500
Who did this to you?

331
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,930
Tell me who this jerk is right now.

332
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,340
I'll beat that punk's face
to a pulp.

333
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,640
It was Gi Man, Mom.

334
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,940
What?

335
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,480
He came to the office,
punched Gi Chan,

336
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
got all mad, and said,

337
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,850
"You told my father-in-law
that I kidnapped Eun Ho!"

338
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,050
"How do you call yourself
my brother?"

339
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,480
Something like that.

340
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,520
I'll go upstairs.

341
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,290
Has he lost his mind?

342
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,790
How dare he go there
and make a scene?

343
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,460
Call him right away...

344
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,900
and tell him to come home now.

345
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,130
Okay.

346
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,070
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

347
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,340
His phone is turned off.

348
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,770
I'll break his legs...

349
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,810
and get some sense into him...

350
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,240
as soon as he comes home.

351
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,510
Good grief. This is so frustrating.

352
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,090
Have a seat.
Let me put some ointment on you.

353
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,900
No, I'm fine.

354
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,060
Mother told me to do it.

355
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,500
Sit.

356
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,710
Honey, shouldn't you
get rid of Jae In, too?

357
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,610
It's uncomfortable to see her
keep lurking around you.

358
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,420
What do you think?

359
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,390
She'll have to leave
when she loses the competition, anyway.

360
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,320
It's all up to you.

361
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,430
You're right. I should do my best.

362
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,260
Is it going to fall?

363
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,300
- It didn't.
- It didn't.

364
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,770
You're so good at this.

365
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,940
"Exploitation
of a Foreign Investment Firm."

366
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,870
"The Dark Side of DH Holdings,
a Global Investment Company?"

367
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,580
They're doing their best
to make this look like...

368
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,680
foreign capital is in this
to destroy a domestic corporation.

369
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,720
How much did YL Group
bribe them with?

370
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,450
What is it?

371
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,090
- Goah.
- What are they talking about?

372
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,090
It says Director K of DH Holdings.

373
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,760
Is this about Do Yun?

374
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,860
Sexual...

375
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,870
That case is still under trial.

376
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,040
Bo Ram, why don't we pick out
your hair tie for tomorrow...

377
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
while Uncle Do Yun and Grandma talk?

378
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,810
- Okay.
- Let's go.

379
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,650
Won't things become disadvantageous
when these articles come out?

380
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,350
It's because they're scared of us.

381
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,050
They're pulling
all kinds of dirty tricks...

382
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,320
in an attempt to kick him out.

383
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,160
I knew this would happen.
This was the reason...

384
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,290
why I tried to stop you
from joining that business.

385
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,000
These people can do even worse.

386
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,430
You don't have to worry.

387
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,330
My identity wasn't revealed,

388
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,840
and our legal team will
release a correction.

389
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,870
Yes, Yun Hee.
You really don't have to worry.

390
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,910
They aren't the only ones
who can play the media.

391
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,440
Director Kang
tried to shut your mouth...

392
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,610
and even got your
non-disclosure agreement notarized,

393
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,820
but they reported this instead?

394
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,620
Isn't this a breach of contract?

395
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,990
It may not be Director Kang.

396
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,920
She seemed shocked
to see the bulletin at the meeting.

397
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,030
So what?
She's always on Hwang Gi Chan's side.

398
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,430
They're all the same.

399
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,540
Gosh. He reeks of alcohol.

400
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,410
I was wondering
what you were doing all night.

401
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,940
Look at this punk.

402
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,310
Hwang Gi Man! Wake up right now!

403
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,680
It's already high noon,
and you don't deserve...

404
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,950
to lie around like this
without opening for business!

405
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,490
Darn it.

406
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,030
That's cold!

407
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,960
It hurts! What's all this?

408
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,130
What do you think? It's your mother.

409
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,400
How can you sleep like this
after beating up your brother?

410
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,910
He also pushed me,
so my body is aching all over, too.

411
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,910
He went easy on you
because you were his brother.

412
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,280
You don't stand a chance
against him.

413
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,610
Why did you go to his office
and bother him...

414
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,380
while he's doing great work?

415
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,320
Mom, be honest.

416
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,420
Did Dad have me out of wedlock?

417
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,220
What are you talking about?

418
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,290
He would've died in my hands...

419
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,330
instead of his illness
if he had done something like that.

420
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,560
Then, you need to get mad
at Gi Chan, too.

421
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,530
He told my father-in-law
that I kidnapped Eun Ho.

422
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,240
So, my father-in-law is
no longer on my side!

423
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,710
I had to get him on my side
to convince Yu Gyeong,

424
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,310
so what am I going to do now?

425
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,780
Gi Chan already did his part...

426
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,250
by not shutting you up in prison
as Eun Ho's kidnapper.

427
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,880
Stop blaming your younger brother,

428
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,980
get yourself together,
and clean up this mess.

429
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,190
Now!

430
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:41,260
Although our rebuttal articles
were published this morning,

431
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,230
public sentiment
has not shown a significant change.

432
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,630
What do we do?

433
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,230
It won't turn over that easily.

434
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,170
It doesn't matter what the truth is.

435
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,870
There's a so-called victim
and a record of her report.

436
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,410
This incident may have begun
with Director Kim's scandal,

437
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,210
but they continued this
by attacking DH Holdings...

438
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,580
and making the investment look like
a malicious merger attempt.

439
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,110
Hwang Gi Chan must...

440
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,120
want to tame us.

441
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,780
It won't benefit YL Group
in any way...

442
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,550
for the investor to get caught up
in scandals like these,

443
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,390
yet they refuse to make
an official statement to patch it up.

444
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,890
He's waiting for me to fire you.

445
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,130
Have you made any progress
on finding the so-called victim?

446
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,430
We're still tracking her down
in America,

447
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,530
but she planned her escape,
so it mustn't be easy.

448
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
Things will only become worse...

449
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,070
if I continue to claim
my innocence...

450
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,370
as long as I look like
the perpetrator.

451
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,280
It's giving me a headache
that they're making it look like...

452
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,540
all of YL Group's employees
want to kick us out.

453
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,910
Designer Kang Se Ri
mentioned the bulletin first,

454
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,780
so she must've egged them on there,
but we have no evidence of that.

455
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,650
The first one
who uploaded a post was...

456
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,820
an employee in the sales team
who's close to Se Ri.

457
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,790
I have to get some files
regarding the competition,

458
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,430
so I'll go over there
and talk to her.

459
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,410
I came to get the redevelopment request
for Saseon-dong.

460
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,980
It should be on Ms. Kang's desk.
I have to go out for a meeting.

461
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,620
(Export Contract)

462
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,130
(Team Leader Kang Se Ri)

463
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:30,970
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan, the reason
why YL's stock price plummeted!)

464
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,000
(Only death awaits
if you do not resign!)

465
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,470
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

466
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,940
Go ahead and try.

467
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,210
Did you call me here
to suddenly act like this?

468
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,450
Go ahead and give it your best.

469
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,250
I'll fight you
for the effort you made...

470
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,020
to send me this threatening letter
bidding my death or whatever.

471
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,660
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan, the reason
why YL's stock price plummeted!)

472
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,720
(Only death awaits
if you do not resign!)

473
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm so glad you got over
Director Kim Do Yun.

474
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,170
I find it ridiculous
that he turned you down,

475
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,270
but after all, he's a sex offender.

476
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,410
You can't be with a criminal.

477
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,880
Isn't a blackmailer
also considered a criminal?

478
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,320
Na Ra, Gi Chan will get mad at you
if you stay away for too long.

479
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,550
You should go.

480
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,220
I was about to leave, anyway.

481
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,660
I don't want to lose my energy
between Jae In and you.

482
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,670
You must've seen the bulletin.

483
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,400
Don't be so mad.

484
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,900
That wasn't blackmail, but...

485
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,640
"Chairman Hwang Gi Chan, the reason
why YL's stock price plummeted!"

486
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,110
"Only death awaits..."

487
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,810
So, you know exactly what this is.

488
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,320
How would I know?

489
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,120
You suddenly began
to slander Gi Chan,

490
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,320
so I had to take that.

491
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,320
Does Gi Chan know...

492
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,960
you were the blackmailer?

493
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,060
It obviously looks like...

494
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,860
you're the blackmailer here, not me.

495
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,030
Is that so?

496
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,430
Then, I'll hand this over
to Gi Chan.

497
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,870
Do you think
he'll believe that piece of paper?

498
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,480
I took pictures
of your toner change request...

499
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,780
and the blackmail file
you put together on the computer...

500
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,250
in the recent files.

501
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,320
If Gi Chan doesn't show interest,
I'll meet with reporters.

502
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,060
You two always play the media
with false information,

503
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,030
so why can't I do the same?

504
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,130
What do you want?

505
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,000
Stop beating around the bush
and tell me.

506
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,200
Bring Director Kim Do Yun
back to his office.

507
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,400
Or you can sit
and watch what happens next.

(YL Planning and Design)

509
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,250
I did as you asked.

(An apology for uploading false
information about DH Holdings)

511
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,690
So,

512
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,260
how am I supposed to believe you?

513
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,130
I deleted everything.

514
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,970
Happy now?

515
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,140
I wonder how mad
Gi Chan will be at you.

516
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,540

517
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,480
Good luck.

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,790
Isn't this the original uploader,
the employee in the sales team?

520
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,060
You're right.

521
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,700
He said he slandered DH Holdings
with a malicious intention...

522
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,430
because he never made money...

523
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,770
after buying our shares.

524
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,900
Hey, there's another one.

525
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,540
"Director Kim Do Yun
of DH Holdings is innocent?"

526
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,740
"I'm an acquaintance
of the victim who reported him."

527
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,210
This person
wanted to expose the truth.

528
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,750
The victim caused trouble on purpose
and fled overseas.

529
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,720
Even the evidence we turned over
to the court is attached.

530
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,990
I think Ms. Kang
put up a nice fight. Right?

531
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,130
How can you ruin everything
like this?

532
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,960
Jae In blackmailed me,
so I had no other choice.

533
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,330
She said she'd hold
a press conference...

534
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,300
and say she was Kang Jae In...

535
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,640
if I didn't handle
Director Kim's case.

536
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,640
And you let her have her way?

537
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,970
I got scared.

538
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,670
I'm sorry, honey.

539
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,110
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

540
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,810
I'll make sure
I kick out Jae In and Kim Do Yun.

541
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,820
I'll just win this competition.
Right?

542
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,490
Everything went well,
thanks to you, Jae In.

543
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,190
A correction was published,

544
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,260
and DH Holdings saved
our image as well.

545
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,430
I'm glad.

546
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,130
I can now focus on designing.

547
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,930
Can you do a great job?

548
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,700
I have faith in you.

549
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,040
I must do a great job.

550
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,240
Hello?

551
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,650
I'm Kang Jae In. Who's calling?

552
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,350
You're the attorney
for the kidnappers?

553
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,890
I'm sorry, but I'm hanging up.

554
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,130
I have nothing to say
regarding the kidnappers.

555
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,130
All right.

556
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,200
Who called you?

557
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,900
You mentioned the kidnappers.

558
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,310
Did Eun Ho's kidnappers
reach out to you?

559
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,140
Yes, I need to go out.

560
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,940
I'll go with you.
Let me give you a ride.

561
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,350
No, I have to go.

562
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,400
I heard from your attorney...

563
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,110
that you had to tell me something
about Eun Ho's kidnapping.

564
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,740
Yes.

565
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,410
It's not too late to stop now
if you're making up a lie...

566
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,510
just to leave prison.

567
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,920
I'll sue you...

568
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,420
if it turns out to be a lie,
and you'll only get more years.

569
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,420
I'm not lying.

570
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,960
I'm telling you...

571
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,190
because I was also deceived
and wronged.

572
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,290
You feel wronged
after kidnapping a kid?

573
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,260
You people don't even deserve
to eat in prison.

574
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,400
We only did as we were told.

575
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,040
Honestly speaking, I may be a thug,

576
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,040
but I still stand by my rules.

577
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,410
I never lay a finger on children.

578
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,680
I only took that job...

579
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,940
because I was told to play with him
for a while before sending him home.

580
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,850
But everything went haywire,

581
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,320
and only we ended up
taking the blame.

582
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,120
They were also our accomplices,
so shouldn't they be punished, too?

583
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,090
That's only fair.

584
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,590
Who put you up for this?

585
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,230
Mr. Hong and Hwang Gi Man.

586
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,730
Eun Ho's uncle, Hwang Gi Man.

587
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,110
(Queen's House)

588
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,050
Did I mention that
when I first met you,

589
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,020
I wanted to have you
as Do Yun's spouse?

590
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,020
Did you?

591
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,460
You should meet a good guy, too.

592
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,720
Do you want to start dating again?

593
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,860
There's something I need to say.

594
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,070
But I'm afraid what I'll say
might hurt someone.

595
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,870
Why are you here?

596
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,040
Why do you care?

597
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,710
Right, you must live off him,

598
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,040
like a parasite.

599
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,110
I won't let this go.

600
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,350
I won't.
