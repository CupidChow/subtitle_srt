(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,080
Ji Ho, do you want to ride a bicycle
with Mommy and Daddy...

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,550
when Daddy gets off work?

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,390
Really?

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,460
Yes, do you want to go?

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,860
Yes!

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,370
This won't come off, Mommy.
Please help me.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,500
Let me help you.

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,700
- Here.
- Get over here, Hwang Ji Ho.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,240
What's wrong with you?

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,340
Why did you shout at my Ji Ho?

14
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,050
Your Ji Ho?

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,520
Did you call him your Ji Ho?

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,850
I did. What's wrong?

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,450
He's my son.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,460
He's my son whom I had with Gi Chan!

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,200
What's going on?

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,970
You wouldn't tell her,
so I told her the truth,

21
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,800
that I had Ji Ho with you!

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,480
We aren't fighting, Ji Ho.

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,380
Mommy, Daddy, and Ms. Kang are
just having a conversation.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,080
Ji Ho is my son!

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,950
That's enough.
Can't you see that he's in shock?

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,490
It's okay, Ji Ho.

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,020
Go to your room and read a book.

28
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,590
Yes, Ji Ho.
You should go to your room.

29
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,260
Okay.

30
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,130
Mark my words.

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,840
Ji Ho is my son.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,710
Oh, no. Honey, what now?

33
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,540
I was anxious this might happen,
and I was right.

34
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,580
Do you remember?

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,880
I told you she might insist
that Ji Ho is her son.

36
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,220
I remember.

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,220
Her condition must've worsened.

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,260
Honey, I can't live
under the same roof as this girl.

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,730
She scares me.

40
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,900
I'm afraid she might do something
to harm Ji Ho.

41
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,200
What is this nonsense?

42
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,300
Why would I do that to my own son?

43
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,170
Ji Ho's my son.

44
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,610
And you need to stop this.

45
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,040
Stop letting her
deceive you like this!

46
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,280
Where are you?

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,220
Come in now with Secretary Kim.

48
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,390
I concluded that the three of us
cannot live together any longer.

49
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,930
You heard him.

50
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,170
Get out of here, Jae In.

51
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,370
Ms. Kang.

52
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,900
Please leave my house.

53
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,670
Honey.

54
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,710
What are you waiting for?
Escort her outside.

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,210
Do not touch me.

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,780
Don't you know who I am?

57
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,220
Let go!

58
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,750
Do not touch me! Let go of me!

59
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,020
Honey!

60
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,320
Hey, is something going on?

61
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,530
What's with all the noise?

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,660
It won't happen again.

63
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,860
It must've been rough.
Go upstairs and get some rest.

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,970
I need to see Ji Ho.

65
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,240
He must've been startled.

66
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,950
What's going on? What is it?

67
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,950
Don't let Se Ri
return to this house for a while.

68
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,520
What?

69
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,420
Marrying her must've been a mistake.

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,100
People usually say
women's lives are volatile,

71
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,570
so how did my sons end up living
such erratic lives?

72
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:58,440
(Director Kim Do Yun)

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
Are you feeling okay?

74
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,270
Can you come to work already?
Are you still in pain?

75
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,610
I'm fine. I told you
that it was just a scratch.

76
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,410
But still, be careful.

77
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,420
I feel more at peace at work...

78
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,020
because there's always trouble
at home.

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,290
- Huh?
- Take it.

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,870
I think it's helping
with clearing my hectic mind.

81
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,840
Thanks.

82
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,380
You're asking me
to leave the office?

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,050
An internal audit
for the Louis B project is still underway.

84
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,880
Nothing has been proven,

85
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,880
so why must I take responsibility?

86
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,520
I wanted to wait
until the internal audit was concluded,

87
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,320
but our directors were highly concerned
about our business...

88
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,790
and became greatly worried.

89
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,930
We released a correction
on Chairman Hwang...

90
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,700
explaining he was framed
for something you did,

91
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,970
but the public is still enraged.

92
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,740
Also, we must show internally that
we're taking a necessary measure.

93
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,310
The employees can
also see and hear everything,

94
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,710
so we must take action.

95
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,820
Please calm down.

96
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,980
Director Kang Mi Ran
cares the most...

97
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,650
about YL Group.

98
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,390
Isn't that so, Director Kang?

99
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,520
You wouldn't use YL Group...

100
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,260
as a shield to protect yourself,
just to defend yourself.

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
I'll leave my office
until the internal audit...

102
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,470
is over.

103
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,540
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

104
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,230
(Oh Seong)

105
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,870
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

106
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,170
You will be charged after the tone.

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,560
It's strange to see you like this.

108
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,830
How does it feel to be betrayed
by someone closest to you?

109
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,100
You probably don't remember,

110
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,470
but I got a taste of how
you must've felt when you were...

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
once wrongfully framed.

112
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,470
No, you couldn't have
gotten a taste.

113
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,580
It hurts...

114
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,380
about 100 times,

115
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,650
no, 1,000 times more
to be betrayed...

116
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,390
by your family.

117
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,840
I left the file you wanted
on your desk.

118
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,340
I have to go to a meeting.

119
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,940
Are you disappointed that
I didn't take Aunt Mi Ran's side?

120
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,980
I also had
a load on my conscience, so no.

121
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,810
Whatever you did was right.

122
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,380
You don't have to mind me.

123
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,260
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

124
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,870
How long will you stand there?

125
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,670
You finally noticed.

126
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,040
How can you humiliate me like this?

127
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,110
How can my husband, of all people,

128
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,410
do that in front of Jae In?

129
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,010
Then, you shouldn't have done
something I told you not to.

130
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,580
You were the one
who always ignored my warnings.

131
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,860
I'm sorry.
I promise to be careful from now on.

132
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:40,160
- When I go home today...
- No.

133
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,590
Don't even dream
of returning for a while.

134
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,400
This is why I'm furious.

135
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,500
How can you stop me from going home
just because Jae In's there?

136
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,940
Go out and ask anyone...

137
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,940
if they can understand
this situation!

138
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,340
Why do I need
a stranger's understanding?

139
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,010
This is my family affair.

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,680
You always listened
to everything I said.

141
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,180
How can you change so much?

142
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,420
Honey, stop trusting
only what Jae In says...

143
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,150
and please trust me, too.

144
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,750
Jae In wasn't why I changed.

145
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,590
It was you.

146
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,230
And you were the one
who betrayed my trust.

147
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,600
You know why I did that.

148
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,060
I told you everything.

149
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,600
I did it out of my love for you.

150
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,270
Isn't that enough?

151
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,270
Sit around quietly for Ji Ho's sake.

152
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,310
I'll call you back in good time,
so leave.

153
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,350
All right. I'll do as you say.

154
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,540
Oh Seong.

155
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,870
Yes? What's up?
Is there anything else to do?

156
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,710
Aren't you busy?

157
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,250
Why are you doing this here?

158
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,050
Physical work is much better
than staring at numbers and words...

159
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,120
when my thoughts are jumbled,
because it helps clear my mind.

160
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,960
I had to do this. Otherwise,
I would've gone back out to sea.

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,660
Don't even bring that up.

162
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,960
That's just fleeing from reality.

163
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,100
It wasn't even a job you loved.
Don't ever say that again.

164
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,270
I'm just saying.

165
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,830
Isn't it great
that I got to give you a hand?

166
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,340
Min Jun finally got the break
he needed, too.

167
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,670
It's benefitting three people.

168
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,770
Me, you, and Min Jun.

169
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,380
Then, let me get a massage
across the hallway...

170
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,750
while you're here.

171
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,150
Please be my guest. You should go.

172
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,080
All right.

173
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,830
(Kang Mi Ran)

174
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,120
I thought of trying this out...

175
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,590
whenever my body ached.

176
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,650
You should come by often.

177
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,190
And please speak casually with me.

178
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,660
- Shall I?
- Sure.

179
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,470
Gosh, that just warmed up my back...

180
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
and got rid of all my sore muscles.

181
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,510
Does this also help
with blood circulation?

182
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,910
Yes.

183
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,550
Excuse me.

184
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,620
Are you done?
Why don't we call it a day early?

185
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,850
Sure. Let's do that.

186
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,260
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

187
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,590
I'll take
everything she tried out today.

188
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,130
Hey.

189
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,130
Don't try to stop me.

190
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,160
It helps to splurge
when I'm feeling down,

191
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,770
so that's why I'm doing it.

192
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,070
It's all for my sake.

193
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,320
So? Do you feel better...

194
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,790
after spending some money?

195
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,460
I feel even better
because I spent it on you.

196
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,030
Anyway, thank you for this.

197
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,580
I'm home.

198
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,410
Hey, Gi Man!

199
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,150
Did you get discharged
without trouble, Gi Man?

200
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
Welcome back, Gi Man. I'm so glad.

201
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,590
Hello.

202
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,890
Hello.

203
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,960
I want to do it over.

204
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,600
Hello.

205
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,060
- Was that good?
- Yes.

206
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,470
You don't have to do that
when you're with me, brother.

207
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,240
Brother?

208
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,310
Why am I his brother?

209
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,610
He's your younger brother, Gi Man.

210
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,980
Gi Chan is the second son,

211
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,180
and I, Na Ra, am the youngest.

212
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,780
No way.

213
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,050
Gi Chan is smaller than me.

214
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,750
He's not this big.

215
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,720
That was when we were young, Gi Man.

216
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,460
I grew taller than you
once I got into high school.

217
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,600
Whatever. You're bigger than me,
so you aren't my younger brother.

218
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,430
You're my older brother, Gi Chan.

219
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,970
Jeez. This was what Mom wanted.

220
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,540
She always hoped
Gi Chan was her eldest son.

221
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,910
Darn it.
Are you trying to curse him?

222
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,510
I never wanted him to be an idiot.

223
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,550
This looks great! Let's eat, Ji Ho.

224
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,250
Okay, Uncle Gi Man.

225
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,480
I'm not your uncle.

226
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,220
Right. Gi Man.

227
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,720
Dig in.

228
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,360
You can have this, pretty lady.

229
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,230
Thank you, Gi Man.

230
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,600
What about me?

231
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,840
You're not as pretty, lady.
You can serve yourself.

232
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,410
I'm not some lady.
I'm your younger sister!

233
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,810
Hey, watermelon.

234
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,980
Cheers.

235
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,890
I'm leaving, Mom.

236
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,960
All right. Goodbye.

237
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,230
- Be careful out there.
- Okay.

238
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,740
I'll get off early after conducting
the due diligence at a few places,

239
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,200
so I'll pick up Bo Ram
and go to your restaurant.

240
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,140
I'd be grateful.

241
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,340
You haven't fetched her for a while,
so she'll be happy to see you.

242
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,950
- You should go.
- Okay.

243
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,220
I can't believe
you keep coming to work.

244
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,750
You're one persistent girl.

245
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,060
Jae In, go ahead
and smile all you want when you can.

246
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,360
I'll wipe that smile off your face.

247
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
I can mess with you, too.

248
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,640
Designer Kang, we're at work.

249
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,170
Stop chatting and do your job right.

250
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,210
Sure, Team Leader Kang Se Ri.

251
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,710
I'm going out to work,
so call me if anything happens.

252
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,360
Hello?

253
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,230
Is that you, Jae In?

254
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,700
Yes, Jae In. Is something going on?

255
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,340
Where?

256
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,540
Where is that? I'm not so sure.

257
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,680
Yeongun Arcade?

258
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,510
I know that place very well.

259
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,350
All right. I'll be there now.

260
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,020
She wanted to see me here,

261
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,090
but I don't see her.

262
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,570
Mom.

263
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,740
Who are you?

264
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,470
It's me, Mom. Jae In.

265
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,210
You are?

266
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,580
Yes, it's you, Jae In.

267
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,950
I had something else on my mind.

268
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,050
It's a date,

269
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,650
so let's go.

270
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,320
It's been a while. Let's do that.

271
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,790
Let's go.

272
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,560
Ms. Mi Sook!

273
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,700
What do you think you're doing?

274
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,400
Get your hand off her!

275
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,470
Hey, who are you?
Why are you shouting at my daughter?

276
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,140
Your daughter?

277
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,510
Mind your own business.

278
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,780
Let's go.

279
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,640
How is she your daughter?

280
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,210
She's not your girl.

281
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,480
Why are you saying that?

282
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,220
Jae In is my daughter,
not anyone else's.

283
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,420
Open your eyes widely
and take a good look.

284
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,290
She's not Ms. Kang Jae In.

285
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,800
She's not my daughter?

286
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,930
Who are you?

287
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,370
Let's go somewhere and talk.

288
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,040
Get your hand off her!

289
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,540
What's going on?

290
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,850
Goodness. What is it?

291
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,320
She must be startled.

292
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,860
She needs to get some rest.

293
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,790
I don't think Ms. Do is around.
What do I do?

294
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,460
I feel bad for Ms. Mi Sook.

295
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,470
Let's take her home, Grandma.

296
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,540
All right. Let's do that.

297
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,090
Mi Sook.

298
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,160
You're at my place.

299
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,960
You looked tired,
so I brought you here.

300
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,890
Don't be alarmed,
and get a good sleep.

301
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,970
What is it? Do you need something?

302
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,410
Do you remember
what happened at my restaurant?

303
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,880
She'll be better off not knowing.

304
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,820
Listen up.

305
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,190
It doesn't matter
if you know someone.

306
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,420
If someone seems evil,
don't go with them.

307
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,120
Don't let go of yourself.

308
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,190
Pull yourself together,

309
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,200
and do your thing.

310
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,330
Startle them with your charisma.
Can you do that?

311
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,110
Are you going somewhere?

312
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,780
Are you in your right mind?

313
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,720
I'm the sinner.

314
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,200
I don't even know
how to apologize...

315
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,900
for everything I did.

316
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,240
I'm deeply sorry.

317
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,800
I am so sorry.

318
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,510
What happened to Ms. Kim Do Hee...

319
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,150
is all on me.

320
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,220
It's my fault.

321
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,490
I'll do everything as you say.

322
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,390
If you tell me to end my life,
I'll do that.

323
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,330
Thank you
for letting Jae In stay with you...

324
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,770
when she had nowhere else to go.

325
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,540
I won't forget it as long as I live.

326
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,150
Even when my memories disappear,

327
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,250
I'll remember it...

328
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,120
with my heart.

329
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,690
So what if you remember that?

330
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,790
Remembering won't bring Do Hee back!

331
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,100
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,700
I'm so sorry.

333
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,540
If I wanted
to get Do Hee's revenge...

334
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,870
by taking your life,
I would've done so ages ago.

335
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,480
Your case is still under trial.

336
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,610
Abide by the court's ruling
and pay the price accordingly.

337
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,950
That's what I want.

338
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,350
So, don't lose your mind
and stay alert.

339
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,290
Do not use your condition
to reduce the sentence!

340
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,390
Do you understand?

341
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm sorry.

342
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,650
Uncle Do Yun,
can Ms. Mi Sook have some juice?

343
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,850
Yes, but wait just a little.

344
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,220
The two ladies are talking.

345
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,320
You can drink that
and give her some later.

346
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,850
But this was for Ms. Mi Sook.

347
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,320
All right.

348
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,140
It's me. Well...

349
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,170
Your mother is at my place.

350
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,580
Yes.

351
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,880
She's getting a good rest,

352
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,920
so don't worry
and come home after work.

353
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,790
All right. Thank you, Mr. Do.

354
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,100
Thank you
for dropping my mom off, Do Yun.

355
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,500
Jae In.

356
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,740
This afternoon...

357
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,410
Se Ri did that?

358
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,810
She pretended to me and did that?

359
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,650
It would've gone very badly
if I had gotten there a little later.

360
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,290
Were you aware
of your mother's condition?

361
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,130
Yes.

362
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,100
Does Hwang Gi Chan know?
He lived with her, too.

363
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,070
Probably.

364
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,610
Recently, Mr. Do said...

365
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,810
he went to get my mom
because she was alone with Gi Chan.

366
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,580
He said...

367
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,150
it looked like Gi Chan knew
about my mom's condition.

368
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,850
Kang Se Ri also seemed to know
about her medical condition.

369
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,290
That must've been
why she took advantage of my name.

370
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,140
How dare you mess with my mom,

371
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,780
even though you knew she was unwell?

372
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,050
What the heck are you talking about?
Get your hand off me!

373
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,320
This is just the beginning
of your misery.

374
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,590
Mark my words, Se Ri.

375
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,260
I can do the same to you.

376
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,030
How would you feel
when I take away...

377
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,930
something most precious to you?

378
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,970
Are you threatening me
by saying you'll mess with Ji Ho?

379
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,810
How do you call yourself human?

380
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,950
You were a mother, too.

381
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,020
How can you blackmail me
with my child?

382
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,860
What about you?
Are you less than beasts?

383
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,990
Was that...

384
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,560
why you killed my son, Eun Ho?

385
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,600
Do not lay a finger
or touch a hair...

386
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,270
on people in my life.

387
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,400
Everything I just said
isn't just empty words.

388
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,050
Honey, Jae In knows everything.

389
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,680
You must get her out of that house.

390
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,390
I have to return to protect Ji Ho.

391
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,550
He's in danger!

392
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,490
This time, are you using him
as an excuse?

393
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,460
Jae In may do something to him.

394
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,060
Please let me see him.

395
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,300
She thinks Ji Ho is her son.

396
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,670
You saw how much she adores him.

397
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,740
Did you think I'd believe you?

398
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,400
Honey.

399
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,110
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

400
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,710
He's doing so well
that he doesn't even miss you.

401
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,510
You'll confuse him more
if you meet him, so do not do anything.

402
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,710
Wake up, Gi Chan!

403
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,880
Fine.

404
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,550
Let's say Jae In doesn't remember
just as you think.

405
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,390
What if her memories return?

406
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,760
Do you think she'll take you back?

407
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,660
You and Jae In
have been over for a long time!

408
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,230
That's my business.

409
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,100
Honey, please look at me.

410
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,000
Please look at me.

411
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,110
You said
you had to recruit Designer L.

412
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,910
I'll do that.

413
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,780
I'll do whatever it takes
to recruit the designer...

414
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,020
and secure your position
as the chairman forever.

415
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,990
Just trust me.

416
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,460
What are you doing here, Se Ri?

417
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,760
I told you
to stay away from my husband.

418
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,300
I just told him
about everything you did.

419
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,670
Why do you ask?
Did you run over here in fright?

420
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,540
I just heard your conversation
on my way in.

421
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,280
You don't have to recruit
Designer L.

422
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,510
You don't have to try, Se Ri.

423
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,850
Did you do it?

424
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,580
Yes.

425
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,750
I sent a collaboration proposal
through a friend of mine...

426
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,290
and received a positive answer.

427
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,390
I sent your e-mail address,
so you can take charge...

428
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,690
of the details of the contract.

429
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,130
I'll do that. I'll offer
the best deal in the industry.

430
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,970
Thank you, honey.

431
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,340
I told you to trust me.

432
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,020
YL Group recruited Designer L?

433
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,660
Yes, we planned on
contacting the designer...

434
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,460
just as you suggested last time,

435
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,200
but Hwang Gi Chan did it first.

436
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,870
What do we do?

437
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,400
Nothing will change drastically
just because L joined the business.

438
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,970
You already know that.

439
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,540
But I sure am curious...

440
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,440
to find out who Designer L is.

441
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,780
- Where's Designer Kang?
- She's not at work yet.

442
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:06,820
Are you going somewhere?

443
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,330
This isn't my only investment,
so I'm a busy man.

444
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,600
You must be quite free.

445
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,970
Designer L is coming today.

446
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,700
Oh, my.

447
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,670
That doesn't sound like
great news for us.

448
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,410
If the designer will be here soon,
we should say hello, too.

449
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,450
Is she the one?

450
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,500
Hello.

451
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,670
I'm Designer L.

452
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,720
(Queen's House)

453
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Are you pretending to be L
to take responsibility...

454
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,090
because the designer
suddenly revoked the contract?

455
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,030
Talk to me.

456
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,100
Gi Chan, do you still not get it?

457
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,000
You can't be this slow and dull.

458
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,540
Then, it'd be such a shame
that you made me suffer.

459
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,940
Wait, so Designer L was...
You were that designer?

460
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,880
I forgot to mention it.

461
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,350
I had noticed,

462
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,650
although I wasn't sure.

463
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,880
You're like a family of frauds.

464
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,450
You don't get to say that.
You're a fraud.

465
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,920
Stop introducing yourself.

466
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,760
Shout out, "Die, Hwang Gi Chan,"
in the lobby tomorrow...

467
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,360
and charge at him,
then, I'll jump in.

468
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,360
You can stab me lightly
at that time.

469
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,970
How... How can this be?

470
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,110
