1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,870
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,180
(Episode 12)

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,230
Goodness.
You didn't even finish half of that.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,990
I'll eat some more
if I get hungry later.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,630
How's Seung Woo?

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,100
He must be in great shock.
Is he okay?

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,910
He thinks
Mom took the blame for him.

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,870
He would've known
if the news articles were out.

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,510
Did you stop the press?

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,250
Dad was greatly concerned
that Seung Woo would be hurt.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,050
Everyone is keeping quiet
because he asked us to wait...

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,480
until he talks to Seung Woo himself.

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,790
Did you also have no idea...

16
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,230
he wasn't your actual brother?

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,860
Not at all.

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,630
I was too young back then,

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,600
so naturally, I thought
Mom had given birth to him.

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,900
I couldn't imagine
something like this.

21
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,810
I'm going downstairs for a minute.

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,370
Do you need anything?

23
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,510
No, I don't.

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,480
I'll take a nap. You should go.

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,120
Hello.

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,260
Doctor.

27
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,400
Dr. Kim Do Yun?

28
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,210
Did I keep you waiting?

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,350
Did something bad happen to you?

30
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,920
Something suddenly came up.

31
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,820
Please excuse me.

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,870
Do I have an upset stomach?

33
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,810
Yes, you can come after that.

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,340
Goodbye.

35
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,080
Do you remember your friend
who told you to give me that gift?

36
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,510
What's her name?

37
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,420
- I have to say something before...
- No, tell me.

38
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,250
I need to know her name first.
Or just the last name.

39
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,320
Kang Jae In.

40
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,790
She's a Kang?

41
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,800
The one who killed Do Hee was
Kang Seung Woo's mother,

42
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,030
not her colleague, Kang Seung Woo.

43
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,700
Is Ms. Kang Jae In's mother...

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,340
the same person
as Kang Seung Woo's mother?

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,580
I only found out yesterday.

46
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,850
I wanted to tell you today...

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,510
Do Yun!

48
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,830
What if you end up
getting hurt badly?

49
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,360
Why won't you think of your family?

50
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,230
How would I feel
if no one helped my family...

51
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,200
when we were in trouble?

52
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,270
I'm saving good karma
in case that happens.

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
If you ever get into trouble,

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,770
I want someone
to step in and help just like me.

55
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,840
I got the gift. Thank you.

56
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,910
You saved Eun Ho's life.

57
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,380
We can't thank you enough.

58
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,920
It's too harsh to make him
an ex-convict after one mistake.

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,750
I'll compensate you
as much as you want.

60
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,220
Think of it
as a present from the deceased.

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,420
Jae In's mom gave him herbal tonics
good for his stomach,

62
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,350
so I heard he had been taking them.

63
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,020
Then, he should've gotten better.

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,830
Why do you think it was perforated?

65
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,000
What are you up to?

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,730
Why are you glaring at that
instead of taking it?

67
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,640
Try it.

68
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,370
What?
I haven't taken a single bag...

69
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,070
since the last time you caught me.
I mean it.

70
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,910
Yes, so try it.

71
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,780
Here. Now.

72
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,620
You can't get mad at me. Okay?

73
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,730
Does it hurt your stomach?

74
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,130
Does it sting
as if you have a hole there?

75
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,170
Are you in pain? How bad is it?

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,640
I'm joking.

77
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,640
No one gets sick
after taking an herbal tonic.

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,910
Good grief. You shouldn't
joke around about that.

79
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,780
Did she give me a decent box?

80
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,180
Was this her way of smiling
at the person she hates?

81
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,890
I need to know what's in here...

82
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,750
to nitpick over this.

83
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,360
It already feels unfair
beyond measure.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,130
What is this?
I thought this was a diet snack.

85
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,960
Oh, my gosh. It's over 200 calories.

86
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,100
Darn it. What's in this?

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,770
Rice. Salt. Wheat.

88
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,370
Can you tell what's inside?

89
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,480
Of course. You can find everything
in the nutrition facts.

90
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,920
Nothing's on this.

91
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,550
If you want to find out, you can.

92
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,620
I can? How?

93
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,050
Do you have to know?

94
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,690
You can send it for a test
to find the ingredients.

95
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
Ms. Jae In is at the hospital.

96
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,360
I know that.

97
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,570
I'm going to take my son,

98
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,700
Director Hwang Gi Chan's clothes
and go to the hospital.

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,270
- Na Ra.
- Yes?

100
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,540
- Let her show the way. Go get it.
- Okay.

101
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,540
Well, I can take those
to Ms. Jae In.

102
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,350
Are you trying to act like
you're a part of the family?

103
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,650
I'm here to take my son's clothes
as Jae In's mother-in-law.

104
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,620
How dare you try to stop me?

105
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,450
I'll call my daughter-in-law
and say something.

106
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,620
I'm sorry.
Let me bring them for you.

107
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,360
That's more like it.

108
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,190
Na Ra, go with her.

109
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,260
Okay.

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,200
Gosh, this place looks so nice
every single time I come by.

111
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,510
It'd be great if this were my place.

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,510
Oh, my. I shouldn't get distracted.

113
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,780
Where did she hide it?

114
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,820
Goodness. I can't find anything
in this huge place.

115
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,690
Wait. Is this it?

116
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,670
Whoa. Mom?

117
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Who are you, old lady?

118
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,970
Well...

119
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,580
Can you bring me that?

120
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,610
Here.

121
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,390
That rude little punk.

122
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,060
Mr. Seung Woo,
you need to stop drinking!

123
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,730
Mom, what are you doing here?
Why aren't you coming?

124
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,130
Did you find it?

125
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,860
I can't believe...

126
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,400
I just handed over a drink
to Jae In's brother.

127
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,230
Let's go.

128
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,000
Ms. Choi did that? Why?

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,370
She mistook that woman
as Gi Chan's mistress.

130
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,140
Jae In must be in shock.

131
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,910
She must be.

132
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,280
And Gi Chan is now hospitalized,

133
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,420
so things have been hectic
for the last few days.

134
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,890
I see.

135
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,950
I should go.

136
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,720
I have to be somewhere else.

137
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,590
You should see your patients.

138
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,130
Yes.

139
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,000
Anyway, who are you meeting?

140
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,260
You're very dressed up.

141
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,530
I should show some decency
when I meet other people.

142
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,470
Actually, I've been
looking for a job.

143
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,110
I'm still furious
and disappointed...

144
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,680
that they fired you.

145
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,180
That really isn't the case.

146
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,280
I was bored,

147
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,820
so I wanted to work for fun.

148
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,320
Is Gi Man doing well?

149
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,050
So? How's his business?

150
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,890
He quit his business and began to help out
with Mother's business.

151
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,190
I see.

152
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,990
I hope it goes well.

153
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,530
It will.

154
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,030
Gi Man and I'll come to your place
next weekend or something.

155
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,240
I forgot to tell you.

156
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,840
I sold that house. I'm moving.

157
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,640
What?

158
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,310
Wait, when did you do that?

159
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,810
Why?

160
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,180
By any chance,
were you in need of money?

161
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,490
What do you mean?
I got enough severance pay.

162
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,160
I lived in the same house
for too long,

163
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,460
so I needed some change.

164
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm throwing away my old things
and cleaning it out, so it's a mess.

165
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,900
You can come by after I move.

166
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,930
I'll go now.
You don't have to see me off.

167
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,700
- Have a great day.
- Okay.

168
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,140
Bye, Dad.

169
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,250
Oh, Mr. Do.

170
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,150
I was just about to call you.
This is great.

171
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,490
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

172
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,920
I heard the gist of everything
from Yu Gyeong.

173
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,260
I see. Please come inside.

174
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,630
It's okay.

175
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,860
I wanted to give this to you
and see you before I left.

176
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,570
Were you leaving?

177
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm going home.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,240
I go home at night
because of Eun Ho.

179
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,840
This must be rough for the chairman.

180
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes.

181
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,210
It must be hard for you, too,

182
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,050
but you're the only one
who can hang in there.

183
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,520
You're his eldest child.

184
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,720
Please take good care
of the chairman.

185
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,960
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Do.

186
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,500
And it'd help him the most...

187
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,330
if you returned to work
as soon as possible.

188
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,970
I know Gi Chan is around,

189
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,340
but it'll be more reassuring
to have his daughter there.

190
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,840
You should return to work soon.

191
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,040
Are you going home?

192
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,880
Let me drop this inside
and give you a ride.

193
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,150
I'm fine.
I have to be somewhere else.

194
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,810
Good luck.

195
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,030
What about Bo Ram?

196
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,590
She fell asleep.

197
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,640
Thank you, Oh Seong.

198
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,470
I only lived through everything
because you were here.

199
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,440
Don't say that.
It's the least I can do.

200
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,740
Yun Hee, from now on,
you can continue to depend on me.

201
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,410
You should go back to your job.

202
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,680
I'm fine now.
So, don't worry about me and go.

203
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,780
Didn't you hear what I just said?

204
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,450
You can continue to depend on me.

205
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,720
Are you done working out on the sea?

206
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,330
I'm going to return to my old job.

207
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,500
I only thought of myself
and stayed away for too long.

208
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,230
I'm done wandering around.

209
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,930
It was about time.

210
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,870
Yes, I'm glad
you came to that decision.

211
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,470
I always felt anxious
whenever you left for the sea,

212
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,010
but I couldn't even stop you.

213
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,580
It's not too late for you
to marry someone and settle down.

214
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,580
Goodness, Yun Hee.
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

215
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,320
I just landed.

216
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,820
Give me some time to adapt.

217
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,950
All right.

218
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,520
So, where will you stay?

219
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,390
Of course, I'll live here with you.

220
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,430
I'll do my best
to make up for Do Hee's absence.

221
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
While we're on the subject,

222
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,230
why don't you
put your store up for sale?

223
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,970
You don't have to worry about money.
It's time for you to get some rest.

224
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,670
I'll miss Do Hee even more...

225
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,940
if I sit at home alone
after Bo Ram goes to the kindergarten.

226
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,910
I'll find a shrewd part-timer...

227
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,180
or an employee
to oversee the store at night...

228
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,820
and go out to work
only during the day.

229
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,220
If even that gets too hard,

230
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,560
I'll consider it then.

231
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,930
I'm home.

232
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,630
Hey, you're back.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,030
- Have you had dinner?
- Yes.

234
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,870
Did you drink?

235
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,770
It was a team dinner,
so I had a drink.

236
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,440
I'm tired, so let me get some rest.

237
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,110
It looks like something is going on.

238
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,880
Gosh, Yun Hee.
You don't have to be so worried.

239
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,490
He just said he had a team dinner.

240
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,950
The culprit was finally caught,

241
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,620
so he must've vented
the things piled up in his heart.

242
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,790
They caught the culprit?

243
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,930
When?

244
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,160
Well, it's...

245
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,930
Wait, Yun Hee.

246
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,500
Yun Hee...

247
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,100
Why didn't you tell me
that they caught the culprit?

248
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,240
Calm down, Yun Hee.

249
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,910
I made a slip of the tongue
and told her.

250
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,380
If they caught the culprit,
you should've told me so!

251
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,140
Where is that punk?

252
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,780
At the police station?

253
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,510
I need to go
and see that punk's face.

254
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,720
Whoever it was should've
taken her to the hospital.

255
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,620
How can anyone hit someone
and just run off?

256
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,290
Lead the way.

257
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,030
- I need to go and demand answers!
- Mom.

258
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,260
You can't meet her
during the investigation.

259
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,300
And even if you wanted to,
she'd turn down the request.

260
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,900
"She?" Wasn't it a man?

261
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,240
You said he was her colleague!

262
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,570
What? Her colleague?

263
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,580
So, someone who worked
in the same office did that to her?

264
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,980
It wasn't him.

265
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,650
I'll explain, so please have a seat.

266
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,160
No, that woman
must be taking the blame...

267
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,490
to save her son
from getting locked up.

268
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,260
No mother would do that to her son!

269
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,630
This makes no sense.

270
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,830
I don't care who did it,
the son or the mom.

271
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,800
Why did she do that?

272
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,270
It didn't happen near her office,
and it couldn't be a coincidence.

273
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,640
Why did she do that?

274
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,110
I don't know the reason.

275
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,540
We'll get a call
after the investigation.

276
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,940
I know it's hard,
but let's give it time.

277
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,110
This could probably make headlines,

278
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,050
but how come
I haven't seen a single article?

279
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,750
Is she from an affluent family?

280
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,790
What was that? You know, don't you?

281
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,460
How big of a deal
is her family anyway?

282
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,400
She's the wife
of YL Group's chairman.

283
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,900
The wife of YL Group's chairman?

284
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,870
I only want one thing.

285
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,940
If it were up to me,
I'd like to kill that woman, too.

286
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,580
But all I want is...

287
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,680
for her to receive a punishment
worthy of her crime.

288
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,250
That's all.

289
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,410
Of course, it should happen.

290
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,480
But she's with YL Group.

291
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,490
I've seen news reports
of rich people...

292
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,390
who serve their time
only briefly as a show...

293
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,020
or even none at all.

294
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,530
So, now, I'm not even sure
if she'll be punished.

295
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,800
And if that happens,
how will Do Hee vent her spite?

296
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,630
Uncle Oh Seong is right.

297
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,170
That's not going to happen.

298
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,300
Even if something like that happens,

299
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll stop them.

300
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,040
I'll do whatever it takes...

301
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,770
to make sure she's punished.

302
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,620
Yes, I'm telling you.

303
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,890
Something didn't feel right,

304
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,620
so I had your brother run a test.

305
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,260
I just took the result
and asked an oriental doctor,

306
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,630
and I heard everything in it
makes your stomach condition worse.

307
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,000
It wasn't a tonic,
but more like poison.

308
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,500
My in-law...

309
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,500
I can hardly call her that now.

310
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,670
That evil woman
tried to kill you, too.

311
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,600
I can sit around
and take this kind of injustice.

312
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,170
Calm down, Mom.

313
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,510
I'll check with Jae In.

314
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,980
There's nothing to check for!

315
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,810
All she'll have to do is deny it.

316
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,920
Something worse may happen...

317
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,150
if we turn a blind eye to this.

318
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,350
I need to handle this now
to make sure nothing worse happens.

319
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,620
Bye.

320
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,320
Mom.

321
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,960
Hello?

322
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,330
Daddy!

323
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,970
Hey, there, Eun Ho.

324
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,840
He said he missed you so much,

325
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,540
so I told him to stop by briefly.

326
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,710
Eun Ho, do you know
where the nurses are?

327
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,510
Can you go there
and get one of them?

328
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,950
Are you in pain?

329
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,250
It's okay. Eun Ho can go.

330
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,320
- Go, now.
- Okay.

331
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,030
Do you remember
the herbal tonic I had been taking?

332
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,340
What?

333
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,600
Oh, that one?

334
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,170
I guess it wasn't effective.

335
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,640
I gave it to you
because I heard it was.

336
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,810
Did you order it? Or was it Mother?

337
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,150
If it were Mother,
I thought you also had to know.

338
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,620
I almost died because of that tonic.

339
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,020
What do you mean?

340
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,060
My mom ran a test on the tonic,

341
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,700
and everything was
bad for the stomach.

342
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,200
That's impossible.

343
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,700
I went and got it myself.

344
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,970
It had nothing to do with Mom.

345
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,740
I'll tell Mother.

346
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm sure...

347
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,310
she's seeing your father now.

348
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,180
You know what?

349
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,550
- I couldn't belief what I was...
- Mom.

350
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,650
It's not belief. Believe.

351
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,490
I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

352
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,560
I almost put myself to death
because of the shock.

353
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,860
How does this make any sense?

354
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,890
How can a mother-in-law
try to kill her son-in-law?

355
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,460
I knew she never approved of him,

356
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,970
but how could she do
something this evil?

357
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,000
Mr. Kang, say something.

358
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,410
Why won't you say anything?

359
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,640
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,510
Not only did she kill that woman,

361
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,020
but she tried to kill
my innocent son.

362
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,290
If Gi Chan was seeing
another woman...

363
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,720
who wasn't Jae In,

364
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,490
I'd eat my hat...

365
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,720
and bet my last dollar on it.

366
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,130
No, I'd even pull out my eyes.

367
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,030
Goodness, my poor son.

368
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,600
You must've been
so troubled all along.

369
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,770
The most toxic thing in life is...

370
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,440
for someone to make another
always walk on eggshells.

371
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,650
Your in-laws made you move in,

372
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,650
and all they ever made you do was
work until you drop.

373
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,950
I can't believe
how they treated you so unfairly.

374
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,460
This is an injustice.

375
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,090
My poor son, Gi Chan!

376
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,830
Hey, Jae In. You're here.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,130
Mother, there's a misunderstanding.

378
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,100
My mom didn't give him
the herbal tonic.

379
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,740
It was me.

380
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,710
Then, you and your mother
worked together...

381
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,550
and tried to kill Gi Chan?

382
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,150
- Goodness.
- Mother.

383
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,850
No, Mother.

384
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,120
My close friend
recommended that place to me.

385
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,860
Who's your friend?

386
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,390
Who tried to kill my son?

387
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,860
I'll look more into it
and let you know.

388
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,340
Hey, Jae In. What brings you here?

389
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,310
Do you remember
that oriental hospital?

390
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,970
The one where I got the tonic from.

391
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,340
Yes, what about it?

392
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,740
I asked the hospital,

393
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,780
and he turned out to be
a paid doctor, not the director.

394
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,350
He even quit his job.

395
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,650
Do you have his contact information?

396
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,990
Like his cell phone number?

397
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,350
I don't have that, either.

398
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,620
Why? What is it?

399
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:23,190
The tonic I got from him was toxic,

400
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,530
especially to his stomach.

401
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,370
Are you sure that doctor is famous
in the Korean community in the US?

402
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,930
Of course.
That was why I told you about him.

403
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,940
I'll contact my friends back there
and find out.

404
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,540
Please do that. Bye.

405
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,740
Bye.

406
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,790
Gi Chan's mother must be...

407
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,520
quite obsessed with her son.

408
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,260
So, no one knows?

409
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,290
They all contacted the hospital,

410
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,760
so no one knew. I'm sorry.

411
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,730
All right, then.
I'll call you later.

412
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,740
Please give this to Secretary Yoon.

413
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,810
Yes, ma'am.

414
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,950
Secretary Yoon? It's me.

415
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,950
I just sent you the herbal tonic.
Can you have it tested?

416
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,590
I also need to find someone.

417
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,930
Did you dread the idea
of my return home?

418
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,000
How can you let me stay detained...

419
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,900
and get investigated in jail?

420
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,800
You could've stopped this!

421
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,700
I tried.

422
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,540
I really did.

423
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,270
Stop lying!

424
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,140
I've been deceived my whole life.
Did you think I'd be fooled again?

425
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,940
You're a man
who moves the domestic economy.

426
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,210
You could've pulled your strings
within the legal system.

427
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm not going
to the detention center.

428
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,720
So, get me acquitted now.

429
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,730
Aren't you worried about Seung Woo?

430
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,200
I have my own fish to fry.

431
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,800
Do you think I can spare
any thoughts for your son?

432
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,570
Seung Woo thinks...

433
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,910
you took the blame...

434
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,570
in his place.

435
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,850
He felt so guilty
and began to drink his life away.

436
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,020
Don't you feel bad for him?

437
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,720
Not at all.

438
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,090
I had been more tormented
over the years.

439
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,990
I'm sorry.

440
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,930
What do you mean?

441
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,830
Are you saying
you won't let me walk free?

442
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,630
I never knew this was...

443
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,200
so painful for you.

444
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,270
I might have known,
but I must've decided to look away.

445
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,080
No, I did.

446
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,080
I thought you'd forget everything
and forgive me...

447
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,050
if I continued to be good to you.

448
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,390
It was my fault
for thinking it'd be that easy.

449
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,120
I'm sorry, honey.

450
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,170
Did you think
I'd fall for such words?

451
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,930
How can you be so shameless?

452
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,740
Fine. I'll forgive you.

453
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
So, do whatever you can...

454
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,650
to get me out.

455
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,350
Then, I'll believe
everything you just said.

456
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,450
I'll do my part to carry out
all duties as a husband...

457
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,360
until the day you forgive me.

458
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,320
But this has gone...

459
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,730
far beyond...

460
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,200
the scope of my capability.

461
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,100
An innocent woman...

462
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,770
died.

463
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,300
We should ask for forgiveness...

464
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,340
That woman is not innocent!

465
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,580
She's a home-wrecker!
How is she innocent?

466
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,310
Both you and Gi Chan are the same!

467
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,360
How dare you leave?
I'm not done talking to you!

468
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,390
My crime is nothing
compared to what you did.

469
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,160
Get me out of here now.

470
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,860
Go talk to the Chief Justice
or the Minister of Law!

471
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,930
Meet whoever you need to
and get me out of here!

472
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,880
Why did you come here?

473
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,280
I already knew Jae In wasn't here.

474
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,420
You look awful.

475
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,490
Are you still in lots of pain?

476
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,690
I'm fine.

477
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,830
And be careful.
What if someone sees you?

478
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,260
Don't come here anymore.

479
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,560
Do you know
what happened at work today?

480
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,530
So, you know.

481
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,700
Jae In and her mom are the same.

482
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,810
How can they do that to your tonic?

483
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,940
She wouldn't do that.

484
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,980
I'm sure there was a mistake.

485
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,580
How can you side with someone
who tried to kill you?

486
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,250
Aren't you scared?

487
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,150
How long will you live like this?

488
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,520
Isn't that a good enough reason
to divorce her?

489
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,120
It won't be long.

490
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,160
YL Group will become...

491
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,760
our wedding present very soon.

492
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,160
Wait just a little longer.

493
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,400
Really? Do you mean it?

494
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,010
Hey, Yu Gyeong.

495
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,510
What brings you here?

496
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,650
I came to say hi before I went home.

497
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,820
Why are you here?

498
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,020
What do you mean?
I had to report something about work.

499
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,820
I'm fine, Yu Gyeong.

500
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,190
You should go.

501
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,830
Goodbye.

502
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,100
Hey, Jae In.

503
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,630
I'm at the hospital.

504
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,340
I'm running an errand
for Director Kang.

505
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,510
I was about to leave.

506
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,270
You want to see me?

507
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,510
Why don't we ask Yu Gyeong, too?

508
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,850
Really? All right.

509
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,290
I'm sorry.
She wants to see me alone.

510
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,000
Why did you want to see me?

511
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,230
It's that oriental doctor
you referred me to.

512
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,870
That doctor?
It's breaking my heart, too.

513
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,670
I told you about him
because he was really good.

514
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,970
- I found him.
- You found him?

515
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,340
How?

516
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,940
He was gambling at a casino.

517
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,240
I'm handing him over to the police.

518
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,110
Which police station is it?

519
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,550
I need to go and ask...

520
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,450
how he ended up
making a mistake like that.

521
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,290
Do you really think
it was a mistake?

522
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
What? It probably was.

523
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,260
A doctor
wouldn't do that on purpose.

524
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,630
I thought we should all meet
before he got arrested,

525
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
so I called him here.

526
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,840
She was the woman.
She made me do it.

527
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,940
Doctor, Jae In already knows
I asked you to help her.

528
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,080
I said he had a weak stomach,
so he needed help with that.

529
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,710
Don't you remember the phone call?

530
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,180
No, that's not true.
It was the other way around.

531
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,280
- She asked me to hurt his...
- Why are you blaming me...

532
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,820
for the mistake you made?

533
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,490
I clearly told you
to make something that'd help him.

534
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,550
Stop lying.

535
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,760
Jae In,
don't believe a word he says.

536
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,560
Why would I do that?

537
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,630
You can check
the CCTV footage at the hospital.

538
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,900
She came and asked me in person,

539
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,070
so it must've been caught on camera.

540
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,840
Someone who toys around
with people's lives...

541
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,540
doesn't qualify to work as a doctor.

542
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,340
Hand him over to the police.

543
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,580
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,350
Wait. One moment.

545
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,080
Wait a moment!

546
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,950
She made me do it! I'm telling you!

547
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,850
Hey!

548
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,290
Jae In, I'm sorry.

549
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,220
What I did was wrong.

550
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,230
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

551
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,730
I didn't want to kill your husband.

552
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,070
I just got a bit jealous,

553
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,100
so I asked him
to hurt your husband a little.

554
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,570
I didn't know the tonic would
turn out that strong.

555
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,870
You were jealous?

556
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,240
Actually,

557
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,480
my husband and I
aren't on good terms.

558
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,610
He's still in America.

559
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,350
That was why I couldn't bring him
to our couples' night.

560
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,450
I got jealous after seeing
how you two were still in love.

561
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,360
You seemed to have everything,
including so much happiness.

562
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,790
I wanted to see you
just a little miserable.

563
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,270
I'm sorry, Jae In.

564
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,300
What I did was wrong.

565
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,400
What are you doing? Get up.

566
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,310
Do you remember back in high school?

567
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,540
My mom knelt before your mom
at school...

568
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,940
and begged her for forgiveness.

569
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,050
Get up.

570
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,920
I was told
not to even tread on your shadow.

571
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,250
I'm so sorry.

572
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,390
What if your family found out?

573
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,370
I'll keep this incident between us.

574
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm too ashamed
to tell my husband...

575
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,670
or my mother-in-law
that my friend was behind this.

576
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,210
Fortunately, his surgery went well,

577
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,380
and he was all right.

578
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,940
So, I'll let it pass.

579
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,680
Thank you, Jae In.

580
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,050
Thank you so much.

581
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,880
What I did was so wrong.

582
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,690
Don't ever let this happen again.

583
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,960
I don't want to lose you.

584
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,160
This was a mistake.

585
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,560
It won't happen again.

586
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,290
If you tell me to promise, I will.

587
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,300
Let me apologize once again
for what my mom did...

588
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,600
to you and your mother.

589
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,780
Let's go. I have to go home.

590
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,210
You should go.

591
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,780
I need to calm down before I leave.

592
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,320
I'll be fine. You should go.

593
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,950
I want to sit alone.

594
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,730
Okay. I'll go, then.

595
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,210
Forgiveness?

596
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,380
Jae In, you will lose me.

597
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,150
I'm going to abandon you.

598
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,220
Aunt Mi Ran! Don't try to stop me
from bringing my mom home!

599
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,690
She's at the police station.
How will you get her home?

600
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,020
Seung Woo, you're drunk.

601
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,190
Go upstairs and get some sleep.

602
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,630
Sleep it off,
and we'll talk tomorrow.

603
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,260
I'll turn myself in!

604
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:00,960
I'll turn myself in
and bring Mom back!

605
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,870
So, move aside!

606
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,730
Stop talking nonsense!

607
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,900
You didn't do anything.
Why would you turn yourself in?

608
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,140
You idiot!

609
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,410
You're too old to be doing this.

610
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,010
Gyu Cheol.

611
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,250
How long will you cry and whine
looking for your mother?

612
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,580
You're an adult, so act like one!

613
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,450
If you feel bad for your mom,

614
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,120
quit drinking immediately...

615
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,850
and return to work
starting tomorrow!

616
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,320
What's more important to you?
Your business or Mom?

617
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,360
I choose Mom!

618
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,960
You...

619
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,260
I need some cold water.

620
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,200
You're still not in your right mind.

621
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
That's enough, Gyu Cheol.

622
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,140
Seung Woo, you need to stop
and go upstairs now.

623
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,410
You little punk!

624
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,310
Don't you think you're too harsh?

625
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,120
He didn't do anything wrong.
Why did you slap him?

626
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,620
How long will you keep it a secret?

627
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,150
He needs to know!

628
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,520
You need to stop, too.

629
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,620
I'm not in the mood to bicker.

630
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,540
(VIP Ward)

631
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,180
Mom, I need to go to the restroom.

632
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
I have to fix my makeup.

633
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,810
You're here to see your brother
get discharged. Why would you do that?

634
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,850
You never know. My future husband...

635
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,080
might be working here.

636
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,320
I'll be quick.

637
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,360
(VIP Ward)

638
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,740
Goodness...

639
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,730
No...

640
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,870
My sister died...

641
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,370
because of you.

642
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,810
You...

643
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,280
also need to die.

644
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,610
Do Yun...

645
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,600
(Queen's House)

646
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:22,300
Tell me the truth.

647
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,030
You're having an affair, aren't you?

648
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,240
I clearly saw you two kissing.

649
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,400
Just pretend like you never saw it.

650
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,970
What is wrong with you?
You'll be in so much trouble.

651
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,540
Only I'll end up betrayed
if he never divorces her...

652
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,250
after I take his word
and wait around quietly.

653
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,920
I don't want to divorce her.

654
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,520
That kind of idea
never occurred to me.

655
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,260
My feelings for Jae In...

656
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,090
haven't changed.
