(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,710
I heard someone was here. Who is it?

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,250
Give it a moment.

6
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,020
(Episode 2)

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,090
It's for Eun Ho's mother,

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,930
but we don't know who it's from.

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,680
Goodness, Jae In.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,840
- Jae In.
- Jae In.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,550
- Jae In.
- Jae In, wake up.

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,780
- Jae In.
- Jae In.

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,180
What is this?

14
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,950
Is this blood?

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,320
- Goodness, Eun Ho. My grandson.
- My gosh.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,820
You need to calm down.
Everything will be fine.

17
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,330
Call Director Park right away.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,960
My goodness.

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,430
Goodness. Where is...

20
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,600
Ms. Do, your in-law, is here.

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,640
Yes, tell her to come in right away.

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,310
Jae In.

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,910
I don't deserve to be a dad.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,650
I had no idea my son went missing,

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,180
completely mesmerized by you.

26
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,280
I was in such a thrill
that I couldn't hear anything.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,050
How can I call myself a dad?

28
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,290
No, I can't do that.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,390
- I don't deserve to say that.
- No.

30
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,630
You have all the right to be a dad.

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,730
You love and adore Eun Ho so much.

32
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,130
Nothing will happen.

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,370
Don't blame yourself.

34
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,610
Hello?

35
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,720
I'll call you.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,320
Gi Chan!

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,890
What about Eun Ho?

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,900
Let's go inside and talk.

39
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,920
Why won't she wake up?

40
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,820
Are you sure she's okay?

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,190
Yes, don't worry.
She'll wake up soon.

42
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,940
Jae In!

43
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,610
Mom, where's Eun Ho? Is he asleep?

44
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,150
No! Eun Ho. No.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,920
- No.
- What are you doing?

46
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,360
- Stay in bed a bit longer.
- Yes, Jae In.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,620
How can I stay in bed?

48
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,560
I don't even know how Eun Ho is...

49
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,900
I'll go out and find him.

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,900
You don't know where he is.

51
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,630
He's looking for me.

52
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,100
He keeps looking for his mommy.

53
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,070
I can hear him cry.

54
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,310
I keep hearing him, Mom.

55
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,540
I'll find him. I have to.

56
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,010
Jae In.

57
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,550
Gi Man, why don't you
escort her back home?

58
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,920
It'll be a huge trouble
if she collapses.

59
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,390
Right.

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
I was going to ask my wife
to take her home.

61
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,100
Ms. Noh, please calm down.

62
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,870
We asked the police
to intervene actively again.

63
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,600
They're coming here after opening
the investigation headquarters,

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,270
so we'll find him soon.

65
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,010
How can such an affluent family...

66
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,140
the whole nation knows of...

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,250
have so much trouble
catching some kidnapper?

68
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,020
He's your grandson, Mr. Chairman.

69
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,150
I am deeply sorry.

70
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,290
Honey, you have to stop Jae In!

71
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,460
Jae In!

72
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,060
Where are you going?

73
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,630
Have you found Eun Ho?

74
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,000
I thought you went out to find him.

75
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,700
No.

76
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,470
I heard Eun Ho's toy was
delivered here.

77
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,580
Find him.

78
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,780
You're his dad.

79
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,210
Bring him back.

80
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,790
Bring Eun Ho back home now!

81
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,950
Right now...

82
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,160
Hey, Jae In.

83
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,230
Honey, bring Eun Ho home. Please?

84
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,730
You're his dad.

85
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,800
You have to do something!

86
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,400
I feel like I'll die now.

87
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,140
I'll die without Eun Ho, honey.

88
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,610
Eun Ho...

89
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,810
Goodness.

90
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,150
Why is she blaming Gi Chan?
He's innocent.

91
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,180
Mom, please.

92
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,160
It's Eun Ho.

93
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,960
Honey, it's Eun Ho.

94
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,500
It's Eun Ho.

95
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,730
Yes, Eun Ho is still alive,

96
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,300
and we'll find him.

97
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,550
(Central Operating Center)

98
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,720
(Surgical Time,
Current Time, Anesthesia Time)

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,180
(Surgical Time)

100
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,870
I found it. Kelly clamps.

101
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,050
One more.

102
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,790
Suture.

103
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,210
Cut it.

104
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,090
Do you have a detector
on your fingertips?

105
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,460
How did you find it right away?

106
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,630
I'll treat you to good food,
so teach me the secret.

107
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,200
Life depends
on the tip of my fingers,

108
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,030
so I go in with the thought...

109
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,970
that I won't let any patient
who gets on my table die.

110
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,440
The Saving Hand sounds much cooler
than the Killing Hand, right?

111
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,940
What?

112
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,210
Dr. Kim.

113
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,350
You were very cool today.

114
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,420
Good work.

115
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,490
Good for you.

116
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,220
Our bosses love you
because of your talent,

117
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,930
the patients' guardians praise you,

118
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,230
and the nurses became your fans...

119
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,930
because you're too pretty
for your own good.

120
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm so jealous of you.

121
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,270
Good grief.
Don't say it like it's a bad thing.

122
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,570
Try to be positive and call me...

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,300
a pretty boy.

124
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,170
Grandma.

125
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,440
Hey, my pumpkin.

126
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,240
Thank you.

127
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,580
You're so cute, my pumpkin.

128
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,750
I adore you to death, my dear.

129
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,350
Grandma, do I have to look ugly?

130
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,950
It'll be nice to look cute.
Why should you be ugly?

131
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,820
Because I can't let you die.

132
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,030
My mommy and uncle will
become sad and cry,

133
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,630
and I will, too.

134
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,800
I want to live with you
for a very long time.

135
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,840
I should've worded myself better.

136
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,300
You're so cute, my pumpkin,

137
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,840
so I'll live for a long time.

138
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,770
I'll live to be at least 100.

139
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,940
If I become even cuter,

140
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,150
can you live to be 200,
and even 300?

141
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,180
Of course.

142
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,480
Then, I'll become cuter every day.

143
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,720
You can do that, my pumpkin.

144
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,350
Mommy, Uncle, Grandma, and you,
the four of us...

145
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,490
can happily live together
for a very long time.

146
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,890
Bo Ram!

147
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,190
Mommy!

148
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,800
Did you have a good day?

149
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,900
- Have you had dinner?
- Not yet.

150
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,200
Why haven't you eaten yet?

151
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,870
- Wash up and come. Let's eat.
- Let's go.

152
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,610
Let's go to our room!

153
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,280
What happened?

154
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,410
Did we find Eun Ho?

155
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,050
Can't you read the room?

156
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,650
Gosh, I'm so dizzy.

157
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,850
Goodness. This is killing me.

158
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,160
Jeez. I told you not to cry
because you'd lose energy,

159
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,090
but you kept on wailing.

160
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,490
My goodness, Eun Ho.

161
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,360
I feel so devastated and lost...

162
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,300
whenever I think of you, Eun Ho.

163
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,800
Hey, don't even worry about it.

164
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,770
That kidnapper must've known
whose son he was.

165
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,510
Not only will this case become
plastered all over the media,

166
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,180
but they must be scared
of the consequences.

167
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,880
They'll let him go safely
as soon as they get the money.

168
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,210
How can you be so sure?

169
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,380
This world is full of evil people.

170
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,190
He'll come home safely
after they get the money, right?

171
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,820
Jeez. If that isn't the case,
then I'll eat my hat.

172
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,830
I can't sit like this anymore.
I'll end up dead first.

173
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,040
Where's Gi Man?

174
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,910
He's at Changpyeong-dong.

175
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,040
Mom, eat slowly.
You'll upset your stomach.

176
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,550
Everything you served is
nothing but veggies.

177
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,820
Is it done yet?

178
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,950
It's done.

179
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,620
Good.

180
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,900
What are you staring at?

181
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,240
This isn't your first time
seeing your mother-in-law eat.

182
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,510
No, I was wondering
if you needed anything.

183
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,550
I already know what you're thinking.

184
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,050
You were probably thinking,
"How can she eat right now?"

185
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,320
No way. Did you really think that?

186
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,290
No.

187
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,920
No, Mother.

188
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,690
I starved all day after eating
only a few bites this morning.

189
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,200
No, Mom.

190
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,960
You finished a bowl and a half of rice.
I saw you.

191
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,870
People need to eat well as we age.

192
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,940
I have to get more energy
to start crying some more.

193
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,410
Goodness, Eun Ho...

194
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,750
I wonder if he ate anything.

195
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,220
Eun Ho...

196
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,760
Please come home safely.

197
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,440
Detectives.

198
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,240
I made a simple breakfast.

199
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,040
You had a tough night,
so you should come and eat some.

200
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,510
- Yes, sure. Thank you.
- Sure.

201
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,880
Yes, please enjoy.

202
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,090
Yes, I just brought
my husband's phone,

203
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,160
the one you called again,
and then left mine at home.

204
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,760
So, the police
aren't tailing us anymore.

205
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,930
If that's a lie,

206
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,170
you'll never get to see
Eun Ho again.

207
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,400
No.

208
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,570
Please. I promise you.

209
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,170
I didn't tell anyone
that you called last night.

210
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,670
We really snuck out.

211
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,180
I mean it.

212
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,910
All right. I'll give you my trust.

213
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,850
What about the money?

214
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,050
We have it.

215
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,050
We'll give you
however much you want,

216
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,020
so please just let Eun Ho go safely.

217
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,460
Listen closely
to what I'm about to say.

218
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,460
Come to the entrance
of Hyocheong Park.

219
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,530
I'll call you once again
after you arrive here.

220
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,470
Hey! Grab the kid!

221
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,010
What?

222
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,460
- I got you.
- Stop it!

223
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,430
You're really bad, mister!

224
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,460
Hurry up.

225
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,700
- I want to go home!
- Hey, some guy is following us.

226
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,900
- Let go of me!
- Let's go.

227
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,130
- Let me go!
- Yes, I'm chasing them right now.

228
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,440
They're running into the park.

229
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,500
No!

230
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,640
- No!
- Come on!

231
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,610
I want to go home!

232
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,610
Mommy!

233
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,350
No! I want to go home!

234
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,550
Mommy!

235
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,520
Mommy!

236
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,190
- This is it, right?
- Yes, this is it.

237
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,620
Mommy!

238
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,590
- Mommy!
- It's Eun Ho.

239
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,930
That's Eun Ho's voice, right?

240
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,800
Gi Chan, you and Jae In can
go that way.

241
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,930
I'll go this way.

242
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,270
- Yes, okay.
- No.

243
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,700
- Eun Ho.
- Eun Ho!

244
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,740
Stop right there!

245
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,280
What are you doing
in the broad daylight?

246
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,150
You don't know these men, do you?

247
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,730
Don't come near us.

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,200
If you do, the kid will get hurt.

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,430
You saw how strong I was, right?

250
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,200
Don't worry too much.

251
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,110
I'll save you.

252
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,340
Stop talking nonsense and get lost.

253
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,480
Over here!

254
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,090
Darn it.

255
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,640
- How dare you kidnap a child?
- Wait!

256
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,800
- There must be a misunderstanding.
- Eun Ho!

257
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,740
- Mommy!
- Eun Ho.

258
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,280
- Eun Ho.
- Look at me.

259
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,410
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

260
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,450
Those two over there.

261
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,680
Get him. Get that guy.

262
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,450
Those two are on the same side!

263
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,620
My goodness.

264
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,250
Darn it.

265
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,960
- Hey, you!
- Eun Ho...

266
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,490
- You...
- Get them!

267
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,140
- Mr. Do.
- Yes.

268
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,470
Are you all right?

269
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,810
Yes, I'm fine.

270
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,710
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

271
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,350
Eun Ho is fine.

272
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,350
Did you talk to him?

273
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,920
Yes, he called me before.

274
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,190
You must've been scared,
but you held out very bravely.

275
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,630
That was awesome.

276
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,630
How can I thank you enough?

277
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,170
Thank you.

278
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,000
Thank you so much.

279
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,540
Don't mention it.
Anyone would've done the same.

280
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,340
- Then, please excuse me.
- Yes.

281
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,010
Hey. Wait a moment.

282
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,180
Your arm is bleeding.

283
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,050
- Oh, my.
- Jeez.

284
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,150
No, it's not a big deal.
I'll be fine.

285
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,560
But you got hurt
trying to save my son.

286
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm so sorry.

287
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,100
This isn't good.

288
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,100
Let's go to a hospital
and get you checked.

289
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,740
You might have been hurt
somewhere else.

290
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,510
I can just put some ointment on it.

291
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,670
I wasn't hurt anywhere else, either.

292
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,840
You should go. He's in shock,

293
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,610
so he'll need his mother
to feel safe.

294
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,550
Yes, right. Please excuse me.

295
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,820
Honey, can you thank the man
who saved Eun Ho?

296
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,490
Eun Ho.

297
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,890
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,160
Hello.

299
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,230
We found our son safe and sound
thanks to you.

300
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't mention it.

301
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,340
I'd like to ask you
for your cooperation.

302
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,540
Please do not share
today's incident with anyone else.

303
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,410
It's a matter of our privacy.

304
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,980
But we'd like to offer you
a handsome reward.

305
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,520
I understand what you mean.

306
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,050
Please give me your contact
and bank account number.

307
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,520
I'll send it over right away.

308
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,620
I didn't do this to get something.

309
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,330
It's all right.

310
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,330
How much do you want?

311
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,500
I don't think
you understood what I meant.

312
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,370
I don't need a reward.

313
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,940
You must've taken me the wrong way.

314
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,410
We were very grateful,
so we wanted to show our gratitude.

315
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,050
Yes, I'll just take the thought.

316
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,150
All right then, excuse me.

317
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,560
Hey, there, my girl.

318
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,730
How adorable.

319
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,370
Mom, I'm leaving.

320
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,040
- Hey, be careful out there.
- Okay.

321
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,280
Life is so hectic.

322
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,420
She never gets a good rest,

323
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,820
trying to balance working
and raising her child.

324
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,390
They say a daughter will live
just like her mother,

325
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,620
which makes me the sinner.

326
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,630
- Gosh.
- Did you leave something behind?

327
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm home.

328
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,830
You look awful.

329
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,630
Did you get into a fight?

330
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,330
No, it's not a big deal.

331
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,870
I got hurt a little trying to teach
a lesson to some evil men.

332
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,710
Do you call that just a little?

333
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
My goodness. You're impossible.

334
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,750
Why won't you ever just look away?

335
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,950
You need to consider yourself
before you get into a fight.

336
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,680
What if you end up
getting hurt badly?

337
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,280
Why won't you think of your family?

338
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,620
I do. That was why I did that.

339
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,920
How would I feel
if no one helped my family...

340
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,790
when we were in trouble?

341
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,890
I'm saving good karma
in case that happens.

342
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,600
If you ever get into trouble,

343
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,430
I want someone
to step in and help just like me.

344
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,470
You're too smooth.

345
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,140
I'm glad you helped someone,
but think of yourself first.

346
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,470
Yes, ma'am. I'll be careful.

347
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:04,880
Are you all right?

348
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,480
I'm fine.

349
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,110
Goodness.

350
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,350
Are you going to Gi Chan's place?

351
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,550
I need to go and see...

352
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,490
how things are going
with my own two eyes.

353
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,120
I'm too worried
and frustrated to stay home.

354
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,490
Are you going somewhere?

355
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,560
What do you think? There.

356
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,630
Do they even want to find Eun Ho?

357
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,130
They found him.

358
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,700
They did? Really?

359
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,240
Yes.

360
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,940
Goodness, thank you,
deities of this world.

361
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,240
So, was he hurt?

362
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,910
Why would he get hurt?
He's perfectly fine.

363
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,550
So, did the kidnapper let him go
after taking the money?

364
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,080
That's two million dollars...

365
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,050
My gosh.
Did they hand over everything?

366
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,790
Who cares
if it's 2 million or 20 million?

367
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,620
Money doesn't matter
when my grandson's life is at stake.

368
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,320
So? Where's Eun Ho?

369
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,190
He went home. What do you think?

370
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,230
- I need to go and see him.
- Wait.

371
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,560
He's fine,
so stop minding that family...

372
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
- and help me out.
- What?

373
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,100
Just help me out this once.

374
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,040
If you don't,
I'll be in big trouble.

375
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,240
I told you
to stop asking me for help.

376
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,610
I told you to shut your mouth!

377
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,880
Come on!

378
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,750
What if I end up dead?
Would you like that?

379
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,950
What now?

380
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,750
Mother. Mom. Please.

381
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,790
This is really the last time,
so just this once.

382
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,090
Please help me just this once.

383
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,630
Good grief. You punk.

384
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,460
- You punk. Come here.
- Why are you beating me? Stop it!

385
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,000
- Shut your mouth!
- Stop beating me. Stop it.

386
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,470
- Come here.
- Mom!

387
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,650
We should all leave...

388
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,150
and let Eun Ho sleep.

389
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,520
Jae In.

390
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,620
I don't want him to feel startled
when he wakes up, so I'll stay.

391
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,230
All right. We should go.

392
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,330
Okay.

393
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,860
I'm so relieved he's fine.

394
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,630
Yes.

395
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,000
I have to leave
and attend a meeting.

396
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,800
Let me escort you.

397
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,540
No, it's okay.

398
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,440
If you aren't busy,
take the day off...

399
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,540
to look after Jae In and Eun Ho.

400
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,910
Yes, sir.

401
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,150
You don't have to see me off.

402
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,650
You should get some rest, too.

403
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,450
All right. Have a good day.

404
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,720
Okay.

405
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,790
We were lucky that we placed
a location tracker in that bag.

406
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,630
How can you take Jae In
to that dangerous situation?

407
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,970
Why are you so reckless?

408
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,100
What if she got hurt?

409
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,870
Jae In wanted to go.

410
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,570
And the kidnapper said
she had to be there...

411
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,910
Is that your excuse?

412
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,480
If the kidnapper
wanted Jae In there,

413
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,150
you should've expected
the situation to be more dangerous.

414
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,250
Why can't you think things through?

415
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,820
Jae In is not like you.

416
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,520
Did you think...

417
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,890
you could keep your position
even after Jae In gets hurt?

418
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,330
I should've thought it through.

419
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,230
I'm sorry.

420
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,630
Be careful from now on.

421
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,230
I know I shouldn't reach out,

422
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,430
but I was worried about you.

423
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,430
I love you.

424
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,170
Hey, I'm on my way there.

425
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,840
Hey, Seung Woo.

426
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,410
The contract?

427
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,320
For the multi-use building
in Balsan New Town.

428
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,280
Right. That one.

429
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,520
I don't think I have a printed copy.

430
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,920
Then, I'll be at the office now.

431
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,930
My dad... No.

432
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,330
The chairman wanted it right now.

433
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,230
I miss you.

434
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,640
I kept the fake contract in
another folder, so he wouldn't find out.

435
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,780
In that case,
turn on my laptop on the desk.

436
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,280
You'll find a folder for contracts
on the desktop.

437
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,320
The password is YL1023.

438
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,890

440
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,120
Yes. I'll call you again
if I can't find it.

441
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,130
Bye.

442
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,630

This isn't it.

446
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,370
Is this it?

447
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,200
Gosh.

448
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,250
Can you come into the office?

449
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,950
Yes, Director Hwang.

450
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,620
I'm an acting genius.

451
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,770
Mr. Kang, is this a joke?

452
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,870
I'm not joking.

453
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,070
The chairman asked me
to print out a file and bring it.

454
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,310
I couldn't find it,
so I wanted to ask for help.

455
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,650
I never said I was the director.

456
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,590
What file?

457
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,960
The contract for Balsan New Town.

458
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,390
He said it was in the folder,
but he had too many of them.

Yes, this is it.

460

You can print this
with the printer outside...

00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,940
Please do the rest.

462
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,880

This is the contract

It's okay. You can pick up.

471

I don't want to.

Should I choose love
or responsibility?

476
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,140
My judgment is murky.

477

two different things.

Different things?

My head, my reason says...

480
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,220
I should consider
my family and future.

481
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,990
What about your heart?

482
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,690
Never mind all that.

483
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,570
You're stuck deep in here,

telling me to follow my heart
instead of my head.

What about the kid?

498
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,850
I saved him
and handed him over to his parents.

499
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,690
How can anyone
get the idea to do that to a kid?

500
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,290
Those punk should be
locked up in prison for life...

00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,720
- and rot there until they die.
- Yes.

503
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,860
Okay.

504
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,300
Bo Ram, you shouldn't
play outside alone.

I need to go with you. Okay?

506
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,200
Okay. I won't play outside alone.

507
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,570
Bo Ram, even if a stranger
offers you something delicious,

508
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,510
don't eat whatever they give
or follow them.

First, second, then third.

510
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,650
I can't eat anymore
because of these nags of love.

511
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,620
Can we do this after we eat?

512
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,950
My princess, hurry up and eat.

513
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,720
All right. You should eat.

514
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,230
- We'll order when our party comes.
- Sure.

515
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,440
Is it all right to send Eun Ho
to the kindergarten?

516
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,010
He insisted that he wanted to go.

517
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,680
The doctor also said he was fine.

518
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,210
I thought it might be better
to act like it was just another day,

519
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,410
so I dropped him off.

520
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,980
I see. Good job.

521
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,950
Anyway, how many years has it been
since we met her?

522
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,350
It's been about 6 to 7 years, right?

523
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,620
Already?

524
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,690
You're right. Time flies.

525
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,300

Why did you open
all these files in this folder?

532
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,000
I didn't know what was what,
so I looked through them.

533
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,240
What was that contract I saw
on Director Hwang's laptop?

534
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,180
The company name is the same,

535
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,880
but the content is different.

536
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,180
You caught the kidnapper?

537
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,350
It means he lurked around us
and kept his eyes on us.

538
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,880
