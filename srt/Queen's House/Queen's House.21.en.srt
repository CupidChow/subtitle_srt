1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,840
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,140
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,250
(Episode 21)

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,960
How did you know
I was locked up in here?

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,130
You're with them, aren't you?

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,130
Where are you trying to take me?

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,730
- Open this door.
- Ms. Kang.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,870
Open this door now!

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,000
Will you please calm down?

11
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,570
Calm down.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,970
I overheard Mr. Kang Seung Woo
talking to you at work by chance.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,510
I came to check, just in case.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,810
What happened to you?

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,810
How did you get hospitalized
at a psychiatric hospital?

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,580
Will you explain
the situation to me?

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,890
My mind feels like
a tangled ball of thread.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,160
I don't know
what's real and what's a lie,

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,290
who's with me and who's against me,

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,860
and when and how
everything went haywire.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,960
Everything is confusing.

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,370
The first mistake you made was...

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,080
marrying me.

24
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,910
I need to confirm this right now.

25
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,350
Can you give me a ride?

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,160
Hello?

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,690
What do you mean she's gone?

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,530
How can she run away
from a closed ward?

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,700
Is this how you manage...

30
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,600
Who came by?

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,200
I didn't send anyone there.

32
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,910
I'll call you back.

33
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,180
What do you think you're doing?

34
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,420
Have you gone crazy?

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,450
Yes, I've gone crazy.

36
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,190
How can anyone not go crazy?

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,350
Yes, I'm crazy!

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,720
I still remember what you said
right next to my ear.

39
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,830
I thought about it
every single day...

40
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,730
and some more.

41
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,200
A mistake?

42
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,030
Marrying you was my mistake?

43
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,700
That was the first mistake?

44
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,870
Then, what was the second one?

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,570
What's the third mistake?

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,440
Tell me why you locked me up
at a psychiatric hospital!

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,710
Shut your mouth. You're at work.

48
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,380
- What?
- People can hear you, so be quiet.

49
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,420
- Jae In! You need to stop.
- You!

50
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,530
Aunt Mi Ran.

51
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,030
What do you think you're doing?

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,400
No, forget that.
I thought you were hospitalized.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,770
She snuck out.

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,540
Aunt Mi Ran, I'm perfectly fine.

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,870
I'm not crazy.

56
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,980
He locked me up by force.

57
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,580
Jae In, you need to stop.

58
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,410
What kind of nonsense is this?

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,710
Nonsense?

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,650
Do you know how I felt as
I held out in that dreadful place?

61
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,950
Calm down, Jae In.

62
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,290
There are many ears around here.
Calm down, and we'll talk at home.

63
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,990
Aunt Mi Ran, I need to see Eun Ho.

64
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,960
He must've missed me so much.

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
I need to see Eun Ho.

66
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,430
You can't do that.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,100
- He's my son.
- And mine, too.

68
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,740
What if Eun Ho gets shocked
after seeing your lunacy?

69
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,470
Is that okay with you?

70
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,810
I may even call the police...

71
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,410
if you go and meet him now.

72
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,680
Honey, let's go back
to the hospital.

73
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,210
I'll bring Eun Ho there
if you go back inside.

74
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,950
You need to receive treatment
for our son's sake.

75
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,350
You're crazy.

76
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,130
I'll go with her. Don't worry.

77
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,810
I said we should go home.
Why did you come here?

78
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,140
Where's Se Ri?

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,410
She went out to work.

80
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,750
- Jae In.
- I want to see a doctor first.

81
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,150
I'm going to get tested
and prove that I'm fine.

82
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,590
Why are you making
so many excuses...

83
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,160
after you failed to keep her
in the closed ward?

84
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,030
Send me the CCTV footage.

85
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,600
I need to check and see who it was.

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,470
We're at work.
Stop coming here so often.

87
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,180
Don't be so sensitive.
Is something not working out?

88
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,850
You need to see this.

89
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,760
I met with a wedding planner today.

90
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,290
We can go there together next time
and pick out a dress and a tuxedo.

91
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,590
These are so pretty.

92
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,800
Didn't you hear me?

93
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,770
Jae In was here just now.

94
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,400
She escaped from the hospital.

95
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,670
I don't know
when she'll storm in again.

96
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,410
Put that away
and go back to your office.

97
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,440
What about our wedding?

98
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,210
Is that so important right now?

99
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,650
Didn't you hear me?

100
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,020
Leave my office before Jae In comes.

101
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,450
Are you scared?

102
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,450
Are you scared
that she'll see us together?

103
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,260
So what if she finds out?

104
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,920
You two are strangers now.

105
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,660
The general shareholders' meeting is
coming up soon.

106
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,590
If I marry you right away
after divorcing her,

107
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,830
it'll take a huge toll on me.

108
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,070
I don't know
when he'll change his mind.

109
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,870
I can't back down now.

110
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,200
So? You want to live like this
without having a wedding?

111
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,440
How many times
do I have to tell you...

112
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,810
that we need to make it official to
have Eun Ho think of me as his mom?

113
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,140
We can do that
after I'm appointed as the chairman.

114
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,810
You held out this far.
Give it a little more time.

115
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,850
Then, let's have a small wedding
just with our family.

116
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,820
We can do that, right?

117
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,160
It's you again?

118
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,330
You aren't even my family.

119
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,400
Stop making a fool out of me...

120
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,930
by claiming to be my family
when you aren't.

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,770
You're still the same.

122
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,170
Do you take
some kind of tonic in there?

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,240
You haven't lost
a hint of your spirit.

124
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,800
Don't be so cheeky.

125
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,940
Tell Jae In to come and see me.

126
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,710
I guess you haven't heard.

127
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,910
I'm about the only one
who'll visit you here now.

128
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,150
Stop talking nonsense
and tell her to come.

129
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,520
I should tell you this first.

130
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,490
Last time, it wasn't easy to keep
the news about her to myself.

131
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,260
She got hospitalized
at a mental institution.

132
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,400
- Jae In got hospitalized?
- Yes.

133
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,170
At a mental institution.

134
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,100
Why? How? What happened?

135
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,410
Isn't it obvious? I told you
it was a mental institution.

136
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,810
Come in.

137
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,620
How...

138
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,620
I fled from the hospital.

139
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,060
Does Gi Chan know?

140
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,060
I met him.

141
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,230
He doesn't even look guilty...

142
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,740
after making me
look like a crazy person.

143
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,140
He's less than human.

144
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,080
Do you also think I'm crazy?

145
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,450
Well, I can't be the judge of that.

146
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,280
I'm not a psychiatrist.

147
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,250
But many recent events
must've made you stressed out,

148
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,660
so it had to be hard mentally.

149
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,320
It was Gi Chan's decision,

150
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,790
and he was
the closest person to you.

151
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,930
I had no choice but to believe him.

152
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,930
Now that I think about it,
it sounds like I'm babbling.

153
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,670
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

154
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,210
Yu Gyeong, I'm fine.

155
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm not crazy.

156
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,440
I just got tested.

157
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,740
You'll also see
as soon as I have the result.

158
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,510
I came to see you...

159
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,050
because of Eun Ho.

160
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,320
How's he doing?

161
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,220
I told him you were sick
and had to be hospitalized.

162
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,060
He misses you a lot,
but he stays patient like a big boy.

163
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,290
Mother, Gi Chan,
and the entire family...

164
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,860
all look out for him,
so he's doing well.

165
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,100
I want to bring him
right this instant,

166
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,300
but I'm holding myself back
from letting him see awful things.

167
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,410
I'll go and see Eun Ho...

168
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,010
as soon as I have the result.

169
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,450
Please tell him that
his mommy is coming for him soon...

170
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,750
and that I love him...

171
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,380
very much.

172
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,350
You won't come home?

173
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,060
Where are you staying?

174
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,360
At Changpyeong-dong.

175
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,160
Please keep an eye on Eun Ho.

176
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,260
I'll give you my number,

177
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,600
so call me if anything happens.

178
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,670
Okay. I'll do that.

179
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,540
Jae In.

180
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,580
You must be tired.
Do you want to go upstairs and rest?

181
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,590
Or do you want to eat first?

182
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,050
I'll eat later.

183
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,160
Let's talk later, Seung Woo.

184
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,060
I need to get some rest.

185
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,910
Aunt Mi Ran, was she discharged?

186
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,370
She ran out.

187
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,780
What? From the hospital?

188
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,010
Yes.

189
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,350
She claims that she's fine,
so she was tested again.

190
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,780
She seems fine,

191
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,520
but she bit Gi Chan's hand...

192
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,490
and screamed at him,
so I'm not so sure.

193
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,690
I asked them to call back
as soon as they have the result.

194
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,360
We'll find out.

195
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,700
Did you go somewhere
in the afternoon?

196
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,400
I heard you took half the day off.

197
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,540
I went to see Mom.

198
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,210
She treats you so coldly,

199
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,440
but do you still want to see her?

200
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,580
I'm not sure.

201
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,450
I'll go upstairs
and get some rest, too.

202
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,060
She broke out from jail?

203
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,560
She escaped.

204
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,630
She got tested today
to see if she was sane.

205
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,070
Wait, did you rat us out...

206
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,300
just to save yourself?

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,240
What good will it do
if I told her the truth now?

208
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,270
Make sure you always remember...

209
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,480
that we're on the same boat.

210
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,750
Goodness.

211
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,690
Gi Chan,
my second daughter-in-law...

212
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,020
No, I mean, Jae In...

213
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,190
received a medical diagnosis
at a hospital.

214
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,290
If she found out she was sane,
she wouldn't stay quiet.

215
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,560
What do we do?

216
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,530
Did she get tested at your hospital?

217
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,930
Yes.

218
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,470
Daddy!

219
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,900
- Daddy!
- Goodness.

220
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,710
- I need to go out.
- Okay...

221
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,370
Daddy, I want to go with you!

222
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,310
He'll come back soon, Ji Ho.
You need to wait.

223
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,680
He's my daddy.

224
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,010
Stop calling him your daddy.

225
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,820
He's my daddy.

226
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,180
Mommy, he's my daddy, right?

227
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,220
No, he's my daddy!

228
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,860
Grandma, he's my daddy, right?

229
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,160
Goodness, you two are
giving me a headache.

230
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,160
Stop bickering and try to get along.

231
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,400
I need to lie down.
Don't be so noisy.

232
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,870
Eun Ho and Ji Ho,
do you want some snacks?

233
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,970
I got some.

234
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,510
Yes, I want some.

235
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,910
- What did you get?
- Bread.

236
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,580
Join us, Eun Ho.

237
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,240
I don't want any.

238
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,980
I'll babysit him.

239
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,450
You and Ji Ho can eat first.

240
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,920
Let's go, Ji Ho.

241
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,820
He's my daddy...

242
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,930
Auntie Yu Gyeong.

243
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,060
When will my mommy get better?

244
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,030
Can you tell her to come home soon?

245
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,000
I miss her.

246
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,710
Eun Ho, she'll get well soon.

247
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,310
But if you keep crying
and looking sad,

248
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,750
it'll break Mommy's heart.

249
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,490
Please don't tell her that I cried.

250
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:36,390
I won't tell her.

251
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,000
Stop crying.

252
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,400
Grandma, do you like this one
or this one?

253
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,070
She likes strawberries.

254
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,870
- Me?
- Uncle Do Yun and I like grapes.

255
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,010
- I like strawberries.
- Strawberries.

256
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,610
- Strawberries.
- Nice.

257
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,210
- It's good.
- Dig in. What are you waiting for?

258
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm done.

259
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,050
How's work at the clinic?

260
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,250
Everything's good.

261
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,220
Hello?

262
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,460
- Try this one.
- This one?

263
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,730
One moment, please.

264
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,060
I'm going to my room.

265
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,540
Why is he taking the call inside?

266
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,300
Maybe he's dating someone.

267
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,310
I really hope that's the case.

268
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,870
Eat up.

269
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,280
How do you feel?

270
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,910
I'm fine.

271
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,180
I should've called you sooner,
but I was out of it.

272
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,780
I hope the result comes out fairly.

273
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,780
Thank you.

274
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,520
I'll reach out
as soon as I have the result.

275
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,290
All right. You should get some rest.

276
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,670
How dare you come here?

277
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,040
Get out of here.

278
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,280
I let him in.

279
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,580
Why did you open the door for him?

280
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,480
You should've asked me first.

281
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,650
Jae In, calm down. Don't be so mad.

282
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,580
Only you'll suffer
if you keep acting like this.

283
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,820
Seung Woo, you have no idea...

284
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,790
the things I had to go through.

285
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,060
He told me all about it,

286
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,620
and I knew you were hospitalized.

287
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,060
I hope you get well soon...

288
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,160
and return to your old self.

289
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,560
I'm fine.

290
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,570
He and Mother planned everything.

291
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,400
Mother changed completely
when she was alone with me,

292
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,940
unlike when we were with others.

293
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,970
Why would she do that?

294
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,470
My mother...

295
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,510
almost groveled before you...

296
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,710
and tended to your needs.

297
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,080
Isn't that so, Seung Woo?

298
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,010
It's true.

299
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,080
That wasn't the case.

300
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,680
She began to change slowly
after I moved in with her.

301
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,020
She kept framing me
and slandering me...

302
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,490
You need to stop, Jae In.

303
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,760
Why do you keep making stuff up?

304
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,830
Everything is a delusion.

305
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,600
Let's go back to the hospital.

306
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,400
You need to be treated.

307
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,670
I'm not crazy. I'm not!

308
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,900
Stop treating me like I'm insane.

309
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,510
I was tested at another hospital.

310
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,640
I won't forgive you
as soon as I get the result.

311
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,510
Jae In, the result is out.

312
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,710
It says I'm fine, right?

313
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,420
Even the hospital director suggested
that you return to the hospital.

314
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,300
Your situation is much more dire
than what it seems on the outside.

315
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,000
No, this is impossible.

316
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,100
I won't beat around the bush.
Let me cut to the chase.

317
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,810
You should build
a newer and bigger medical center.

318
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,040
Let me help with that.

319
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,610
However, I do have one request.

320
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,990
My wife recently got tested
at your hospital.

321
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,160
I just need you
to tweak the result a little.

322
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,060
No, something went wrong.

323
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,460
Jae In.

324
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,300
I want to be tested
at another hospital!

325
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,130
The result will be the same.

326
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,900
You should go back for treatment
as soon as possible...

327
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,300
for Eun Ho's sake.

328
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,000
We're strangers now,
so I won't ask for more.

329
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,740
But at least have a sense
of responsibility as his mother.

330
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,410
Please.

331
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,640
Strangers?

332
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,410
Are you saying you two are divorced?

333
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,980
Yes.

334
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,020
She asked for it.

335
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,290
I asked for it?
When did I divorce...

336
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,290
No, I want to do it now.

337
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,760
And I will. But...

338
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,960
Gi Chan, explain this
so that I can understand.

339
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,330
I can't hide this anymore,
so let me just share it with you.

340
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,700
She had another man.

341
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,110
Jae In wouldn't do that.

342
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,780
I saw it with my own eyes,

343
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,380
and she admitted to it.

344
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,780
Stop lying!

345
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,910
It wasn't me. It was you!

346
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,880
Aunt Mi Ran, he's seeing someone.

347
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,190
She demanded a divorce
as soon as she was caught.

348
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,320
I begged her to stop for Eun Ho,

349
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,060
and I even said
I'd forgive her for everything.

350
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,330
But she insisted on divorcing me.

351
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,530
So, I signed it.

352
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,060
Me?

353
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,570
You gave up
on his parental rights and custody,

354
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,540
but you were still his mom,

355
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,070
so I wanted to hide it
until the end.

356
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,840
You need to stop lying!

357
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,410
I never asked for a divorce.

No.

376

I never divorced you.

377
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,540
I never signed this. No.

378
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,470

Why did you make me look crazy?

382
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,450
You need to stop, Jae In!

383
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,150
Please stop, Jae In!

384
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,920
Get yourself together.
Why are you adding to this?

385
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,830
I can't force you anymore if
you don't want to get hospitalized.

386
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,890
We're strangers now,
so I have no right over you.

387
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,530
But let me leave you with this.

388
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,330
Go back to the hospital now,
for Eun Ho's sake.

389
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,400
Do not show yourself before him
in this state.

390
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,870
If you do,

391
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,840
I won't just sit around.

392
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,040
That's all I have to say.

393
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,280
Please excuse me.

394
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,980
Jae In,
you need to be treated first.

395
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,420
That's the only way
you can see Eun Ho again.

396
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,280
Yes, Jae In.
You need to go back to the hospital!

397
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,020
Why won't you believe me?

398
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,050
You're my family.

399
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,620
Aunt Mi Ran and you are...

400
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,190
both my family, so how...

401
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,050
Make sure you take
the prescribed medicine after meals.

402
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,820
Yes, thank you.

403
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,890
Sure.

Hello?

406
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,370
Which one of these is
the chairman's office?

407
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,070
It's somewhere around...

408
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,350
My gosh. Dr. Kim!

409
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,450
Please excuse me. I'm a little busy.

410
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,890
This must be fate.

411
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,190
It's my chance
to accept our fated love.

412
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,700
What the heck is this punk doing?

413
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,040
Gi Chan.

414
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,610
Tell Dr. Kim of the clinic
to come to my office now.

415
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,680
What? He just left.

416
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,480
Do you know him?

417
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,750
Yes, I've seen him
at Yu Gyeong's hospital.

418
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,890
Anyway, why do you need him?

419
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,290
It's none of your business.

420
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,120
Why are you here?

421
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,160
Me? Well, no reason.

422
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,760
I was passing by,
and then I got curious.

423
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,260
I wanted to see your office.

424
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,430
I'm busy. Go home.

425
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,870
Wait.

426
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,240
Do you know where Dr. Kim is?

427
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,710
No, he left in a hurry, though.

428
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,690
Your tests are over.

429
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,150
They'll reach out to you
as soon as they have the result,

430
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,920
and it'll probably say
you're in normal condition.

431
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,030
Why do you think
the hospital director did this?

432
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,630
He was probably bribed.

433
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,540
The same thing happened before
with the wife of YL's chairman.

434
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,510
I'm sorry
for making you feel uncomfortable.

435
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,340
It's true, though.

436
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,450
Can I trust this hospital?

437
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,980
You can.

438
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,950
I felt so lost
after seeing the test result,

439
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,020
but I had no one to call but you.

440
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,660
Thank you.

441
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,170
You said you took medicine at home
during the consultation.

442
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,370
Do you know what it was?

443
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,370
It was soon after
I had a miscarriage.

444
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,870
My mother-in-law gave it to me
as a health supplement every day,

445
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,410
but it was a bit odd.

446
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,480
It felt similar
to the sedatives I took...

447
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,880
at the psychiatric hospital.

448
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,450
I felt sleepy, drowsy,
and slow in my response...

449
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,250
whenever I took it.

450
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,520
I didn't feel like myself.

451
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,060
Do you have it with you?

452
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,560
It's probably home.

453
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,160
I need to go there.

454
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,270
I'll go with you.

455
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,430
I can go alone.

456
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,100
It should be empty at this hour.

457
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,570
Hey, I'm at my business with Eun Ho.

458
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,480
Ji Ho was taking a nap,
so I left him there.

459
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,610
You need to go home.

460
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,080
Jae In is acting sensitive,
so she may barge in soon.

461
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,350
She was always sensitive.

462
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,190
Hello?

463
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,060
Darn it. It's not like I'm a nanny.

464
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,430
How can he leave
both his kids with me?

465
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,700
Hey, keep an eye on him.

466
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,160
Don't try to pull any funny tricks.

467
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,270
Do you think I'm a nanny?

468
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,740
Give your uncle a high-five.

469
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,690

from Ms. Noh forever.

472
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,580
Eun Ho, it's me, Mommy.

473
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,120
Who are you?

474
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,160
And why are you in this room?

475
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,260
This is my mommy and daddy's room.

476
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,890
Who are you, lady?

477
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,700
Do you know your daddy's name?

478
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,500
He's Hwang Gi Chan.

479
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,170
Hwang Gi Chan.

480

Her name is Kang Se Ri.

We're getting robbed!

483

- Grandma.
- Hey, there.

484
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,820
Goodness.

485
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,660
Where's the medicine you gave me?

486
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,460
What medicine?

487
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,960
Stop talking nonsense and get out
before I call the police.

488
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,160
The medicine you gave me
as a health supplement.

489
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,500
Where is it?

490
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,330
Darn it. I don't know what that is!

491
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,470
Get out of here.

492
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,040

Where is he?

494
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,110
I hid him
because I knew you'd come by.

495
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,980
Don't ever dream of seeing...

496
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,740
my precious eldest grandson.

497
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,310
Go act crazy somewhere else.

498
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,920

(Haesung Psychiatric Hospital,
2nd Floor Corridor)

503
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,700
So, Jae In was
really seeing someone else?

504
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,710
She fled from the hospital
with that man.

505
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,880
She met him
when Eun Ho got kidnapped,

506
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,950
and they must've stayed in touch
since that time.

507
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,020
Jae In.

508
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,020
What do you think you're doing?

509
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,790
Jae In, where are your manners?
What are you doing?

510
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,200
Aunt Mi Ran, do you know
who I ran into at Seongbu-dong?

511
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,900
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri's son.

512
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,040
He was as big as Eun Ho.

513
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,940
Do you think this makes any sense?

514
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,640
It's a misunderstanding.

515
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,910
He's Se Ri's son,
but that isn't the case.

516
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,340
You knew about this?

517
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,110
They're living under the same roof.

518
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,350
I just heard it.

519
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,080
They asked me
to keep it from you for a while,

520
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,420
but it doesn't look like
there's anything to hide now.

521
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,120
Stop this misunderstanding
and tell her yourself.

522
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,260
Gi Chan had a tough time...

523
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,060
after your divorce
and hospitalization.

524
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,760
I also had a tough time
after my divorce,

525
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,600
so we were in a similar situation.

526
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,130
I didn't want to take it that far,

527
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,440
but things kind of happened...

528
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,410
as we comforted each other.

529
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,540
I'm sorry, Jae In.

530
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,510
I'm so sorry.

531
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,510
How can you cry?

532
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,250
So, that's what
fake crying looks like.

534
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,520
You should get treated first
before you get any other ideas.

00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,190
Aunt Mi Ran, please!

536
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,960
I'm not crazy. I'm not!

537
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,560
I won't let you two
get away with this.

538
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,630
Just wait.

539
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,480
Hey, you're here.

540
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,280
You should've called.

541
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,050
Have a seat.

542
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,860
Did you see the test result?

543
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,730
Why didn't you tell me?

544
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,830
About what?

545
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,700
About Gi Chan and Se Ri.

546
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,340
You knew what was going on
between them.

547
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,870
How can you stay silent?

548
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,570
You knew everything.

549
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,710
How can you do this to me?

550
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,750
Did you come here
to nitpick over this?

551
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,620
I found out much later.

552
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,720
I would've told you
if I had known earlier.

553
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,820
But would anything have changed
if I told you this...

554
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,320
at this point in time?

555
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,130
Don't push the blame on me.

556
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,030
We each have
our own misfortune to handle.

557
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm dealing with mine,

558
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,370
so you should deal with yours.

559
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,500
Isn't that so?

560
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,670
Don't take it the wrong way,

561
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
and face the reality
with your rational mind.

562
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,850
Everything already happened.

563
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,480
We all came too far
to turn everything back.

564
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,290
It's too late.

565
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,050
What do you mean?

566
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,290
They're getting married soon.

567
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,970
Your bouquet is here.

568
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,660
What is this?

569
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,660
It must be the wrong one.

570
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,560
I'll call
and have them bring the right one.

571
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,830
The ceremony is happening soon.
It's going to be too late!

572
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,940
Are you ready?

573
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,110
Yes.

574
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,580
Hey, you look wonderful.

575
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,950
(KL Holdings, UF Media, KC Finance)

576
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,490
This one looks good.

577
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,550
Goodness.

578
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,620
Oh, my.

579
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,830
- Hello.
- Congratulations.

580
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,530
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

581
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,700
I thought they didn't tell anyone...

582
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,970
about the wedding today.

583
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,140
Who sent all these flowers?

584
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,510
Word gets around quickly.

585
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,810
They tried to keep it quiet,

586
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,410
but everyone in the know
already knew.

587
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,280
He'll obviously be
the next chairman of YL Group,

588
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,710
so they need
to get on his good side.

589
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,150
I had one wonderful son, didn't I?

590
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,920
And you mean Gi Chan by that.

591
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,620
Aunt Mi Ran, did you
know about this already?

592
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,690
I'll explain it later.

593
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,790
What's with those flowers?

594
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,160
(Hwang Gi Chan, Kang Se Ri,
may the deceased rest in peace.)

595
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,130
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

596
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,430
What are these?

597
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,100
Wait, this isn't a funeral!

598
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,540
What is...

599
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:38,510
What? Who sent these awful things?

600
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,540
Darn it. Who sent these?

601
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,350
I did.

602
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,990
Why is she...

603
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,650
What do you think? Do you like it?

604
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,950
You've gone completely crazy.

605
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,290
You've lost it.

606
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,050
What took you so long?

607
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,860
I need to go really crazy
if I'm going to go crazy.

608
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,560
Goodness.

609
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,670
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

610
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,040
The man and the woman
of the hour are here.

611
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,250
Congratulations on your marriage.

612
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,050
I decorated the place
as a wedding present.

613
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,790
I hope you like it.

614
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,820
Right. I forgot to give you
some money to celebrate.

615
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,070
Hwang Gi Chan.

616
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,100
Kang Se Ri.

617
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,170
May you two rest in peace.

618
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,300
(Queen's House)

619
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,030
- Goodness.
- My gosh. Are you all right?

620
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,030
I thought everyone was cold
in this day and age...

621
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,970
and couldn't care less about anyone.

622
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,440
I must protect the elderly,
children, and women at all times.

623
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,910
Women?

624
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,840
Protect?

625
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,710
Right. About Dr. Kim Do Yun.

626
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,650
Is he dating Jae In?

627
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,410
Don't say anything like that,
not even as a joke.

628
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,250
I heard Mr. Kim was the one
who helped Jae In escape...

629
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,520
from the hospital.

630
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,950
Jae In, do not trust anyone.

631
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,590
Especially not Seung Woo.

632
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,160
He claimed that
the company belonged to him.

633
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,760
This is why you never show kindness
to another human.
