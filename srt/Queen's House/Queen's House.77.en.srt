(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,550
(Episode 77)

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,150
Hello.

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,990
I'm Designer L.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,600
You're L?

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,570
Yes, I'm L.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,410
How can you be Designer L?

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,680
See? I told you that
Jae In's memories had returned!

11
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,010
She was determined
to make a fool of us!

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,110
Shut your mouth.

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,470
No one's around,
so you can be honest here.

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,280
Are you pretending to be L
to take responsibility...

15
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,680
because the designer
suddenly revoked the contract?

16
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,820
Talk to me.

17
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,920
Gi Chan, do you still not get it?

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,760
You can't be this slow and dull.

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,790
Then, it'd be such a shame
that you made me suffer.

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,830
Why are you doing this?

21
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,570
Why? Did you ask me why?

22
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,440
Because I remember everything...

23
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,210
you and your family did...

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,940
to me and us.

25
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,620
Jae In. Kang Jae In.

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,950
Honey. No, right?

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,890
You're only trying
to tease me, right?

28
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,560
This makes no sense.

29
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,200
You were pregnant...

30
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,000
with our child,

31
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,670
and you lost it.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,740
Is that why you're doing this?

33
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,010
That wasn't the only child I lost.

34
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,150
I lost
Eun Ho's sibling in my womb...

35
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,150
and even Eun Ho!

36
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,650
If you wanted to protect us,

37
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,750
you shouldn't have done that to me.

38
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,170
This is my present.

39
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,010
You don't have to thank me
after listening to it.

40
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,410
Take note.

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,710
You're always confident,
thinking you're always in the know.

42
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,180
You must be sure
that you know everything.

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,020
Do you really think so?

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,250
That's a delusion
rooted in your arrogance.

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,360
Wake up if you thought...

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,330
people you trust so much
only have the sides you know of.

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,500
I'm giving you this advice...

48
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,930
because I've trusted you
just like that.

49
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,890
Shout out, "Die, Hwang Gi Chan,"
in the lobby tomorrow...

50
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,430
and charge at him.
Then, I'll jump in.

51
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,490
You can stab me lightly
at that time.

52
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,610
Wait, so Designer L,

53
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,040
the one whom everyone
in the industry is dying to recruit,

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,150
was you, Ms. Kang?

55
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,820
It must've been a surprise.

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,920
I had to prepare everything quickly,
so I forgot to mention it.

57
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,690
I had noticed,
although I wasn't sure.

58
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,960
Really? You should've told me.

59
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,730
I wasn't sure.

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,870
After I found out
you didn't have amnesia,

61
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,400
I had a feeling
you might be Designer L...

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,570
when I saw the designs.

63
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,110
I was a little jealous to hear
Hwang Gi Chan recruited you.

64
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,240
But this is delightful.

65
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,880
It feels like
we gave him a huge blow.

66
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,250
You'll work with them for a while
as Designer L, right?

67
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,880
Yes.

68
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,220
I look forward to everything.

69
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,220
You're with Jae In, aren't you?

70
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,820
I can tell that
you knew she didn't have amnesia.

71
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,660
You also knew
she was Designer L, didn't you?

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,200
You're like a family of frauds.

73
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,730
You don't get to say that.
You're a fraud.

74
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,240
Stop speaking for yourself.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,210
My sister is like an expert
who decided to live quietly.

76
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,110
She always had the talent,
but she hid it.

77
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,610
But you had an affair
with your friend's husband...

78
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,910
while pretending to be
her best friend.

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,480
You even pretended like
you were my sister.

80
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,950
That's not all.

81
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,690
You even lied
about your educational background.

82
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,720
Watch what you say.

83
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,790
I'm your direct superior.

84
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,390
You...

85
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,530
Where's my seat?

86
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,430
Don't you know?

87
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,930
If your memories are back,

88
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,240
return to
the Investment and Development Team.

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,270
I'm Designer L,

90
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,380
a designer YL Group
desperately wanted to recruit.

91
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,180
You can sit there or whatever.

92
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,050
This looks like my spot.

93
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,060
It's my desk.

94
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,000
Not anymore.

95
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,470
I don't care
even if you're the real Designer L.

96
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,010
This is a power trip!

97
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,640
Ms. Kang Se Ri,
you need to know your place.

98
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,280
YL Group and Hwang Gi Chan...

99
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
recruited me
with the best terms in the industry.

100
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,650
During my stay, I'm in charge
of the Planning and Design Team,

101
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,320
and I have the right to dismiss
all incompetent designers.

102
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,230
That was a part of my contract.

103
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,700
So what?

104
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,060
Are you going to dismiss me?

105
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,430
You already know.

106
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,900
If you don't want that,
turn in your resignation.

107
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,340
Start walking on eggshells
if you want to save your job.

108
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,370
If you don't want to do that,
run over to Gi Chan...

109
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,410
and try to get him
to revoke my contract.

110
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,210
Do you think I won't?

111
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,710
Gi Chan will do everything as I ask.

112
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,780
Be my guest.

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,190
But how much compensation...

114
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,720
do you think he'll owe me
for canceling the contract?

115
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,660
Do you really think I'll sit around?

116
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,160
Well, if he loves you,

117
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,890
that kind of compensation
must be nothing.

118
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,060
Stay strong. You got this.

119
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,140
Were you surprised?

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,210
Yes. No. I wasn't.

121
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,720
You're so cool, Jae In.

122
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,660
Is it true
that Jae In got her memories back?

123
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,470
Director Do Min Jun is innocent!

124
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,840
Look into H and K Company.

125
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,850
You sent an anonymous letter
to Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol.

126
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,950
Does Chairman Hwang know?

127
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,720
Do not touch that!

128
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,790
Honey, Secretary Yoon
staged everything.

129
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,990
That's not me.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,290
Why would I do that? That's crazy.

131
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,960
No, sir. This was Ms. Kang Se Ri.

132
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,170
I kept it quiet because it happened
when Chairman Kang was with us.

133
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,600
You two were already married,
so I couldn't tell you,

134
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,940
thinking I'd only cause trouble
if you found out.

135
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,440
I wasn't trying to betray you.

136
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,710
Don't be ridiculous.

137
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,750
Why are you telling him this now?

138
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,150
Why did you record this?

139
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,420
Honey, don't trust anything he says.

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,950
He's trying
to come between you and me!

141
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,620
You'll know when you see this.

142
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,560
A note was delivered,
so I traced it back...

143
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,090
and saw her handing it over
to the deliveryman.

144
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,740
Honey.

145
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,150
Get out, both of you.

146
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,490
Get out of here now!

147
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,500
So, you staged your amnesia?

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,330
Yes, I had to return to that house
to find something Dad mentioned...

149
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,370
in his last will.

150
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,140
His last will?

151
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,950
Jae In, it's me. Dad.

152
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,480
You might be startled
after hearing this voice recording,

153
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,520
but I thought I had no other way...

154
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,390
of sharing the actual truth
with you.

155
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,400
That way,

156
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,300
you won't get swayed
by what anyone says...

157
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,840
and come to an objective decision.

158
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,580
So,

159
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,720
Gi Chan and Se Ri had an affair,

160
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,360
and Gyu Cheol
knew everything already.

161
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,890
As Gyu Cheol died, Gi Chan...

162
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,900
Dad wouldn't have died in vain...

163
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,940
if he had called an ambulance.

164
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,110
I couldn't tell my mom or Seung Woo.

165
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,920
They'd run over to Gi Chan
and try to harm him if they found out.

166
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,880
It'd be too much for them to bear.

167
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,320
So, Aunt Mi Ran,

168
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,790
you need to keep it quiet, too.

169
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,300
What about that boy
Kang Se Ri brought?

170
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,970
He's not their son, right?

171
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,970
He's a boy...

172
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,110
Gi Chan and Se Ri had.

173
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,850
How... How can this be? How?

174
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,890
You were the one
who lost your objectivity.

175
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,660
I clearly told you everything.

176
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,430
I shared everything as is...

177
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,100
except for Dad's voice recorder.

178
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,470
Back then,
you didn't believe anything I said.

179
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,540
Do you finally believe me now?

180
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,920
If you choose to side with them
after finding out about everything,

181
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,880
I can't help with that.

182
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,620
The choice is yours.

183
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,990
That's all I have to say.

184
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,660
Please excuse me.

185
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,810
No.

186
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,170
Hello, Ms. Kim.

187
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,670
I can't go out today.

188
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,240
I've been studying lately.

189
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,210
I need to put in some work
now that I'm a director of a gallery.

190
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,680
Ms. Kim.

191
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,350
Do you know the painting called
"Munch's Scream?"

192
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,990
You know,
that painting of a bald person...

193
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,120
standing around while screaming.

194
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,060
Did you ask who it's by?

195
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,030
It must be Picasso.

196
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,000
All right. Goodbye.

197
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,180
Grandma, Munch is
the name of the painter.

198
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,610
Edvard Munch.

199
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,810
You were trying to mention
"The Scream,"

200
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,480
a painting by Edvard Munch.

201
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,920
What?

202
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,420
You're such
a knowledgeable little prince.

203
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,220
What did you draw?

204
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,930
Ta-da.

205
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,430
What's that?

206
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,830
Is that someone who lost their mind?

207
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,700
I drew you.

208
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,230
What?

209
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,210
It's so difficult to navigate
the world of art.

210
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,240
What are you drawing, Uncle Gi Man?

211
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,880
I'm not your uncle.

212
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,980
What are you drawing, Gi Man?

213
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,790
Mom! This is huge.

214
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,360
Jae In is totally fine.
She got her memories back.

215
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,560
She remembers everything.
Isn't that crazy?

216
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,900
See? I told you so.

217
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,700
How did you know?

218
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,870
Does Gi Chan know?

219
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,140
There's someone named Designer L,
the hottest one in the industry now.

220
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,210
Gi Chan recruited
that designer himself,

221
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,610
and she turned out to be Jae In!

222
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,510
Jae In stabbed him in the back
a big time today.

223
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,850
Goodness. See? I told you so.

224
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,160
I told you
that she remembered everything.

225
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,630
People say only good things will happen
if you listen to your mother.

226
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,930
Why did you let a nobody
like her betray you,

227
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,630
the chairman of YL Group, like this?

228
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,070
He must feel devastated, too.

229
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,580
He'll no longer associate
with that persistent...

230
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,480
and sly girl, right?

231
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,020
I'll finally have some peace.

232
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,620
You'll move out
of that house now, right?

233
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,160
Yes, I already took
everything that's important,

234
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,460
so I won't have to go back.

235
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,090
Even if I wanted to return,

236
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,230
Gi Chan would stop me now.

237
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,170
What if he lets you return?

238
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,270
You won't go back, will you?

239
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,500
Of course not.

240
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,310
I left everything
I wore and used at that place.

241
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,710
All of it gave me the creeps.

242
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,480
I still haven't found a lead
on my dad's will,

243
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,680
which still bothers me.

244
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,320
I'll think of another way.

245
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,490
I'll finally get to sleep in peace,

246
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,220
knowing that
you're no longer in that house.

247
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,630
I mean...

248
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
I'm sorry.

249
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,570
My mom is waiting for me. I must go.

250
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,770
All right. You should go.

251
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,010
Jae In. Do you feel all right?

252
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm fine, Mom.

253
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,860
I feel all right.

254
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,360
Good. I'm glad you're fine.

255
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,830
Welcome back, Jae In.
I'm glad you're here.

256
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,030
I can't even imagine
how much you would've put up with...

257
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,570
while you were there.

258
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,540
You've done well.

259
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,970
Thank you for welcoming me.

260
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,210
Thank you.

261
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,480
You probably had dinner,

262
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,480
so why don't we have some tea
to welcome her?

263
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,310
All right.
I'll get changed and come out.

264
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,450
Jae In?

265
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,960
Yes, her contract with YL will
only last for this project,

266
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,620
so we should recruit her
as soon as the project is over.

267
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,630
I'll ask.

268
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,130
She'll consider it
in a positive light.

269
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,270
All right.

270
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,100
Something's odd.

271
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,870
Why did you two stop talking
as soon as I came?

272
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,580
Well, the thing is,

273
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,950
I found out today that Jae In was
a famous interior designer...

274
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,380
who even received prestigious awards
around the world.

275
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,890
We were discussing that.

276
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,050
He's right.
That's what we were saying.

277
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,660
Really?

278
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,100
Was she really that famous a designer?

279
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,560
I want that, too.

280
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,170
Uncle Do Yun, I want to be
an awesome designer just like her.

281
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,600
Grandma, may I become a designer?

282
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,340
Of course.

283
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,540
You can do everything you want to,

284
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,340
no matter what it is.

285
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,560
Kang Jae In.

286
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,260
How can you...

287
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,730
How can you do this to me?

288
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm sorry, honey.
I shouldn't have done that.

289
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,570
Please hear me out.

290
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,300
You had second thoughts
when you heard Jae In was pregnant.

291
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,670
I thought
you'd leave Ji Ho and me...

292
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
because it seemed like
you didn't want to divorce her.

293
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,410
I became spiteful
when I thought of my poor Ji Ho...

294
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,850
and despised you for that.
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,750
I'm so sorry.

296
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,250
Leave.

297
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,050
I'm sorry for everything.

298
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,460
But it happened only once back then.

299
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,260
I never betrayed you,

300
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,330
so please believe me.

301
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,030
Didn't you hear me?

302
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,300
It's been so long
since I've seen Ji Ho,

303
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,860
so I'm about to lose it!

304
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,900
Honey, I'll return home. Okay?

305
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,870
Let's make up.

306
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,440
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

307
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,770
I told you to leave.

308
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,040
The one
you need to kick out isn't me,

309
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,710
but Designer L, Kang Jae In!

310
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,150
She made a fool of you...

311
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,050
by pretending like
she was Designer L!

312
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,120
Haven't you read the news?

313
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,290
Our stock price went up
as soon as we announced...

314
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,560
our collaboration with Designer L.

315
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,560
Our PR team is
bombarded with calls...

316
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,290
asking for an interview with her.

317
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,330
Do you really think
you and Jae In are worth the same?

318
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,400
Go do your job.

319
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,400
How can you deem her more important
while talking to me?

320
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,640
Jae In was born with everything.

321
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,870
You know how hard I had to try
to beat a girl like that.

322
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,210
You already know
how tough it was for me.

323
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,980
I'm expecting a guest soon.

324
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,120
Will you keep standing around?

325
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,730
Ms. Kang, I need a cup of coffee.

326
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,000
Add another shot,

327
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,140
get low-fat lacto-free milk,
and ground ice instead of ice cubes.

328
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,940
Throw in cinnamon powder,
tapioca, and extra chocolate.

329
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,410
Right, don't forget to add
a pump of vanilla bean syrup.

330
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,320
How dare you go on this power trip?

331
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,990
Get your own coffee.

332
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,250
Turn in your resignation...

333
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,360
or grovel before me as I say.

334
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,390
Leave it on my desk
before my day begins every day.

335
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,500
Don't let the ice melt too much.

336
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,200
Get it right the first time
if you don't want to go back.

337
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,500
And I want a paper straw
instead of plastic.

338
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,180
What are you waiting for?
Didn't you hear my order?

339
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,410
Do I have to repeat myself?

340
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,810
Se Ri, nothing good will come
from making me annoyed.

341
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,050
Add another shot,
make it with low-fat lacto-free...

342
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,190
I'll go.

343
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,300
I got your coffee, Jae In.
An Americano, right?

344
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,770
Yes.

345
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,380
I've been craving coffee. Thanks.

346
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,650
I clearly remember you telling me,
as the director of the hospital,

347
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,520
that Jae In had amnesia.

348
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,420
Say something, Director.

349
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,060
Did she tell you to lie to me?

350
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,230
Don't you remember
how much money you got from me?

351
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,030
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,330
I really had no other choice.

353
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,030
You need to see this, Gi Chan.

354
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,070
This video is spreading everywhere.

355
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,440
In the past,
I've issued a false diagnosis...

356
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,540
for Director Choi Ja Young
to help her receive...

357
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,080
a stay of execution.

358
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,720
Also, when Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
of YL Group...

359
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,860
requested another checkup,
wanting to lock up...

360
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,020
his healthy wife, Ms. Kang Jae In,
back in the mental hospital,

361
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,660
I also issued her
a false diagnosis...

362
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,530
and said she was mentally unwell.

363
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,300
Everything was done under
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's order.

364
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,510
In the process,

365
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,010
I took money...

366
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,540
from Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

367
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,770
I did a little digging
without expecting to find much,

368
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,310
but giving me a false diagnosis
under Gi Chan's order was...

369
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,980
just the tip of the iceberg.

370
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,380
You habitually harass
your nurses sexually,

371
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,420
pocket donations to the hospital
to speculate in real estate,

372
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,720
and bribed a doctor in charge...

373
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,220
to have your son exempted
from the mandatory military service.

374
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,960
What will happen
if the world finds out everything?

375
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:47,100
Is there something you want?

376
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,770
Issue a false diagnosis
and make Gi Chan believe...

377
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,770
I have amnesia.

378
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,400
Isn't that your specialty?

379
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,880
Also, record a video for me.

380
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,150
Everything was done under
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's order.

381
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,580
In the process,

382
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,920
I took money
from Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

383
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,960
Are we good?

384
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,000
It'll come in handy
when I need it most,

385
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,510
so live every single day
as if it's your last.

386
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,150
Have you lost your mind?

387
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,080
She offered to cover up
all my other misdeeds...

388
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,990
if I exposed
only the things I did for you.

389
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,650
I had no other choice.

390
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,660
I know you gave me black money,

391
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,260
so neither you nor I has
any evidence of the transaction.

392
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,870
Things may become rowdy for a while,

393
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,130
but you can always just deny it.

394
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,410
It's the PR team, Gi Chan.
They're asking for a manual.

395
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,910
Tell them everything is false,
and that I'll sue him for defamation!

396
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,020
You handed over the evidence
of his other misdeeds to Wang Sik, right?

397
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,630
Yes, by now,
he should've been arrested...

398
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,790
while returning home in peace.

399
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,830
You've been throwing jabs
and uppercuts yesterday and today.

400
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,170
Gi Chan must feel semiconscious.

401
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,940
We still have
another strong cross punch.

402
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,070
Did you figure out everything?

403
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,980
Yes, the Chinese investment company
Gi Chan bribed...

404
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,310
will receive a call soon.

405
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,620
He's dying to find another investor
that isn't DH Holdings,

406
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,650
but it won't go as he wants.

407
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,850
His position as the chairman will
seem more jeopardized every day,

408
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,790
so he'll have to take the bait.

409
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,660
The bait we prepared is
like a flytrap.

410
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,560
Yes, he'll fly right into his death.

411
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,430
If he takes our hand
without realizing it's his demise,

412
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,840
it'll be fun to see.

413
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,540
What brings you here?

414
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,850
I know you don't want to see me,

415
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,820
but I was reminded of Gyu Cheol.

416
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,590
You were the only one I could think of
to discuss our family affair.

417
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,660
I have nothing to discuss with you.

418
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,690
Gi Chan...

419
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,060
must've known all about
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

420
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,230
You knew that, right?

421
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,870
I only found out recently.

422
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:40,240
Finding out won't change anything.

423
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,970
It's all too late.

424
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,610
I'm sorry.

425
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,550
You're right.
It was too late when I found out.

426
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,820
No, I must've refused
to listen to it.

427
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,720
Back then,
I only thought of Seung Woo.

428
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,090
I couldn't listen to anything else.

429
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,660
Gyu Cheol must despise me so much.

430
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,690
It's all my fault.

431
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,770
I have no idea how I'll sort out...

432
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,540
this mess I have made.

433
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,370
What did Gyu Cheol say?

434
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,410
Have you talked to him?

435
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,980
He would do anything for you.

436
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,420
You should talk to him.

437
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,250
Ja Young.

438
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,960
What do you mean, Gyu Cheol?

439
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,160
He passed away.

440
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,700
My husband passed away?

441
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,830
To where?

442
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,600
Ms. Choi.

443
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,810
You must be tired.
Would you like to get some rest?

444
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,910
Yes, I should do that.

445
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,480
Wake me when my husband returns.

446
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,050
Yes.

447
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,850
Let's talk later, Mi Ran.

448
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,590
Isn't she acting weird?

449
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,060
Does she believe
Gyu Cheol is still alive?

450
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,600
Ms. Choi is suffering
from Alzheimer's disease.

451
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,830
Alzheimer's disease?

452
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,540
Dementia?

453
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,140
Yes.

454
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,190
What are you talking about?

455
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,660
Why did that suddenly happen?

456
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,160
No idea. The Chinese investors said
they wanted to call this thing off.

457
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,060
I even sent them more money
than they demanded.

458
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,800
Are you kidding me?

459
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,570
You should've found out
what they wanted!

460
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,200
You didn't take this job
just to act like a broker...

461
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,570
who handed over money!

462
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,540
What do you want?

463
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,310
I must tell you something.

464
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,080
I'm not in the mood, so leave.

465
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,980
I heard your deal
with the Chinese investors fell through.

466
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,450
Mr. Chairman,
please grant me one last chance.

467
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,560
I'll find another investor.

468
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,690
You?

469
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,030
Yes, sir. I'm not sure if you know,

470
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,700
but I've had years of relationships
based on trust...

471
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,100
with secretaries
and working-level employees...

472
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,700
of many other companies
since the last chairman's days.

473
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,970
We've exchanged
intel with each other,

474
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,210
so there are a few people
I can confide in.

475
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,680
I'll do whatever I can
to find a new investor.

476
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,390
Bo Ram wants to be a designer.

477
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,530
She's grown up so well
that it's a shame you can't see her.

478
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,930
You must miss her a lot.

479
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,470
I miss you a lot, too, my girl.

480
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,410
At the very least,
I want to hear your voice.

481
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,660
(Director Kim Do Yun)

482
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,760
Hello, Mom.

483
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,790
Call recordings?

484
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,200
When Do Hee bought me this phone,

485
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,330
I remembered how she set up
something called...

486
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,500
either call saving or recording.

487
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,010
I wanted to hear her voice,
so I thought of using that function.

488
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:40,810
If automatic call recording is on,
it's probably saved on the phone.

489
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,080
My Files? So it's in that app?

490
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,280
Okay. Thanks.

491
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,930
Mommy, what are you up to?

492
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,000
Bo Ram. Did you borrow
Grandma's phone to call me?

493
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,830
Yes, I was complimented
at the kindergarten today...

494
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,000
for drawing really well.

495
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,140
Really?

496
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,570
Gosh, Bo Ram. Great job.

497
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,840
You're the best.

498
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,280
Do Hee, will you come home late?

499
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,910
I heard you were working late.

500
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,880
I have a lot of overdue work,
so I'll come in late.

501
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,050
- What about Bo Ram?
- She's asleep.

502
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,090
Should I tell Do Yun to pick you up
if you'll be very late?

503
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,130
No, he's probably tired, too.

504
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,830
You should go to sleep first.
Don't wait around for me.

505
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,170
Right, Mom. There's a delicious
new bakery in front of my office.

506
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,500
Should I bring some home?

507
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,900
Or is there anything else
you want to eat? I'll get that.

508
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,410
Mommy,
when will you come home today?

509
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,550
Hey, Bo Ram.

510
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:51,810
Have you been waiting for me?

511
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,280
It began to rain,
so I had to get an umbrella.

512
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,250
Yes, I'm on my way home right now.

513
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,070
Please spare my life.

514
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,640
Please let me...

515
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,740
Please let me live.

516

(Queen's House)

517
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,990
I'm the team leader here.

518
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,630
Stop talking back to me
and do as I say.

519
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,200
I have no reason
to keep you around...

520
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,370
if I can't have fun
bossing you around.

521
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,100
Are you Designer L or Kang Jae In?

522
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,500
If you're Designer L, act like her.

523
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,210
Ji Ho.

524
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,280
It's the police!
You have to arrest this woman!

525
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,910
She's so pretty.

526
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,980
Goodness, what's with you?

527
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,220
I owe you so many apologies.

528
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,490
If I get another chance,

529
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:45,090
I'll never let go of your hand.
