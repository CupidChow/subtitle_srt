and backgrounds...)

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

(Also, children and adolescents were

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,710
(Episode 99)

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,050
Who gave you permission to die?

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,550
Just because you're dying from
some incurable disease,

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,290
you think I'll feel sorry for you
and forgive you?

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,660
Do you think I'm out of my mind?

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,960
Even if you die,

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,730
I will never forgive you.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,540
Hwang Gi Chan.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,340
So live.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,350
Do whatever it takes...

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,820
to get every possible treatment
and fight for as long as you can.

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Live.

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,590
Take responsibility for...

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,560
all your sins...

18
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,660
and get the punishment you deserve.

19
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,970
Don't hide behind your illness
like a coward.

20
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,940
Live.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Right now,

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,360
do you have any idea how happy I am?

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,760
Because of all people,

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,400
you're the one telling me to live.

25
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,000
Telling me that I'm allowed to.

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,940
When I said I was dying,

27
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,780
I thought you'd be more thrilled
than anyone.

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,420
Don't...

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,890
do anything you'll regret.

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,390
At least, for Eun Ho's sake,

31
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,430
be a father he won't be ashamed of
when you're gone.

32
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,540
- Ji Ho! Mom's home!
- For goodness' sake.

33
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,110
- Ji Ho!
- I told you, he's in kindergarten!

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,210
You have some nerve showing up here
after what you did to my son.

35
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,540
What am I doing?
I should be calling the police.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,850
Mother, you can't report me.

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,450
You know better than that.

38
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,950
What are you talking about?

39
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,280
And why can't I?

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,590
Because I have definitive proof
that Gi Chan murdered Kim Do Hee.

41
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,320
Are you really okay with that?

42
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,430
You're lying!

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,700
That's all just circumstantial evidence
or something.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,830
If you had real proof,
he would've been arrested ages ago.

45
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,270
Do you want me to show you?

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,210
(Dashcam Footage)

47
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,510
Do you still doubt
that I have his life in my hands?

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
So,

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,090
how are you threatening my mom,
using my life as collateral?

50
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,120
It's a misunderstanding.
I just want to be with you.

51
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,490
Mom, what are you doing?

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,190
I told you to call the police
the second you saw her.

53
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,000
Honey, I was wrong.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Get your filthy hands off me!

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,800
Do you expect me to forgive you
who tried to kill my brother?

56
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,470
What are you doing, Mom?
Call the police.

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,140
Right.

58
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,450
Gi Chan,

59
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,820
we can't report her,
and we can't throw her out.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,990
What are you talking about?

61
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,630
The video of you hitting Kim Do Hee
with your car.

62
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,770
She has it on that dashcam
or whatever it's called.

63
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,940
What if she goes to the police
just to save her own skin?

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,110
No.
You must restore our family's name.

65
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,980
You can't go to jail.
Absolutely not.

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,880
Mom, I'm dying.

67
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,550
I know.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,490
I'm sure you feel like you're dying
because of that witch.

69
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,320
I get it.

70
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,290
But we have to cover up what we can.

71
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,930
Even if you can't stand her,
just grit your teeth and bear it.

72
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,560
We have to think about the future.

73
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,570
- All right?
- I'm about to die.

74
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,600
What are you talking about?

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,770
What do you mean you're dying?

76
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,870
Your son...

77
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,910
doesn't have much time left to live.

78
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,880
Don't even joke about that.
It's bad luck.

79
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,260
Are you just trying
to scare your mother?

80
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,260
It's stomach cancer.

81
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,430
Terminal stomach cancer.

82
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,870
My son.

83
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,240
My son is going to die?

84
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,780
It can't be.

85
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,380
Gi Chan.

86
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,690
It's not true, is it?

87
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,050
Right?

88
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,530
Oh, no. This can't be happening,
Gi Chan.

89
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,300
If you die,
how am I supposed to go on?

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,900
I can't live without you.

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,540
I can't go on.

92
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,110
Gi Chan. It can't be true.

93
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,510
Gi Chan is terminally ill?

94
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,680
He's dying.

95
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,380
So, Gi Chan is
actually going to die?

96
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,820
Right.

97
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,050
I have to stick it out
if I want to get Ji Ho's inheritance.

98
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,200
Honey.

99
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,070
I heard about you dying.
What nonsense is this?

100
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,440
It's not true, right?

101
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Right?

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,810
You're not dying.
Why would you be dying?

103
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,680
It's none of your business.

104
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,080
- Get out.
- I'm not leaving.

105
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,680
I'll do what it takes to save you.

106
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,380
- I won't let you die.
- Oh, no.

107
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,350
How could fate be so cruel?

108
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,090
After all the offerings I've made,

109
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,400
first, you made
one of my sons a fool,

110
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,670
and now you're taking the pillar
of our family.

111
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,970
Darn it all.

112
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,810
Hey, why is everyone crying?

113
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,310
Did something happen
to our family again?

114
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,520
I can't go on.

115
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,290
I can't live without my Gi Chan.

116
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,300
With that good-for-nothing idiot
burden of a son,

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,430
how am I supposed to survive
on my own?

118
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,370
I can't go on.

119
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,810
I can't?

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Why not?

121
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
I have to.

122
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,190
The living have to find a way
to survive.

123
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,450
Wait a minute.

124
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,730
Oh, right.

125
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,870
The one I took out on Gi Man.
And the one I took out on Na Ra.

126
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,940
Here it is.
The life insurance for Gi Chan.

127
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,210
Thank goodness
I never missed a payment.

128
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,650
Hold on.
I have to keep paying the premiums.

129
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,460
Then I can at least get the payout
when Gi Chan is gone.

130
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,690
I guess I'll have to sell something.

131
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,170
(Certificate of Insurance)

132
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,940
This one is a limited edition.
It'd be a shame to sell it.

133
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,240
You know Uncle
is building our new house.

134
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,680
He said
you should pick out a bed for it.

135
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,110
Your uncle is really something else.

136
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,320
Can I help you find something?

137
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,750
Yes, my mom is on her feet all day,

138
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,690
so her back has been bothering her,
and her legs swell up often.

139
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,190
You need a bed with firm support.

140
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,060
Why don't you lie down here?

141
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,300
Go ahead and try it, Mom.

142
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,410
It's so comfortable and plush.
It feels really supportive too.

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,810
The right mattress
can make a big difference...

144
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,150
in your body's recovery.

145
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,290
Thanks to you, I'll finally be able
to get a comfortable night's sleep.

146
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,190
I just want you to be comfortable,
at least when you're sleeping.

147
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,620
Yes.

148
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,300
- I'm off to a meeting.
- Okay.

149
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,930
- Please, have a seat.
- Thanks.

150
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,270
I promised Ji Ho I'd get him a gift.

151
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,080
But neither Kang Se Ri
nor Hwang Gi Chan is answering my calls.

152
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,720
I feel like I might have told
Hwang Gi Chan about Ji Ho too soon,

153
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,880
and now I'm worried.

154
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,350
I'll look into it.

155
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,220
Hello?

156
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,370
Thank you for coming.

157
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,030
No one's home right now.

158
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,240
This is a gift for Ji Ho.

159
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,770
This one, too.

160
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,140
Teo asked me to pass this on.

161
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,610
How's Ji Ho doing?

162
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,390
Where is Ji Ho? Is he in his room?

163
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,850
He's in kindergarten.

164
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,090
There's something I need to tell you
about Gi Chan.

165
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,800
I heard he was very sick.

166
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,240
Could you please forgive him?

167
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,970
Could you please save him?

168
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,440
It's not my place to say anything.

169
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,010
That's up to him, isn't it?

170
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,720
But if you say something,
he might...

171
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,420
I'll go put this in Ji Ho's room.
Where is it?

172
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,040
(Mr. Hong)

173
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,710
It's me, Mr. Hong.

174
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,520
I need some pocket money in here.

175
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,490
Send some money to my commissary.

176
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,190
What? Cat got your tongue?

177
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,890
You know if I talk to prosecutors,
you'll end up in here too.

178
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,030
You can't just blow me off.

179
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,270
Am I wrong?

180
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,140
Fine.
Just text me the account number.

181
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,340
I found a cell phone.

182
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,410
It's Kang Se Ri's.

183
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,820
I just found this
at Hwang Gi Chan's place.

184
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,420
Hong Man Su used this phone
to call Se Ri.

185
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,560
It's password-protected,
so I couldn't see what's on it,

186
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,190
but I think
Kang Se Ri might have been using it...

187
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,630
for criminal activities.

188
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,430
That would make sense.

189
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,200
Why else would she need two phones?

190
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,300
It's likely a burner phone,
but we should check to be sure.

191
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,580
If we want to see what's inside,
we have to crack the password first.

192
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,110
I'll take it to a specialist.

193
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,610
I'd appreciate that.

194
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,580
Dad.

195
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,750
I don't want to go to kindergarten.

196
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,620
Do I have to go?

197
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
Why?

198
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,030
Did you fight with your friends
in kindergarten?

199
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,940
Ji Ho, it's okay.

200
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,610
You can tell me anything.

201
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,610
What happened?

202
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,510
Look at me.

203
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,180
Dad, are you a bad person?

204
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,620
My friends say you and Mom
are bad people.

205
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,260
You're not, right? Right, Dad?

206
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,610
A clean home is a healthy home.

207
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,450
(If something happens to me,
Se Ri is behind it.)

208
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,420
"If something happens to me,
Se Ri is behind it."

209
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,860
"Not a match?"

210
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,930
Mom.

211
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,000
I made some noodles.
Do you want some?

212
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,100
Hey, look at this. What is this?

213
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,040
What is it?
Why are you so surprised?

214
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,470
Ji Ho...

215
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,010
It says...

216
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,710
Ji Ho isn't Gi Chan's son.

217
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,750
What? What does that mean?

218
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,120
Wait, if he's not Gi Chan's son,
then whose son is he?

219
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,860
Hey, look at this.

220
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,500
Na Ra is saying...

221
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,270
this means
he's not your flesh and blood.

222
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,370
Take Ji Ho and Gi Man
and go play outside.

223
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,940
What? Okay.

224
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,170
Ji Ho, let's go to the playground.
You come too, Gi Man.

225
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,380
Really? The playground!
This will be fun!

226
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,280
Na Ra, push me on the swing!
The swing!

227
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,290
Don't say anything to Ji Ho.

228
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,020
Is it true?
Is Ji Ho really not your son?

229
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,860
Genetics don't matter.

230
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,200
I raised him as my son,
so he is my son.

231
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,730
Don't be ridiculous!
That darn Kang Se Ri.

232
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,940
How dare she make a cuckoo's nest
in our family?

233
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,840
And the real father?

234
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,910
Do you even know
who the real father is?

235
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,040
It's Teo.

236
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,710
Lee Teo, the art dealer.

237
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780
Oh, no.

238
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,820
They must think our family's a joke.

239
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,360
How could they be so shameless,
parading around us without a care?

240
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,990
Mother, what's wrong?

241
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,460
What's going on?

242
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,300
You witch! I could tear you apart!
You darned cuckoo witch!

243
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,800
You dared bring another man's seed
into the Hwang family!

244
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,040
Mother, I can explain everything.

245
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,140
Explain what?

246
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,710
That you passed off another man's child
on my son as his own?

247
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,480
What is there to explain? Just die!

248
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,520
Die! Just die, you witch!

249
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,420
Stop, you're going to kill me!
Mother, you'll be a murderer!

250
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,760
Fine by me.
Killing you would be worth it.

251
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,190
- You witch, die! Die!
- Mother!

252
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,930
Stop it, please!

253
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,300
Don't you dare say a word of this
to Ji Ho.

254
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,170
It's not his fault.

255
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,990
So when are you going to send
the commissary money?

256
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,390
What are you talking about?

257
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,730
You said on the phone you'd send it.
Are you backing out now?

258
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,670
Wait a second.

259
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,770
What do you mean
I took a call earlier?

260
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,740
Who? Me?

261
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,410
Who else would answer your phone?

262
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,070
Na Ra,

263
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,470
did anyone come by the house?

264
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,240
Jae In came by.
She brought food and toys for Ji Ho.

265
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,150
Kang Jae In was here?

266
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,580
Got it.

267
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,380
Okay, Se Ri. Calm down.

268
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,720
The phone is password-protected,
so it'll take her a while to get in.

269
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,430
And if she tries to recover files,
it'll take even longer.

270
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,860
I just need to grab everything I can
and leave Korea before she does.

271
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,940
You seem to be doing so well lately,
and it makes me happy too.

272
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,410
After my dementia diagnosis,

273
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:55,250
I realized how few things in life
are actually important.

274
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,620
You practically raised your brother
like a son,

275
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,890
so I'd be furious and resentful too
if I were you.

276
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,320
Just try to open your heart
a little.

277
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,860
Just a tiny crack.

278
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,460
Just a tiny bit.

279
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,100
I thought you were going to tell me
to forgive them completely.

280
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,700
Just a little bit?

281
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,110
If you had wanted to cut them off,
you could have kicked them out.

282
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,110
If you open your heart just a bit,
you're already halfway there.

283
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,480
The rest is up to them.

284
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,290
You said you'd come pick her up,
Min Jun.

285
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
Thanks to you,
we had a really nice chat.

286
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,100
Next time, you and Bo Ram
should come to our place.

287
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,830
Ready to go?

288
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,220
We're home.

289
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,220
We ran into Jae In's mom and Min Jun
on our way in, so we said hi.

290
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,860
You've been seeing them
a lot lately?

291
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,060
She's been doing really well lately,
which is a relief.

292
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,770
You two. Go bring me that thing.

293
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,170
That thing?

294
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,640
For the new house we're moving into.

295
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,710
The blueprints was it?

296
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,010
I want to take another proper look.

297
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,650
So bring it here.

298
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,280
The house where we'll all
live together?

299
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,890
You want to see the blueprints
for that house?

300
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,220
- I'll go get it.
- Okay.

301
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,660
Yun Hee.

302
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,530
Thank you.

303
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll spend the rest of my life
making it up to you.

304
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,470
That's so cringey. Get away from me.

305
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,740
I'm just saying I'll wait and see
how it goes.

306
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,070
I'm not forgiving you completely.

307
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,340
I'm just opening a tiny, tiny crack.

308
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,410
That's good enough for me.
I'll work to open it all the way.

309
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,620
Don't you worry.

310
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,230
All this time, we thought he was
our own flesh and blood.

311
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,500
We treated him as the precious heir
who would succeed Chairman Hwang.

312
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,970
We gave him...

313
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,000
the best of everything,
from food to clothes, and you name it.

314
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,810
I mean your son, Hwang...

315
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,640
Oh, that's right. Just Ji Ho.

316
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,310
I'm aware.

317
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,410
Then shouldn't you be on your knees
thanking me right now?

318
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,350
After my whole family was tricked
into raising him?

319
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,020
Do you have any idea what it cost us
to raise your son?

320
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,060
I'm going to get that money back.
Now, pay up.

321
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,100
They say a child thrives best
when raised by their birth parents.

322
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,400
So if you pay the right price,

323
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,700
even if my Gi Chan says no,
I'll hand the boy over to you.

324
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,840
Are you telling me...

325
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,870
I have to buy my own son
back from you?

326
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,240
As an art dealer,
you of all people should understand.

327
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,380
Limited editions are worth more,
and the seller names the price.

328
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,190
If someone cared for your child,
it's only fair that you pay them.

329
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,390
Look, I'm not asking for much.

330
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,690
Just the cost of his food, clothes,
and shelter so far.

331
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,830
Let's say three million dollars.
That's practically pocket change.

332
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,330
Noh Sook Ja!

333
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,370
Who are you to get angry
with your elders, you punk?

334
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,670
I'm taking my son back.
I don't need your permission.

335
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,670
And I have no intention of haggling
over him like he's some product.

336
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,010
We're done talking. Get out.

337
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Get out!

338
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,110
Darn it, fine! I'm leaving!

339
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,190
Darn it! If you won't pay,
you can forget taking Ji Ho back.

340
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,820
You just sit back and watch
what I do to him!

341
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,540
It's me.

342
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,370
We need to meet. Right now.

343
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,220
Your mother demanded money from me
for raising Ji Ho.

344
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,320
Three million dollars.

345
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,490
Are you in on this?

346
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,160
I can't believe all of you
are making a business deal...

347
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,260
out of a child.

348
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,400
And the way all of you treat Ji Ho
like property...

349
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,040
I'll report you all for child abuse
or whatever I can.

350
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,270
I recorded every awful thing
your mother said.

351
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,240
That wasn't my idea.

352
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,750
I never agreed to it.

353
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,350
Even after I found out
Ji Ho wasn't my biological son,

354
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,120
nothing has changed for me.

355
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,020
Ji Ho...

356
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,720
is the son I raised.

357
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,870
He can't stand to pay
for his own son's care?

358
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,800
What are you doing over there?

359
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,240
It's nothing, Mother.

360
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,070
Stop! Get over here.

361
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,880
Wait a minute. Why are my official seal
and ID card in here?

362
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,720
- Mother, about that...
- You...

363
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,550
Give that here.

364
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,590
Why do you have
Gi Chan's life insurance certificate?

365
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,230
Hold on a second.

366
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,900
Why isn't my name listed
as the beneficiary,

367
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,600
and why is your name here instead?

368
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,740
You little witch.
You planned to steal my son's money?

369
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,510
Yes. I changed the beneficiary
to my name.

370
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,810
Is there a problem?

371
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,220
What? What did you just say?

372
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,690
Before it's your son's insurance money,

373
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,860
it's insurance money that my son,
Gi Chan's son, should receive.

374
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,060
Why should you be the one
to collect it?

375
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,230
He has a child,
and he has a wife right here.

376
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,500
What are you talking about?
Gi Chan doesn't have a son.

377
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,600
It's bad enough we were tricked
into raising that boy,

378
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,770
but now you're trying to steal
his life insurance?

379
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,470
It's my son's life insurance,
so it's mine!

380
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,040
And it's for my husband's life too!

381
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,710
You call yourselves a family?

382
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,150
Your son is dying,

383
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,350
your husband is dying,

384
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,320
and you're fighting
over who gets my life insurance?

385
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,620
You're trying
to cash in on my life insurance...

386
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,690
before I'm even dead?

387
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,190
Oh, no...

388
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,510
Gi Chan,
how am I meant to live without you?

389
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,640
I was just so scared, that's why...

390
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,010
Honey, no matter what,
Ji Ho is your son.

391
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,880
And that's why
you're not abandoning him.

392
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,950
So, everything
that you leave behind...

393
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,220
- should go to Ji Ho. It's his.
- Shut up!

394
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,590
I said, shut up.

395
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,970
Is this the insurance company?

396
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,740
Hi, I'd like to cancel
a change of beneficiary...

397
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,780
and change it back
to the original person.

398
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Yes, that's right.

399
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,250
Thanks for coming to see me.

400
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,190
I didn't think you would.

401
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,690
When I hit my breaking point,

402
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,030
all I could think about was you.

403
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,540
It's pathetic, isn't it?

404
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,180
My own mother, and even Kang Se Ri,

405
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,350
they're family,
but they don't even tell me to live.

406
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,880
They're so blinded by money...

407
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,620
that instead of caring
about me dying,

408
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,160
they're greedy for the insurance money
they'll get when I'm gone.

409
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,630
I guess that's why I thought
of you even more.

410
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,100
You were the only one
who told a guy like me to live.

411
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,770
What's the point of saying that now?

412
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,650
I'm not the one
who will be by your side.

413
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Jae In, I'm sorry.

414
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,220
I was wrong.

415
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,860
I was wrong about everything.

416
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,070
I'm so scared, Jae In.

417
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,170
Just like this...

418
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
I'm so scared of dying all alone.

419
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,110
In my final moments,

420
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
could you...

421
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,650
be the one by my side?

422
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,220
Please, Jae In, I'm begging you.

423
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,090
Hwang Gi Chan.

424
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,330
You're going to suffer in the abyss.

425
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,900
Which means you'll never see
our Eun Ho again.

426
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,840
But even so, if...

427
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
by some sheer coincidence,

428
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,410
even on your way to the underworld,

429
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:57,950
and if by some complete accident,

430
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,120
you happen to meet our Eun Ho,

431
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,420
I hope you face him as a father...

432
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,320
who used to have a shred
of a conscience.

433
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,200
Whatever time you have left,

434
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,430
I hope you can live
without any more regrets.

435
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,070
That's all I have left
to say to you.

436
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,620
- A bite for Mom.
- For me?

437
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,990
- Oh, my.
- It's delicious.

438
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,790
Hwang Eun Ho!
What do you think you're doing?

439
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,930
I'm going to Mom!

440
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,330
Go to your room!

441
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,100
Go to your room and think about
what you did! Right now!

442
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,940
Mom...

443
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,310
Eun Ho.

444
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,080
Daddy is sorry.

445
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,620
Daddy is so sorry.

446
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Daddy...

447
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,590
was such a terrible father.

448
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,020
Hello, sir.

450
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,990
Well, hello there.

451
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,140
Ji Ho, do you remember
what I told you?

452
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Yes.

453
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,880
You said you and Mom are going away
for a long, long time for work,

454
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:43,410
and if I go live with Teo in the US,
you promised you'd come and see me.

455
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,580
You're really coming, right, Dad?

456
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,550
Of course I will.

457
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,390
Ji Ho.

458
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,490
I'm sorry I couldn't play
with you more.

459
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,800
How about a hug?

460
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,510
Ji Ho.

461
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,950
Don't cry until I get back.

462
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,650
Listen to Teo,

463
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,720
and stay strong and healthy for me.

464
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
All right?

465
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,830
Okay.

466
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,760
Dad, you can't cry either,
even if you miss me.

467
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,770
You have to be brave
and healthy, too.

468
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,940
Okay.

469
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,980
All the necessary legal documents
are in here.

470
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,450
Please...

471
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,860
take good care of Ji Ho.

472
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,230
Of course. Don't worry.

473
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,270
What do you mean
there's new evidence?

474
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,700
A face-to-face interrogation
with Jae In?

475
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,040
To find out that Kang Se Ri ordered
Hong Man Su to kill Jae In...

476
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,210
and whether I knew
that led to Eun Ho's death?

477
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,820
Even on your way to the underworld,

478
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,090
if you happen to meet our Eun Ho,

479
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,020
I hope you face him as a father...

480
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,930
who used to have a shred
of a conscience.

481
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,030
No.

482
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,170
I'll go to the police by 2 p.m. tomorrow
and tell them everything.

483
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,490
