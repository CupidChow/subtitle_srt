1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,470
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,170
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,880
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,850
(Episode 94)

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,620
That's enough.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,560
Jae In, didn't you say you had
to head home early?

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,170
Let's go. I'll take you home.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,140
Sorry, I'm going to head out first.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,450
Let's have a drink, Chairman.

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,150
The chicken here is amazing.

11
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,890
Way to kill the mood.
Can't he read the room?

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,090
We were finally enjoying ourselves,

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,760
and he just killed the vibe.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,530
Well then,
how about we call it a night...

15
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,730
and get together again soon?

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,670
Sounds good.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,940
How about just the two of us go
for a drink? Deal?

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm in.

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,940
Shall we make a quiet exit home together?

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
That's enough.

21
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,440
We're here, Do Yun.

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,580
We're here.

23
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,020
Oh, right.

24
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,350
What's on your mind?

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,860
It's nothing. You should go inside.

26
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,130
Thanks for the ride.

27
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,030
Get home safely.

28
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,280
It's a shame the company dinner
ended so abruptly.

29
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:21,880
Want to grab a drink?

30
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,980
Maybe next time.
I have things to do.

31
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,450
In front of all those people,

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,760
it's was not a good look
trying to drag a woman away.

33
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,160
As the chairman,

34
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,600
you should be more mindful
of your conduct.

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,960
And it's not like
she's just an acquaintance.

36
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,970
Especially since you two are over.

37
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,770
Over?

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,040
Jae In is your ex-wife, right?

39
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,010
You knew?

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,880
Of course.

41
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,940
I told you.

42
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm interested in her.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,950
So you knew she was my ex-wife
and still said that to my face.

44
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,620
Well, you two are nothing
to each other now.

45
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,420
Why should I be careful?

46
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,260
Like I said,
I'm not one to dwell on the past.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,460
Go on, then.

48
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:37,220
What did you have to say to Jae In
that you'd drag her away in public?

49
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,890
Why are you suddenly so obsessed
with Jae In?

50
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,030
Stop that nasty habit of yours
of tearing into people.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,230
I said I won't interfere if you two
see each other, and I won't,

52
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,200
but at least have some decency.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,170
Is cheating something to brag about?

54
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,310
If you're going to see her,
do it in secret.

55
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,440
Everyone in the company knows
I'm your wife.

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,640
What does that make me look like?

57
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,780
You're so loud.

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,510
You're giving me a headache.
Get out.

59
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,150
I am still your wife.

60
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,160
So I'll find out what's owed to me
and claim what's rightfully mine.

61
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,160
Where's the slush fund
that Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol left?

62
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,630
See? I'm not the only one
keeping secrets.

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,240
How long were you planning on
keeping this from me?

64
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,110
Everything you've accomplished,
everything you have,

65
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,980
you didn't do it all on your own.

66
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,810
We built this together.

67
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,050
So I have a right to know
and a right to my share.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,720
Where's the slush fund?

69
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,020
I don't know.
I haven't found it yet.

70
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,990
You really haven't found it?

71
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,760
Yes.
If I had it, would Jae In be quiet?

72
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,200
Then you'd better share it with me.
Exactly how much you know.

73
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,770
I don't know much.
All I have is a note with an address.

74
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,150
Hey...

75
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:23,490
So your mom said things while drunk,
and now you're not talking to me?

76
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,700
I was too hungover to eat yesterday.
Aren't you worried about me at all?

77
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,270
I haven't seen you in two days,

78
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,640
and I've wasted away to nothing.

79
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,610
We'll put the door over here
and make it a sliding pocket door.

80
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,580
Here's some coffee for everyone.

81
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,150
Thank you. I appreciate it.

82
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,230
If she has a great man by her side,

83
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,960
no losers would even dare
to come near, right?

84
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,160
The more I see him,
the more I like him.

85
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,630
I heard he's a famous art dealer.

86
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,540
This one? Okay.

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,810
- This one is for Jae In.
- Thanks.

88
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,940
Is it okay if I treat you
like an older brother?

89
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,210
Whatever you're comfortable with.
You can just call me by my name.

90
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,480
So what do you think of my sister?
You two look so good together.

91
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,590
Kang Seung Woo, stop joking around.

92
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,990
I'm not.
I'm being 100 percent serious.

93
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,470
He says we look great together.
Shouldn't we try to humor him?

94
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,540
Please forgive him.
He's just a doting younger brother.

95
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,610
He sets me up with anyone he likes,
so please don't get the wrong idea.

96
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,170
Don't worry about it.

97
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm actually flattered.

98
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,340
I'm a fool for you too, you know.

99
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,220
See? I've got a good eye
for these things.

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,190
Jae In, a straightforward guy
like Teo...

101
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,760
is honest and manly,
and he'd be a great match for you.

102
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,660
Seung Woo,
I told you to cut it out.

103
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,600
I have an off-site meeting.
I'll be back later.

104
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,810
Have a good meeting.

105
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,860
What's going on?
Something's felt off for a few days.

106
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,890
Like I forgot to eat something,

107
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,400
or forgot to see someone.

108
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,130
Right, I haven't seen
Hwang Na Ra around.

109
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,900
She used to constantly pester me.
No wonder it's been so quiet.

110
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,640
I think she asked me to go
to the movies around this time.

111
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,140
I bet she even sent me
the tickets already.

112
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,490
Hello? Who is this?

113
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,120
You wanted to see a movie today.

114
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,760
Assistant Manager Kang?
Is that really you?

115
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,270
Did you ask some other guy
to the movies?

116
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,400
No! I only have eyes for one person.

117
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,810
You sound energetic enough.
Be there on time.

118
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,750
You'll really see a movie with me?

119
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,720
Never mind.

120
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,220
I don't deserve to see a movie.

121
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,090
I don't deserve to be happy
with you.

122
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,660
I'll be at the cafe
in front of the theater after work.

123
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,400
But I told you I can't go!
Don't wait for me.

124
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,470
I'll just wait here
until you show up.

125
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,310
What?

126
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,570
Hello?

127
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,820
Ji Ho said he wanted to see you,
Princess, so we came.

128
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,290
That's right, Auntie.

129
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,360
I mean, Princess.

130
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,430
What were you thinking,
just bringing him out like this?

131
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,230
Did you ask his parents
for permission first?

132
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,170
I'm his big brother,
so I don't need permission.

133
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,770
Right?

134
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,670
Can we draw here?

135
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,810
We even brought our own supplies.

136
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,680
Go ahead. You can use the table.

137
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,080
Excuse me.

138
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,650
Looks like you have company.

139
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,420
Yes, something like that.
What brings you here now?

140
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,460
I was in the area for work.
But what's going on?

141
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,490
First, I need you to look at this.
Hwang Gi Man drew these.

142
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,840
They're all pictures of stairs.

143
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,910
I heard his accident
was a fall down the stairs.

144
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,010
It's strange for an amnesiac
to draw stairs so compulsively.

145
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,980
You're right.
It's definitely strange.

146
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,280
He may not remember it,

147
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,820
but the fall's trauma
could be showing...

148
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,190
in his subconscious drawings.

149
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,520
So you think it might not have been
a simple falling accident?

150
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,100
Well, looking at these, the trauma
from the accident must've been huge.

151
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,370
I drew my dad.

152
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,740
I want to show this to my dad.

153
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,340
Let's go show it to Gi Chan.
I know where his company is.

154
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,250
I have to go back to the office.
I'll take them to their parents.

155
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,290
And it'd be awkward for you
to contact that family anyway.

156
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,350
That would be a huge help.
Thank you.

157
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,830
Ji Ho, this gentleman is taking you
and your uncle to your father.

158
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,400
I was hoping for dinner tonight,
but I have another appointment.

159
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Let's do it next time.

160
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,600
Right. I have plans tonight too.

161
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,240
Mom!

162
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,840
Ji Ho!

163
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,550
Mom, I missed you.

164
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,380
Ji Ho, have you been well?

165
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,650
I ran into them at Yu Gyeong's.

166
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,050
I brought them because
I heard they were coming here.

167
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,630
Oh! There's Gi Chan!

168
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,630
Gi Chan!

169
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,900
Hey! It's Dad!

170
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
Dad!

171
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,840
Hey there, Ji Ho. Up you go!

172
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,340
Ji Ho, how did you come here?

173
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,580
I said my uncle and I were going
to see you at your office,

174
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,080
so that man over there
gave me a ride.

175
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,550
Ji Ho, do you want to go
to the office with me?

176
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
Come with me, Gi Man.

177
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,900
Try not to let it get to you.

178
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,800
Teo?
Was this the appointment you had?

179
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,070
Yes. And you?

180
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,640
Seung Woo booked it.
He said the vibe here was great.

181
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,770
Seung Woo did?

182
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,110
My goodness.

183
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,120
Don't tell me Seung Woo asked
to meet you too.

184
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,850
He did.

185
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,920
Unbelievable.

186
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,100
Teo.

187
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,600
About today...

188
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,540
I think Seung Woo
must have gotten the wrong idea.

189
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,910
I know what you're trying to say.

190
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,880
I had no idea
this was going to happen either.

191
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,480
I'm so sorry.
I'll have a word with Seung Woo.

192
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,720
There's no need.

193
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,360
He even booked us a table here.
Isn't it fun?

194
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,230
That of all people, we're the ones
caught in this unexpected situation.

195
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,770
I don't know.
I guess we did get caught up in it.

196
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,210
I actually like the unexpectedness.
You know, a coincidence? A surprise?

197
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,680
That little bit of magic
you find in unexpected moments.

198
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,710
And that's why I'm enjoying this.

199
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,890
Let's not give it a second thought...

200
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,490
and just enjoy ourselves.
What do you say?

201
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,670
Jae In and Teo both got off work
early today, right?

202
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,670
That's right.

203
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,940
But weren't you supposed
to meet Jae In?

204
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,310
Jae In said she had dinner plans
with you before she left.

205
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,580
I played matchmaker
for Jae In and Teo.

206
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,320
I have a knack for matchmaking.
When two people seem right together,

207
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,460
I just get a gut feeling, you know?

208
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,960
Anyway, I have an appointment,
so I should get going.

209
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,040
Oh, it's not a date or anything.

210
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,100
It's more like humanitarian.

211
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,510
Something like that.

212
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,710
What about you?
Do you have a girlfriend?

213
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,710
Not at the moment.

214
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,850
Me neither.

215
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,720
Maybe we single guys should work out
together sometime.

216
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,190
Okay. That sounds good.

217
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,420
Great. Well, I'll get going then.

218
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:21,390
It's been a while.
Won't you even let me see your face?

219
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,990
I'm a mess,
and I'm not wearing any makeup.

220
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,630
So what?

221
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,900
Who wants to show their bare face
to the guy they like?

222
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,670
So I told you not to come,
but you insisted on waiting.

223
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,870
You said you wanted to see a movie.
Let's go.

224
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,270
It's been a while. Let's just talk
instead of seeing a movie.

225
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,840
About how you've been lately
and all that.

226
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,380
I don't want to talk about it.

227
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,910
Fine, then you can
just listen to me.

228
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
What can I get you to drink?

229
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,060
Wait, so Director Kang Mi Ran
is your birth mother,

230
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,630
and CEO Patrick of DH Holdings
is your biological father?

231
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,360
It's wild, isn't it?

232
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
You haven't known about CEO Patrick
for very long, have you?

233
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,900
But you seem to be handling it
surprisingly well.

234
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,210
- Weren't you shocked?
- I was surprised,

235
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,140
but it's not like he knew
about me all along.

236
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,910
It's not as if he knew I existed
and chose to ignore me.

237
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,820
He knows now,
and we can try to connect.

238
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,050
It's not a crime
to not know something.

239
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,990
It's what you do after you find out,

240
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,760
that's what really matters,
don't you think?

241
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,790
Right.

242
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,230
What you do after you find out...

243
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,470
That's true.

244
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,400
Do you know
about my family's situation?

245
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,110
A little. Patrick told me.

246
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,410
But I thought you didn't want
to talk about it today.

247
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,080
Let's just stick
to me doing the talking.

248
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,450
What brings you here
all of a sudden?

249
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,420
Is something wrong?

250
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,390
No.

251
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,060
I should go. You should head in.

252
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,200
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

253
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Do Yun?

254
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,450
I guess I was jealous.

255
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,450
I heard from Assistant Manager
Kang Seung Woo.

256
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,750
About your dinner plans with Teo.

257
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,030
You're free to see whoever you want,
Jae In.

258
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,930
It's not like
I have any right to object,

259
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,600
but I liked you first.

260
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,200
Saying it out loud
sounds so childish.

261
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,440
I sound like a little kid, don't I?

262
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,110
Just forget I said that.

263
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,550
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,550
I'll get going.

265
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,550
We just had dinner.

266
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,160
Nothing else happened.

267
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,530
What you said about waiting for me.

268
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,600
I haven't forgotten that.

269
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,570
Mom, you're taking good care
of yourself.

270
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,210
How have your knees been lately?

271
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,210
Thanks to you, I am taking this.
The throbbing pain is much better.

272
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,150
And I feel like the stiffness
in my joints has eased up too.

273
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,420
Thank you.

274
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,490
Keep taking it
for your joint health.

275
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,630
I'll order more when you run out.

276
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,230
- I'm heading out.
- Okay, be safe.

277
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,030
Watch out for cars.

278
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,200
Hey, you're here.

279
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,710
She's in good spirits today.

280
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,810
Mom, I'm here.

281
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,320
Shouldn't you be at work?
What are you doing here?

282
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,150
I came to hang out with you, Mom.

283
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,890
Don't worry. I took the day off.

284
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,760
Mom, do you know how hard I worked
just so I could take today off?

285
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,060
Pretty great, right?

286
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,400
Come on, Mom. Pat me on the head
and tell me I did a good job.

287
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,270
Stop coming here. Just go.

288
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,470
Mom, come on. Hang out with me.

289
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Please?

290
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,290
You're being a nuisance. Just go.

291
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,590
Mom.

292
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,360
Mom, look at me. Please?

293
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,670
I heard you told Mi Ran
to legally register me as her son.

294
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
She's your biological mother.

295
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,040
Now that
you've found out everything,

296
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,370
so you don't need
to remain on my register.

297
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,310
Think of it as setting things right
and sort it out quickly.

298
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,450
I'm tired. I need to rest.

299
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
Leave.

300
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,960
Mom, you know how stubborn I can be.

301
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,260
I think I get it all from you.

302
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,640
It's true Mi Ran gave birth to me,

303
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,070
and I know
she's my biological mother.

304
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,970
But, Mom...

305
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,780
To me, you're my mom.

306
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,780
That's true now,

307
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,950
and it'll be true
even if you forget who I am.

308
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,690
I don't know how long you'll be able
to remember me.

309
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,760
I'm going to do my best
to slow it down.

310
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,130
But we can't waste the time
we have.

311
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Right?

312
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,540
So, no more talk about
the family register,

313
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,110
and if you're tired, sleep, and then
we'll hang out when you wake up.

314
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,740
You'll hang out with me, right, Mom?

315
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,860
How's the internal audit
on Hwang Gi Chan going?

316
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,770
It's taking longer than expected.

317
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,200
It seems the Louis B case
was just the tip of the iceberg.

318
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,140
We're finding one suspicious thing
after another.

319
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:59,340
We're reviewing all the projects
he handled before becoming chairman,

320
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,680
so it's going to take a while.

321
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,150
Hwang Gi Chan thinks the audit
is just about the Louis B project?

322
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,290
Jae In, you know the head
of the audit team.

323
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,290
Nothing is going to get out.

324
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,700
Yes, he's a principled man
since my father's time.

325
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,970
- Are you in contact with his board?
- Yes.

326
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,940
The neutral members are with us,
so there isn't much pushback.

327
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,840
Besides, they're all veterans
from my brother's time.

328
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,980
They're sharp enough to figure out
what's best for the company,

329
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,050
and what's in their
own best interest.

330
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,020
Jae In, just be ready to take down
Hwang Gi Chan at the meeting.

331
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,760
And we need to take him down so hard...

332
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,090
that he never even thinks
of coming back.

333
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,860
Right.

334
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,500
I'll do everything I can to help.

335
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,100
I worked myself to the bone
to raise that boy.

336
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,710
He's in and out in a flash,
morning and evening.

337
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,970
He doesn't even show his face.

338
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,440
How many days has it been now?

339
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,380
What? He's miserable because of me?

340
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,910
He lost Jae In?

341
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,780
How ridiculous.

342
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,390
It's all because
of that little vixen.

343
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,060
That's it. Today, I'll teach her
a lesson she won't forget.

344
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,100
(Designer Kang Jae In)

345
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,670
You wench!

346
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,610
The divorce should've been the end!
How dare you mess with my Gi Chan?

347
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,310
- Let go of me!
- I will not!

348
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,350
You teamed up
with those scoundrels...

349
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,210
to extort money and run your scams,

350
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,450
and you think
you can hurt my family? You wench!

351
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,020
I'll just kill you!

352
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,290
I said, let go of me!

353
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Come here!

354
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,630
I said, let go of me!

355
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
You wench!

356
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,130
Hey! Give me my son back.

357
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,540
My son Gi Chan has changed
because of you!

358
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,800
What are you talking about?

359
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,370
Give him back!

360
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,940
- Hey, you!
- What do you think you're doing?

361
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,410
That's enough!

362
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,480
Chairman, get out of the way.

363
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,950
I'm going to beat some sense
into her today.

364
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,050
Mother!

365
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,190
- You...
- This is why...

366
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,020
I blame you for everything!

367
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,790
It's because you act like this!

368
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,230
Did a single word I said
get through to you?

369
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,230
I told you I was struggling.

370
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,130
And did you listen to a single word
I said?

371
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,270
Are you proud that vixen duped you?
How dare you yell at your mother?

372
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,300
Please, just stop!

373
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,110
Please, just stay out of it.

374
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,940
If you so much as lay a finger
on her,

375
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,280
I'll cut you out of my life
for good.

376
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,050
You...

377
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,550
I've made myself perfectly clear.

378
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,150
When I say I'll do something,
I do it.

379
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,290
You know that.

380
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,800
He's lost his mind over a woman,

381
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,940
and now he wants to disown
his own mother.

382
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,180
They say raising a son
only gets you stabbed in the back.

383
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,950
Oh, it's so unfair.
This is just heartbreaking.

384
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,650
It's so unfair.

385
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,360
Let go of me.
Are you going to let go or not?

386
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,860
I said, let go! Let go!

387
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,030
I told you to let go.

388
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,810
I'll apologize for my mother.

389
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,240
- I'm sorry.
- Don't.

390
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,110
What good is an apology
after the damage has been done?

391
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,180
Don't ever let this happen again.

392
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,720
Jae In.

393
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,050
Let go!

394
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,030
Can't I come back to you?

395
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,440
I've been thinking about
when I was the happiest.

396
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,570
It was when I was with you
and our son, Eun Ho.

397
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,650
I didn't realize that was happiness
back then.

398
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,980
It was too peaceful...

399
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,290
and too ordinary.

400
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,560
I didn't see it as true happiness.

401
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,190
I've only just realized that.

402
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
That happiness.

403
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,300
Who shattered it?

404
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,400
It was you, Hwang Gi Chan.

405
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,480
Nothing else matters to me anymore,
Jae In.

406
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,650
All I need is you.

407
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,950
If we could just go back
to the way things were,

408
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,550
I would give up everything.

409
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,750
Please give me one more chance.

410
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,190
You've got some nerve.

411
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,000
After everything you've done,

412
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
a chance?

413
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,510
All right, fine.

414
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,080
Go to the police, confess it all,
and face the consequences.

415
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,120
Asking for a second chance
without being punished...

416
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,780
just seems like a cheap trick
to avoid responsibility.

417
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
I'll do it.

418
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,360
If that's what you want,
then I have to.

419
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,270
I'll confess the crimes
I've committed so far...

420
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,670
and turn myself in.

421
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,370
Do you even realize...

422
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,140
what you're saying right now?

423
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,880
To pay for my crimes,

424
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,280
it might take several years.

425
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,380
I have no right,
but will you wait for me?

426
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,850
Then,

427
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,890
give me one more chance.

428
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,000
Talk is cheap.

429
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,530
I don't believe in empty promises.

430
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,170
I'll show you.

431
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,100
I'll prove that I mean it.

432
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,560
How many times do I have
to tell you?

433
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,360
I am not getting a divorce!

434
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,160
Then, I'm filing for divorce.

435
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,100
I've already spoken to my lawyer.

436
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,030
Honey.

437
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,930
I'm taking custody of Ji Ho.

438
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,940
If you don't want to drag this out
in a messy court battle,

439
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,840
your best option
is to take the settlement money...

440
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
and walk away.

441
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,810
You can't dump me.

442
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,440
You can never get rid of me!

443
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,280
Have you forgotten what I know?

444
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,080
If you're planning to blackmail me
over Kim Do Hee's accident...

445
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,520
The original dashcam footage.

446
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,260
I have it. Have you forgotten?

447
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,700
(Rear Camera)

448
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,240
If I hand this over to the police,

449
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,570
it's an open-and-shut case.
You're going to prison.

450
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,980
So drop the idea
of filing for divorce.

451
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
I don't care.

452
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,550
What?

453
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,790
Send that footage to Jae In,

454
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,750
or send it to the prosecution.

455
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,060
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

456
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,800
I'm going to turn myself in.

457
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,000
Are you crazy?

458
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,440
Are you out of your mind?
Why are you suddenly doing this?

459
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,340
I've said my piece.

460
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,850
You decide what to do.

461
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,190
Doctor, I'm very busy today.

462
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,390
Could you please
just write the prescription?

463
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,470
First, I need to discuss
your test results.

464
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,940
Is my stomach ulcer that bad?

465
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,870
We found a tumor in your stomach,
so we performed a biopsy.

466
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,780
And?

467
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,920
You have terminal stomach cancer.

468
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,340
(Queen's House)

469
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Are you serious?

470
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,570
Do I look like I'm kidding?

471
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,570
Let me do it again, properly.

472
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,980
Just give me some time.

473
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,250
Sure. No pressure.

474
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,880
Did you tell Hwang Gi Chan...

475
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,720
that he's not Ji Ho's biological father?

476
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,020
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

477
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,750
He is Gi Chan's son.

478
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,290
Good. Keep telling yourself that.

479
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,130
That’s what makes you, Se Ri.

480
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,860
The mailman just dropped this off.
He said it was for you, Jae In.

481
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,570
Who on earth did this?

482
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,470
Jae In, are you okay?

483
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,470
