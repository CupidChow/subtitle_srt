and backgrounds...)

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,080
(Episode 20)

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,550
Sign your name right here
as the first guardian.

6
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,560
Me?

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,020
Didn't you just hear me?

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,890
You're the only one here.
Who else could I be talking to?

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,500
Did you ask me
for the sleeping pill prescription...

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,330
to do this?

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,200
Have you been giving it to Jae In?

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,140
You said you were going to have it.

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,710
I was too scared
to live with Jae In...

14
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,440
because she had been
out of her mind.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,740
She almost set the place on fire,

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,110
ripped my clothes,

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,250
and almost killed me
with those shrimps.

18
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,020
If she doesn't get better,
we'll all end up dead.

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,890
So, print your name here
and sign it.

20
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,890
I'll do it
after she gets a proper diagnosis.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,790
We have a doctor in the family,
so why should we tell others...

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,760
and suffer from the humiliation?

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,430
Sign it.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,930
You're pretty much
on the same boat anyway.

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,800
The sleeping pills?

26
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,270
Yes, I gave those to her.

27
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,270
You gave me the prescription
to give her those pills.

28
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,280
I didn't...

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,780
There's no use in denying it.

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,580
I'll have my way
if I continue to insist on this.

31
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,050
So? What do you say?

32
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,990
Jae In was with Dr. Kim last night.

33
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,990
Was everything okay last night?

34
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:24,820
Yes.

35
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,130
His younger sister died
because of Jae In's mom,

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,300
so I thought it was odd that
they were meeting each other.

37
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,000
Tell Jae In
and ask for her forgiveness.

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,100
Everything must be tough for her.

39
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,070
She's not allowed
to suffer a little,

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,040
but it's okay for me to suffer?

41
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,810
Yu Gyeong.

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,960
(Guardian Do Yu Gyeong,
Guardian Noh Sook Ja)

43
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,960
I'll teach you
simple stretching exercises,

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,200
- so find chances to do those.
- Okay.

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,300
Straighten your back, and...

46
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,130
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,900
Hello?

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,040
You said you'd come,
but you never came by,

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,740
so I was wondering
if I should call you.

50
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,080
I still have the box here.

51
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,180
Can I stop by in the afternoon?

52
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,750
Of course. I'll see you later.

53
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,090
Right. Let me teach you
the stretching exercises.

54
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,860
Who are you?

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,030
Who are you?

56
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,140
Honey, you need to stop them. Honey!

57
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,570
I'm doing this all for you.

58
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,640
Honey.

59
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,810
Who are you?

60
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,510
Honey, please, help me!

61
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,550
Ms. Kang, please calm down.

62
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,950
You're not in a dangerous place.

63
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,250
You're at a hospital.

64
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,520
Free me.

65
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,090
Why are you doing this?

66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,660
Free me right now!

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,690
Honey, Gi Chan.

68
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,160
Please help me. Honey!

69
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,230
Calm down.
I'm doing this all for you.

70
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,930
You need to be treated.

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,210
You were hospitalized here
to receive treatments.

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,740
You're suffering...

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,610
from a serious case of delusion
along with jealousy.

74
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,750
No, I'm completely fine.

75
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,050
Nothing's wrong with me!

76
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,350
Honey, you have to tell them.

77
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,290
Honey!

78
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm completely fine!

79
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,220
Honey!

80
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,960
Don't you remember
setting our place on fire?

81
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,030
It was you.

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,070
No, I didn't do that.

83
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,700
I thought about it again and again,
but it wasn't me.

84
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,370
No, it was a mistake.

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,440
I made a mistake, honey.

86
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,750
I won't do that anymore. I mean it.

87
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,960
The first mistake you made was...

88
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,700
marrying me.

89
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,910
I'll take a long time,

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,550
but please be safe here
and get treated until you're well.

91
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,750
Goodbye.

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,820
Honey...

93
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,760
Honey. Honey!

94
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,460
Honey!

95
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,000
- Thanks for your good work.
- Of course.

96
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,640
Do not let her see
any outside visitors.

97
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,470
And she will not be discharged
until you have my permission.

98
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,740
Please do not worry.

99
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,180
She's unable to be discharged
until she's fully healed,

100
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,280
just as you wanted.

101
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,550
It's my donation.

102
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,680
I'll continue
to sponsor you regularly.

103
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,390
Thank you.

104
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,340
(Kang Jae In)

105
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,940
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

106
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,210
after the tone.

107
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,210
(YL Group Clinic, Doctor Kim Do Yun)

108
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,920
- Where's Seung Woo?
- He's eating dinner.

109
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,960
Good.

110
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,500
Hey.

111
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,900
You can sit down and eat.

112
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,970
- Have you had dinner?
- I ate.

113
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,910
It's nice to see you eat well.

114
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,210
I want to go meet Jae In tomorrow.

115
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,850
Really? Where are you two meeting?

116
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,220
We'll call each other
and figure it out tomorrow.

117
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,020
You can reach out to me
if you want to let me join you.

118
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,350
I want to see her alone.

119
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,890
We have to talk
about something, too.

120
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,460
All right. You should do that.

121
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,430
Shouldn't you return to work soon?

122
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,170
I keep thinking of Ms. Kim Do Hee
when I'm at the office.

123
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,500
Seung Woo.

124
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,940
You didn't kill her. It was Mom...

125
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,980
It was that woman.

126
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,610
She didn't cover for you.

127
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,550
She killed her and framed you.

128
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,950
But in the end,
she died because of me.

129
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,160
That's not the case.

130
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,060
She thought
your brother-in-law was...

131
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,160
having an affair with Ms. Kim,
so it was a misunderstanding.

132
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,260
Yes, so it's because of me.

133
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,430
How is that your fault?

134
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
She did that...

135
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,670
because I was around
to remind her...

136
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,470
of the betrayal she felt
from my birth mother and Dad.

137
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,970
It's my fault.

138
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,950
There's no need to go that far
just to blame yourself.

139
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,520
Ms. Kim was my immediate superior.

140
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,290
While I had a tough time
adapting to the workplace,

141
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,060
she was the first person
I was grateful for,

142
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,730
someone who taught me how to work
and that it can be rewarding.

143
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,570
That's why this is harder for me.

144
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,310
Hey, Bo Ram.

145
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,250
Can you open the door?

146
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
Bo Ram.

147
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,320
Is Bo Ram...

148
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,990
She's in the room,
but the door is locked.

149
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,360
Did something happen?

150
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,030
I called her out for dinner,
but she didn't say anything.

151
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,830
When I went to open the door,
it was already locked.

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Bo Ram, it's me, Grandma.

153
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,470
Do you feel unwell?

154
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,410
Bo Ram, Grandma is here.
Can you open the door? Please?

155
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,410
- Bring me a chopstick.
- Yes, a chopstick.

156
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,540
I'm home...

157
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,550
What's going on?

158
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,050
- I have it here.
- Yes, well... The chopstick.

159
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,790
What about the chopstick?

160
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,790
Bo Ram.

161
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,460
Why did you keep the door locked?

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,530
Why did you pack up your stuff?

163
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,600
Uncle Do Yun.

164
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,510
Yes, Bo Ram?

165
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,540
You can talk to me.

166
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,840
You talked to Mom on the phone.

167
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,150
So, you know where she is, right?

168
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,450
Yes, right. I do.

169
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,850
Why do you ask?

170
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,120
I'm going to go see her.

171
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,230
Take me to Mommy.

172
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,030
Bo Ram.

173
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,760
Mommy's busy working.

174
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,670
You already know that.

175
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,370
No, I want to go to Mommy.

176
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,940
Take me there now.

177
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,670
Bo Ram, it's too late today.

178
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,410
Let's talk again tomorrow.

179
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,680
No, I don't want to.
I want to go now.

180
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,020
I want to go to Mommy!

181
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,650
Take me to her now.

182
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,650
Right now.

183
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,990
Mommy's too far away right now.

184
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,760
You can
talk to Uncle Do Yun tomorrow.

185
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,590
Stop lying.

186
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,760
You and Grandma are all liars.

187
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,410
Uncle Do Yun, did my mommy...

188
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,040
die?

189
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,510
Goodness. What do you mean?

190
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,950
I overheard my teacher
and the director...

191
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,790
talking about her
at the kindergarten.

192
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,620
They said my mommy died.

193
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,830
Did she die?

194
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,540
Uncle Do Yun, did my mommy die?

195
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,010
Come here.

196
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,390
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you the truth.

197
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,990
Bo Ram, Mommy is...

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,360
now on the other side
with your grandpa.

199
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,930
Mommy...

200
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,240
Mommy...

201
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,500
Mommy...

202
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,840
Mommy...

203
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,410
- Mommy...
- Goodness.

204
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,780
- My pumpkin.
- Mommy...

205
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,010
Mommy...

206
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,720
- Mommy...
- Goodness.

207
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,420
Mommy...

208
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,660
Mommy...

209
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,260
- Mommy...
- My goodness.

210
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,030
Grandma, where's my mommy?

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,870
I called her,
but her phone was turned off.

212
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,180
Eun Ho, listen up.

213
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,380
Okay.

214
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,180
Your mommy is quite sick.

215
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,090
So, she got hospitalized
to get better.

216
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,950
Is she badly sick?

217
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,960
I want to go to the hospital.

218
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,390
I want to see her.

219
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,590
I want to let you do that,

220
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,500
but she told us not to come...

221
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,730
until she was fully healed.

222
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,140
You can ask your auntie
if you don't believe me.

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,140
You know that
she's Mommy's good friend, right?

224
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,510
Yes.

225
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,180
Eun Ho,
your mommy will get well soon.

226
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,750
Don't worry about her.

227
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,790
I'll tell her to call you
when her condition gets better.

228
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,820
You heard her, right?

229
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,030
Auntie Yu Gyeong will take
good care of you until Mommy comes.

230
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,730
Don't worry about her,

231
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,830
and you can ask
whatever you want to your auntie.

232
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,430
Okay.

233
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,530
I don't have an appetite.

234
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,030
I'm done.

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,100
And me.

236
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,940
Gosh. Me, too.

237
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,180
Let's eat, Eun Ho.

238
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,950
Try this.

239
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,690
Auntie Yu Gyeong,
your hand is bruised.

240
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,260
I got hurt at the hospital.

241
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,860
One moment, please.

242
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,470
May I see your hand, Auntie?

243
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,580
Let me put the ointment on you.

244
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,290
My mommy put this on me
whenever I got hurt.

245
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,920
I'm sorry, Eun Ho.

246
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,160
Is anybody there?

247
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,570
Please let me leave.

248
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,840
Please open the door!

249
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,640
Please.

250
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,480
Please let me leave.

251
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,550
Eun Ho...

252
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,560
Eun Ho...

253
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,940
Come in.

254
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,540
Jae In's phone has been off
since the morning.

255
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,910
Please have a seat.
I have something to tell you.

256
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,880
So, you got her hospitalized?

257
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,550
You saw her,
so you'd already know the situation.

258
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,460
Her condition had worsened.

259
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,060
She even tried to hurt herself,
so I couldn't sit around and watch.

260
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,930
What if she gets
the worst idea of them all?

261
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,700
I may end up losing her.

262
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,240
Her condition was that dire?

263
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,780
After what happened
to her father and mother,

264
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,010
she had a miscarriage, too.

265
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
She must've suffered
from a great shock.

266
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,120
She wanted to do this
when she was in her right mind.

267
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,050
She wanted to get hospitalized...

268
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,660
and be treated for Eun Ho's sake.

269
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,030
Seung Woo said
he was supposed to see her today.

270
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,300
I should tell him.

271
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,000
Where's the hospital?

272
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,830
Will you go and see her?

273
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,570
I should.

274
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,670
The doctor said it'd be better
if she didn't accept visitors.

275
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,610
It'll be harder to treat her
if she sees her old family...

276
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,050
because they'll bring back...

277
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,080
those painful memories.

278
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,590
I'll let you know again...

279
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,320
once she calms down and gets better.

280
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,260
All right.

281
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,430
Take good care of Jae In.

282
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,930
Of course. Don't worry about her.

283
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,750
I heard my family was visiting,
so I thought it was Jae In,

284
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,550
but it was you?

285
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,350
Yes.

286
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,650
My family?

287
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,820
- Please have a seat.
- You don't even know your place.

288
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,530
I have no intention
to sit alone and talk with you.

289
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,200
Goodbye.

290
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,930
Mom.

291
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,300
Don't you understand?

292
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,470
How dare you call me your mom?

293
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,070
Don't ever come here again.

294
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,170
I've never had a son.

295
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,980
And this is my warning.

296
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,310
Get out of my house and YL Group...

297
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,210
before you're kicked out
in humiliation.

298
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,080
I don't want to.

299
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,190
I won't.

300
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,120
Dad was still my dad.

301
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,960
So, I am entitled
to that house and YL Group.

302
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,730
I'll take those as his son.

303
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,770
You're finally showing
your true colors.

304
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,970
This is why people say
everything runs in the blood.

305
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,210
I can't even imagine
how disgusting your blood must be.

306
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,280
You're filthy.

307
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,480
Let me tell you once again.
Leave quietly before you get hurt.

308
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,580
This life isn't yours,

309
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,320
so learn your place.

310
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,190
Just wait.

311
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,390
I'll make sure I take YL Group.

312
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,290
Have fun watching me
behind the bars.

313
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,640
You called saying
you had something to say, so talk.

314
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,670
What do you want?

315
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,010
I felt responsible
as a member of the owner's family,

316
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,780
so I wanted to step up
and resolve this matter.

317
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,450
Resolve?

318
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,280
Resolve this matter?

319
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,550
Then, bring back Kim Do Hee,
my niece.

320
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,320
Don't ask me
for something impossible.

321
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,790
I want to do my best
within the realm of possibility.

322
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,060
I mean it.

323
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,410
It's a token of my apology.

324
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,780
If it's not enough,
feel free to let me know.

325
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,110
I'll give you as much as you want.

326
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,430
You're still the same.

327
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,230
You still have
that materialistic attitude,

328
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,530
thinking money is
the answer to everything.

329
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,170
Don't you people have
any sense of morality?

330
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,640
As I said,
it was a token of our apology.

331
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,470
Realistically speaking,

332
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,580
monetary compensation is
the best we can do for you.

333
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,180
Don't you think
it's your sense of inferiority...

334
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,380
that makes you take this
the wrong way?

335
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,750
Everything is still the same
as how it was in the past.

336
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,450
Your family is something.

337
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,460
I never wanted to bargain
for the price of my niece's life,

338
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
and I do not want to resolve this
in this kind of manner.

339
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,230
You didn't just kill my niece.

340
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,800
You've destroyed my family.

341
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,030
My sister lost
her precious daughter.

342
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,500
My niece's
seven-year-old daughter...

343
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,640
does not have a father,
so her mother was everything to her.

344
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,740
But she lost that.

345
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,840
Have you ever heard
a child crying herself to sleep,

346
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,080
missing her mother every night?

347
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,410
That is...

348
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,320
what you people have done to us.

349
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,520
If that wasn't enough,

350
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,490
you insisted that my family killed
your brother.

351
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,130
If that's how you play the media,

352
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,730
how can I expect you to show me
even a hint of sincerity?

353
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,300
You people were
just like this in the past,

354
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,500
and you're still the same.

355
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,040
You must think...

356
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,940
people like us decline this offer
because of our pride,

357
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,880
but it's just that. We decline.

358
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,850
What can we do to resolve this?

359
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,180
It's too late.

360
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,950
We don't need your apology or money,

361
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,820
so don't ever reach out again.

362
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,540
Goodness, Father.

363
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,470
Why were you in there?

364
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,440
Does your family run
the pig's feet place?

365
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,210
Yes, why are you...

366
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,850
I know. Did you come to eat?

367
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,380
Are you running
this fried chicken place?

368
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,490
Yu Gyeong didn't say anything.

369
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,250
Don't tell her anything.

370
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Sorry?

371
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,120
I'm a part-timer here.

372
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,860
What? Why would you...

373
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,700
Anyway, you.

374
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,030
No.

375
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,870
If I ask him
about the kidnapping incident,

376
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,770
he'll run over
to Gi Chan and talk to him.

377
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,970
I don't need to blow this up
and make it worse for Yu Gyeong.

378
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,880
I'll just forget it.

379
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,180
Bo Ram, I made
all kinds of dishes you like.

380
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,280
Let's eat.

381
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,720
You haven't eaten anything all day.

382
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,130
I'm home.

383
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,700
Bo Ram, Uncle Do Yun is here.

384
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,440
Hey, Bo Ram.

385
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,280
Do you want to go see Mommy?

386
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,220
You're a liar.

387
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,060
I didn't lie.

388
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,700
Bo Ram, Mommy is...

389
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,400
on the other side,
still looking over you.

390
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,900
When people leave this world
with their beloved behind,

391
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,970
they become stars.

392
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,680
They keep looking over you
and protect you from the sky.

393
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,180
Did my mommy
become a star in the sky, too?

394
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,360
Which one is Mommy's star?

395
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,030
Look over there.
It's the brightest star.

396
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,500
Do you see that?

397
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,500
Yes.

398
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,200
Is that Mommy's star?

399
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,140
Yes, that's it.

400
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,440
Mommy's the brightest star.

401
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,280
Bo Ram, when you miss her,

402
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,850
find that brightest star.

403
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,680
That star shines brightly...

404
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,220
because she wants to tell you
that she loves you a lot...

405
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,620
and that she's watching over you,

406
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,820
but she's too far away right now.

407
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,060
That's why she's shining brightly.

408
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,330
Can you see us, Do Hee?

409
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,900
Bo Ram said she missed you,
so we came to see you!

410
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,910
She's doing well,

411
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,470
so don't worry about her!

412
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,180
Bo Ram,
do you want to say hi to her?

413
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,150
Mommy.

414
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,450
Mommy!

415
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,920
I'm here!

416
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,560
I love you, Mommy!

Hey, Dr. Do. It's me.

422
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,290
I had a question.

423
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,700
Ms. Kang's phone was turned off.

424
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,130
What's going on?

425
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,040
No, it's nothing important.

426
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
She said she'd stop by last time,
but she didn't come.

427
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,970
As you know, she went through a lot.

428
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,280
I thought she'd stay strong,

429
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,910
but she couldn't,
so she's recuperating.

430
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,080
That's probably why
her phone is off.

431
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,180
How unwell is she?

432
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,080
That's her privacy,
so I can't share that.

433
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,120
All right, then.
I'll call you later.

The first mistake you made was...

441
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,490
marrying me.

443
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,810

You'll experience misfortune...

453
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,560
what does this mean?

454
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,630
Was she sacrificed
because of those two?

455
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,470
What am I thinking?

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,370

For Choi Ja Young to find out
what true despair is like,

458

516
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,820
Hi.

517
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,690
I can't thank Director Hwang enough.

518
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,030
I was already grateful
for his donations,

519
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,870
but he even designated us
as YL's affiliated hospital.

520
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,340
He's only returning
whatever you're giving,

521
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,740
so there's no pressure.

522
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,470
As you heard, I'll check and see
if Haesung Psychiatric Hospital...

523
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,170
is worthy of becoming...

524
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,380
a designated hospital for YL Group
as the doctor in charge,

525
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,710
- but it's just the process.
- Yes.

526
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:52,220
You don't have to reach out
to Director Hwang.

527
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,450
We may end up facing trouble...

528
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,790
if anyone challenges this
for unfairness. You know, right?

529
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,050
Yes, of course.

542
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,920
Can you run?

543
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,900
(Queen's House)

544
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,070
It's you again?

545
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,110
You aren't even my family.

546
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,240
Stop making a fool out of me...

547
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,880
by claiming to my family
when you aren't.

548
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,410
What do you mean she's gone?

549
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,280
Jae In received
a medical diagnosis at a hospital.

550
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,590
If she found out she was sane,
she wouldn't stay quiet.

551
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,950
What do we do?

552
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,420
Why do you do this to me?

553
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,720
Why did you make me look crazy?

554
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,460
Eun Ho, it's me, Mommy.

555
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,460
Who are you?

556
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,500
And why are you in this room?

557
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,270
Who are you, lady?
