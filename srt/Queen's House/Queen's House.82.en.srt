1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,910
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,650
I called
an emergency meeting today...

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,980
for this reason.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,450
I propose opening
an extraordinary general meeting...

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,960
to put forth
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's dismissal.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,230
YL Group has given him
many chances to this day.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,900
I decided there was no more reason
for us to tolerate his scandals.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,970
How many times has he fallen
into controversies...

11
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,510
relative to his private life?

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,470
The situation doesn't change
even if we disregard his personal life.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,210
All he wanted to do was cover up...

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,980
the suspicions
surrounding the Louis B project.

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,550
He failed to clarify
the allegations he faced.

16
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,880
(Director Shin Yong,
Director Kim Byeong Cheol)

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,990
He should've played a role
in the growth of our business,

18
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,420
but instead, he ruined our image...

19
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,090
and plummeted our stock price.

20
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,830
Why do we need him as a chairman?

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,100
If you agree to opening
an extraordinary general meeting...

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,200
to dismiss Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

23
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,100
please raise your hand.

24
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,880
(CEO Jung Oh Seong,
Director Kim Do Yun)

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,050
(Director Shin Yong,
Director Kim Byeong Cheol)

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,030
That's the result.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,360
We will inform you
as soon as we schedule...

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,430
the extraordinary general meeting.

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,080
- Let's go.
- Okay.

30
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,630
I can't have you
behaving like this, Director Kang.

31
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,960
Did you suddenly decide to find
your missing family?

32
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,570
Is that why you're siding with Jae In
to drag me down?

33
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,600
Don't be delusional.

34
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,570
I was never on your side.

35
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,340
It was one of the decisions
I made for YL Group.

36
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,810
If I had known you'd
rot the business from the inside,

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,250
you wouldn't have been
one of my choices from the start.

38
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,690
I suddenly...

39
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,860
had this thought.

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,930
Where would you have been by now...

41
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,370
if you hadn't betrayed me?

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,070
You would've played...

43
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,740
a significant role in this business.

44
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,580
My dad thought highly of you,

45
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,250
and he never overlooked
the achievements you've made.

46
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,990
You have the tendency...

47
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,660
to sabotage your own luck,

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,460
including how you picked up Se Ri...

49
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,030
after abandoning me.

50
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,390
Seung Woo.

51
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,130
What do you think you're doing?

52
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,230
We found more evidence
that points to Mr. Kang Seung Woo...

53
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,530
as the hit-and-run driver
behind Kim Do Hee's death.

54
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,330
That's impossible.

55
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,970
What's the evidence?

56
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,470
Tell me what evidence you have
that points to Seung Woo. Now.

57
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,010
We're still investigating,

58
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,340
and the process is confidential,
so I can't disclose that.

59
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,880
We're here to arrest him legally
after obtaining a warrant.

60
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,850
Move aside.

61
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,690
Or you two may also get arrested
for interfering with police officers.

62
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,790
Don't worry, Jae In.

63
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,830
Please don't worry.

64
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,860
All right.
Don't be scared, Seung Woo.

65
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,300
You aren't at fault.

66
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,600
Okay.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,270
I'll send an attorney,

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
so stay silent until then.

69
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,900
Okay.

70
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,710
I'll be back.

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,340
Let's go.

72
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,790
Don't worry, Aunt Mi Ran.

73
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,630
I don't know what the evidence is,

74
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,660
but I know for sure
that it wasn't Seung Woo.

75
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,730
What's going on?
Why did Seung Woo get arrested?

76
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,970
They found evidence...

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,540
that he could be the culprit
behind Ms. Kim Do Hee's death.

78
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,680
What? What is this nonsense?

79
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,950
We know who killed Do Hee!

80
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,980
The one who did that to Do Hee is...

81
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,280
still roaming about
here at YL Group!

82
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,890
You know that, too.

83
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,460
I do. Calm down.

84
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,020
How am I going to calm down?
He's my son!

85
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,900
Who's the detective
that arrested Mr. Kang?

86
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,930
What's his name?

87
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,700
He was the detective in charge
of Do Hee's case.

88
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,400
The one who seemed
to be working for Hwang Gi Chan?

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,340
Yes, he's Detective Baek Mun Su,
who freed Hong Man Su...

90
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,840
at the time
of Eun Ho's hit-and-run accident.

91
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,110
It was him.

92
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,980
I think Gi Chan made a move first,

93
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,820
expecting you
to propose his dismissal.

94
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,590
That was why the directors
who sided with him...

95
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,520
didn't even budge
during the meeting today.

96
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,760
He outsmarted me.

97
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,260
- Call Attorney Kim.
- Okay.

98
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,470
Hey, it's me.

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,630
Something urgent came up,
so I had to call you.

100
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,510
A detective named Baek Mun Su,
who was in charge of Do Hee's case,

101
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,680
came by and took an innocent man
as the culprit. What should I do?

102
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,150
He said he found some evidence,

103
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,210
but that man cannot be the culprit.

104
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,650
His name? Kang Seung Woo.

105
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,450
Please don't let them
do anything weird to him...

106
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,790
until his attorney arrives.

107
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,560
Yes, he's my son.

108
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,230
Yes, please do that.

109
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,430
All right.

110
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,030
Attorney Kim is going straight
to the police station, too.

111
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,940
I can't stand this. I need to see...

112
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,370
Hwang Gi Chan.

113
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,670
I'm going first.

114
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,680
Don't follow me.

115
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,380
Yes, things will go smoothly,
thanks to you, Prosecutor Byun.

116
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,450
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

117
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,390
I'll set up a meeting with you
and the chief prosecutor.

118
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,690
He'll be
the prosecutor general soon,

119
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,530
and you need your promotion, too.

120
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,830
Personnel changes are
coming up soon, right?

121
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,670
You can't do this!
He told me not to let anyone in!

122
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,970
All right. Let's stay in touch.

123
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,970
What have you done to Seung Woo?

124
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,440
He's not the one
who should be getting arrested,

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,850
but it's you!

126
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,050
Mr. Kang got arrested
by the police? Why?

127
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,350
Leave the room, Na Ra.

128
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,790
Gi Chan!

129
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,050
Leave the room!

130
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,320
Dang it.

131
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,960
You must've been...

132
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,400
worried sick about him
if you ran over so quickly.

133
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,400
Right. Is it because your son,
the one you gave birth to?

134
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,080
Seung Woo isn't the culprit
who did that...

135
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,780
to Ms. Kim Do Hee.

136
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,110
You probably know that
better than anybody else.

137
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,320
Director Kang,
don't be such an amateur.

138
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,050
You know how things work.

139
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,330
This isn't about whether
he really is the culprit or not.

140
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,630
The real culprit...

141
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,160
may or may not become
Kang Seung Woo,

142
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,030
depending on what you do.

143
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,640
Why do you think
I let Choi Ja Young get tried...

144
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,170
without detention?

145
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,880
It was all to prepare
for a situation like this.

146
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,180
What do you want?

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,620
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

148
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,420
You aren't looking
to free your son...

149
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,060
just by dropping your proposal
for my dismissal, are you?

150
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,860
Do you remember
the notarized document...

151
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,960
that says Kang Seung Woo
shall be the chairman...

152
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,030
at the time you want in exchange
for making me the chairman?

153
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,130
Destroy that.

154
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,610
Ms. Choi. I got the groceries.

155
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,450
Would you like to eat lunch now?

156
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,220
Ms. Choi?

157
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,260
I'll open the door.

158
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,760
She's not here.

159
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,440
She left her phone here.
Where did she go?

160
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,880
He wants to drop his dismissal
and destroy the notarized document?

161
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,020
He must've been ready.

162
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,220
He wanted to remove
anything that would restrain him...

163
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,760
with this chance.

164
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,660
It's the price I'm paying
for ignoring you and siding with him.

165
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,360
I used the guilt I felt
for Seung Woo as an excuse...

166
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,270
to fall into self-pity,
and Seung Woo ended up...

167
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,030
paying the price.

168
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,340
I feel uneasy
to see him in so confident.

169
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,770
This is his way of announcing...

170
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,010
he'll freely tamper with the case
and make him the culprit.

171
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,080
It's because he knows
he has something to fall back on.

172
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,620
Most key posts in the prosecution
are held by those on his side.

173
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,550
The chief prosecutor who's likely
to be the next prosecutor general...

174
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,520
was Hwang Gi Chan's superior
while he worked as a prosecutor.

175
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,430
They've been meeting more often
after he became the chairman,

176
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,970
so they must be exchanging
whatever they need.

177
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,600
Aunt Mi Ran.

178
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,900
Give him what he wants.

179
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,680
I can always destroy the document
that'll make Seung Woo the chairman.

180
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,610
But Jae In.

181
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,610
I can't drop his dismissal.

182
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,580
This time, he must've noticed
that you and I are working together.

183
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,150
We don't know what he'll do...

184
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,320
if we let him go right now.

185
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,590
I have him
in the palm of my hand, anyway.

186
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,100
I have many other ways
to drag him down.

187
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,230
So, for now, our priority is
getting Seung Woo out of this...

188
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,470
to prevent Gi Chan from hurting him.

189
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,580
Ms. Choi?

190
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,310
No, she's not here.

191
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,650
While you were gone
to get groceries out front?

192
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,520
Have you called her?

193
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,390
All right.

194
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,460
She might be on her way here,

195
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,030
so I'll go outside and look. Bye.

196
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,630
I wanted to grab
a cup of coffee with you.

197
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,800
Are you looking for someone?

198
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,900
Jae In's mom.

199
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,270
She disappeared
while he went to the supermarket,

200
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,110
and she left her phone at home.

201
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,170
He searched through our place,

202
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,140
but she wasn't there, so I wanted
to search near the shopping arcade.

203
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,080
She might be at the supermarket
where I once saw her.

204
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,650
I'll look for her, too.

205
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,180
Thank you.

206
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,920
All right.

207
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,300
I knew you'd make a quick decision.

208
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,030
I confirmed that you called
the directors to drop my dismissal.

209
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,800
And the other term?

210
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,650
We're good now.

211
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,750
I need you to free Seung Woo.

212
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,060
I'll only be assured
after seeing him with my own eyes.

213
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,670
Hey, it's me.

214
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,100
Free Kang Seung Woo
before the day is over.

215
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,010
Okay. Let's meet up soon.

216
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,580
Are we good now?

217
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,010
That was
the end of our deal, correct?

218
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,830
What do you think you're doing?

219
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,790
You messed with the wrong guy.

220
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,100
Kang Seung Woo is my son,
and not just Director Kang's son.

221
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,870
I won't let this incident go,

222
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,240
so keep that in mind.

223
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,310
Get up.

224
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,650
If I stay here any longer,
I'll end up beating him to a pulp.

225
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,790
Patrick Jung was
Kang Seung Woo's biological father?

226
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,670
I must drive out DH Holdings
as soon as possible.

227
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,470
Secretary Yoon.

228
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,480
How much have you found out
about DH Holdings' investments?

229
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,950
Have you found anything?

230
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,950
I'm still investigating.
Please give me a little more time.

231
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,820
How much more time do you need?

232
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,150
Find out everything right now!

233
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,730
Why did you step in?

234
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,130
Nothing good will happen
if Hwang Gi Chan finds out.

235
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,840
No.

236
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,970
Someone like him, who grovels
before the strong and abuses the weak,

237
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,310
needs to know who's superior to him.

238
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,680
He needs to know
who exactly he's dealing with...

239
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,280
to stop him from messing with us.

240
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,590
I'll go and see Seung Woo.

241
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,250
I'll go.

242
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,260
You?

243
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,460
I asked a detective I know
for a favor,

244
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,360
and one of our attorneys is there.

245
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,660
So, I thought I should check
to make sure of everything.

246
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,830
Or we can go together.

247
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,000
No, you should go.

248
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,810
Okay.

249
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,380
How did it go?

250
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,850
I saw him calling
the prosecutor in charge.

251
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,980
He'll be freed soon.

252
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,890
That jerk.

253
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,990
He's sailing smoothly
through everything.

254
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,460
He must've expected you to do this.

255
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,060
You should pick him up.

256
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,760
Mr. Jung went.

257
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,500
Oh Seong...

258
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,140
CEO Jung and I once dated.

259
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,340
I thought that'd be the case
when he said he was Seung Woo's dad.

260
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,380
Was Grandpa against you two?

261
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,480
No one could convince him...

262
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,550
once he made up his mind.

263
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,690
I found out I was pregnant
with Seung Woo after we broke up.

264
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,360
I was told to abort my pregnancy,

265
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,330
but I was also quite stubborn.

266
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,430
It runs in the Kang family.

267
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,140
I could only give birth to him...

268
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,980
if I agreed to let Gyu Cheol
adopt him as his son.

269
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,880
Otherwise,

270
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,110
he might have given Seung Woo up
for adoption without telling me.

271
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,150
Back then,

272
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,450
it was the best
I could do for Seung Woo,

273
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,660
and I couldn't afford
to think about anything else.

274
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,230
I didn't know I had become
such a sinner to your parents...

275
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,070
and only focused
on blaming your grandfather.

276
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,740
I can understand that
it was a tough decision to make.

277
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,710
Things wouldn't have
spiraled like this...

278
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,580
if my dad
had told the truth to my mom.

279
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,610
I thought that was
one thing that could've gone better.

280
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,950
But my dad must've thought...

281
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,850
it was the best for everyone.

282
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,890
No one thought this through.

283
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,090
I had no idea
Ja Young lived in such pain.

284
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,660
I looked into it, and stress was
a key factor that causes dementia.

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,100
I'm the sinner...

286
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,670
to Ja Young and you.

287
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,840
I'm so sorry.

288
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,150
I feel the same way about my mom.

289
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,350
Thank you for helping me
save Seung Woo today.

290
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,560
I'll repay you
for the rest of my life.

291
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,460
Aunt Mi Ran.

292
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,060
Seung Woo is important to me, too.

293
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,860
He's a dear brother to me.

294
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,000
I know now...

295
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,040
how tough your journey
must've been...

296
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,840
with that soft heart of yours.

297
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,940
Jae In, from now on,

298
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,250
I'll protect you.

299
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,180
Just trust me and only march ahead.

300
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,620
I'll do all kinds
of dirty and disgusting things...

301
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,320
and gladly get blood on my hands...

302
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,460
from this day on.

303
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,660
Aunt Mi Ran.

304
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,330
Don't do things like that
for the sake of YL Group.

305
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,830
I'm here for that.

306
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,040
Do you understand?

307
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,570
One moment, please.

308
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,840
Hey, Yu Gyeong.

309
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,310
My mom's gone?

310
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,720
When did she disappear?

311
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,750
Okay.

312
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,660
Hey, Jae In. Your mother is gone.
Have you heard?

313
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,100
Yu Gyeong called me just now.

314
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,660
Is there any place
you think she might be?

315
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,940
Yes, think about it.

316
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,410
Se Ri?

317
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,180
It might be Se Ri again.

318
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,140
You said
she took a leave today, right?

319
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,180
Yes, what do you mean again?

320
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,450
She once tried to abduct her.

321
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,980
What?

322
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,600
Stand guard outside.

323
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,130
Yes, ma'am.

324
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,040
If you want to save your life
and meet your daughter again,

325
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,980
answer my question.

326
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,950
You. Who are you?

327
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,150
That's none of your business.

328
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,620
Where's the slush fund
your husband made,

329
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,120
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol's
slush fund?

330
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,990
Slush fund?

331
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,220
I never knew he kept one.

332
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,160
How would I know where it is?

333
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,460
Let go of me now! Let go of me!

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,740
Then, you can stay here
until you remember.

335
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,580
I know this voice.

336
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,380
Kang Se Ri? It's you, isn't it?

337
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,150
You're too loud.

338
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I don't know who that is.

339
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,220
Anyway, I won't starve you,
so just behave.

340
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,660
And ask for me
if you remember anything...

341
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,260
about his slush fund.

342
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,370
Where are you going? Let go of me!

343
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,230
Where are you going?

344
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,540
Let go of me!

345
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,710
Let go! Let go of me!

346
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,010
This is why we say the police are
here to protect and serve.

347
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,210
Investigation should be
your priority.

348
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,240
Call me when you're free. Goodbye.

349
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,110
(Respectful and Considerate)

350
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,980
- You're here.
- Yes. Thanks for your good work.

351
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,180
- You may go.
- Goodbye.

352
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,090
Why are you here, Patrick?

353
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,620
Right. Did my aunt ask you to come?

354
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,090
Yes, and have this.

355
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,830
- What's this?
- Tofu.

356
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,870
I just got questioned.
I wasn't locked up.

357
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,600
Have some.

358
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,870
I'm not a kid,

359
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,540
and it's not like you're my dad.

360
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,180
Yes, Do Yun. What?

361
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,450
She went missing?

362
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,420
Yes, okay.

363
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,560
You had a rough day,
so you should go home and rest.

364
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,890
I have to do something.

365
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,570
What was that?
That was kind of cool.

366
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,810
It's you, the pretty lady.

367
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,580
Where's Se Ri? Kang Se Ri!

368
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,420
Why am I hearing
this dreadful voice again?

369
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,750
What is this? Why are you here?

370
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,950
How dare you come here?

371
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,190
Where's Se Ri?

372
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,820
Kang Se Ri! Come out now!

373
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,320
Why did you suddenly storm in here
just to look for her?

374
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,560
She's not around.

375
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,400
And how brazen are you?

376
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,930
You should be ashamed
for lying about your amnesia.

377
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,730
Where did you get the idea
to show yourself here again?

378
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,970
What's going on?

379
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,410
Why are you here?

380
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,210
Where's Se Ri?

381
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,810
Are you two working together?

382
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,080
What are you talking about?
Say it so that I can understand.

383
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,920
My mom's gone,

384
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,250
and she once tried
to abduct her and failed.

385
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,190
You really don't know?

386
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,560
I don't.

387
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,030
What would I get
from abducting your sick mother?

388
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,000
That woman is sick?

389
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,330
How is she unwell?

390
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,770
Well, I don't care.
I'm good as long as she's unwell.

391
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,540
That serves her right.
This is great news!

392
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,280
It better not be you.

393
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,680
I won't let this go.

394
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,080
Look at that girl.

395
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,990
You should report her
for barging in here without permission.

396
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,120
It's called trespassing or whatever.

397
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,590
She didn't barge in
without permission.

398
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,260
I opened the door for her.

399
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,370
There are idiots everywhere.
Goodness.

400
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,610
Has my mom reached out?

401
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,410
Not yet.

402
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,840
I must've been too relaxed
because I went somewhere nearby.

403
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,680
It wasn't your fault.

404
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,320
I must've paid more attention
as her daughter. I was careless.

405
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,890
I reported this to the police,

406
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,450
so they'll find out something.

407
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,260
Does Seung Woo know?

408
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,460
Not yet. I wasn't in my right mind,

409
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,230
and I thought he'd be shocked, too.

410
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,870
I'll go out and look around
the neighborhood again.

411
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,570
Okay. I'll go with you.

412
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,410
Have you been waiting for me?

413
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,610
I heard you weren't at work today.

414
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,720
Where have you been until this late?

415
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,580
I went out to get some air.

416
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,720
You know
how I've been feeling lately.

417
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,160
Did you abduct Jae In's mom?

418
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,790
No. Who told you
that kind of nonsense?

419
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,360
You tried to do that once before.

420
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,000
Was it Jae In?

421
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,770
She's lying.

422
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,770
Stop falling for her lies.

423
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,410
Think about it.

424
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,170
How am I going to abduct her alone?

425
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,510
So, it wasn't you?

426
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,780
No. I'm exhausted.

427
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,080
I need to get some rest.

428
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,340
Hello, Detective Baek. It's me.

429
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,140
I need you to find
one more person for me.

430
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,410
It's Director Choi Ja Young.

431
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,510
I heard she got abducted.

432
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,150
Why don't you tail...

433
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,450
Kang Se Ri and Hong Man Su
while you're at it?

434
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,660
What happened to Mr. Kang?

435
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,170
Wang Sik stopped everyone...

436
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,770
from doing him any harm
until our attorney got there.

437
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,570
I came home after seeing him
leave the police station.

438
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,540
Anyway, I'm worried
about Ms. Kang's mother.

439
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,010
If what Jae In said was true,

440
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,550
it's most likely that
Kang Se Ri abducted her.

441
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,880
We'll consider all possibilities
and look for her.

442
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,450
What is it?

443
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,620
It's Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

444
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,460
Is he really?

445
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,160
He turned out to be my son.

446
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,460
I found out only recently.

447
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,470
That's the funny thing
with instincts.

448
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,870
Once I found out he was my son,

449
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,840
many things inside me
began to come before reason.

450
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,170
Does Mr. Kang know?

451
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,780
He just found out
who his birth mother was.

452
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,910
Well, forget that.
I don't even know what to do,

453
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,810
so I asked her
to keep it a secret for a while.

454
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,250
Don't you think you should tell Mom?

455
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,220
I also don't like
keeping secrets from her.

456
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,430
I'll tell her
as soon as I figure this out.

457
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,390
But for now,
let's patch up this mess.

458
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,900
Okay.

459
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,270
Mr. Kang.

460
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,010
What are you doing?

461
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,480
Are you all right?

462
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,080
I heard you were taken
to the police station yesterday.

463
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,480
Have you been freed?

464
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,250
That's why I'm at work.

465
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,890
I brought soft tofu, soymilk,

466
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,560
soybean soup, and tofu chips.

467
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,430
And there are more.

468
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,900
These are yours.

469
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,370
I hear you have to eat these
after going somewhere like that.

470
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,270
You can have them all.

471
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,710
I don't need
this many soybean products.

472
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,950
Well, hey.
About my brother, the chairman.

473
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,950
He wasn't why
you were arrested, was he?

474
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,990
I heard Director Kang blaming him.

475
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,890
No, right?

476
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,560
Well, the hit-and-run accident was
caused by my ex-brother-in-law,

477
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,460
and I can't deny that
he was behind...

478
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,230
my sudden arrest yesterday.

479
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,970
Gosh.

480
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,340
This is why you can't like me. Okay?

481
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,810
Gi Chan always ruins my dating life.

482
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,460
You were released quickly.

483
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,090
Tell me about it.

484
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,990
The fraud they should be arresting
is sitting here right now.

485
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,360
They missed the target.

486
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,840
I told you to take the day off.

487
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,870
I'm fine. Where's Jae In?

488
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,880
Is she working outside?

489
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,750
It's probably better
if Seung Woo doesn't know.

490
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,080
He doesn't know
about her condition, either.

491
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,250
She took a leave today.

492
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,750
She wants to get some rest,
so don't bother calling her.

493
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,090
Okay.

494
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,090
Things were hectic,
so I couldn't ask yesterday.

495
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,190
But how was I suddenly freed?

496
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,160
Jae In made a deal...

497
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,100
and called off
Chairman Hwang's dismissal.

498
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,870
You should've stopped her
regardless of me!

499
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,410
This means I dragged her down again!

500
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,080
Don't lose heart, Seung Woo.

501
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,080
This time, I won't let Hwang Gi Chan
get away with this.

502
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,880
I'll do whatever I can...

503
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,550
to drag him down...

504
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,220
and make him kneel before Jae In.

505
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,760
Do you mean that?

506
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,460
Of course, I should do that.

507
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,430
And I need your help.

508
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,600
We're family,
so of course, I'll help.

509
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,300
We are...

510
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,740
family.

511
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,240
Yes.

512
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,810
Gi Chan!

513
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,150
I told you not to call me that
when we're at work.

514
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,880
Anyway, I was going to stay quiet,
but what is wrong with you?

515
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,650
Why do you keep messing
with the men I like?

516
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,120
I don't want to be Juliet
of "Romeo and Juliet."

517
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,920
I'm not going to take poison,

518
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,360
because I'd rather
cut ties with you!

519
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,260
Don't ever mess with Mr. Kang again.

520
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,800
This is my warning.

521
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,700
First, Kim Do Yun,
and now, Kang Seung Woo?

522
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,240
Does he like you?

523
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,510
No, but I like him.

524
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,910
So what?

525
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,080
I have a meeting outside,
so I'm leaving.

526
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,480
Stay in the office.

527
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,920
Hey, didn't you hear
what I just said?

528
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,590
Stop harassing Seung Woo!

529
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,020
Stop messing with him!

530
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,020
Dang it!

531
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,460
Jeez.
I want to ask him out properly.

532
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,400
How can I make him happy?

533
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,900
I have to put out candles
on his way in...

534
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,710
and sit in a heart made of candles
to make it look pretty.

535
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,010
But I'm too scared
to work with fire.

536
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,580
Should I see a psychiatrist?

537
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,190
I'm done with urgent business,
so I'll go and see Jae In.

538
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,860
I should help her find her mother.

539
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,160
Okay. You should go.

540
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,130
Hello.

541
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,040
Dr. Kim,
you're still a doctor, right?

542
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,310
I have something important
to consult with you about.

543
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,240
I don't have much time,
so let's do it later.

544
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,010
Give me just 10, no, 5 minutes.

545
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,580
Please?

546
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,650
Have a seat.
You only get five minutes.

547
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,030
Whoa. Can you see me?

548
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,330
I'm invisible right now.

549
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,030
Just pretend like I'm not here.

550
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,630
I'm too busy working
to hear anything.

551
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,770
I have this trauma.

552
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,810
When I was about 4 or 5 years old,
I tipped a stove over...

553
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,380
and set my home on fire.

554
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,880
I see. It must've been shocking.

555
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,420
Yes, very much.

556
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,820
I remember crying loudly in fright.

557
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,460
The fire blazed like it was dancing,

558
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,260
and it burnt down my home.

559
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,170
Was anybody hurt?

560
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,740
Thankfully, no.

561
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,200
My family and the landlord's family
all survived.

562
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,940
Thankfully, no one was home.

563
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,850
I think I remember
the male landlord always lying around,

564
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,250
but my mom said everyone was fine,
so he should be okay.

565
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,890
Is it because Ms. Noh is
now across the hall from me?

566
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,700
I casually think of our days
in that poor neighborhood.

567
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,860
I always regret leaving that man...

568
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,830
who couldn't move around
alone at home.

569
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,000
That wouldn't have happened
if I had stayed with him that day.

570
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,810
I left the fire on low heat
to make some herbal tonic.

571
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,980
Why did that stove
have to fall over?

572
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:46,200
(Queen's House)

573
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,560
Eat this unless you want to die.

574
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,700
Don't you want to see Kang Jae In?

575
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,300
Did you get Mr. Hong
to abduct Choi Ja Young?

576
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,810
What would I get from doing that?

577
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,340
How can I hold myself back?

578
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,610
How is holding back
going to do anything? How?

579
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,780
Mom, that family won't change...

580
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,250
just because you run over
and say something to them.

581
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,450
Have you really broken up
with Director Kang Mi Ran?

582
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,220
Yes, I realized how I truly felt...

583
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,860
after dating another woman.

584
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,000
I finally found out
who my true love is.

585
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,860
Oh, my.

586
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,830
