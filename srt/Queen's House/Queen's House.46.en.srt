1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,080
A witness to the accident?

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,350
Yes, all right.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Something urgent just came up,
so I must be excused right now.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,460
- You should go.
- Yes.

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,660
A witness?

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,460
Does this mean someone saw
Kim Do Hee's accident?

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,200
Gi Chan looked shaken up
when he heard about the witness.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,000
What does he know?

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,440
He's usually such a calm person.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,740
I wonder what's going on.

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,340
It's probably
about his younger sister...

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,550
Let's call it a day.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,610
Director Kang,
I'll let you decide what to do...

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,750
regarding Ms. Kang's design leak.

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,720
You two may leave.

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,450
Sure. I understand.

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,590
Did you really quit your job,
Manager Jung Hyeon Su?

21
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,930
I resigned yesterday as soon as
you sent the rest of the amount.

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,570
Also, don't forget about
the non-disclosure agreement...

23
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,840
and how you promised
never to return to Korea again.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't worry.

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,910
Thanks to you,
I got to join my family abroad.

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,680
Your business may contact you
to hold you responsible,

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,750
so get a new phone
as soon as you arrive.

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,830
First of all, I apologize
on behalf of the business...

29
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,760
regarding this misunderstanding.

30
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,530
There was hard evidence
I could see with my eyes,

31
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,470
so I didn't have
another choice back then.

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,370
I still think
you should've checked for facts...

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,270
with the competitor,
business-to-business.

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,080
You didn't even doubt
that I did something like that.

35
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,310
You rebuked me without reserve...

36
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,850
and only demanded
I take responsibility.

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,650
That's why
I'm apologizing right now.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,320
The truth is out now.
Is there any value...

39
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,720
in your apology at this point?

40
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,620
Find out
who really leaked my design...

41
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,260
and punish them.

42
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,460
I'm getting ready
to make a claim for damages...

43
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,200
and hold the competitor responsible.

44
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,100
Then, they'll begin to investigate
the man named Manager Jung Hyeon Su,

45
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,670
so they'll find something.

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,270
Didn't you fire me right away?

47
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,010
But now, you want to play down
the entire incident...

48
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,940
and maybe even cover it up?

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,810
An internal investigation...

50
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,680
will only kill our staff's spirits
and cause unnecessary trouble.

51
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,150
We don't need to get our hands dirty,
so let's give it time.

52
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,460
Here's the file
you wanted yesterday.

53
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,890
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop,

54
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,460
but it seemed like Ms. Kang
wasn't responsible for the design leak.

55
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,730
No, there was a misunderstanding.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,740
Oh, my. Then, who would do
something like that?

57
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,840
Who would do...

58
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,510
something as dirty as that?

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,540
I'm not sure.

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,380
Whoever it was, you should be fine
as long as you were vindicated.

61
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,920
You should reinstate her
and wrap up the case, Director Kang.

62
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,050
The business won't benefit
from blowing up this incident.

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,490
I agree with you.

64
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,360
This is a problem between businesses,
so give it time.

65
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,660
I hope we can wrap this up
with your reinstatement.

66
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,330
If you want,
the business will even offer you...

67
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,630
some monetary compensation.

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,940
Right now,

69
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,670
you two seem more like
the aunt and the niece.

70
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,240
You always turn a blind eye
to the truth...

71
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,440
and want to hide it and conceal it.

72
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,810
If you keep living that life,

73
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,580
you'll end up
cutting your own throat...

74
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,820
because it'll be...

75
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,720
impossible for you to know
what the truth really is.

76
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,090
If you're done venting,
you may leave.

77
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,590
And come to work starting tomorrow.

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,790
No.

79
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,800
I do not plan to return
and work for bosses...

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,060
whom I cannot trust.

81
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,570
You know your own blood
can be the scariest, right?

82
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,440
Be careful
not to get stabbed in the back.

83
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,350
So, no one called as a witness
to Kim Do Hee's accident?

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,750
No, I looked into it,
and nobody called.

85
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,460
If a witness shows up
or reaches out to you,

86
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,660
find out who it is and call me.

87
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,630
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,900
Hello, Director Do. It's me.

89
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,370
Call me right away
if you see any suspicious moves...

90
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,570
from Director Choi or Jae In,

91
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,440
or if they say
they're meeting someone.

92
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,850
Yes, you may do that.

93
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,080
Keep a close eye on them.

94
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm so glad a witness showed up.

95
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,160
I hope it leads to a clue.

96
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,000
Are you done talking to them?

97
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,870
Yes.

98
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,140
They wanted to cover it up
and offered my reinstatement,

99
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,240
but I turned it down.

100
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,610
Was that call really from a witness?

101
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,240
Yes, we had put up banners
looking for one after it broke out,

102
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,910
so he remembered that and called.

103
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,750
What took him so long?

104
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,620
It's been months already.

105
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,950
He had been abroad,

106
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,220
and he had to wonder if he wanted
to be involved in the incident.

107
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,260
I'm going to meet him,
so I'll hear what he has to say.

108
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,860
Don't tell Yun Hee about it.

109
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,890
Let's meet him first
and decide if we should tell her.

110
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,560
We can save her the concern
if he has nothing valuable to say.

111
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

112
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,800
So, what happened to the cuff link?

113
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,840
Did the place that order made those
find anything?

114
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,710
I ordered it a few years ago,

115
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,440
so the order and purchase history
have all been deleted.

116
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,450
Unfortunately, it cannot be used
as evidence at this moment.

117
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,850
Hello, Mr. Do.

118
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,820
Gi Chan said what?

119
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,340
Why is Mi Ran's wallet here?

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,090
My gosh.

121
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,230
You surprised me!

122
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,030
I almost pulled a muscle
because of that.

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,070
Why didn't you call me?

124
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,000
You can't be that shy.

125
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,800
Was it that hard...

126
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,940
to choose 1 of the 2 dates
I told you about...

127
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,640
and ask me out?

128
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,580
I'm the type who hates
to jump to a conclusion,

129
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,750
but are you interested in me?

130
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,550
What? What are you talking about?

131
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,890
You flirted with me first.

132
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,790
You did that to me.

133
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,490
What is this?

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,260
Is it because you feel too shy?

135
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,170
All right. I get it.

136
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,400
Let me set the date.

137
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,010
Let's have lunch
next Wednesday. Okay?

138
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,240
What is this?

139
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,540
Jae In and Dr. Kim
should be gone by now, right?

140
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,110
Things seemed bloody,
so I had to run out.

141
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,650
Jae In?
Are you talking about my sister?

142
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,690
She's here?

143
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,990
Yes, right.

144
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,090
He was Jae In's younger brother.

145
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,930
What if Jae In stops us from dating
after we work things out?

146
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,270
If you don't believe me,
feel free to call her and ask.

147
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,210
I told her to come back,
but she refused.

148
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,840
Isn't it because
you made her feel uncomfortable?

149
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,850
If it wasn't Jae In,

150
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,550
you should be looking
for the culprit immediately.

151
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,950
This person was trying to frame her.

152
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,890
I will,
and I'll do it quietly, so wait.

153
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,090
What is this crazy talk?
You have to find them now!

154
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,590
Why are you so worked up?
This isn't even about you!

155
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,790
She's my sister!

156
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,790
We may only be half-siblings,

157
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,360
but she's still my sister.

158
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,500
You should still consider
YL's image first.

159
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,900
That's the attitude
you must keep as the owner.

160
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,400
I'll do everything
in proper order, so wait.

161
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,440
Do you feel all right?

162
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,180
Why did you drink so much?

163
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,750
Things happened.

164
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,180
Stop drinking that much.
You'll ruin your stomach.

165
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,190
Do you remember
what happened last night?

166
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,690
I was too drunk, so I blacked out.

167
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,480
(Yeongwon Credit Card:
Bo Ram's Fried Chicken, 160 dollars)

168
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,890
Where should I deliver those to,
and until when?

169
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,560
It'll take a while
to fry 100 chickens.

170
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,200
You don't have to.

171
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,070
Think of it as a donation.

172
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,730
An acquaintance of mine
told me to do this.

173
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,880
He's my son.

174
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,350
What about his mother?

175
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,690
Don't ask me anything.

176
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,720
But I can tell you
one thing for sure.

177
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,860
Nothing complicated will happen...

178
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,930
because of this baby.

179
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,470
Relax.

180
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,100
What if he's not Gyu Cheol's son?

181
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,600
He could've adopted him.

182
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,170
What do you think you're doing?

183
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,380
Seung Woo. Are you all right?

184
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,610
Are you hurt?

185
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,080
Let me see you.

186
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,980
How dare you push him?

187
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,420
Seung Woo was so weak
when he was young,

188
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,150
so he had to get hospitalized
whenever he fell ill.

189
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,820
And Mi Ran ran over
every single time.

190
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,330
But still,
100 chickens are too many.

191
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,930
I don't have a reason
to accept a donation.

192
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,900
Give me that credit card.
I'll cancel the charges.

193
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,640
Mi Sook, the credit card!

194
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,240
Where is she suddenly going?

195
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,680
I'm done delivering.

196
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,920
Well, are you looking for Mi Sook?

197
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,260
Something must've come up.
She just left.

198
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,130
- Didn't you see her?
- Is that so?

199
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,530
I wonder what it is.

200
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,570
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

201
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,270
What are you here to do this time?

202
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,580
I came to return this.

203
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,650
You're supposed to offer a reward
to someone who finds your wallet,

204
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,020
so think of this as the reward.

205
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,900
I didn't see Seung Woo outside.

206
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,630
Did he go somewhere?

207
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,570
Why? Are you here to apologize?

208
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,930
I'm not crazy.

209
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,470
Why should I apologize?

210
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,100
Don't you know
about the things you did to him?

211
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,670
What about what Gyu Cheol did to me?

212
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,670
It can't be worse than that.

213
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,850
Who is Seung Woo to you?

214
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,350
What do you mean?

215
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,720
I didn't mean anything by that.

216
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,260
I always thought
you adored him very much.

217
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,130
He's one of the Kangs,

218
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,600
and he's now the only one
who can succeed YL Group.

219
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,500
Jae In is one of the Kangs, too.

220
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,370
It's our tradition
to leave it to the eldest son.

221
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,270
Did you turn a blind eye
and kick her out...

222
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,970
even though she was framed,
in case she gets in his way?

223
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,440
Why won't you say anything?

224
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,480
Did it hit too close to home?

225
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,850
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,920
I was trying to get
a strand of hair off you.

227
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,100
Leave.

228
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,800
I don't think there's anything else
for us to discuss.

229
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,910
What are you doing?

230
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,250
Mind your own.

231
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,990
What are you doing?

232
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,230
I was checking if you were
missing anything from your desk.

233
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,100
How do you know
what I keep on my desk?

234
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,130
- It's not that...
- Don't let me catch you...

235
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,170
going through my things
when I'm not around.

236
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,570
I'll run over to the chairman
and tell him about it.

237
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,240
Move aside!

238
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,490
Hey, it was just delivered.

239
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,120
You didn't have to send it to me.
You could've just called.

240
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,090
I haven't seen it yet.

241
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,160
I'm too scared.

242
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,270
Okay. All right. Give me a moment.

243
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,650
Hello?

244
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,490
Hey, does this mean
my numbers have gone up?

245
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,860
Does this mean I'm not infertile?

246
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,830
Your sperm count is
much lower than the average,

247
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,700
but the numbers have gone up a lot.

248
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,900
Don't worry about the possibility,

249
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,600
and give it a try with confidence.

250
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,500
Okay. Thanks a lot.

251
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,840
It's so great
to have a doctor as a friend!

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,940
What are you up to today?
Let me treat you to dinner.

253
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,240
I'll run over there now. Okay. Bye.

254
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,280
Hooray! Hooray, Gi Man!

255
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,220
I'm a man, too! I'm a man!

256
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,820
- Mom!
- My gosh.

257
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,590
Don't be so gross. Get off me.

258
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,190
I'm broke.

259
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,030
Mom, money isn't everything in life.

260
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,370
Then, what?

261
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
Love.

262
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,340
It's love.

263
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,900
"Love."

264
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,210
I'm done working.
I'll close the business now.

265
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,240
Bye, then.

266
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,310
Hey, you can't close the business!

267
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,180
He needs to make money.

268
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,650
Oh, my. Oh Seong.

269
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,590
You look...

270
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,390
extra sleek today.

271
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,660
I'm glad I ran into you,
Ms. Sook Ja.

272
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,200
Did you want to see me?

273
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,840
Well, something like that.

274
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,410
Please come inside.

275
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,810
The person
I want you to meet is inside.

276
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,620
Wait, I think
the person is in the kitchen.

277
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,920
Please have a seat for a moment.

278
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,160
What's going on?

279
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,670
Is he going to make a proper introduction
to his older sister?

280
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,330
At this rate,

281
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,000
he might propose by next month.

282
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,010
Come on out for a moment.

283
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,610
Please have a seat. Right here.

284
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,520
You two should meet.

285
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,260
Hello. My name is Noh Sook Ja...

286
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,030
You two were about the same age,

287
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,700
and you both had been single
for a long time.

288
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,730
I thought you two could
work things out,

289
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,330
so I wanted to set you two up.

290
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,570
What do you think, Min Jun?

291
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,670
She's a charming woman.

292
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,640
You two would make a great couple.

293
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,570
I'm sorry, Ms. Noh.

294
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,280
I guess he didn't know
we were in-laws.

295
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,510
You two are in-laws?

296
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,650
Then, you two...

297
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,120
can't work it out.

298
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,920
No, we can't work it out
between in-laws,

299
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,220
no matter how immoral things get.

300
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,420
And Oh Seong,

301
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,860
I have a high standard for men,

302
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,860
and he's nowhere enough
to be my spouse.

303
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm so glad I'm far from your type.

304
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,140
Tomorrow?

305
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,010
They're meeting tomorrow?

306
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,450
Where at?

307
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,250
All right. Thanks for your help.

308
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,630
Ji Ho's asleep.

309
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,700
Let's have a glass of wine together.

310
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,600
Honey.

311
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,070
A witness showed up.

312
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,700
What witness?

313
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,470
To Kim Do Hee's accident.

314
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,210
Someone saw that?

315
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,080
Did the police call you?

316
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,350
I heard someone calling Kim Do Yun.

317
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,250
He said it was from a witness.

318
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,350
What if the witness saw us?

319
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,150
What do we do, honey?

320
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,990
Jae In and Kim Do Yun are
meeting the witness tomorrow,

321
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,420
so let's check.

322
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,860
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

323
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,930
Hey, life is great.

324
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:53,240
Hey! Oh, my darling.

325
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,040
My love, Yu Gyeong!

326
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,770
Did you forget that the hospital
appointment was tomorrow?

327
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,680
I said you couldn't drink
the day before your collection.

328
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,650
No, don't worry about it.

329
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,850
- Don't worry.
- Jeez.

330
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,390
I love you, Yu Gyeong.

331
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,520
Let us live happily ever after.

332
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,330
Let's have sons...

333
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,130
and daughters,
and we'll live happily ever after.

334
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,400
I'll file for bankruptcy...

335
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,540
and get rid of all my debt.

336
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,270
- Goodness.
- Honey, you have...

337
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,810
nothing to worry about now.

338
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,740
Our happiness begins today.

339
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,310
Isn't this great? It's so great.

340
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,880
Get up. Hey.

341
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,150
Honey!

342
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,920
Gosh.

343
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,090
(Saechorok OB-GYN Clinic)

344
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,950
Honey.

345
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,020
Can you give me some water?

346
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,390
I need... I need water.

347
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,630
Honey.

348
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,430
I need some water. My stomach hurts.

349
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,070
What's wrong with you?

350
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,180
I know you're mad at me
for drinking,

351
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,150
but you just crossed the line!

352
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,250
I found that in your pocket.

353
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,020
Honey, it's...

354
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,820
How did you keep this quiet
through all these years?

355
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,630
I was always blamed
for our infertility,

356
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,060
and your mother
even treated me like a defect.

357
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,930
No, honey. It's a misunderstanding.

358
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,170
Look at the date of the result.

359
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,900
It came yesterday.

360
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,740
I got scared
before going to the clinic with you,

361
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,500
so I got tested in advance.

362
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,270
It also shows the numbers
from your test five years ago.

363
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,040
I'm a doctor.

364
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,280
I know what those numbers mean.

365
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,610
You're infertile!

366
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,090
Honey, I'm sorry.

367
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm so sorry.

368
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,860
What did you do this time
to beg her this early?

369
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,060
You almost ended our family line,
yet I let you off, so that's enough.

370
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,630
Where's breakfast?

371
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,130
I'm hungry.

372
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,140
Make breakfast, and then wash these.

373
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,570
Don't use a washing machine.
Use your hands.

374
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,810
You can do it yourself.

375
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,880
What did you just say?

376
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,250
You can do it yourself.

377
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,780
Have you lost your mind?

378
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,650
Mom, you need to stop. Please.

379
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,820
Move aside.

380
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,520
Say that again!

381
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,260
I'm resigning
as your daughter-in-law.

382
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm sick and tired of living
as your daughter-in-law.

383
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,200
I won't say anything more.
I want a divorce.

384
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,530
Look at her!

385
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,400
Has she lost her mind?

386
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,970
- Mom.
- She's gone crazy.

387
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,740
You need to stop!

388
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,080
She knows everything!

389
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,610
- She knows that I'm infertile!
- What?

390
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,850
Honey! Yu Gyeong!

391
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,310
Goodness.

392
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,850
I was on my way to meet someone,

393
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,560
but it suddenly rained,
so I began to run.

394
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,860
I saw a woman on the ground
on the crosswalk,

395
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,630
and a car was parked
in front of her.

396
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,800
Did you see the person in the car?

397
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,570
It rained pretty heavily,

398
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,970
and I was far away from them,
so I didn't get a good look.

399
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,770
But I saw the driver's door open,

400
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,510
so I naturally thought the driver
would've called 911 and left.

401
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,280
I never thought
it'd be a hit-and-run case.

402
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,250
Can you share
what you just said with the police?

403
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,760
Of course.
I'll go and make a statement.

404
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,630
Are they gone?

405
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,400
Yes, they both left.

406
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,710
Gi Chan asked Mr. Do
to let him know...

407
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,750
if I did anything suspicious
or met with somebody.

408
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,090
We need to meet the witness now
before Hwang Gi Chan finds out.

409
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,420
Yes.

410
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,990
Thank you for coming out...

411
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,860
even after such short notice.

412
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,700
It's all right.

413
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,900
It had always weighed me down,
so I wanted to meet you soon, too.

414
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,570
Can you tell us
everything you saw on that day?

415
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,110
I had to meet someone,

416
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,280
but it suddenly rained,
so I began to run.

417
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,210
There must've been an accident.

418
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,850
I saw a woman down on the ground
in front of a car.

419
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,490
And?

420
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,530
I'm not sure if it was the car
that hit the woman,

421
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,500
but I saw a young man and a young woman
who seemed like a couple...

422
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,730
bickering with one another
next to the car...

423
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,270
parked at the scene of the accident.

424
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,640
My mom was driving...

425
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,510
while Seung Woo was asleep
in the passenger seat.

426
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,180
So, if the man and the woman
looked young...

427
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,050
It must be...

428
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,550
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

429
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,790
There were people outside,

430
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,290
so I figured
they must've called 911.

431
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,990
But after finding out
it was a hit-and-run accident,

432
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,360
I suddenly got scared.

433
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,560
I was scheduled
to leave the country for a while,

434
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,330
so it took me a while to reach out.

435
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,670
I'm so sorry.

436
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,070
I know my mom was the one...

437
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,010
who hit Ms. Do Hee with the car.

438
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,750
The dash cam footage was
the evidence,

439
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,050
and my mom didn't deny that.

440
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,090
We don't know how and how far
those two are involved in the accident,

441
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,220
but what we do know is Hwang Gi Chan
and Kang Se Ri were there that day.

442
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,160
If they called 911,

443
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,860
Do Hee...

444
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,300
might have lived.

445
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,110
We should confirm
if Gi Chan and Se Ri were...

446
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,210
the ones that the witness saw.

447
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,840
Let's throw them bait.

448
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,590
Mr. Do, it's me.

449
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,390
Tell Gi Chan that
we're meeting the witness...

450
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,400
to Ms. Do Hee's accident.

451
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,930
Hello? It's me, Mr. Chairman.

452
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,700
Jae In told me...

453
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,940
she'd meet the witness
to Kim Do Hee's accident tomorrow.

454
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:16,850
Thanks for acting as the witness.

455
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,620
I can't say no to your request.

456
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,650
I'll get going, then.

457
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,030
If Gi Chan and Se Ri came here...

458
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,560
after hearing
we'd be meeting the witness,

459
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,570
it would mean they were the ones
the witness saw.

460
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,070
We have to do whatever it takes
to find out what they did.

461
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,740
Oh, no. Bo Ram must be waiting.

462
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,810
I have to go.

463
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,710
I'll stop by the restaurant
to meet my mom.

464
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,280
Okay.

465
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,350
What now?

466
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,920
Isn't it too dangerous
to let him roam around?

467
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,460
It might be better
to give him hush money.

468
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,090
I'll meet with him.

469
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,230
No, he said he didn't see our faces.

470
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,430
It won't affect us,
so don't approach him.

471
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
If we do, we can get tracked down.

472
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,640
I made myself clear.

473
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,140
All right.
I'll put my faith only in you.

474
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,440
Hello.

475
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,220
Hello.

476
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,550
- Why are you...
- Why are you...

477
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,760
So, this place was run
by Ms. Kim Do Hee's mother?

478
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,700
Yes, my mom told me a lot about you,

479
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,170
but I didn't know it was you.

480
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,930
I didn't, either.

481
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,070
I never even imagined this,

482
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,440
so this is quite disconcerting.

483
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,240
Where's my mom?

484
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:57,710
It was the weekend,
so she left early to play with Bo Ram.

485
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,950
I see.

486
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,420
By any chance, does Jae In know?

487
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,190
No, not at all.

488
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,990
Where did he go?

489
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,930
- He won't even pick up.
- The person you have...

490
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,030
He makes me so frustrated.

491
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,040
Come and have a seat.

492
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,340
I was about to call you.
I'm glad you're here.

493
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,750
Give it to Gi Man.

494
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,250
It's the divorce papers.

495
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,820
Do you have to do this?

496
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,320
How did you treat me,
although you knew he was infertile?

497
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,830
You treated me like a defect
and abused me through the years.

498
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,990
Yet I only blamed myself
and thought it was all my fault,

499
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,630
and I was the wrong one.

500
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,400
Listen to this girl.

501
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,170
Who's infertile?

502
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,730
Didn't you see that piece of paper?

503
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,600
It's not like
he doesn't have any sperm.

504
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,440
If you were healthy,

505
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,110
you would've been pregnant
a long time ago.

506
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,340
And of course, that's your fault.

507
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,640
Is it mine?

508
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,580
And abusing you?

509
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:05,220
People who really get abused
by their in-laws would laugh.

510
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,920
That's nowhere enough
to call it abuse.

511
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,890
Hey! Honey!

512
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,790
You were here! Honey!

513
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,530
- Honey!
- Goodness.

514
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,430
Honey. Hey.

515
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,660
Honey, I'm so sorry.

516
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,800
I'm so sorry. I apologize.

517
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,100
I brought the divorce papers.

518
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,570
Sign it, and I'll see you at court.

519
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,010
Honey, I really love you. I do.

520
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:35,280
You know I can't live without you.

521
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,850
I love you. I really do.

522
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,520
I love you!

523
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,250
I don't love you.

524
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,690
I've done enough,

525
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,460
and I don't even want to see you,
so let's get divorced.

526
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,470
We better not say anything
to my mom.

527
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,870
All right. Goodbye.

528
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,320
Come on! I told you I was sorry!

529
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,750
Darn it!

530
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,890
Good grief. My head hurts.

531
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,260
My head is splitting.

532
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,460
I'm done talking. Goodbye.

533
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,530
Read the divorce papers,

534
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,360
and talk to my attorney
if you have anything to say.

535
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,430
Where do you think you're going?

536
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,640
You can't leave me.
How dare you leave me?

537
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,070
We're a married couple.

538
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,880
I said I loved you!

539
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,380
You did this to your wife,
the woman you said you loved!

540
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,110
How can you do this to me?

541
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,580
Even when you went around
causing trouble like a madman,

542
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,250
I still put up with everything
every single time. Why?

543
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,990
Yes! Because you said you loved me,

544
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,190
and I thought that much was real.

545
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,200
Don't try to make me pity you.

546
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,900
Stop acting like you're the victim.

547
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,500
I pity myself the most right now.

548
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,570
How dare you leave?

549
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,070
- You can't leave.
- Let go of me!

550
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,110
Stop!

551
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,610
Have you been
treating my daughter like this?

552
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,620
I had no idea and told her
to work things out with you.

553
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,190
Dad!

554
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,400
All right. Let's go.

555
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,170
- Father!
- Good grief.

556
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,870
Jeez. That's enough.

557
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,510
He might report you.

558
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,110
Yu Gyeong!

559
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,620
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

560
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,890
He seems to be staying
with Mr. Kim Do Yun.

561
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,660
They look quite close.

562
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,360
Have they known each other
for a long time?

563
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,230
Didn't you know?

564
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,030
Mr. Kim Do Yun is
Ms. Kim Do Hee's older brother.

565
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,400
Her older brother?

566
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,770
It means they're...

567
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,780
Can we talk?

568
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,380
I'm glad you're here.

569
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,220
I was about to go see you.

570
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,320
Please meet the designer
DH Holdings recently hired.

571
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,580
(Queen's House)

572
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,820
Why did you hide that
Director Kim Do Yun was your nephew?

573
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,520
I never hid it.

574
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,450
I just didn't have a reason
to let you know ahead of time.

575
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,320
They must've become quite close.
What do I do?

576
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,360
Things will become chaotic
if they find out about each other.

577
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,230
Team Leader Kang Se Ri's
real name is Kang Jae In, right?

578
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,530
She's the daughter
of the late Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol,

579
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,530
your father-in-law.

580
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,600
You must know her well.
She's your niece.

581
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,710
Are you trying to say...

582
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,770
Kang Seung Woo killed Ms. Kim,
not your mom?

583
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,510
What are you talking about?

584
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,810
You're trying to save your mom...

585
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,680
and frame Seung Woo as the murderer.
