00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,610
(Episode 58)

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,980
Mom?

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,390
Did you just call her your mom?

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,060
Wait, where...

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,430
Where am I?

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,510
Come with me.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,970
Mi Sook.

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,080
Your name is Do Mi Sook, right?

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,580
You got the wrong person.

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,220
You just said she was your mom.

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,530
Don't say anything and come.

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,290
Come with me.

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,130
Tell me.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,860
Did you say she was her mom or not?

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,540
She's my mom.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,480
I told you to come.
Why are you standing there?

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,010
Come out. Now.

21
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,620
Are you all right?

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,840
Jae In!

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,710
What do you think you're doing?

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,610
What did she do to deserve
this kind of violence?

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,210
You two are less than human.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,420
How can you do this to me?

27
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,790
How can you do this?

28
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,670
How can you do this to me? How?

29
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,880
What's this sound?

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,110
Dad.

31
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,310
Hello, Min Jun.

32
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

33
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,730
Bring my daughter back!
Bring her back!

34
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,460
- Step back.
- Bring her back!

35
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,560
- Step back. You'll get hurt!
- No.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,970
You'll get hurt. Step back!

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,270
You need to die, too.

38
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,170
Die. You need to die, too!

39
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,440
Let go!

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,940
- Let go of her!
- Mom!

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,040
- Yun Hee! You need to stop!
- You!

42
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,650
- Yun Hee!
- No!

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,120
Oh Seong...

44
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,750
- Yes?
- Just kill me now.

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,260
I'm the one who needs to die.

46
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,160
I must've been crazy.

47
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,400
My Do Hee!

48
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,200
How am I going to face her now?

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,730
- No, Do Hee...
- Yun Hee.

50
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,470
Yun Hee.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,070
No...

52
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,710
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,810
Do Hee...

54
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,510
- Do Hee! How can this happen?
- You need to go, Jae In.

55
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,680
- Do Hee...
- Jae In, you should leave for now.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,450
- Yu Gyeong.
- Do Hee!

57
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,620
You should go, Ms. Choi.

58
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,890
Do Hee...

59
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,790
Do Hee!

60
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm so sorry.

61
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,070
I didn't know anything!

62
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,740
No, Do Hee!

63
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,170
What's going on, Yun Hee?
Is it because Ms. Kang came here?

64
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,550
I've sinned greatly...

65
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,720
against my Do Hee, Oh Seong.

66
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,990
Is this about Ms. Kang?

67
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
She was a victim, too.

68
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,430
I housed...

69
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,000
her murderer's daughter in her room,

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,870
and I gave a job...

71
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,010
to the very woman who killed her.

72
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,340
- No, Do Hee!
- What are you talking about?

73
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,150
The woman who killed Do Hee?

74
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,450
Choi Ja Young?

75
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,590
She was that woman.

76
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,990
I'm sorry, Do Hee!

77
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,430
I'm so sorry!

78
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,380
Why did you go there?

79
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,280
Don't ever go back.

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,880
What's going on?

81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,490
Was she your acquaintance?

82
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,830
Have you been working there?

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,460
Yes.

84
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,400
How can this be?

85
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,470
She must be in a great shock.

86
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,140
I was greatly shocked, too.

87
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,540
How could I ever imagine
that she was her mother?

88
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,590
I made chamomile tea. Have some.

89
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,660
My dad wants to see you.

90
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
It must've been a surprise.

91
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,210
I didn't know
my mom had been working there.

92
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,150
It was my fault.

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,650
I had no idea
Ms. Kim's mother ran the place.

94
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,320
As you already know,
I only found out recently.

95
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,930
Yes, Do Yun told me.

96
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,400
I was about to ask her to quit
after finding out,

97
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,930
but she offered to quit first.

98
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,440
So, I thought
it worked out smoothly.

99
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,200
And she really quit.

100
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,510
I didn't want to worry you,

101
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,440
so I chose not to tell you.

102
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,480
It's my fault.

103
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,050
Don't say that.

104
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,320
You didn't do anything wrong.

105
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,420
It's all my fault.

106
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,250
You aren't at fault, either.

107
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,190
It wasn't your fault,
so you don't need to feel guilty.

108
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,060
Mom.

109
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,630
She died because of me.

110
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,770
Why don't you get it?

111
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,400
Yes, I killed her.

112
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,670
I killed her myself for my daughter.

113
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,570
I fell into the trap
Kang Se Ri put out.

114
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,440
Did you think
I was happy to do that?

115
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,710
Do you think I'm at peace
after killing someone?

116
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,410
I'm only human, too.

117
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,850
I also...

118
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,320
Calm down, Ms. Choi.

119
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,660
If I could turn back time,
I really want to.

120
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,260
But that's impossible.

121
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,700
Then, what else can I do?

122
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,500
Do I have to die?

123
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,900
Mom, that's not what I'm saying.

124
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,000
Forget it.

125
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,740
You're all taking sides
to blame only me.

126
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,210
No one understands...

127
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,910
how I really feel right now...

128
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,690
I want to be alone,
so don't come into the room.

129
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,060
Mom!

130
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,660
You should try
to understand, Jae In.

131
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,930
Her words may be harsh,

132
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,270
but she must be
greatly distressed on the inside.

133
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,300
She had been quite close
to Ms. Kim's mother,

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,970
like they were good friends.

135
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,080
So, it was harder for me
to share the truth with her.

136
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,480
Had she really?

137
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,210
Yes.

138
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,120
They seemed to get along so well.

139
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,850
I agree.

140
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
I hope you aren't too distressed.

141
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,570
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

142
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,170
Its belly looks just like yours.

143
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,280
How cute. And you're cute, too.

144
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,910
Grandma's here, Bo Ram.

145
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,950
You're back, Grandma!

146
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,050
Hey, there.

147
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,060
Did you have fun today, Bo Ram?

148
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,120
Yes.

149
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,320
You came home early.

150
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,590
Did something happen?

151
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,430
Bo Ram.

152
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,870
Who gave this to you?

153
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,230
Ms. Kang gave it to me as a present.

154
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,640
Isn't it cute?

155
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,670
Ms. Kang?

156
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,080
Did you meet her?

157
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,650
Yes, we read books...

158
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,650
and made drawings on Sunday.

159
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,420
We promised to make cookies together
next time she comes over.

160
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
Right, Uncle Do Yun?

161
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,990
What?

162
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,760
Yes, sure.

163
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,660
Do Yun, can I talk to you?

164
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,770
I need to talk to you first.

165
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,340
I'll talk to him, Yun Hee.

166
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,840
What's going on?

167
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,210
Brace yourself before you walk in.

168
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,080
- Do you want to play with me?
- Okay.

169
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,910
All right. Let's sit down.

170
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,150
What were you up to?

171
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,450
I asked Jae In to come.

172
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,490
I had the articles left behind
by her father, Chairman Kang.

173
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,860
She came to pick those up.

174
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,660
Didn't you remember what I said?

175
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,530
I said we'd be
sinning against Do Hee...

176
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,670
just by letting her
set foot into this house, didn't I?

177
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,940
I just explained the situation.

178
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,070
Why won't you listen to me?

179
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,710
Mom, what happened today?

180
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,540
I went to the police station...

181
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,710
and demanded an answer...

182
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,880
for why Do Hee's murderer was
still roaming around out here.

183
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,720
You knew, didn't you?

184
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,420
Yes.

185
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,530
I heard she was under reinvestigation
without detention.

186
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,730
I knew you'd be concerned,
so I never told you.

187
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,060
Also, we couldn't do anything...

188
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,430
except wait
for the judgment to be made.

189
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,100
Is that all?

190
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,040
Or was it
because she was Jae In's mother?

191
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,810
No, Mom.

192
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,080
No.

193
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,040
I already felt disgusted to think...

194
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,380
that she was out here...

195
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,380
sleeping in peace
after she killed my daughter,

196
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,520
but here's what's more absurd.

197
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,060
She worked for me,

198
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,590
claiming she was Mi Sook,
Mr. Do Min Jun's older sister.

199
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,730
While her daughter stayed
in my daughter's room,

200
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,930
the mother was working for me.

201
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,600
They must've thought we were a joke
to do something like that.

202
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,270
Jae In probably didn't know.

203
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,910
Are you still taking her side?

204
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,980
I don't want
to talk about that family anymore.

205
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,750
Kick her out
of your business right away,

206
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,680
and don't let Bo Ram see her again.

207
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,590
Why won't you say anything?

208
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,260
Uncle Do Yun.

209
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,500
Is Grandma mad at you?

210
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,630
Did you do something wrong?

211
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,170
Well, it's...

212
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,570
You should get some rest.

213
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,980
Grandma, are you angry?

214
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,450
No.

215
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,120
Bo Ram, I can get you...

216
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,730
a much better stuffed animal
instead of this one.

217
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,190
No, thank you.

218
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,730
I like this best
because it's from Ms. Kang.

219
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,310
You really didn't know anything?

220
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,480
No, I didn't.

221
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,950
What about Jae In? Did she know?

222
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,320
She probably didn't.

223
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,690
She would've told us
if she had known.

224
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,690
You know how she is.

225
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,230
Yes, that's true.

226
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,630
What are the chances?

227
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,930
Yun Hee always said
Mi Sook was such a great person,

228
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,270
but she turned out to be
Do Hee's murderer.

229
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,070
She must've been stunned.

230
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,240
Why couldn't she recognize her?

231
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,110
Well, she did have a different name,

232
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,550
and Yun Hee couldn't imagine
Choi Ja Young would work there.

233
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,950
She must've thought
the woman was under detention.

234
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,950
The trial date
gets postponed every time,

235
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,290
and the public defender
has changed many times already,

236
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,760
so I thought it'd take
much longer than I expected.

237
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,760
I didn't know
she wasn't under detention.

238
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,930
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,900
I should've at least told you.

240
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,170
Well, even I couldn't imagine...

241
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,540
that haughty woman would be
willing to work at a restaurant.

242
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,070
It's my fault.

243
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,440
I should've paid
more attention to Mom.

244
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,180
We humans cannot control
everything that happens in life.

245
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,820
I also lost it as soon as I heard
she was Choi Ja Young.

246
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,290
I thought of calling Jae In
and demanding an answer, but...

247
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,920
No one would be unhappy
if we knew everything in life.

248
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,430
It wasn't your fault.
Don't be hard on yourself.

249
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,100
Thank you
for picking up my stuff, Na Ra.

250
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,470
It was a bit of a hassle,

251
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,340
but Gi Chan let me leave early...

252
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,910
to help you bring the box home,
so it's a win for me.

253
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,150
What are all those?

254
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,350
It's from work.

255
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,990
Why did you bring these home?

256
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,890
- Well...
- She got fired, Mom.

257
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,530
She and Jae In had a design contest,

258
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,690
and she got destroyed...

259
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,700
I mean, she completely lost.
It was so embarrassing.

260
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,200
Na Ra!

261
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,170
Oops. Sorry.

262
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,340
Very humiliating. Utter disgrace.

263
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,240
Total embarrassment. Happy now?

264
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,280
Jeez. You lost to Jae In,

265
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,850
of all people, and got kicked out?

266
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,050
How can you
humiliate Gi Chan like this?

267
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,920
Whatever. Get ready to stay at home
and start doing chores.

268
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,320
You used to be so proud
of going out and making money.

269
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,930
I hated seeing Jae In running wild,
thanks to the investment firm,

270
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,900
so I left reluctantly.

271
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,630
I'm the one
who always takes from Jae In.

272
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,270
She can't take anything from me.

273
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,540
I won't let it happen.

274
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,780
Why is she so proud?

275
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,710
Jeez.

276
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,120
No. It wasn't me.

277
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,350
I didn't do it. No!

278
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,120
What's wrong, honey?

279
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,620
Did you have a nightmare?

280
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,290
I think Jae In knows something.

281
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,560
She did? What does she know?

282
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,470
She must know something.

283
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,270
I'm sure.

284
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,970
I thought you'd find your peace
once YL Group became yours.

285
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,810
I didn't know
it would make you so stressed out.

286
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,110
I wish I were a deity...

287
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,180
to bring judgment
to everyone who harasses you.

288
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,560
Honey, look at me.

289
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,790
I won't let you be tormented alone.

290
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,360
Put your trust in me.

291
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,030
I can do anything...

292
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,070
for you, Gi Chan. Anything.

293
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,190
Grandma, Uncle Do Yun is
only picking at his rice.

294
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,460
You should tell him...

295
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,590
to eat a balanced meal
instead of doing that.

296
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,060
Uncle Do Yun, she's telling you
to eat a balanced meal.

297
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,300
Tell her I'll do that, Bo Ram.

298
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,410
You should eat a balanced meal, too.

299
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,810
Here. Try this one.

300
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,170
I thought I'd never see you again
in this building.

301
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,010
I suddenly got fired,

302
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,410
so I came to turn in
my letter of resignation.

303
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,910
And you're doing that
in our empty office?

304
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,750
I came to say my final goodbye,

305
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,210
but no one was here,
so I was about to leave.

306
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,150
It's wonderful
to say goodbye to you two,

307
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,320
who considered me
the biggest nuisance.

308
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,190
Goodbye, Jae In.

309
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,960
Goodbye, Director Kim.

310
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,460
Bye.

311
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,980
Hey...

312
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,720
You heard about my mom, right?

313
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,060
Ms. Jung seemed quite shaken.

314
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,360
Is she okay?

315
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,690
She's in deep shock.

316
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,330
Anyway, how did she
end up working there?

317
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,570
Mr. Do must've asked her
to work there with him...

318
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,240
before he found out
Ms. Jung was Ms. Kim's mother.

319
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,780
Ahoy.

320
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,660
Hey, thank you
for your help last time.

321
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,830
I've done too many things
for you to thank me for,

322
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,260
so I need you...

323
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,030
to state exactly
what you're grateful for...

324
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,060
to know what this is about.

325
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,970
I only have
one thing to thank you for.

326
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,810
Take it however you like.

327
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,780
Mr. Kang looks very sullen.
What's going on?

328
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,050
Mind your own.

329
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,990
Yes, those two are
definitely the Kang family.

330
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,560
They're the same.

331
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,580
Hello. You're here.

332
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,650
Take your seat.

333
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,490
I'm sorry
for what happened yesterday.

334
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,890
You don't have to apologize...

335
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,590
No, I'll accept your apology.

336
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,400
That way, I'll feel more at ease.

337
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,200
Nothing you can say will be
a good enough excuse for Yun Hee.

338
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,940
I know.

339
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,570
So, why Do Mi Sook?
Why did she change her name...

340
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,240
I can explain that later.

341
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,180
Anyway, about the voice recorder
the chairman left behind.

342
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,880
What will you do with that?

343
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,720
Yes, Do Yun told me about that.

344
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,050
I heard he left a message
just before he passed away.

345
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,850
So, what are you waiting for?

346
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,220
Why won't you report it
to the police?

347
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,590
There was a detective
who was in charge of my dad's death.

348
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,530
His name was Baek Mun Su.

349
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,200
He wasn't even in charge
of Eun Ho's case,

350
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,770
but he was involved
in the investigation.

351
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,370
I remember him.

352
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,940
Was he the one who freed Mr. Hong,
the man who got the job done?

353
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,740
That's him.

354
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,340
Baek Mun Su.

355
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,840
That name sounds familiar.

356
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,780
He was in charge of Do Hee's case.

357
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,880
Something smells fishy.

358
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,750
That detective was
involved in all these cases?

359
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,420
He might have a connection
with Hwang Gi Chan.

360
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,490
So, even if I take the evidence
to the police station,

361
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,460
I'm not sure if they'll conduct
a proper investigation.

362
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,770
I don't know
how deep the connection...

363
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,800
really goes.

364
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,540
There seems to be no one
we can trust right now.

365
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,480
Yes, right. Should I call Wang Sik?

366
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,550
My friend from the army has...

367
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,590
an older brother named Son Wang Sik,
and he's a detective.

368
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,890
I heard he was
recently appointed to Seoul,

369
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,690
so should we leave this with him?

370
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:00,860
I know we can trust him.

371
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,730
Then, I'd be grateful.

372
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:07,560
Please do that, Mr. Jung.

373
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,700
I'll reach out to him
and set up a meeting soon.

374
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,810
Okay. Thank you.

375
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,920
You're here.

376
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,930
Thank you for coming.

377
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,430
You said you had something to say.

378
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,970
You look much thinner.

379
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,430
Do you eat well?

380
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,540
You don't care about me.

381
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,070
Seung Woo.

382
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,140
I can't ask you to understand me,

383
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,250
but this is as hard for me
as it is for you.

384
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,910
Your aunt...

385
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,880
Your aunt said she wanted you
under her family registrar.

386
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,250
And?

387
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,890
Did you call me to tell me
to get out of your family on paper?

388
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,890
It's the opposite. I turned it down.

389
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,000
You had been
Gyu Cheol and my son all along.

390
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,800
It's nonsense for her
to demand that I give up my child.

391
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,770
I also didn't think
it was best for you,

392
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,200
so I declined.

393
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,810
Do you mean that?

394
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,810
Does it seem like I'm lying?

395
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,080
I was always worried about you.

396
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,280
Then,

397
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,520
what do you think...

398
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,060
about the reinvestigation
for Ms. Kim's case?

399
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,590
Who did it?

400
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,900
Was it me? Was it you?

401
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,600
If not, who was it?

402
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,370
It's still under investigation,

403
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,670
so we'll find out later.

404
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,480
You said you were worried about me.

405
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,980
Are you really worried?

406
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,680
If you really considered me a son,

407
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,150
if you were really my mom,

408
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,460
you couldn't say that to me.

409
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,460
If you want to make me
the hit-and-run driver, do that.

410
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,800
I'll turn myself in instead of you.

411
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,730
No!

412
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
That wasn't my question!

413
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,870
You don't think of me
as your real son,

414
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,040
do you?

415
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,480
Go, now.
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

416
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,150
Just go!

417
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,130
What was I doing right now?

418
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,510
A voice recorder?

419
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,920
Chairman Kang left a message
on a voice recorder as he died.

420
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,990
What message?

421
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,650
I don't know that.

422
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,120
They were talking about
how they'd give it to the police,

423
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,560
so it probably
wouldn't do you any good.

424
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,960
You didn't kill
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol, did you?

425
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,970
Stop talking nonsense.
Why would I kill him?

426
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,800
Why are you yelling at me?
I was just curious.

427
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,310
Anyway, forget that.
It's Detective Baek Mun Su.

428
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,340
They're suspicious
of his connection with you.

429
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,980
I heard he was in charge
of Ms. Kim Do Hee's case.

430
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,350
Are you scared?

431
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,550
How can you joke around
in this situation?

432
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,220
I told you not to worry
and just trust me.

433
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,930
Can you get the voice recorder?

434
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,300
I should.

435
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,030
It'd be a perfect crime
if the voice recorder disappeared.

436
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,310
Honey, I'll save you.

437
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,350
Then, Mr. Kang can hand over...

438
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,160
everything Team Leader Kang
had been doing to Designer Kang.

439
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,730
You disregarded the procedure
and kicked her out...

440
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,830
without finding a replacement,
so do her job until we find one.

441
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,430
Is that all?

442
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,970
Don't you have
something more to say?

443
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,700
I don't.

444
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,400
I must be at an executive meeting.
Please excuse me.

445
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,820
Is this about what
you two were discussing last time?

446
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,150
What do you have to hear from her?

447
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,220
I already told you last time.
I'll tell you...

448
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,660
after I figure it out some more.

449
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,130
I don't think I'd be able to stand it
if you also fell into danger.

450
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,000
Stop treating me like a kid.

451
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,700
Is it okay for you
to fall into danger?

452
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,700
I don't want that.

453
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,440
Please give me a little more time.

454
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,480
Have you thought about
becoming Aunt Mi Ran's family...

455
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,550
on paper?

456
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,420
It never even crossed my mind.

457
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,850
Why would I think about that?

458
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,390
If you're hesitant
because of me or Mom,

459
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,530
please don't do that.

460
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,560
Aunt Mi Ran, Mom, and I...

461
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,270
don't have any right
to force anything on you.

462
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,830
To me,
it's not even a matter of choice.

463
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,610
Are you trying to get rid of me
because I'm not your brother?

464
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,940
Seung Woo.

465
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,680
You already know
that's not what I mean.

466
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,880
No.

467
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,420
I don't know what you mean. I don't.

468
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,400
Hello?
Yes, you've reached Kang Jae In.

469
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,840
Yes, right. Hello.

470
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,040
Yes, CEO Jung Oh Seong
told me about you.

471
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,270
Yes, I'm free today.

472
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,180
Yes. I'll meet you at 7 p.m...

473
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,250
at Cafe K.

474
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,720
Yes, I'll call you when I get there.

475
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Goodbye.

476
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,820
Hey, who was that?

477
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,160
It was the detective
CEO Jung mentioned.

478
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,000
I need to leave a little early
to be there on time.

479
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,030
I'm sorry.

480
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,470
It's okay.
This is important. You should go.

481
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,770
Okay.

482
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:01,610
Seung Woo,
it's not like what you think.

483
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,150
Whatever. I don't care.

484
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,050
Let's meet tonight.

485
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,020
I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

486
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,290
Something urgent came up,
so I have to go.

487
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,960
I'll call you.

488
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,900
(Designer Kang Jae In)

489
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,040
Where's Ms. Kang?

490
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,310
She went to meet the detective
you told her about.

491
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,850
Wang Sik?

492
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,980
I haven't given him her number yet.

493
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,790
Then, who is she meeting?

494
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,490
Who could it be?

495
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,830
Did the other person claim
he was the detective I mentioned?

496
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,130
(Cafe K, 7 p.m.)

497
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,500
Hey, Do Yun!

498
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:17,250
(Do Yun)

499
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,730
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

500
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,640
(Do Yun)

501
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,440
Jae In? It's me.

502
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,310
Hey, Do Yun.

503
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,010
You can't meet the person you're
about to meet right now! Don't go.

504
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,950
What? Why not?

505
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,150
Stop the car first.

506
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,080
Pull over and wait for me. Okay?

507
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,080
All right.

508
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,560
What? What's wrong with this?

509
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,460
- Why? What is it?
- No, wait.

510
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,060
The brakes. The brakes are weird.

511
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,800
The brakes aren't working?

512
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,530
Jae In!

513
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,870
Do Yun! My car is acting up.

514
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,750
(Road closed, detour)

515
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,380
Mommy!

516
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,650
Mommy!

517
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,690
- Mommy!
- Eun Ho!

518
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,730
I'll keep you safe, Mommy.

519
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,030
Don't cry, Mommy.

520
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm a brave boy,

521
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,170
so you don't have to worry.

522
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,700
(Queen's House)

523
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,470
You just need to follow my instructions
and make a call.

524
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,770
I'm calling
because Oh Seong told me about you.

525
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,370
I'm Detective Son Wang Sik.

526
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,640
Who died? Kang Jae In?

527
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,240
Her car blew up?

528
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,210
What goes around
really comes around.

529
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,410
She committed a sin...

530
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,910
for her daughter's sake
and considered my girl's life petty,

531
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,650
and it all went back
to her daughter.

532
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,220
I feel guilty and scared.

533
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,590
Everyone's fate is sealed,

534
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,820
and that was hers.

535
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,660
- Mourning won't bring her back,
- Do Hee!

536
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,960
so empty your drink
and forget about it.

537
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,560
