00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,080
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,850
Aunt Mi Ran, are you telling me
to betray my sister?

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:12,080
I'm saying...

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,220
we must make the best decision
for YL Group.

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,720
So what? What's your plan?

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,490
I'm still thinking...

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,260
about what the best choice will be.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,100
I'm going to cast my vote
for Jae In.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,670
You're the owner of this company.

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,270
We always bequeath the business
to the eldest son.

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,470
Do you think Jae In will
hand it over to you...

14
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,810
after she takes office?

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,470
No.

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,010
Even if Jae In gives it up,

17
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,580
I know the other one will
try to stop her.

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,580
You know who I'm talking about.

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,550
I don't care for it.

20
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,620
You must remain cold-hearted
when you're doing business.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,290
It doesn't matter
if you care for it or not.

22
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,460
That doesn't change the fact that
you're the eldest son of the Kangs.

23
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,430
Why don't we do this?

24
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,000
What if you find out...

25
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,400
if that woman has
any motherly love for you?

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,230
Then, can you do as I say?

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,840
Do you not feel bad at all...

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,780
about Seung Woo?

29
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,920
I've shown him enough kindness.

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,580
He'd be shameless to want more.

31
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,560
Mi Ran, if you have
enough time to care about him,

32
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,260
you need to focus on Jae In.

33
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,090
YL Group...

34
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,330
must belong to her,
no matter what happens.

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,260
It must happen.

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,300
Congratulations.

37
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,740
Director Hwang Gi Chan,
you have been elected...

38
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,970
as the next chairman of YL Group.

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,560
Yes, I was on my way
to the meeting room.

40
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,130
We need some privacy.

41
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,530
Sure.

42
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,640
Jae In's mother called and said...

43
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,640
she'd hand over
the power of attorney.

44
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,050
And I'm on my way
to get it from her.

45
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,820
So, everything is in my hands.

46
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,350
I can make you the chairman...

47
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,190
or not.

48
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,030
What can I do? Please tell me.

49
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,470
It's an agreement that says...

50
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,330
you won't make any calls
regarding YL's profit distribution...

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,500
and other major decisions
for the group without my consent...

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,370
and that you agree to endorse
Kang Seung Woo...

53
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,480
as the chairman after your office.

54
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,810
I'll have it notarized right away
as soon as you sign it.

55
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,990
(Signed by Hwang Gi Chan)

56
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,080
That's all for this
extraordinary general meeting.

57
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,380
Congratulations.

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,220
Good work, sir.

59
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,520
Congratulations.

60
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,960
Thank you, Aunt Mi Ran.

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,460
(YL Group
Extraordinary General Meeting)

62
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,910
Seung Woo.

63
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,410
No, right?

64
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,980
Why did you do that?

65
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,580
Did you forget what I said?

66
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,350
Why weren't you thinking?

67
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,390
Are you telling me
to blindly follow whatever you say?

68
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,090
I'm not an idiot.

69
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,020
I can think for myself.

70
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,200
I made my own judgment
and came to this decision...

71
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
as a shareholder.

72
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,760
I already explained it to you.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,100
- For the business...
- What's the problem...

74
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,340
with me exerting my rights?

75
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,210
I did this for the business, too.

76
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,170
Happy now?

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,540
- Seung Woo.
- I'll protect YL Group,

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,910
so don't worry about it.

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,180
I'm leaving.

80
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,350
Aunt Mi Ran.

81
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,390
Seung Woo and I are
on the same page.

82
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,920
I decided it'd be better...

83
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,760
if Director Hwang
managed the business for YL's sake.

84
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,670
Then, you should've told me first.

85
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,630
Must Seung Woo and I be swayed
by your personal feelings?

86
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,900
You must've
taken after your mother, too.

87
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,010
Don't be so selfish.

88
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,380
Again, I did this for the business.

89
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,600
Mr. Do...

90
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,730
(YL Group
Extraordinary General Meeting)

91
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,040
Seung Woo.

92
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,880
You've done well.

93
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
Jae In must've been disappointed.

94
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,820
You two
would've clashed one day, anyway.

95
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,020
It's better to do this now.

96
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,660
Jae In must've realized
you weren't a pushover.

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,230
I have no hard feelings for her.

98
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,300
It's Mom.

99
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,900
I didn't want that woman...

100
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,570
to control the business
just as she did with my life.

101
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,810
Make sure you don't forget
how you feel right now.

102
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,110
You must become stronger.

103
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,680
Your late father
would want that, too.

104
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,580
Okay.

105
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,840
Congratulations,
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

106
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,540
Thank you. You've done well, too.

107
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,380
Hey, move aside.

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,250
Let me give him a hug, too.

109
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,820
Goodness, my son.

110
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,420
Congratulations.

111
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,520
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

112
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,360
the one whom I gave birth to myself.

113
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,860
Congratulations.

114
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,400
Is this your seat, Mr. Chairman?

115
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,700
Yes, do you want to take a seat?

116
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,100
All right.

117
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,240
Gosh, even the air is different.

118
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,810
Hey, Gi Chan.
Let me take a seat, too.

119
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,350
I need to get your good vibes.

120
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,580
- Ouch.
- Don't bring your bad luck today.

121
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,890
Gi Chan, you cannot step down
from this office.

122
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,920
Make sure you hold onto it.

123
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,790
Yes, I plan to do that.

124
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,360
I quit my job as a prosecutor...

125
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,830
and lived like a servant
to Chairman Kang's family,

126
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,530
only dreaming of this day.

127
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,170
I'm the king of YL Group
from this day on.

128
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,840
You can tell everyone to come at me,

129
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,240
but I, Hwang Gi Chan,
will never step down.

130
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,050
Goodness,
I shouldn't be sitting here.

131
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,450
I should go home
and get the party ready.

132
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,890
Let's pop bottles of champagne
in that huge garden!

133
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,990
So, should I run to my business
and bring some pig's feet?

134
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,490
Is that not enough?
Then, let's buy some meat.

135
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,660
- Yes.
- Should we get some Korean beef?

136
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,580
Eun Ho. Wait.

137
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,320
Eun Ho. Eun Ho?

138
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,950
Eun Ho, it's me, Mommy.

139
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,220
Please open the door, Eun Ho.

140
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,990
Go home, Jae In.

141
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,030
You know you can't come in.

142
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,330
Yu Gyeong, is that you?

143
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,100
Please let me see Eun Ho.

144
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,660
I beg you, Yu Gyeong. Please?

145
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,770
What's with all the noise?

146
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,000
Who's here?

147
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,970
Eun Ho!

148
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,080
Yu Gyeong, please open the door.

149
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,150
Please, Yu Gyeong!

150
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,950
Who's that? Is that Jae In?

151
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,920
Do not open the door for her.

152
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,150
My mom said you couldn't.

153
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,920
Mommy?

154
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,420
- Mommy!
- Eun Ho!

155
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,690
- Mommy!
- Please open the door!

156
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,990
- Mommy!
- You can't go.

157
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,490
- Mommy!
- Eun Ho!

158
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,860
Mommy!

159
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,200
Yu Gyeong!
I'm so not responsible for this.

160
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,770
This is all on you.

161
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey, Eun Ho!

162
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,540
Eun Ho!

163
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,410
Jae In, Na Ra is home.

164
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,280
She might call the police again,

165
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,050
so just see him briefly and go.

166
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,390
Thank you. Where is he?

167
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,690
Is he upstairs?

168
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,160
Mommy!

169
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,520
Goodness, Eun Ho.

170
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,700
I should've come sooner. I'm sorry.

171
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm so sorry.

172
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,310
Don't cry, Mommy.

173
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,610
I'm a brave boy,

174
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,610
so you don't have to worry.

175
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,450
Okay.

176
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,450
Mommy, take this.

177
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,560
Take this,
and don't be sick anymore.

178
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,500
Who opened the door for her?
Who did this?

179
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,700
Mom, it wasn't me. It was Yu Gyeong.

180
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,000
I told you to keep the house safe...

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,300
when you said it was your day off,
but you couldn't even do that?

182
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,870
What are you waiting for?

183
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,240
Take Eun Ho upstairs.

184
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,740
Move aside, Jae In.

185
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,410
Na Ra! No! Eun Ho!

186
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,350
Why are you standing around?
Didn't you hear me?

187
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,080
- Eun Ho! Please stop.
- No, you can't do this.

188
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,950
- Eun Ho!
- Mommy!

189
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,020
Eun Ho!

190
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,290
- Mommy!
- No!

191
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,490
- Mommy!
- Eun Ho!

192
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,860
- Mommy!
- You can't do this, Jae In.

193
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,360
- Mommy!
- Eun Ho, I'll come back for you!

194
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,030
Don't cry, and stay healthy!

195
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,870
- Eun Ho! I love you!
- Goodness.

196
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,630
- My gosh!
- Eun Ho...

197
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,770
Good grief. How heartbreaking.

198
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,410
What a sad day.

199
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,140
I don't want to see you around here,

200
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,240
so get out of my place
before you get dragged out.

201
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,540
Beat it!

202
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,810
What do you want?

203
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,880
So what if you glare at me?

204
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,120
Do you still think you're
the daughter of a rich family?

205
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,850
Know your place.

206
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,460
You have zero power
or connections now. Good grief.

207
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,690
Please take good care of my Eun Ho.

208
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,370
He's my grandson,
so I'll take care of him.

209
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,570
You better be grateful that
I'm putting up with you today...

210
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,270
because my son was
appointed as YL's chairman.

211
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,010
Otherwise, this would've been
the last day of your life.

212
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,410
Get out of here now!

213
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,460
Na Ra!

214
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,760
What's up, Mom?

215
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,090
Bring some salt...

216
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,130
and sprinkle it all around our gate
to cleanse the place.

217
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,530
She was sheer bad luck
on a great day like this.

218
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,440
Hello?

219
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,080
The hotel?

220
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,010
Yes, that's me.

221
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,880
You cannot enter the room...

222
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,150
if you do not pay off the balance
within the day.

223
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,950
All right. I'll pay today.

224
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,570
Jae In, I'd like to see you tonight.

225
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,620
Mommy, take this.

226
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,830
Take this,
and don't be sick anymore.

227
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,900
Have some.

228
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,070
Come on. My arms hurt.

229
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,680
Hey, this is it.

230
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,950
This was the medicine
my mother gave me...

231
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,980
before I went
to the psychiatric hospital.

232
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,960
I really didn't want
to come and ask you.

233
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,300
I didn't want to be
a nuisance again,

234
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,500
but please help me.

235
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,900
I'll find out what it is
and let you know.

236
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,270
Thank you.

237
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,370
Let me make myself clear...

238
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,040
that this is the last time.

239
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,550
Okay.

240
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,660
Hey, I was just about to call you.

241
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,930
She got off work early.

242
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,630
You can come here and have a seat.

243
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,280
As I mentioned before,

244
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,880
I made the decision
for the business.

245
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,110
Please don't be disappointed.

246
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,450
Say what you want to say.

247
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,720
The hotel called, right?

248
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,920
I paid off the balance.

249
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,530
Thanks.

250
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,260
You probably spent
all your assets...

251
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,130
trying to buy
as many shares as you could.

252
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,670
What's your plan now?

253
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,240
You have no money or home.

254
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,540
You'll need both
to bring Eun Ho back.

255
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,740
So, I was thinking,

256
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,680
why don't you sell
all of your shares to me?

257
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,220
I'll pay you more
than the current market value.

258
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,280
What do you say?

259
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,690
I don't understand
why you're suddenly doing this.

260
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,260
Did you make a deal with Gi Chan?
Is that so?

261
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,300
You shouldn't have done this...

262
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,030
if you thought of my dad.

263
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,130
Jae In.

264
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,670
He was my brother
long before he was your father.

265
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll never betray him.

266
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,570
I did this
for the business and Seung Woo.

267
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,810
You just made it more confusing.

268
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,140
I have no reason to explain myself.

269
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,250
Sell your shares to me.

270
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,950
I can't.

271
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,880
My dad left those for me.

272
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,320
I can't touch those
no matter what happens.

273
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,230
If that's your decision,
then I can't force you.

274
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,830
All right.

275
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,760
Take your suitcase and go.

276
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,840
Don't even think
of living off Seung Woo.

277
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,670
I'll find a place and live with him,

278
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,140
and he already agreed.

279
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,820
It seems like things have taken
a weird turn lately.

280
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,460
Tell me about it.

281
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,490
It was odd how the aunt
didn't side with her niece.

282
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,300
Well, I've seen in the news
that affluent families...

283
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,230
don't care about each other.

284
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,630
It's only about money.

285
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,770
I'm home.

286
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,470
- Hey, you're late.
- I am.

287
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,010
I had to go somewhere.

288
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,980
- Have you had dinner?
- I have.

289
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,780
What were you two talking about?

290
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,120
We were talking about
the new chairman of YL Group.

291
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,990
I was thinking
about how scary money was.

292
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,390
Those people don't care about their family
because of money.

293
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,790
In that aspect,
we're a truly happy family.

294
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,060
Family always comes first
before money.

295
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,730
How can anyone be called human
if they prioritize money?

296
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,330
They may look like a human,
but they should be called a beast.

297
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Anyway, I hope that company
either changes its name...

298
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,600
or goes down completely.

299
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,570
My heart breaks
every time I hear it...

300
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,610
because it reminds me of Do Hee.

301
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,140
It will happen.

302
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,250
"What goes around will come around."

303
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,080
That old saying exists for a reason.

304
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,050
You don't have to mind it anymore.

305
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,220
You're right.

306
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,520
I'll only focus on raising Bo Ram
into a wonderful person.

307
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,320
And you two
both need to get married soon.

308
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,030
Gosh, my stomach hurts.
I have to go to the bathroom.

309
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,260
I need to get some rest.

310
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,130
Don't run away like that!

311
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,570
Bring your girlfriends
or go on blind dates...

312
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,830
within the year!

313
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,940
Goodness.

314
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,640
Come on, Gi Chan.

315
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,080
Give me a job there.

316
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,150
Na Ra, you've taken a leave
from the university for years.

317
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,750
You haven't even graduated.

318
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,420
Only those who have
no connection need to graduate.

319
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,220
But my own brother is the chairman.

320
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,950
Good grief, kid.

321
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,960
Fine. I'll find out
if there's an open position.

322
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,190
All right!

323
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,430
It's a promise, okay?

324
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,160
I'll go celebrate with my friends.

325
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,060
Goodness, that idiot.

326
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,100
So,

327
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
this punk became the chairman...

328
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,040
instead of my daughter, Kang Jae In?

329
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,740
Yes, the public responded positively
because the business...

330
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,650
no longer stayed in the family...

331
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,610
and gave a fair chance
to the best performer,

332
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,050
deeming it as the beginning
of its professional management.

333
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,760
("Hwang Gi Chan Appointed
as the New Chairman of YL Group")

334
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,840
Do you have an appointment?

335
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,770
Yes, I'm here to celebrate
with the chairman.

336
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,210
Who are you?

337
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,540
- I know him very well.
- No, you can't.

338
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,240
Please don't do this. Just leave...

339
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,340
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan!

340
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,250
Congratulations on your appointment.

341
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,020
You reached the very top in no time.

342
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,380
You're an amazing man.

343
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,250
Is Gi Man doing well?

344
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,530
I thought
we never had to meet again.

345
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,830
Don't be so cold. We're accomplices.

346
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,670
That's disappointing, Mr. Chairman.

347
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,130
I stopped by today
to celebrate your success.

348
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,740
I don't mean anything else by it.

349
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,010
Please remember me
if there's a job you can't do yourself.

350
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,910
I came to ask you
to call me when that happens.

351
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,510
Does it look like...

352
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,250
I have time on my hands
to deal with someone like you?

353
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,550
I won't have to see you again,
so get out.

354
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,560
That's what they all say
in the beginning.

355
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,560
However, the higher up you go,

356
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,890
the more dirty work
you'll have to do.

357
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,730
Light and shadow.

358
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,460
The crocodile
and the crocodile bird.

359
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,900
Wouldn't it be wonderful to keep
this win-win relationship?

360
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,340
Let's eat lunch...

361
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,370
You had a guest.

362
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,680
He was just leaving.

363
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,840
We're done talking, so please leave.

364
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,710
Yes, I'll see you next time.

365
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,710
Hello.

366
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,550
If you need to get
a hard or difficult job done,

367
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,720
please give me a call.

368
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,560
Who was that?

369
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,730
Nobody.

370
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,860
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

371
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,750
It was a classic
home title fraud for a lease.

372
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,210
There are a number of victims.

373
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,850
Even if we catch the culprit,

374
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,850
it won't be easy
for you to get the money back.

375
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,620
- A bottle of soju, please.
- Sure.

376
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,730
(Seung Woo)

377
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,030
Don't even think
of living off Seung Woo.

378
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,030
- Uncle Do Yun.
- Yes?

379
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,160
Let's hang out.

380
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,160
Let me get changed first.

381
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,200
Then, should we ride our bikes
at the playground?

382
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,300
Okay.

383
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,370
Hey, what's up?

384
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,180
You found out
the drug's constituents?

385
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,080
Eun Ho.

386
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,120
Hwang Eun Ho.

387
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,290
Eun Ho.

388
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,900
My son.

389
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,570
Eun Ho...

390
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,410
Ma'am, someone's calling you.

391
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,770
Ma'am.

392
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,280
Hello?

393
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,030
Jae In.

394
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,070
Wake up, Jae In.

395
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,540
Eun Ho...

396
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,270
Mommy's sorry.

397
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,510
Eun Ho, I'm sorry...

398
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,960
Is that you, Oh Seong?

399
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:10,260
My gosh. Who's that lady?

400
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,030
Can you get the door
to the smaller room?

401
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,600
Right. Okay.

402
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,480
Dad.

403
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,190
Please help me.

404
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,090
Dad...

405
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,010
What happened?

406
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,550
Did she drink with you?

407
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,610
No.

408
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,580
We met to talk about something,

409
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,050
but she was too drunk,

410
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,420
and I didn't want
to take her to a hotel.

411
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,190
She drank alone
until she passed out like that?

412
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,590
She must've had a reason.

413
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,230
What happened?

414
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,660
It didn't seem like a good thing.

415
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,760
Do you know her well?

416
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,470
No.

417
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,600
We met by coincidence.

418
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,240
I know her a little, too.

419
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,380
How do you know her?

420
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,650
She was the same young lady
who helped me...

421
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,810
out on the street.

422
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,380
I was surprised
that you brought her home.

423
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,650
I even thought
of setting you up with her.

424
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,620
Come on out! Let's eat breakfast.

425
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,220
Who's in that room?
Why won't you even let me in?

426
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,560
Will you be quiet? She'll wake up.

427
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,530
You're up.

428
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,540
You remember me, right?

429
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,640
It's you, Ms. Kang.

430
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,070
Goodness, it's you, Bo Ram.

431
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,740
Hello.

432
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,950
Who's that woman?
Why was she in the small room?

433
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,950
Is she your girlfriend?

434
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,750
Hey, man.
You said you weren't dating anyone.

435
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,020
What happened?

436
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,390
Let's catch up later.

437
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,720
You should
relieve your hangover first.

438
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,930
I made some bean sprout soup.
Have a seat.

439
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,730
Right.

440
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,540
I'm so sorry
for the nuisance I caused.

441
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,140
Don't be sorry.

442
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,340
I guess
we must've been meant to meet.

443
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,410
Have some.

444
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,420
Don't make her feel uncomfortable.

445
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,990
You should stop staring
and let her eat.

446
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,320
Yes, right.

447
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,560
- Please take your time.
- Okay.

448
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,660
My suitcase.

449
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,830
It's in my car.

450
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,870
Right. I see.

451
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,370
Your suitcase?

452
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,840
Are you traveling somewhere?

453
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,310
No, some things happened,

454
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,080
so I have to look
for a place to stay.

455
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,850
It's not so easy
to find a place these days.

456
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,720
Well, if she wants to find one,
she'll find it.

457
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,890
That hurts.
Why do you keep pinching me?

458
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,720
Just eat your food.

459
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,690
Are your parents not with you...

460
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,400
if you had to look for a place?

461
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,860
What about your siblings?

462
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,000
Mom.

463
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,470
Yes, right. I was prying too much.

464
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,110
I'm just too old-fashioned.
Please understand.

465
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,140
Okay.

466
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,270
You should eat.

467
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,180
- Let's eat, everyone.
- Okay.

468
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,780
Gosh, it's been a while
since we had bean sprout soup.

469
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,350
Here. Try this.

470
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,820
What do you want?

471
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,980
- This one?
- You should try this, too.

472
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,550
It's seasoned perfectly.

473
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,870
You had been taking...

474
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,500
sleeping pills.

475
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,310
And it's an addictive
and powerful one,

476
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,240
so most hospitals
don't prescribe that.

477
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,780
So, if I took this
after every single meal...

478
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,420
You would've overdosed.

479
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,490
The side effects
must've been severe.

480
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,330
Not only will it make you sleepy
and degrade your consciousness,

481
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,660
but it can do worse
and cause memory impairment...

482
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,030
or even delirium.

483
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,320
Mr. Hottie...

484
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,420
Here's another person
who should've been in jail.

485
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,030
Yes, I also think so...

486
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,400
Ms. Noh Sook Ja.

487
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,840
What are you doing here?

488
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,570
And what now? "Ms. Noh Sook Ja?"

489
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,670
Yes, Ms. Noh Sook Ja.

490
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,510
We're strangers now.

491
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,440
Wouldn't it be odd
if I called you my mother?

492
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,010
Where are your manners?

493
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,020
You're still mentally unwell.

494
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,190
You need to get the facts straight.

495
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,860
I know you made me...

496
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,760
overdose on sleeping pills
to shut me up in that hospital.

497
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,130
I don't know
what you're talking about.

498
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,760
You were the one
who gave me those pills.

499
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,900
Yes, it was just as you said.

500
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,560
All I did was give those to you.

501
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm an uneducated woman.

502
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,230
How would I get...

503
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,770
so many sleeping pills
and give those to you?

504
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,170
I was told to give it to you,
so I did. That was all.

505
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,270
Who told you to give it to me?

506
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,740
Yu Gyeong. Your sister-in-law.

507
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,980
She gave me those pills.

508
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,760
That's the drug
Mother had been feeding me.

509
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,530
Can you take a look?

510
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,770
I don't know what it is
just by looking at it.

511
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,440
Is that so?

512
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,090
Do you know what it is now?

513
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,130
It's such a powerful sleeping agent,

514
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,560
so I hear most hospitals
don't prescribe that.

515
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,000
How can...

516
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,270
How can you, of all people,
give me this?

517
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,940
I don't know who told you what,

518
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,510
but Mother asked me to get it,
so I just got her the drug.

519
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,740
That woman said
you gave those to her to give to me.

520
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,810
Don't you know what she's like?

521
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,710
Would she give it to you
just because I told her to?

522
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,910
You already know...

523
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,920
that I have no power in that family.

524
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,220
I just got the drug as she wanted.
That was all.

525
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,890
I didn't know
she'd use it to do that to you.

526
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,020
What about the relationship
between Gi Chan and Se Ri?

527
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,030
Did you really find that out
much later?

528
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,160
- That's...
- Yu Gyeong.

529
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,270
I'm very disappointed in you.

530
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,340
I did my best for you.

531
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,610
I told you
not to get too close to Se Ri,

532
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,270
and I gave my warning to her, too.

533
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,580
I made myself clear.

534
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,110
You caused your misfortune,
and it's yours to deal with.

535
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,950
Do not put the blame on me.

536
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,550
I never did.

537
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,450
Because I don't plan to drown...

538
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,790
in self-pity and misfortune.

539
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,520
I think you're blaming others,

540
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,530
intoxicated by your unhappiness.

541
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,510
Let's go out on a date and shop.

542
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,180
My son.

543
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,110
Let me see you.

544
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,720
Are you all right?

545
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,450
Yes, I'm fine. What's wrong?

546
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,350
It's Kang Jae In, that crazy girl.

547
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,560
She came to me and made a scene...

548
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,320
about how I gave her that drug,

549
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,130
and then she told me to run here
if I wanted to save you.

550
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,830
I came running...

551
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,330
because I thought
that evil girl might pull your hair out.

552
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,040
My audience is all here.

553
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,640
Ms. Kang Se Ri.

554
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,680
You're under arrest
for attempting to kill Hwang Gi Chan.

555
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,860
(Queen's House)

556
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,270
Jae In knows everything.

557
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,400
What do I do? I mean the drug.

558
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,340
She came and had a go at me...

559
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,940
after finding out I prescribed it.

560
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,710
Why don't you stay here
until you find another place?

561
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,340
No one's using that room.

562
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,750
I don't know the whole story,
but you have nowhere else to go.

563
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,650
Why would I be happy
to have a stranger at home?

564
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:34,050
You said
helping someone in need was...

565
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,750
good karma for our family.

566
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,550
She might be a guest Do Hee sent us.

567
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,020
A scumbag like you...

568
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,230
cannot take my dad's position.

569
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,230
Don't you want to know
how I'll reveal everything?

570
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,900
Look forward to it.
