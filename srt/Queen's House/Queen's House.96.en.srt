00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,890
Dad, the book, please.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,320
Dad?

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,230
Are you sick?

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,800
If you're sick,
you have to take medicine.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,430
Medicine is bitter, so have this.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,070
Have some candy,
and it won't be bitter at all.

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,210
Ji Ho.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,510
Yes?

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,320
Here.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,290
Oh, right.
I should give one to Uncle too.

This blank minus this blank.

19
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,960
What does that even mean?

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,760
Mom!

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,870
Oh, hey, Ji Ho.

22
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,800
I need to talk to your dad now,
so let's talk later.

23
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,540
Dad's in his study.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,920
This is no time
for you to be acting like this.

25
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,690
How long will you mope around
and skip work?

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,890
Kang Mi Ran is up to something.

27
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,090
The board of directors
seems to be meeting frequently.

28
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,460
And it looks like
Kang Jae In keeps joining them.

29
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,200
Something's up.

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,570
They're hell-bent
on dragging you down.

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,040
If I were still a team leader,
I could attend their meetings...

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,010
and get some information.

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,710
This is no time
for you to be relaxing.

34
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,210
Contact the board members now,
see what's happening, and act.

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,850
Are you even listening to me?

36
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,360
Shouldn't you be figuring out
what to do?

37
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,570
(Designer Kang Jae In)

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Come in.

39
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,080
What? You haven't left yet?

40
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,680
I'm about to.

41
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,280
I saw the light was on,
so I came in to see who it was.

42
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,790
I'll be leaving soon too.

43
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,120
Let's go together, then.
I'll give you a ride.

44
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,790
Do Yun said he'd give me a ride
since he's heading my way.

45
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,170
By the way, about that woman,
Kang Se Ri...

46
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,240
Remember when she got a new laptop
and dared you to look, not sneak?

47
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,640
What's on it?

48
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,410
H and K Company's double contract.

49
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,780
The one Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee
was probing before the accident?

50
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,650
That's right.

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,990
Since Kang Se Ri is Catherine,
the CEO of H and K Company,

52
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,660
there must be a YL Group contract,
so I went through her laptop.

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Oh, so did you find it?

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,830
I found it, but Kang Se Ri caught me
before I could get it.

55
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,970
Now she knows we're looking for it,
she must have hidden it even better.

56
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,810
Probably.

57
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,010
We'll have to find another way.

58
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,920
- Oh, you fold them so well.
- Thank you.

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,560
Hey, Mi Ran bought some clothes
for you.

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,970
Tell her to stop buying
and sending me things.

61
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,240
Come on.
The misunderstanding's cleared up,

62
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,310
and you know about Seung Woo now.

63
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,080
Can't you open your heart to her,
just a little bit?

64
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,350
You were adrift for nearly 30 years.

65
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,850
Watching you fall apart,
watching you drift aimlessly,

66
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,450
that's how long I've spent
worrying sick about you.

67
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,090
I know.

68
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,730
I know I've made you suffer so much.

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,090
If you know that, don't bring me
these things again.

70
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,200
If gifts were enough to forgive her,
none of this would have happened.

71
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,440
All right, I get it.

72
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,740
Are you and Little Grandpa fighting?

73
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,080
Fighting? Of course not.

74
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,280
Your little grandpa is
Grandma's little brother.

75
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,220
I was just nagging him a little
because I was worried, okay?

76
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,890
That's right, Bo Ram.
Nagging out of love.

77
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,790
Goodness, Bo Ram. You're doing great
folding the laundry!

78
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,300
Here, give them to me.

79
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,840
Do you remember this?

80
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,600
The one you told Ji Ho
to give to me.

81
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,540
This isn't my handwriting.

82
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,580
This is a grown-up's handwriting.

83
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
Take a closer look.

84
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,980
It's your handwriting
from before you got hurt.

85
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,790
"If something happens to me,
it's Kang Se Ri's doing."

86
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,390
Kang Se Ri is your wife, isn't she?
Ji Ho's mom.

87
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,060
That's all I know.

88
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,730
Okay.

89
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Listen.

90
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,830
What I just showed you is a secret.

91
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,740
Don't tell anyone. Got it?

92
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,870
I'm a grown-up,
so I keep my promises.

93
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,580
I have to find out if Kang Se Ri
is the one who hurt you.

94
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,510
Until then, I have to keep her close
so she doesn't try anything funny.

95
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,570
Heading to work?

96
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,140
- Yes.
- It's the right call.

97
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,700
You have to show Kang Mi Ran
and DH Holdings...

98
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,810
that they can't just take
your place from you.

99
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,510
YL Group is yours,
not anyone else's.

100
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,450
Mom said she's going to eat later.

101
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,560
Gi Chan, you should go calm her.
You know how Mom is.

102
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,870
Before I take the items
to the gallery for appraisal today,

103
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,770
let me check the inventory list.
Would that be all right?

104
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,710
Of course. I'll arrange it for you.

105
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,190
Hwang Ji Ho, how old are you?

106
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,020
You're seven years old,

107
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
and you can't even pick up
a side dish?

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,260
After all this time,
you still can't use chopsticks?

109
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,100
Don't.

110
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,430
Try again.

111
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,610
Who do you take after that you can't
even use chopsticks?

112
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,980
What are you talking about?
He takes after you or Se Ri.

113
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,380
He's your son, isn't he?

114
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,420
He's just nervous.

115
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,520
Why are you being like this?
It's not like you.

116
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,430
I apologize.

117
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,000
He doesn't deserve
to be treated like that.

118
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,380
Aren't all children precious?

119
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,780
You seem to be upset
about something,

120
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,650
but I believe you're taking it out
on the wrong person.

121
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,090
Just finish your meal.

122
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,700
What about the sincerity
you were going to show me?

123
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,700
Where did you throw it away?

124
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,310
You said you'd turn yourself in.

125
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,480
You said you'd prove it.

126
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,610
I wasn't in my right mind
when I said that.

127
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,820
You said you don't believe in
empty promises,

128
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,650
but it looks like you did.

129
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,620
You've been fooled this whole time
and didn't even realize it.

130
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,660
Kang Jae In.

131
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,930
Don't trust me too much.

132
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,230
You jerk.

133
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,570
I still had a sliver of hope.

134
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,500
You really are a piece of trash,
after all.

135
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,210
I'll be throwing you in the trash
soon enough, so just you wait.

136
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,640
My sister and Teo. Don't you think
they're a good match?

137
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,610
They seem really
into each other, right?

138
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm not so sure.

139
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,850
Oh, you couldn't tell?

140
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,580
I have a knack for these things.
Not just anyone can be a Cupid.

141
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,220
To really hook them up for sure,
I need to get them alone again.

142
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,290
Now, where should I have them meet?

143
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,570
Chef Hong Baek has an award-winning
restaurant in Seonwon-dong.

144
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,870
- Should I book a table for them?
- Cupid.

145
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,540
Let's just stop.

146
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,440
It's because I like Jae In.

147
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
What?

148
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,680
My sister?

149
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,660
Is something wrong?

150
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,660
It's because of Hwang Gi Chan.

151
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,560
He told me a while ago
he was going to turn himself in.

152
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,930
He sounded sincere,
but I guess I was mistaken.

153
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,700
I ran into him a moment ago,
and he was so smug, acting innocent.

154
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,910
That's the kind of person
he's always been.

155
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,040
People don't change that easily.

156
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,050
You're right.

157
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,680
I regret ever believing him,
even for a moment.

158
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,120
All that's left is to take him down.
Just hang in there a little longer.

159
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,990
(Princess)

160
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,430
Does Hwang Gi Man
still come by often?

161
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,700
I've told him a few times,

162
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,470
but he keeps coming back
with one excuse or another.

163
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,140
You know he's not well anymore.

164
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,520
All I can think about is
how much my daughter suffered.

165
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,820
It wasn't enough
that he laid a hand on you,

166
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,720
but they ganged up
and humiliated you,

167
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,160
and even hid his infertility.

168
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,530
Even now, thinking of those people
makes my blood boil.

169
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,830
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,900
Instead of enduring it
for your sake,

171
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,670
I should have gotten out sooner.

172
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,950
Yu Gyeong, I told you
to only think of yourself.

173
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,150
How you're going to get away
from that house and Hwang Gi Man...

174
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,420
is all you should think about.

175
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,090
Just because he isn't all there,

176
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,230
doesn't mean you have any obligation
to put up with him.

177
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,860
I guess
I subconsciously felt responsible...

178
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,500
for his condition.

179
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,870
That's also why I couldn't
bring myself to be harsh with him.

180
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,110
You did more than enough
living with that jerk Hwang Gi Man.

181
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,340
No matter how pitiful he seems,
don't give in.

182
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,250
It's important to draw a clear line,
especially now.

183
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Okay.

184
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,090
I did sit him down
and had a serious talk recently.

185
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,760
But if he comes again,

186
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,690
I'll ask his siblings,
whom I can talk to,

187
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,290
to keep him away.

188
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Good.

189
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,230
To me, that jerk Hwang Gi Man...

190
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,700
is nothing but a parasite who fed
on my precious daughter's life.

191
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,910
Don't keep sacrificing and suffering
for a guy like that.

192
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,950
I won't. Don't worry.

195
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,170
Please let me grow up fast
so I can meet my princess.

196
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,580
Mom, I'm heading home now.
I'll be there soon.

197
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,710
Yes?

198
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,850
Jae In,
there's a board meeting soon,

199
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,850
- and I think you should join us.
- Me too?

200
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,060
They want you to be there.
They want to discuss next steps,

201
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,200
and they want to hear
your position directly.

202
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,960
Do you have other plans?

203
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,870
It's my mom's hospital appointment,
and I promised I would go with her.

204
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,840
My dad has work today too.

205
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,140
I can take her.

206
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,380
You can?

207
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
Yes, I'm free today. I'll go.

208
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,620
Would you? Thank you so much.

209
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,330
You left in high spirits.
Why are you back so defeated?

210
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
Mom.

211
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
Was I a parasite?

212
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,910
What? What are you talking about?

213
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,640
Did I hurt the person I loved?

214
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,510
Where did you hear that nonsense?
Who told you that?

215
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,450
You're not denying it.

216
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,520
So I guess I am a parasite.

217
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,560
I must have been horrible.

218
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,790
What's getting into you? Who was it?

219
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,230
Who called you a parasite?

220
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,560
I don't know. I'm not saying.

221
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,800
Was it that Yu Gyeong?
Did she call you a parasite?

222
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,600
Tell me. I'll go over there...

223
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,340
and make her regret
she ever said that word.

224
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,410
Don't touch my princess!
I don't want to be a parasite.

225
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,910
I hate you, Mom.

226
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,980
I can't tell if he's sane or not.
He'll be the death of me.

227
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,960
Thanks to you,
I had an easy trip to the hospital.

228
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,890
Please go in and get some rest.
I'll be on my way.

229
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,170
Drop dead, Choi Ja Young!

230
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,310

231
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,110
You con artist!

232
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,380
You got duped like an idiot.
Who are you taking it out on?

233
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,280
Because of you,
I was made to look like a fool!

234
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,060
I just did what I was told.
But why did you only report me?

235
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,290
Are you all right?

236
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,930
We staked out on Kim Do Yun's tip.
I had my doubts, but...

237
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,200
And we finally caught him here.

238
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,100
We'll bring him in to get the truth,
so don't you worry.

239
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,170
Go!

240
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,180
Are you okay?
You must have been terrified.

241
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,750
Thank you for your help.

242
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,250
Thank you.

243
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,060
Thank you.

244
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,060
Gosh, this looks delicious!

245
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,000
Hey, give me some of that.
Don't eat it all by yourself.

246
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,030
Let's eat!

247
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,400
Ji Ho, what would you like?
How about some sausage?

248
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,070
You're not that pretty, Na Ra.
This will make you pretty.

249
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,270
Oh, give me some of that.

250
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,880
Gosh, Mom, slow down.
No one's going to take it from you.

251
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm just trying to get my fill
before Gi Chan gets here.

252
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,830
A son is a son
until he takes a wife.

253
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,700
I knew what to expect from that one,
but I thought Gi Chan was different.

254
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,370
Ever since he was a kid,
he'd believe and do whatever I said.

255
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,970
He would've believed me
if I told him pigs could fly.

256
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,940
You reap what you sow.

257

What's that supposed to mean?

258
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,110
I don't know.
It just popped into my head.

259
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,150
Was I a bad guy as an adult?
Wasn't I a good adult?

260
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,120
Oh, Gi Man.
You can be a good adult from now on.

261
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,330
Ji Ho, if using chopsticks is hard,
do you want a fork?

262
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,630
No.
I'll get good at this for my dad.

263
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,840
And what for?

264
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,710
Dad likes it when I do a good job.

265
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,140
Look at the dutiful son.

266
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,550
You all could learn a thing or two
from him!

267
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,450

We have a dutiful son!

268
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,390
I'm good at this! I'm a dutiful son!

269
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,920
Oh, you're such a good boy.

270
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,460
You're doing great.

271
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,130

272
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,400
Eat this too. Here.
Try picking this one up.

273
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,630
Mom, I'm a dutiful son too.

274
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,630
Yes, you're a dutiful son.
Such a dutiful son.

275
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,270
You're good enough
to show your dad now.

276
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,040
You're getting so good
with the chopsticks.

277
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,880
If you're testing my patience,
I've got zero.

278
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,850
I told you I needed more time.

279
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,710
And I did give you time. Didn't I?

280
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,680
Asking for more would be cheating.

281
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,550
It's not like I'm going to be
in Korea forever,

282
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,790
so from now on,
I'll handle things my way.

283
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,860
Are you threatening
to expose everything?

284
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,790
If you're so scared,
then you should confess first.

285
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,780
Teo actually brought a gift
for Ji Ho.

286
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,480
I was just about to leave it here
and go down for dinner.

287
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,680
You need to have dinner too, right?

288
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,620
I don't have an appetite.

289
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,960
Please, go have dinner.

290

Just 3 days. Exactly 3 days, okay?

291
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,850
Jae In bought this for you, Mom.
She got it shopping for her mom.

292
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,580
Jae In did?

293
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,650
That's so thoughtful of her.

294
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,020
She heard you've been having aches
and pains lately.

295
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
And high-frequency therapy is good
for relieving pain.

296
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,200
Actually, I've been needing
something like this.

297
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,570
It's really easy to use too.

298
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,340
Oh, this is amazing.
The footpads aren't hot,

299
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,540
but I can feel my whole body
warming up.

300
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,520
Thank you, Do Yun.

301
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,490
Oh, Do Yun, if it weren't for you,
I don't know what I would've done.

302
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,860

and Attorney Seo was arrested.

Hwang Gi Chan will have no way out.

304
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,770
All right.
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

Mom, are you okay?

306
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,650
You must have been
really shaken up today.

307
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,120
Shaken up? Of course not.

308

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,200
Yes. She's asleep.

310
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,670
I wonder if she'll like
her birthday present.

311
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,870
That husband of mine...

312
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,240
He even said he built this house
with Jae In in mind,

313
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,340
but to think he'd even
make a miniature house...

314
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,210
Who would have guessed?

315
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,990
I can't believe how he made it look
exactly the same.

316
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,560
Auntie, did you see it?

317
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,560
He said he made it himself,
you know.

318
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,560
I'm not just saying this
because he's your brother,

319
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,370
but if you really look at him,
he's a very thoughtful person.

320
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,770
Auntie, if you do start dating,
find a man just like him.

321
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,480
I will.

When we had to suddenly move out
of the Changpyeong-dong house,

344
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,130
I stored all of our things
in this warehouse.

Nothing over here. Any luck there?

Jae In.

347
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,760
I found it.

348
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,670
The one that was written
in the notebook.

349
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,940

Dad.

357
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,260
Because of you, Dad...

358
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,330
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

The meaning behind his last words,
and the inheritance he left you...

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,970
I'm so genuinely happy
you found them all. Congratulations.

00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,880
Thank you.

Why don't you just give it to me
in person?

374
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,590
Give you what?

375
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:12,060

and lost,

390
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,870
I think back to the beginning.

Our internal audit shows that
besides the Louis B project,

420
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,460
both before and after
his appointment as chairman,

421
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,530
he has committed countless acts...

422
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,200
of corruption.

423
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,740

circumstantial evidence...

424
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,970
as proof, are you?

425
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,440
Of course not.

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,510
You don't think I'd
hunt a viper bare-handed, do you?

427
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,850
Just in case you thought you could
squirm your way out,

428
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,320
it took some effort to narrow down
the overwhelming amount of evidence.

when I was blinded,

437
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,550
but now that all my desperation
is gone,

438
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,990
I can see everything clearly,
as if a fog has lifted.

439

Only now can I see everything.

The first to discover this truth
and launch an investigation,

441
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,100
