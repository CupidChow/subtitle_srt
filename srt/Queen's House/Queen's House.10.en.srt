00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:02,823
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:16,643
- Mom. - You got home early.

3
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:19,083
Do Yun, can you give this a taste?

4
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:21,553
I keep putting in more salt, but it still tastes bland.

5
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:27,393
It's a bit salty.

6
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:29,323
- It is? - Yes.

7
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:30,623
I didn't think so.

8
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:38,163
Why didn't you spit it out?

9
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:42,303
What now? These are all too salty.

10
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:44,873
I'll throw everything out.

11
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:47,673
Just leave them. I'll eat everything.

12
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:51,013
Stop talking nonsense. It's all right.

13
00:00:58,523 --> 00:00:59,993
What did the police say?

14
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,023
Were they unable to catch the culprit yet?

15
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,263
No.

16
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:07,633
We put up signs and gave out flyers, so let's give it some time.

17
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,933
We might find a witness.

18
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:11,863
What's this?

19
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:13,703
Was this delivered here?

20
00:01:14,503 --> 00:01:16,803
Yes, it was left in front of the door.

21
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,073
Isn't it yours?

22
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:30,283
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

23
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,753
(I hope this helps with the investigation.)

24
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:13,693
Something came up, so I have to go out for a minute.

25
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:17,033
- Be careful out there. - Okay.

26
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:23,843
I should clean this up.

27
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:49,663
What's with you two?

28
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:52,363
Who do you think you took after...

29
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:54,273
and were born with those pretty faces?

30
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:57,073
- Who? - Your DNA is...

31
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,713
all right in here.

32
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:06,083
I've never been happier, Mom.

33
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:08,113
I'm having fun raising Bo Ram,

34
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:09,613
and I'm content with my job.

35
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,053
I'll also continue to study...

36
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:13,123
and earn my master's degree and even Ph. D.

37
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,093
Different flowers bloom...

38
00:03:17,493 --> 00:03:19,323
in spring, summer, fall, and winter.

39
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,563
Just like that, people all have different primes.

40
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,933
I know I'll see my glory days, too.

41
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:25,903
Just wait and see.

42
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,483
Yun Hee!

43
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,313
Hey, Yun Hee.

44
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:42,783
Goodness, Oh Seong.

45
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:44,723
Yes, Yun Hee. It's me, Oh Seong.

46
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,853
I'm sorry I came late.

47
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,023
I came as soon as I heard the news,

48
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:51,023
but it wasn't easy to travel from the middle of the ocean.

49
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,293
We said goodbye to Do Hee.

50
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,463
I should've been here.

51
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,803
She passed away on her birthday...

52
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,203
before she had a chance to eat her birthday meal or cake.

53
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:08,043
Bo Ram waited for her the whole day,

54
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:09,313
but they didn't get to meet.

55
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:11,813
Oh Seong.

56
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:14,953
Do Hee must be in a good place now, right?

57
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:16,783
She was a good girl.

58
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:19,953
Of course. Your husband must've come to meet her.

59
00:04:24,593 --> 00:04:27,063
She passed away before she saw her glory days.

60
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:29,903
That really bothers me.

61
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:33,103
It keeps bothering me.

62
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,203
And your brother-in-law is too harsh.

63
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:40,913
He made me raise two kids all alone,

64
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,743
so why did he take one from me so soon?

65
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:44,813
That awful man.

66
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:46,683
Are you all right, Yun Hee?

67
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:52,283
I have a lot to do, so I need to pull myself together.

68
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,593
Goodness.

69
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:56,893
I must have an upset stomach.

70
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,633
I feel really stifled right here.

71
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,433
I should take some digestive medicine.

72
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,973
Hey, take a seat, Yun Hee.

73
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:10,173
What's up?

74
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:13,343
You need to cry.

75
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:17,543
- What? - You probably didn't get to cry,

76
00:05:17,683 --> 00:05:19,613
trying to look after Do Yun and Bo Ram.

77
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:23,053
Back when our parents passed away when we were still young,

78
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:25,353
you didn't get a chance to cry, trying to look after me.

79
00:05:25,623 --> 00:05:27,393
It was the same when your husband passed away.

80
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,123
I used to rely on you,

81
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:31,323
but it's the other way around now.

82
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,763
You can lean on me.

83
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,063
What are you waiting for? Just cry your heart out.

84
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:54,083
Do Hee...

85
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:00,623
Do Hee...

86
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:05,593
Do Hee...

87
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:10,363
My girl...

88
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,103
My girl, don't go.

89
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,613
My Do Hee...

90
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:25,443
My Do Hee...

91
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,753
You're under arrest...

92
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:30,983
for a fatal hit-and-run accident, subject to aggravated punishment,

93
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,753
resulting in Kim Do Hee's death.

94
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,223
Take him away.

95
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:41,793
What are you doing right now?

96
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,103
Gi Chan.

97
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:46,003
We'll talk at the police station.

98
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,143
I didn't kill her!

99
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:52,603
Do something, Gi Chan!

100
00:06:52,843 --> 00:06:53,973
I didn't do it!

101
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:55,843
I didn't...

102
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,783
(Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)

103
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,053
Gyu Cheol, this is bad.

104
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:07,793
Seung Woo got arrested.

105
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,523
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:11,293
I have no idea, either.

107
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:13,293
Detectives just came and took him away.

108
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:18,303
Summon Director Hwang immediately.

109
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:25,043
Seung Woo caused a hit-and-run accident?

110
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:26,973
I'm not sure.

111
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:30,043
We'll know for sure after the investigation ends.

112
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:33,583
Make sure you keep the employees quiet.

113
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,583
Look into this and find out what's going on.

114
00:07:36,853 --> 00:07:37,923
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,423
Shouldn't we share this with Mother?

116
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,023
Call her, but don't tell her anything.

117
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:48,163
Tell her to come home immediately.

118
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,173
What is it? Why did you suddenly need me here?

119
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,113
Don't be alarmed at what I'm about to say.

120
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:06,083
It's Seung Woo.

121
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:10,783
He's at the police station right now.

122
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,993
Seung Woo is there?

123
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:16,963
Why?

124
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:21,063
So you called the chauffeur service and went home?

125
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,993
- Is that so? - Yes.

126
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,733
I'm telling you.

127
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:26,673
And exactly what time was it?

128
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:29,473
Don't you know what it's like?

129
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,673
How would I know the time after I get hammered?

130
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,413
Why did you recently get a new car?

131
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:40,283
I told you. My mom gave it to me as a present.

132
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:42,883
You're driving me crazy!

133
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,983
How many times do you have to ask the same question?

134
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:46,693
What did you do with the previous car?

135
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:49,153
Do you have evidence...

136
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:51,563
that I caused the hit-and-run accident?

137
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,593
Stop blaming the innocent.

138
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,103
Do you know who my father is?

139
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:02,003
He's the chairman of YL Group!

140
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,183
Please check the license plate number.

141
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:17,053
(59 M 2840)

142
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:21,153
It could've been the chauffeur service driver.

143
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:23,693
The driver was driving another car at this hour.

144
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,223
We already confirmed that.

145
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,863
We also found out that your car had already been demolished.

146
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,193
Did you know...

147
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,663
you could face worse punishment for destroying evidence?

148
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:32,763
Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

149
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:35,033
It's not too late to tell the truth.

150
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,633
You knew about it, didn't you?

151
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:40,743
You knew you were the driver who hit and killed...

152
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:43,843
Ms. Kim Do Hee, didn't you?

153
00:09:49,413 --> 00:09:50,523
Yu Gyeong.

154
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:53,923
You didn't have to come.

155
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:55,153
We could've just met there.

156
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:58,263
You were on my way there, and I had to do something, too.

157
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,233
I never got to thank the doctor...

158
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,733
who helped Eun Ho.

159
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,803
- Do you want to give him a present? - Yes.

160
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:08,333
I'll come out quickly after I drop this off.

161
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:10,873
Hello, I...

162
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:12,103
I'm sorry. Next time.

163
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:14,373
Did you catch them?

164
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:15,813
Later.

165
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:21,783
Is something urgent going on?

166
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:23,453
Catch who?

167
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:27,253
It's his privacy. Let's go.

168
00:10:27,953 --> 00:10:29,023
Okay.

169
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:35,733
(Celebrating your grand opening, YL Group Director Hwang Gi Chan)

170
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,733
Hey, Aunt Mi Ran.

171
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:43,703
I'm visiting my in-laws for an occasion.

172
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,103
Gi Chan? I haven't talked to him.

173
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,213
What is it?

174
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,313
I have to go right now.

175
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:58,853
Yu Gyeong, please tell Mother that I apologized.

176
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,083
What's going on?

177
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:02,123
I'll tell you later. Please do that.

178
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:08,163
Mom, don't you think this is too much?

179
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,233
You said I was the owner.

180
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,863
You can be the main cook and the owner.

181
00:11:12,863 --> 00:11:14,133
They're both leaders, after all.

182
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,073
The main chef, the owner.

183
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,503
It'd look really cool if you came out...

184
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,843
with a customer's order in that outfit.

185
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,843
But still, Mom!

186
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:23,943
Sto!

187
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:25,613
I'm not your mother here. Call me the chairwoman.

188
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:28,883
Mom, it's stop, not sto.

189
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:31,683
It's the opposite of go, stop.

190
00:11:32,923 --> 00:11:34,053
Stop.

191
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:35,393
Great job, Mom.

192
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:36,693
You have a killer pronunciation.

193
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,793
Don't use the word killer.

194
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:41,263
You'll be the daughter-in-law of an affluent family soon.

195
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,793
Speak with more class.

196
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:44,463
Okay. Mom.

197
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,503
It was very good!

198
00:11:48,273 --> 00:11:50,943
See? That was wonderful. And you have a good pronunciation.

199
00:11:54,143 --> 00:11:55,273
I'm here.

200
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:58,313
- Congrats on your grand opening. - Thanks.

201
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:02,713
You got something that didn't suit your size.

202
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:04,653
Why did you bring that tiny plant to celebrate?

203
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,323
It's from Jae In.

204
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:09,393
I'll celebrate with cash.

205
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:12,823
So, that was from Jae In?

206
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:16,063
I knew it looked expensive, although it was tiny.

207
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,833
Why isn't she coming in?

208
00:12:18,963 --> 00:12:20,033
She left.

209
00:12:20,603 --> 00:12:21,673
She left?

210
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:22,833
Something came up at home,

211
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:24,673
so she told me to tell you she was sorry.

212
00:12:24,973 --> 00:12:27,143
She left without seeing her mother-in-law?

213
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,773
So, Ms. Choi probably won't come, either.

214
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:31,283
I don't think she can.

215
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:34,213
My dad isn't feeling well, either, so he'll drop by next time.

216
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:36,653
I only have two daughters-in-law,

217
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:38,623
yet they neither care about anything I do.

218
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,353
Darn it.

219
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,493
I paid to get dressed up for no reason.

220
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:48,493
Then, please take good care of this.

221
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:53,633
Where's Seung Woo?

222
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:56,333
The questioning is over, so he'll come out soon.

223
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:59,043
A hit-and-run accident? Says who?

224
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,173
Who dared to frame him for this accident?

225
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,313
The victim is someone you know.

226
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:06,483
You also know Ms. Kim Do Hee, who's in my department, right?

227
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,253
She recently passed away in a hit-and-run accident,

228
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:11,323
and the police said Seung Woo was the driver.

229
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:15,323
Mom.

230
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:17,423
Seung Woo!

231
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:20,433
Mom, please help me.

232
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,933
It wasn't me. I mean it.

233
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,433
You believe me, right?

234
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,063
Yes.

235
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:31,173
May I have a word with you?

236
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:40,453
Don't worry.

237
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,353
I'll do whatever it takes to help you.

238
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,723
I have no idea.

239
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,753
I was so drunk that I couldn't remember anything.

240
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:51,993
What if I really killed her?

241
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:53,963
Let's go.

242
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:55,063
Mom...

243
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:57,903
Excuse me. I heard you caught the driver. Who was it?

244
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,003
Seung Woo!

245
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:01,433
Was it you? Was it?

246
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:02,803
- Were you the driver? - Goodness.

247
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:04,703
Look at me!

248
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:06,643
You need to look at me!

249
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:08,373
Will you let go of me?

250
00:14:08,943 --> 00:14:11,543
Bring Do Hee back! Bring her back!

251
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,953
Hey! Bring Do Hee back!

252
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:20,453
First of all, may the deceased rest in peace.

253
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,753
I'm sorry for your loss.

254
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,793
But those who are alive must go on.

255
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:30,663
You should remain level-headed in times like these.

256
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:33,733
What do you mean by that?

257
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:38,203
It's too harsh to make him an ex-convict after one mistake.

258
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:39,673
He's still young.

259
00:14:40,573 --> 00:14:43,643
I'll compensate you as much as you want.

260
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,513
Think of it as a present from the deceased...

261
00:14:46,513 --> 00:14:47,583
Present?

262
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:51,283
My younger sister died, and did you just call it a present?

263
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:52,383
How...

264
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:56,753
can you say something like that?

265
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,693
Finding fault and blaming him won't bring back the dead.

266
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:03,963
I'm telling you to take whatever you can get from this.

267
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,233
That would be best for each other.

268
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:07,603
For whom is this good?

269
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,673
A mistake?

270
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,373
How is that a mistake?

271
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:14,673
This was murder.

272
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:18,243
Your son didn't make a mistake. He murdered her!

273
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,553
She wouldn't have died if he had called 911...

274
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:24,123
as soon as he caused the accident! Do you understand?

275
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:31,163
I'll have him tried under the law.

276
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:34,233
I will not settle...

277
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:36,093
or show him mercy.

278
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,533
Again, let me tell you that your son...

279
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:42,703
didn't make a mistake.

280
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:44,803
He's a murderer.

281
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:49,613
Taken into custody?

282
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:51,713
The police were worried he might try to destroy evidence.

283
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:55,213
I know the prosecutor in charge, so I'll come home after a meeting.

284
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:00,593
All right.

285
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,973
Was it really Seung Woo?

286
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:15,703
Where's Mom?

287
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,603
She ran to the police station as soon as she heard it.

288
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,413
What are we going to do?

289
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:23,913
I'm worried about Seung Woo,

290
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:27,183
but if the press finds out, it'll impact our business, too.

291
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,323
- Mom. - Ja Young.

292
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,053
I need to get some rest first.

293
00:16:40,163 --> 00:16:41,263
What happened?

294
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:43,963
Why was Kang Seung Woo arrested for what Jae In's mom did?

295
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,863
I was kind enough to send the evidence from my dash cam.

296
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,033
It's because the vehicle was registered under his name.

297
00:16:50,433 --> 00:16:52,973
I thought they'd backtrack from the dash cam video,

298
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:54,913
but it looks like they finished investigating...

299
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,143
based only by the things in the video.

300
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,853
Did you erase all our voices when you sent the video?

301
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,113
Don't worry about that.

302
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:03,513
I edited that out.

303
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:05,523
Anyway, what's your plan now?

304
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:07,723
Will you let Jae In's mom go on?

305
00:17:07,723 --> 00:17:09,553
You've already seen how frightening she can be.

306
00:17:10,293 --> 00:17:11,463
I'll keep an eye on her for now.

307
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:14,033
What if she ends up killing you?

308
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,093
That won't happen.

309
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:16,633
Even if it does, I won't let it.

310
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,503
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

311
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,903
It's a stomach ulcer. I'm just stressed out.

312
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,243
I'll be fine.

313
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,673
They both fell asleep.

314
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:57,373
You can drink slowly.

315
00:17:59,073 --> 00:18:01,173
Your mom may act like she's fine,

316
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:02,873
but you know she isn't, right?

317
00:18:03,543 --> 00:18:04,883
The dishes she made...

318
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:07,853
a few days ago were everything Do Hee liked.

319
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:09,913
I feel bad for Bo Ram.

320
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,253
She needs her mom at this age.

321
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:14,793
She cried this evening, asking when her mommy would come.

322
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:16,853
I heard you told her she traveled somewhere far away.

323
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,463
Yes.

324
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,493
I couldn't make myself tell her.

325
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,863
You're right. She's too young to understand death.

326
00:18:25,203 --> 00:18:26,563
It'll only hurt her.

327
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,033
Actually,

328
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,173
the police called and said they caught the hit-and-run driver.

329
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,543
They caught the driver? Why didn't you...

330
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:36,843
call me?

331
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:40,513
Hey, did you see the driver? Was it a man or a woman?

332
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:42,853
I just saw his back. He's a man.

333
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:45,583
I should've been there to beat him into a pulp.

334
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,053
He was Do Hee's colleague at work,

335
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:50,493
and they worked in the same department.

336
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:54,063
So, he's in the police station?

337
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:55,563
I won't let him live.

338
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:58,033
Mom will collapse if you act like this, too.

339
00:18:58,463 --> 00:18:59,563
Calm down.

340
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:01,073
Darn it.

341
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:03,033
How can he be like this?

342
00:19:03,373 --> 00:19:05,943
How can he do this to his work colleague?

343
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:08,113
Good grief.

344
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:13,813
Anyway, shouldn't you tell her?

345
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,353
I'll do it when the investigation ends.

346
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:18,883
She would go over every day if she found out,

347
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:21,123
and it would torture her.

348
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:24,093
I want this to be...

349
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,063
as painless as possible for her.

350
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,033
Good grief.

351
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:03,593
No, go away.

352
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:05,703
Go away.

353
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:08,733
I didn't do anything wrong.

354
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,373
Do not blame me.

355
00:20:10,703 --> 00:20:11,803
It's all your fault.

356
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:13,673
You brought this upon yourself.

357
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:29,753
Let me live.

358
00:20:33,863 --> 00:20:35,893
Let me live. Stop it.

359
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:37,263
Spare my life.

360
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,033
Spare my life.

361
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,073
What?

362
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:44,573
Honey, wake up.

363
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:46,703
Honey!

364
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,283
Are you all right?

365
00:20:55,553 --> 00:20:57,113
What about Seung Woo?

366
00:20:57,313 --> 00:20:58,423
Is he home?

367
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:03,953
I must be out of my mind.

368
00:21:05,193 --> 00:21:06,363
Seung Woo...

369
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:08,393
will be okay, right?

370
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,363
I need some hot tea.

371
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,033
Honey, should I come with you?

372
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:20,173
No, I need some time alone.

373
00:21:20,773 --> 00:21:21,913
You should go to sleep.

374
00:21:39,763 --> 00:21:41,963
Why haven't I thought of that?

375
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:45,133
Gyu Cheol.

376
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:48,073
Your son turned into a murderer.

377
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:53,203
I never imagined things would unfold like this.

378
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,043
This is hardly painful...

379
00:21:57,813 --> 00:22:00,113
compared to how much you tortured me for life.

380
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,253
I have no idea.

381
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:07,453
What if I really killed her?

382
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:11,263
Seung Woo, you don't have to blame me.

383
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,493
You should've never been born anyway.

384
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:17,903
If you want to blame anyone, blame your birth mother.

385
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:21,473
Blame your father, who made me raise you.

386
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,903
It's all your sin and your karma.

387
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:28,573
Everything worked out nicely.

388
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:32,313
I finally got my revenge on you like this.

389
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,123
I'm back.

390
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,163
I heard you met with the prosecutor in charge.

391
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:47,163
How did it go?

392
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,063
It wasn't helpful.

393
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:53,933
Are you glad?

394
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:56,903
What do you mean?

395
00:22:57,103 --> 00:22:58,703
You know who the victim is.

396
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,513
She disappeared from this world...

397
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,743
just as you threatened her.

398
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,513
You talk as if I have...

399
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:07,283
that girl's blood on my hands.

400
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:12,553
Did you think I convinced Seung Woo to do this?

401
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:13,953
Hardly.

402
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,053
I already know...

403
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,123
he's not that bold.

404
00:23:19,793 --> 00:23:20,933
If you know that,

405
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:24,093
do whatever it takes to have Seung Woo released.

406
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,633
That's how you can repay us.

407
00:23:27,303 --> 00:23:28,933
And remember one more thing.

408
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:30,903
It's a shame...

409
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:33,843
that Seung Woo got caught up in this unfortunate incident,

410
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,843
but this is when we say what goes around comes around.

411
00:23:37,613 --> 00:23:39,183
She was punished by fate.

412
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:41,253
You should be careful, too.

413
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,083
You may be able to deceive people,

414
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:45,853
but you can't do that to fate.

415
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,693
Honey.

416
00:23:50,623 --> 00:23:52,123
Was it really Seung Woo?

417
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:54,063
Did he do this?

418
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:57,233
Yes.

419
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,273
Thanks for your hard work on Seung Woo's case today.

420
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,173
You should go upstairs and get some rest.

421
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:07,743
Okay. Goodnight.

422
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,273
How can I spend a good night...

423
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,683
while Seung Woo is behind bars?

424
00:24:13,783 --> 00:24:16,583
I'll take sleeping pills and nap briefly.

425
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:19,223
I'll give her the pills and be upstairs.

426
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:20,323
You should go first.

427
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,093
Okay.

428
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,673
I keep thinking about it,

429
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:45,743
but I still can't believe Seung Woo did this.

430
00:24:46,843 --> 00:24:48,353
I berated him a few times,

431
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,783
so he began to call the chauffeur service every time he got drunk.

432
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:53,023
I even saw him doing it a few times.

433
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:55,153
It's all my fault.

434
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:56,893
As your dad said,

435
00:24:57,423 --> 00:24:59,063
I spoiled him too much.

436
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:01,193
It wasn't your fault, Mom.

437
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:04,063
Jae In, you are...

438
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:06,663
my only hope and light from now on.

439
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:08,103
You're the only one for me.

440
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:10,703
You need to live a good life on behalf of Seung Woo.

441
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:12,873
You can leave him to me.

442
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:15,613
Only focus on seeing and thinking about good things.

443
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:18,183
That's the kind of world you need to live in.

444
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:19,983
Okay?

445
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:22,113
Mom.

446
00:25:23,113 --> 00:25:25,383
Don't worry about me. Okay?

447
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:28,123
Jae In is...

448
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,353
my one and only child.

449
00:25:30,953 --> 00:25:32,423
Everything I do, I do for her.

450
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,763
You should be careful, too.

451
00:25:40,663 --> 00:25:43,173
What if she ends up killing you?

452
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:48,873
You were still up?

453
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:53,583
Honey.

454
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:55,883
Thank you.

455
00:25:57,883 --> 00:26:00,223
My mom must be very grateful to you, too.

456
00:26:01,553 --> 00:26:04,493
She said she'd leave Seung Woo to you.

457
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:08,033
If he did something wrong, he should be punished.

458
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:10,863
I don't want to go that far yet,

459
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:14,333
but please make sure...

460
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,103
there are no more doubts.

461
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,913
I'll do as you say.

462
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:33,023
Thank you, honey.

463
00:26:34,753 --> 00:26:37,023
You've never been fearful or frightened of anything.

464
00:26:37,793 --> 00:26:40,793
And you've never lost or been robbed of anything in life,

465
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:42,793
but you'll experience it very soon.

466
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:46,003
I'll let you have a taste of everything.

467
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:56,643
You asked them to conduct a thorough investigation?

468
00:26:57,813 --> 00:26:59,513
Mother seemed to be quite worried.

469
00:27:00,713 --> 00:27:02,813
I saw her taking sleeping pills last night,

470
00:27:03,383 --> 00:27:04,623
so I felt heavy.

471
00:27:05,983 --> 00:27:08,523
He's quite worried about you.

472
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:11,263
Thank you.

473
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,163
I couldn't sit around and watch this as your son-in-law,

474
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:15,493
so I protested firmly against my prosecutor friend...

475
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,063
to figure out the whole truth.

476
00:27:19,303 --> 00:27:21,333
Above all, I trust Seung Woo.

477
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:24,473
All right. I'm glad you did that, Gi Chan.

478
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,773
Seung Woo's future is at stake,

479
00:27:27,243 --> 00:27:28,673
so he can't be framed unjustly.

480
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:37,153
Hello.

481
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,253
We came even though it was a discourtesy to be here this early.

482
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:41,593
We were given the order to investigate thoroughly...

483
00:27:41,723 --> 00:27:43,723
so that people wouldn't say it was done half-heartedly.

484
00:27:44,123 --> 00:27:46,463
I understand that you're here to do good work.

485
00:27:46,923 --> 00:27:48,993
But you should be investigating out there.

486
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:50,763
Why are you here at my place?

487
00:27:50,763 --> 00:27:52,303
Well, we've been checking...

488
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,063
the whereabouts of the car on that day.

489
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,003
I saw CCTVs installed...

490
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:57,333
in front of your place and the parking lot.

491
00:27:57,903 --> 00:27:59,043
Do you have the footage?

492
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:01,673
You may hand them over.

493
00:28:02,373 --> 00:28:04,143
They're deleted automatically once every week,

494
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:05,843
so we don't have the videos from that day.

495
00:28:07,443 --> 00:28:10,113
No, we do have it.

496
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:13,853
I believe our security team keeps a backup of the footage.

497
00:28:14,823 --> 00:28:16,453
Jae In, no.

498
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:18,263
That's not the case.

499
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,333
Hello? Is this the security team?

500
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:26,033
What happened to the CCTV footage I wanted you to find?

501
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:28,033
Bring them over now.

502
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,903
Mother, they have the footage.

503
00:28:34,943 --> 00:28:36,043
Aren't you glad?

504
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,613
Everything was fabricated.

505
00:29:13,113 --> 00:29:14,683
The video was faked!

506
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:17,483
Honey, this isn't true.

507
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:18,883
I didn't do it.

508
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:21,083
Ja Young.

509
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:24,253
Did you really do this?

510
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,723
It wasn't me, Mi Ran!

511
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:28,533
Didn't you hear me?

512
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:29,993
This was faked.

513
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,763
Gi Chan tampered with this.

514
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:34,063
I know it!

515
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:35,903
Mother.

516
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:40,643
Did you kill her intentionally, knowing it was Ms. Kim?

517
00:29:41,043 --> 00:29:43,973
What is he talking about?

518
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:45,313
Did you do this intentionally?

519
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,143
Mother had been suspicious...

520
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,483
that Ms. Kim and I were in an affair.

521
00:29:50,653 --> 00:29:52,523
I clearly told her it wasn't the case,

522
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,993
and Seung Woo also tried to talk her out of this idea.

523
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:58,963
But even after that, she kept tailing Ms. Kim...

524
00:29:59,193 --> 00:30:00,823
and threatened to kill her.

525
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:03,763
Ms. Kim became frightened and told me all about it.

526
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:07,533
Mom, you didn't do that, did you?

527
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:09,673
Jae In, listen up.

528
00:30:10,173 --> 00:30:11,973
He's slandering me.

529
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:14,503
He got caught cheating on you with that woman.

530
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,313
I said I'd make him divorce you,

531
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:19,213
so he began to frame me as his way of protesting.

532
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:20,883
You need to stop, Mother!

533
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:24,253
I knew you never approved of me,

534
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,083
but did you have to take things this far?

535
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,353
Did you really do this?

536
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:32,363
Was it you?

537
00:30:33,193 --> 00:30:34,833
If nothing else,

538
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:36,633
Seung Woo is...

539
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,163
your son.

540
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,473
Why did you do this?

541
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,003
It's your fault.

542
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,573
It's all your fault.

543
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:49,673
Honey...

544
00:30:50,873 --> 00:30:52,243
How is he my son?

545
00:30:53,383 --> 00:30:56,013
I never gave birth to him, so how is he my son?

546
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:58,383
Why is he my son?

547
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:00,983
How do you call him my son?

548
00:31:02,323 --> 00:31:05,393
He's your son, but not mine!

549
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:07,793
He's not mine!

550
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,433
- Ma'am. - He's not my son!

551
00:31:10,763 --> 00:31:12,533
You're under arrest for a fatal hit-and-run accident...

552
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,633
resulting in Kim Do Hee's death.

553
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:18,303
Come with us.

554
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:21,843
Mom.

555
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:33,443
(Queen's House)

556
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:37,343
The hit-and-run driver wasn't Kang Seung Woo,

557
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,313
but his mother?

558
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,053
I did it for you.

559
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:44,783
You're the only one in my life.

560
00:33:47,283 --> 00:33:48,393
Remember this.

561
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,123
Seung Woo isn't your brother.

562
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:52,763
- What do you mean, no? - Do not let him have the company.

563
00:33:53,293 --> 00:33:55,733
You're the rightful owner of YL, no matter what anyone says.

564
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:59,463
I got the gift. Thank you.

565
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:02,273
Is that doctor acquainted with Jae In?

566
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:05,073
He's the older brother of the woman her mom killed...

567
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:07,373
in that accident.
