1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,070
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm asking you.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,910
Do you work for YL Group?

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,250
What's wrong, Yun Hee?
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,760
I thought you worked at a clinic.
Wasn't that the case?

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,530
Say something!

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,400
- Grandma.
- Yun Hee, Bo Ram can hear you.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,500
Come inside.

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,970
Bo Ram, do you want to go out
and play in the playground with me?

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,510
Uncle Do Yun, why is Grandma angry?

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,280
Hey, it's not a big deal.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,350
Your uncle didn't listen
to what Grandma said,

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,880
just like what I did.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,180
What are you waiting for?
Get in there.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,460
Hey, Bo Ram. You should go out
and play with Ms. Kang.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,130
Let's go, Bo Ram.

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,590
Okay.

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,280
Oh Seong,
you knew everything, didn't you?

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,010
You had to stop me
from dropping off his lunch...

22
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,680
because you already knew...

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,250
Do Yun was working at YL Group.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,490
Well, I didn't want you
to pass out in shock.

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,120
That was why I couldn't tell you.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,220
I would've told you
if I had known you'd be so feisty.

27
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,530
Do you think
this is the time to joke around?

28
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,400
You should've stopped him
if you had found out.

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,270
Did you sit around
and let him do this as his uncle?

30
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,570
He's not a stranger.
He's your nephew!

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,200
He tried to stop me,

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,940
but I insisted on doing this.

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,410
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,550
I didn't want to worry you.

35
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,180
Why did you get a job there?

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,750
Why did you quit the hospital
and join YL Group?

37
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,650
I get to work regular hours there,

38
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,320
which gives me enough time
to spend with Bo Ram.

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,930
It pays well, too. That's why.

40
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,830
Is that really all?

41
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,760
Is there any other reason?

42
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,870
And what's that certified mail?

43
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,370
How did you get charged
for attempted rape?

44
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,610
What is this?

45
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,140
Did you really do this?

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,710
I can confidently guarantee...

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,010
that it's not the case.

48
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,180
There's no way he'd do that.

49
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,550
He's your son,
so you probably know him better.

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,450
Then, why did they send that mail
to say they'll sue him?

51
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,590
I think YL set up a trap...

52
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,830
in an attempt to kick him out.

53
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,490
Why would they do that?

54
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,660
Isn't it obvious?

55
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,930
They must've felt uneasy
to have Do Hee's brother around.

56
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,400
They can probably take a guess
on why he got a job there.

57
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,200
Exactly. Why?

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,210
What's the reason
you get a job there...

59
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,480
only to end up harassed like this?

60
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,580
Is it because of Do Hee?

61
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,050
The woman who did that to her is
paying for her crime in prison!

62
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,350
Is there...

63
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,990
Is there anything else going on?

64
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,260
Choi Ja Young is responsible
for the action that resulted...

65
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,030
in Do Hee's death.

66
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,730
But I don't think that's all.

67
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,770
I'm trying to uncover the truth,
and what I do know is...

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,440
that the people who framed her
and cornered her into death are...

69
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,140
still at YL Group.

70
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,510
I'll also hold them responsible...

71
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,980
for the things they did
by any means necessary.

72
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,750
I need to let Do Hee
rest in peace on the other side...

73
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,980
without holding any resentment.

74
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,290
Mom, please stop.

75
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,860
What's wrong?

76
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,930
You need to quit.

77
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,200
You need to quit right away
if you don't want to see me die.

78
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,440
Do Yun.

79
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,780
I can't lose you, too.

80
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,980
They're only framing you
for sexual assault now,

81
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,420
but who knows what they're capable of
in the future?

82
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,820
Do Yun.

83
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,960
No.

84
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,320
Don't do it. You have to quit.

85
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,060
What about Do Hee?

86
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,330
You also feel ill at ease
about letting Do Hee go like this.

87
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,030
I'll deal with it.

88
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,900
I'll do that if that's the best move
I can make for you and Bo Ram.

89
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,440
Mom.

90
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,140
I don't know about me,
but you shouldn't say that...

91
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,740
for Bo Ram's sake.

92
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,580
We must face them and fight them.

93
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,710
Why are you so afraid?

94
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,590
We have to expose what they did...

95
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,750
and how far they went.

96
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,820
They should be punished
for a crime they committed.

97
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,430
That's the only way
Do Hee will rest in peace.

98
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,760
I know her better,

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,100
and she wouldn't want you
or Bo Ram to get hurt.

100
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,700
If exposing that...

101
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,970
will bring Do Hee back,

102
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,810
I'll tell you to do it thousands
and tens of thousands of times.

103
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,620
But she can't come back.

104
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,490
Do Yun, do as I say. Okay?

105
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,530
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,670
Get out, both of you.

107
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,410
If you'll both live
however you want to, get out.

108
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,110
Go out and live your own life.

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,510
You, too. Both of you, get out.

110
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,080
Yun Hee.

111
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,580
I don't need any of you.

112
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,990
I don't need a child
or a younger brother...

113
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,790
who can't understand how I feel.

114
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,530
Get out.

115
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,730
Go out and live on your own.

116
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,200
Go.

117
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,880
It's been a while since we had tea.
Let's have some.

118
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,550
I'm busy right now.

119
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,960
What do you think you're doing?

120
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,860
This is the only way
to get your attention.

121
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,330
You're within my reach,

122
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,070
but why do you feel so distant?

123
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,810
Honey, tell me if there's anything
that's bothering you about me.

124
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,970
I'll do better. Please?

125
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,380
Nothing's bothering me.

126
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,410
You haven't looked at me...

127
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,150
or touched me recently.

128
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,820
Are you still troubled
about that wedding photo?

129
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:57,920
I won't deny that.

130
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,760
Can you please give me your trust?

131
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,700
We're in love.

132
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,570
We've been through
so many ups and downs.

133
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,570
How can you crumble...

134
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,070
after falling into one trap
that Jae In set up?

135
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,110
Did you have
this little faith in me?

136
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,110
I need time.

137
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,380
How long? Until when?

138
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,420
Honey, look at me.

139
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,250
Look at me.

140
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,500
I love you.

141
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,770
I have to get back to work.
You need to leave.

142
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,310
All right.

143
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,010
You should get to work.

144
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,080
You seem uncomfortable with me,
so I'll sleep with Ji Ho tonight.

145
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,380
Don't stay up too late. Goodnight.

146
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,660
Here.

147
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,100
Hey, come to think of it,

148
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,870
it's been a while
since I've massaged your shoulders.

149
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,010
I should put my hands to work.

150
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,510
It's okay. Just eat your fruit.

151
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,910
Hey, I'm Hwang Gi Man,
aka the medicinal hands.

152
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,180
Stay still.

153
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,020
We should...

154
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,150
take this as our last chance...

155
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,520
and work things out.

156
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,730
That was exactly
what I wanted to say.

157
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,330
I want to have a baby.

158
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,530
Yes, sure.
You'll want to have a baby...

159
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
Wait, what?

160
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,500
Sit down.

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,470
When I saw you play with Ji Ho,

162
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,780
I realized that was
the kind of family I wanted.

163
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,280
So, I began to want to make...

164
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,080
a whole family.

165
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,780
I guess
I only covered up my desire...

166
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,820
to want to be a mother.
I don't think I ever gave up.

167
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,320
Let's try once again, honey.

168
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,590
But you're busy at the hospital.
You don't have to strain yourself.

169
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,130
I'm going to take a leave.

170
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,500
You'll even take a leave?

171
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,230
I had to balance work
and chores at home all along,

172
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,540
so I didn't have any energy
both physically and mentally.

173
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,410
I was always concerned,
thinking I might be the reason...

174
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,380
why we never had a chance.

175
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,550
Why are you blaming yourself?

176
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,750
And I'm grateful that
you never gave me a hard time...

177
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,120
on that matter.

178
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,520
I want to focus all my attention
and give it my all...

179
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,420
one last time.

180
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,090
Is that all right?

181
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,460
Yes, of course.

182
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,630
It's great news for me.

183
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,800
I see.

184
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,040
if you have to hire some people,
do that and make it happen...

185
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,200
as soon as possible.

186
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,170
All right.

187
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,910
I checked the departure record
for that female employee,

188
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,450
and she really left the country.

189
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,380
Don't lose your heart.

190
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,250
I had people look for her in person.
I'll hear back very soon.

191
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,690
Okay.

192
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,720
Anyway, I'm about to seal
the investment contract.

193
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,290
Can you do this?

194
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,630
I have to.

195
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,260
But she's firmly against this.
Are you sure?

196
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,500
I'll have to persuade her.

197
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,770
She's against this now,
but she'll understand eventually.

198
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,140
I'm done drying your hair.

199
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,910
Bo Ram, do you want to sleep
in my room tonight?

200
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,110
Okay.

201
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,750
Bo Ram, go to my room.

202
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,850
Grandma, may I sleep
with Ms. Kang tonight?

203
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,990
Bo Ram, you should do as she says.

204
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,860
Okay. Ms. Kang.

205
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,400
Goodnight.

206
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,360
Goodnight.

207
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,070
If you haven't had dinner,
I'll whip up something.

208
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,510
I'm fine. Have a seat.

209
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,110
I thought about this
and became quite disheartened.

210
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,850
You said you worked part-time
at Do Yun's clinic.

211
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,260
Was that true?

212
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
Yes, I worked there.

213
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,830
So, you already knew
it wasn't an actual clinic.

214
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,700
You didn't say anything
when I thought it was a hospital.

215
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,570
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,310
You probably didn't know,

217
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,040
but I despise YL Group
with all my heart.

218
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,310
When you said you got a job there,

219
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,110
I still celebrated with you...

220
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,410
even though
I shuddered on the inside.

221
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,550
Did Do Yun say anything to you?

222
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,620
Yun Hee, don't be so hard
on that innocent woman.

223
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,860
You need to stop. Let's go.

224
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Why are you doing this to me?

225
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,130
Why do you all shut your mouths...

226
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,930
and keep things secret
whenever I'm around?

227
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,870
Hey, well, Bo Ram said
she wanted her grandma.

228
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,640
She's waiting for you.
Come with me. Come on.

229
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,580
Sorry about that. Get a good rest.

230
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,790
Here.

231
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,890
Mother, today, I'm going to request
a leave of absence at the hospital.

232
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,500
It's too early
for something like this.

233
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,330
What kind of otter nonsense is this?

234
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,240
Mom, it's not otter. Isn't it atter?

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,540
You're worse than me.

236
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,340
It's not atter. It's utter.

237
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,140
The letter is U. Utter nonsense.

238
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,310
How will you pay for your living?

239
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,080
I make money, too.

240
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,150
You don't even make much.

241
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,350
She's right. You're a puppet boss.

242
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,460
You little brat.
Don't butt in when the elders talk.

243
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,230
I didn't want to face someone here,
so I was leaving anyway.

244
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,530
That little...

245
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,400
I want to take some time off
and focus on having a child.

246
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,840
A child?

247
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,410
Mother, are you
that happy to hear...

248
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,010
that Yu Gyeong wants to have a baby?

249
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,850
Please show me your understanding
for the next year.

250
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,860
You couldn't get pregnant
over all those years.

251
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,490
Suddenly taking a leave
won't help with that.

252
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,030
Even if you do get pregnant,

253
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,830
aren't you two too old...

254
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,960
to have a kid now and raise them?

255
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,200
I had enough trouble
while raising my three kids.

256
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,470
I won't be a babysitter for you.

257
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,440
I have my father,

258
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,940
and I can hire a helping hand
like Ji Ho's tutor.

259
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,380
Mother, she's right about that.

260
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,740
Everyone hires
babysitters these days.

261
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,110
You...

262
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,850
We'll have to see
when those days come,

263
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,320
but I want to try, Mother.

264
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,190
Congratulations in advance,
Yu Gyeong.

265
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,960
Am I going to have
a younger cousin soon?

266
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,590
All right!

267
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,260
Good for you, Ji Ho.

268
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,840
I wish to invest. From Hong Man Su.

269
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,040
(Mr. Hong: I wish to invest.
From Hong Man Su.)

270
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:31,380
You have to eat up, okay?

271
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,480
I made some porridge.

272
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,920
I don't want any.

273
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,550
I have no appetite.

274
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,290
Please have just a bite.

275
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,090
You need to recover your energy.

276
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,530
Later.

277
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,000
You had no idea what was going on,

278
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,800
so I shouldn't have vented on you.

279
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,140
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,770
It's okay.

281
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,140
I also should've let you know.
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,450
It's okay.

283
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,280
Shouldn't you go to work?

284
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,890
You should go.

285
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,200
She hasn't had
anything to eat since last night.

286
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,970
What should we do?

287
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll be home all day
after going out briefly in the afternoon,

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,470
so I'll look after her.
Let me have that.

289
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,540
I'll be home, too.
You should go to work.

290
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,680
Have a great day, Ms. Kang.

291
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,310
Have fun at the kindergarten,
Bo Ram.

292
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,550
Okay.

293
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,090
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

294
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,390
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan, the reason
why YL's stock price plummeted!)

295
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,560
(Only death awaits
if you do not resign!)

296
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,630
Where did you get this thing?

297
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,070
What? I brought the mail
that was addressed to you.

298
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,270
What's wrong? What is it?

299
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,770
What is this?
Shouldn't you report this?

300
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,810
Should I call the police?

301
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,040
No.

302
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,710
We don't need to summon them
to handle a coward...

303
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,710
who threatens me
with a piece of paper.

304
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,050
Who did this?

305
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,520
Gi Chan,
did you do something wrong...

306
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,890
to anyone else other than Jae In?

307
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,320
I get it.

308
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,600
Ms. Hwang, summon Ms. Kang Jae In.

309
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,500
Did you want to see me?

310
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,440
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

311
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,610
Go ahead and try.

312
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,420
Did you call me here
to suddenly act like this?

313
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,850
Go ahead and give it your best.

314
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,760
I'll fight you
for the effort you made...

315
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,420
to send me this threatening letter
bidding my death or whatever.

316
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,660
You're completely delusional.

317
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,100
Hwang Gi Chan.

318
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,270
I'll pull you down
to the darkest place of the abyss,

319
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,610
so stop acting up
and just sit quietly.

320
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,980
What do you think you're doing?

321
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,080
See?

322
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,920
I can always threaten you
without sending that letter.

323
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,890
I didn't know you were this foolish.

324
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,750
Stop blaming me...

325
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,020
and think back
on your wonderful past.

326
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,030
I doubt I'm the only one...

327
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,660
who'll want to kill you.

328
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,340
He just insisted on this
without hard evidence.

329
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,900
He must feel anxious.

330
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,280
I heard my husband summoned you.

331
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,190
What is it this time?

332
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,490
What did you do this time
to slander me?

333
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,520
You can ask him yourself
if you're curious.

334
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm asking you, so answer me.

335
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,660
What are you so afraid of?

336
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,730
You said your love would
never change no matter what.

337
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,040
I'm not afraid. I'm furious.

338
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,010
It's unpleasant
to have you slander me...

339
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,040
just as your mother did.

340
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,680
Do you get it?

341
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,950
Someone sent a threatening letter
to Chairman Hwang.

342
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,010
What? Who?

343
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,650
- Was it you?
- Don't be ridiculous.

344
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,980
Why would I do that?

345
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,290
I wouldn't know.

346
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,960
If you deny it,
then I guess it wasn't you.

347
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,660
I'm starting to wonder who it is.

348
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,060
Get your hand off me.

349
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,080
Are you going somewhere?

350
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,210
Don't you know?

351
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,450
I'm going to my part-time job.

352
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,520
You said you didn't want to do it.

353
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,050
When did I say that?

354
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,350
I never said that.

355
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,290
You silently pressured me,
so I have no choice but to get a job.

356
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,430
You demanded living expenses.

357
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,860
Ms. Choi, I didn't mean
to make you feel that way.

358
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,440
What are you waiting for?
Take the lead.

359
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,370
We don't have to go.

360
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,380
She just texted me and said
she'd close for a few days.

361
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,620
Goodness, it's so warm.

362
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,680
It's still steaming hot.

363
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,520
I gave you a little more
than what you asked for. It's on me.

364
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,220
My gosh. You're such a generous man.

365
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,160
My wife is a doctor,

366
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,190
and she's going on her leave soon.
I need to rake in lots of money.

367
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,060
Thank you very much
for this wonderful energy.

368
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,970
I already did my research
before jumping into this.

369
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,200
Mr. Hwang Gi Man,
you have such solid guarantors.

370
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,510
I already know the chairman
of YL Group is your younger brother.

371
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,950
That's why I'm giving you
this kind of money with trust.

372
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,180
But we live in a society
that runs on credit.

373
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,880
You know nothing is free, right?

374
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,890
Yes, of course.

375
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,060
And your interest rate is
as low as a bank. I won't flee.

376
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,320
I only ask you
to stick to the repayment schedule.

377
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,130
Your interest rate begins
as low as a bank,

378
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,430
but it doubles if you miss a day...

379
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,300
and quadruples if you miss
another day. Do you agree?

380
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,860
If you do, please sign that.

381
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,330
Yes, okay. Agreed.

382
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,570
Dang it. Please excuse me.

383
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,670
Hello? What is it?

384
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,450
Mom.

385
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,250
You need to eat.
Everyone is worried about you.

386
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,260
You can't change my mind
by doing this.

387
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,500
I'm going to find out
why my only sister, Do Hee,

388
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,260
had to face such death.

389
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,570
That's the last thing...

390
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,900
I can do for her
as her older brother.

391
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,910
And I understand
why you're concerned.

392
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,180
I also know it's not easy
to put up a fight...

393
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,050
against power and authority.

394
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,680
But the idea of living quietly
without making a sound...

395
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,590
whenever I get trampled on sounds...

396
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,760
as good as death.

397
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,790
Forget me.

398
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
I don't want Bo Ram
to live that kind of life.

399
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,100
I don't want...

400
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,570
to break your heart.

401
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,940
I'm sorry, Mom.

402
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,390
Mom, I keep thinking about it,
and this is just too much.

403
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,030
Why do I have to be here
to meet Na Ra's date?

404
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,060
I'm busy running my business.

405
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,830
You should be here
as the eldest son of the family...

406
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,230
to decide
on a family affair like this.

407
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,070
I wanted to crush his spirit
as much as possible...

408
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,540
and even bring
my chairman son with me.

409
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,240
Mom, do not use
any English words today.

410
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,670
Why not?

411
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,210
He'll notice how uneducated you are
if you call him a doctar.

412
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,010
I didn't say he was a doctar.

413
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,650
I said doctal.

414
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,050
They're both wrong.

415
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,650
Anyway, no English words today.

416
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,490
I won't use them, either. Okay?

417
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,820
Okay.

418
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,060
Which language is "okay" from?

419
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,860
Hey, Dr. Kim. Over here.

420
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,470
Mom, he's Dr. Kim Do Yun,
the man I told you about.

421
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,610
Please meet my mother.

422
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,840
And this guy is...

423
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,150
my eldest brother,
who ended up coming along.

424
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,950
Darn it.
This is the worst kind of fate.

425
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,520
Hello.

426
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,330
What is this ridiculous situation?

427
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,830
Mom, don't be so rude.

428
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,530
What do you mean,
a ridiculous situation?

429
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,000
Did you think I was a joke?

430
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,470
Am I a joke to you?

431
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,070
Did you think I was such a pushover?

432
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,140
Mom, that's enough.

433
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,810
How dare you
hit on my naive daughter?

434
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,310
Hey, you darned crazy punk.

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,280
You can't have my daughter
even if you were...

436
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,410
the last man on earth!

437
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,550
Darn it. Mom, that's enough.

438
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,780
- What's with you?
- Get your hands off me.

439
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,290
Do not lay a finger on my daughter.

440
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,290
Did he?

441
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,460
What? No.

442
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,830
There must be a misunderstanding.

443
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,330
I only came
because she wanted to see me.

444
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,830
Good grief.
A misunderstanding, my foot.

445
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,030
Beat it!

446
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,230
Don't come anywhere near my girl.

447
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,940
I'll kill you,

448
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,470
and I'm not joking.

449
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,040
Mom, please!

450
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,310
Be quiet!

451
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,610
What are you doing? Grab her.

452
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,810
- Ouch.
- Okay.

453
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,910
- Come here.
- Let's go!

454
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,220
- No, Dr. Kim!
- Come here!

455
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,950
- Let's go!
- Get over here!

456
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,860
- I got you water.
- Goodness.

457
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,030
What's with you, Mom?

458
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,630
How am I going to face him
with this embarrassment?

459
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,000
Why would you face him?

460
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,600
Do you know who he is?

461
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,800
He's the guy
who had an affair with Jae In.

462
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,410
He said it wasn't true.
I already confirmed it.

463
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,210
When Jae In's mom lied
and got hospitalized,

464
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,210
he was the one who reported her.

465
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,010
I heard Jae In's mom say it
when she came to make a scene.

466
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,120
Really?

467
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,320
Even so, you can't date him.
Not even over my dead body.

468
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,820
Get me a weapon.

469
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:45,990
I'll marry him over your dead body.

470
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,630
Good grief. Like mom, like daughter.

471
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,530
You two sound the same.

472
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,130
Anyway, I'm completely
against this, too.

473
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,460
We shouldn't get involved with him.

474
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,200
Why are you adding to this?

475
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,500
You don't even know what he's like.

476
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,200
I didn't want to know, either.

477
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,740
What?

478
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,710
How do you know him?

479
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,740
He's Yu Gyeong's colleague,

480
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,180
so I've run into him before.

481
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,550
Anyway, he's not that great.
He only looks good on the outside.

482
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,650
The women in my family all have
the worst taste in men.

483
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,650
- You little...
- Ouch!

484
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,620
- Why are you taking it out on me?
- You.

485
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,750
You're finally here.

486
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,250
I was going to send your stuff home
or tell someone to throw them out...

487
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,850
if you didn't come by today.

488
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,790
Thanks for your hard work.

489
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,950
I hope
we'll never see each other again.

490
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,320
It's a leave of absence.

491
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,030
It means I can return.

492
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,070
I doubt it'll be easy.

493
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,370
Do you really think so?

494
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,440
Then, let me make this certain.

495
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,280
This won't be the end of it.

496
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,230
All right. Please enjoy.

497
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,400
It's on the house,
so relax and enjoy everything.

498
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,970
Did something good happen?

499
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,340
I'm always in a good mood.

500
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
You always give me great energy.

501
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,540
Right. I turned in the request
for a leave of absence.

502
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,350
Great job!

503
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,450
Eat up.

504
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,910
- Enjoy.
- Sure.

505
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,720
Are you taking a leave of absence?

506
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,550
I want to take some time off.

507
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,920
Your glass is empty.

508
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,400
- You should have a drink, too.
- No.

509
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,060
I can't drink for a while.

510
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,630
Why not? Are you unwell?

511
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,340
No, something just came up.

512
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,210
Are you sure
this is enough for dinner?

513
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,510
Yes.

514
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,080
Let's see.

515
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,650
It's good.

516
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,250
Didn't you want to see me to talk?

517
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,060
Is something going on?

518
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,460
Gosh, you got me.

519
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,360
I was wondering...

520
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,130
if Jae In told you anything.

521
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,240
I mean, about my birth mother.

522
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,270
Have you heard anything?

523
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,540
No, it didn't seem like she knew.

524
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,850
Do you want to know?

525
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,890
I just asked you
such an obvious question, right?

526
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,620
I want to know...

527
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,830
how I was born.

528
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,100
Director Choi must be the one
who has the most information.

529
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,070
Why don't you ask her?

530
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,600
She wouldn't tell me
even if she knew.

531
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,940
She'd think that was her revenge.

532
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,850
What about your aunt?

533
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,820
She must have
more information than Jae In.

534
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,020
After all,
she's the former chairman's sister.

535
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,650
She must know best
after Director Choi.

536
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,830
No.

537
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,560
No!

538
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,330
Darn it.

539
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,240
What kind of a nightmare was that?

540
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,870
Why did all those strangers...

541
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,780
jump at me in an attempt to kill me?

542
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,980
It's the character that means death.

543
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,420
Your second son killed someone.

544
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,890
When I asked Gi Chan about it,

545
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,030
he didn't completely deny it.

546
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,000
It seemed odd
when he gladly told me...

547
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,170
to get a talisman
when I said I would.

548
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm home.

549
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,540
I'm home, too.

550
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,340
I need to see you, Gi Chan.
Come here.

551
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,580
Honey, I'll have your briefcase.

552
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,650
I'll leave it in the room.

553
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,850
I'm fine.

554
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,470
He'll continue to act like this...

555
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,770
until Mr. Hong tells him
who the guy in the wedding photo is.

556
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,800
I had to work so hard
to take Gi Chan for myself.

557
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,410
I can't let my past drag me down.

558
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,310
Pull yourself together, Se Ri.

559
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,050
You know that I have
an accurate sixth sense, right?

560
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,850
I've never had...

561
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,820
such an awful nightmare
in all of my life.

562
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,560
I need to know this for sure.

563
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,030
Have you...

564
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,970
killed a person?

565
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,340
Tell me yes or no for sure.

566
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,340
So what if I give you an answer?

567
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,780
What will you do?

568
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,710
Will you report me?

569
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,980
You can't handle this.

570
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,420
Don't ask,
and don't try to find out.

571
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,200
Do you really want to know?

572
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,930
No.

573
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,000
I don't care what it is.
Don't say anything.

574
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,710
I need to read some files
before I leave.

575
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,820
I can always tell...

576
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,950
what my child is thinking.

577
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,760
Who did he do this to,
and what did he do?

578
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,200
Ma'am, what kind of dish
would you like to eat?

579
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,170
Everything.

580
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,240
You're going to get fat
if you eat everything, so no.

581
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,640
How about a pizza
with lots of different toppings...

582
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,980
for a balanced meal?

583
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,480
- Pizza sounds great.
- Okay.

584
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,790
I'll put this on, too.

585
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,490
And this one.

586
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,030
And this.

587
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,870
Wait.

588
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,670
You can't take it now.

589
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,340
I have to bake it
to make it delicious.

590
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,110
You're missing
one of your cuff links.

591
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,580
Did you drop it somewhere?

592
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,720
I was out to a meeting,
and it was already gone...

593
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,890
by the time I got into the car.

594
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,930
Bo Ram, where did you get this?

595
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,590
It was my mom's.

596
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,760
- Your mom's?
- Yes.

597
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,000
I found it in her handbag.

598
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,350
(Queen's House)

599
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,090
What are you doing?

600
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,430
It's because you're spreading
evil energy all around.

601
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,090
It wasn't your fault.

602
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,130
I know it's heartbreaking,
but you still need to eat dinner.

603
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,570
Do you know...

604
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,570
who my birth mother is?

605
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,840
Excuse me.

606
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,780
Where is the office
of the chairman of YL Group?

607
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,210
Why do you need to go
to the chairman's office?
