00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,870
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,520
She wanted
to keep it a secret from you.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,890
Her condition
had worsened for a while...

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,990
when she thought you were dead.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,930
But after she found out
you were still alive,

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,600
she kept taking her medicine
and got better.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,070
I had no idea she was in this state,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,110
although I thought
something was odd at times.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,610
I had no idea...

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,010
she was unwell,
even though I'm her daughter.

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,150
No, Jae In. No.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,920
No!

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,990
Mom. I'm right here.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,930
I'm sorry, Mom.

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,070
It's all my fault.

18
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,970
Why are you crying?

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,440
Did something happen, Jae In?

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,610
Why is she like this, Yu Gyeong?

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,680
She found out about your condition.

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,620
I must've lost my mind again.

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,660
I'm sorry, Mom.

24
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,030
I'm so sorry.

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,660
Don't say that.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,430
I'm just grateful
that you're here with me.

27
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,100
Don't cry.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,640
Jae In.

29
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,050
I should tell you this when
you get your memories back, but...

30
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,450
Never mind. I'll tell you later.

31
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,150
Mom.

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,990
I didn't lose my memories.

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,290
I remember everything.

34
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,930
I also found out recently.

35
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,670
Then, you've been putting on a play?

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,210
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

37
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,310
I understand.

38
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,310
You must've resented me.

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,910
No, Mom. That's not the reason.

40
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,450
I had to deceive everyone
to move into that house.

41
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,520
Dad had left me a will.

42
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,620
A will?

43
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,890
Yes.

44
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,060
Do you not remember
where you put his notebook?

45
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,470
Yes, the notebook.

46
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,400
I took that...

47
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,940
and went to Changpyeong-dong
when I got the call that you were alive.

48
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,640
But I couldn't find it anymore,

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,540
so I must've lost it out there.

50
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,650
Who called and said I was alive?

51
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,250
Was it Se Ri?

52
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,550
Yes.

53
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,720
She's been nothing but trouble
since high school,

54
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,060
and in the end,
she even took your position.

55
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,730
Mom, I have a question.

56
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,870
Do you remember Ms. Kim Do Hee?

57
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,240
Why did you misunderstand her
for Gi Chan's mistress,

58
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,510
instead of Se Ri?

59
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,180
I fell for that brat's trick.

60
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,990
I told you that someone sent a photo
to your number, right?

61
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,800
Do you want hard evidence?

62
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,040
It's this bracelet.

63
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,910
You crazy punk!

64
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,710
Stop it! Let go of him.

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,020
It was you?

66
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,620
You made a fool out of me?

67
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,020
Sorry. Happy now?

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,090
I had no idea
and asked Kang Se Ri...

69
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,830
to find out if there was a woman
who seemed to be close to Gi Chan.

70
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,800
It's all my fault.

71
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,840
You were right. I...

72
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,110
I killed Kim Do Hee,
that innocent woman.

73
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,250
It's all my fault. It's on me.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
All right. Let's go inside.

75
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,140
No one else is home,
so you can play with me today.

76
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,440
Okay.

77
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,270
What's your blood type,
Uncle Gi Man?

78
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,210
Me? I'm a type O.

79
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,910
Why do you ask?

80
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,050
I'm a type AB.

81
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,450
What? No way.

82
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,820
Your daddy's a type O, just like me.

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,290
Do you know
what your mommy's blood type is?

84
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,660
I don't.

85
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,660
But I did a physical checkup
at the kindergarten last time.

86
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,360
I'm a type AB.

87
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,660
What?

88
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,700
Look.

89
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,870
(Hwang Ji Ho, Blood Type: AB)

90
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,010
Aren't I right? I'm a type AB.

91
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,110
Yes, right.

92
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,430
Oh Seong.

93
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,760
Yes, hello.

94
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,900
Wait a second.

95
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,540
Oh Seong.

96
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,810
Life is just too tough for me.

97
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,550
Please continue.

98
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,320
Wait.

99
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,090
No, wait.

100
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,190
I'm at work,

101
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,090
so I can't do something like this.

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,260
What?

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,930
What brings you here?

104
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,000
If you're here to see the chairman,
you're on the wrong floor.

105
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,970
No, it's not that.

106
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,940
It's Kang Jae In...

107
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,570
I mean, the female employee
who used to work here.

108
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,940
She's making my life miserable.

109
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,410
Ms. Kang?

110
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,080
As you probably heard,

111
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,550
she was once my daughter-in-law,

112
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,090
and she lost her memories
in a car accident.

113
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,120
She even forgot
that she divorced my son.

114
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,860
My son felt bad...

115
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,030
and let her stay with us
for a while.

116
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,070
But she only pretended
like she had lost her memories,

117
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,500
but she actually didn't.

118
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,870
Is that so?

119
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,310
Yes.

120
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,910
I'm the only one who knows.

121
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,280
I keep telling everyone...

122
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,610
that she didn't lose her memories,

123
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,190
but no one in my family
would believe me.

124
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,890
I see.

125
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,220
Have you been
stressed out a lot lately?

126
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,890
I'm not just stressed out.

127
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,660
I can probably fall over
and collapse any minute now.

128
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,700
You believe me, don't you?

129
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,170
Don't you?

130
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,170
I heard you could run
a dementia test once you hit 60.

131
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,470
I recently read in a news article...

132
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,280
that the symptoms include...

133
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,780
suspicion, delusion,
and inappropriate sexual behavior.

134
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,350
You should get a check-up
before it's too late.

135
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,020
He's not here, Mom.

136
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,330
See? He isn't here.

137
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,170
Why would I lie to you?

138
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,570
You're here, Mother.

139
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,340
- Where's Gi Chan?
- He has a meeting outside.

140
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,010
Darn it. What are the chances?

141
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,280
When is he coming back?

142
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,810
He's not. He'll go straight home
if it goes on for a while.

143
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,950
Mom, I'm busy. I have to go.

144
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,860
I'm so frustrated.

145
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,130
I don't even want to go home.

146
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,330
I keep telling everyone
she didn't lose her memories,

147
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,860
but no one will listen to me.

148
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,170
Mother, does Jae In
really remember everything?

149
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,240
Otherwise, why would I say
such nonsense?

150
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,010
But I have no idea
why she's pretending...

151
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,650
to have lost her memories.

152
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,350
Is she trying to hit on Gi Chan?

153
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,250
That's probably
why she got pregnant.

154
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,590
I knew something was
suspicious about her.

155
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,490
Is she trying to hit on Gi Chan
to kick me out?

156
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,530
You believe me, right?

157
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,830
Of course.

158
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,730
I'm your daughter-in-law,
so who else would I believe?

159
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,700
But Mother,

160
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,840
you need evidence
to let Gi Chan believe you.

161
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,510
You're right.

162
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,180
You should make a voice recording.
You can do that with your phone.

163
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,180
What? I don't know how to do that.

164
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,450
It's too hard.

165
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,280
Then, why don't you do this?

166
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,760
How's my mom?

167
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,000
I put her on a sedative,
so she'll sleep for a few hours.

168
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,440
You're looking for the photo...

169
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,740
she mentioned just now, right?

170
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,540
Yes. I think I set up my phone
so that it automatically saves...

171
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,880
all photos that come in,
including text messages.

172
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,780
I'm trying to see
if it's saved in the cloud storage.

173
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,220
It's been a while,
so I'm not sure if it's still there.

174
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,520
(My Drive, Restored Files, Messages)

175
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,190
(My Drive, Restored Files, Messages)

176
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,770
What she said was true.

177
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,540
This was the trigger.

178
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,880
She made a move first
after seeing this picture...

179
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,850
because she didn't want me
to be hurt.

180
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,150
I have to check the photo
she got from Se Ri.

181
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,760
(Hello, Ms. Choi.
It's me, Se Ri. I'm sending you...)

182
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,060
(Mr. Hwang's pictures
just as you wanted.)

183
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,900
Se Ri.

184
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,600
Everything began because of you.

185
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,800
It was all because of you.

186
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,080
Yu Gyeong.

187
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,520
Can you let my mom
stay here for a while?

188
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,450
Sure. Don't worry about her.

189
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,990
My dad and I will look after her.

190
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,690
Thank you.

191
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,630
Thank you so much.

192
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,080
Come here, my daughter-in-law.

193
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,180
You can talk to me.

194
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,890
Come here.

195
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,230
I'm hungry.
Can you make me some food?

196
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,100
Of course, I can.

197
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,540
Please give me a moment.

198
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,640
Hey, wait.

199
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,680
I want some braised short ribs.
You won't make that, will you?

200
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,550
I'll make it delicious.

201
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,480
It'll take an hour or two,

202
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,720
so if you feel hungry,
I can bring some snacks.

203
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,150
Just act like your usual self.

204
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,920
Tell me to make it myself
and refuse to cook!

205
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,160
Okay, then.

206
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,160
Make it yourself or whatever.
I don't care.

207
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,330
What? Hey, give me that!

208
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,870
That's mine!

209
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,140
What? Darn it.

210
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,940
You'd better not get the idea...

211
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,310
to deceive me like this again.

212
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,880
Darn it.

213
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,180
How dare you copy my buzzword?

214
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,850
You've made a name for yourself
as an elderly YouTuber.

215
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,620
Sit around quietly
if you don't want to expose...

216
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,920
your dysfunctional family.

217
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,860
I also have
lots of videos to upload.

218
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,230
Don't be ridiculous.
You don't have any videos.

219
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,200
Remember kneeling and begging me
over Gi Man's kidnapping attempt?

220
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,770
Do you think
I still have that video or not?

221
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,940
She's become so sly...

222
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,280
after coming back from the dead.
Good grief.

223
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,250
That's so adorable, Ji Ho.

224
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,420
It looks so good. How cute.

225
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,090
- What's this?
- I made eyes, nose, and mouth.

226
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,360
Ji Ho, you're so good at this.

227
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,070
So? Are you having fun?

228
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,200
Yes, I'm having so much fun.

229
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,240
It's a teddy bear, right?

230
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,540
But it's missing a nose.

231
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,810
Do you want Mommy's help?

232
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,240
Yes.

233
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,910
Daddy!

234
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,550
Hey, honey. When did you get here?

235
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,220
Hey. Just now.

236
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,950
I'll clean up and make dinner,
so you should shower first.

237
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,790
All right. Take your time.

238
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,000
Ji Ho, wash your hands.
You got them dirty.

239
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,530
After I finish making these.
I'm having fun.

240
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,570
Ji Ho, Daddy's hungry,

241
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,200
so let's bake just these
and clean up the rest.

242
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,340
You can wash your hands.
Mommy will clean up.

243
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

244
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,330
Yu Gyeong, can you send that now?

245
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,430
Hey, is dinner ready?

246
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,140
Are you seeing another woman?

247
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,040
What are you talking about?

248
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,780
Then, what's this photo?

249
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,860
What's this photo?

250
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,430
Where did you get it?

251
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,860
Someone sent it to me now
from a restricted number.

252
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,700
This is you.

253
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,400
Who's this woman by your side?

254
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,780
That bracelet...

255
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,410
Is it you?

256
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,520
How can you do this?

257
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,820
What are you talking about?

258
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,260
Look. This is you, isn't it?

259
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,190
What's going on
between you and my husband?

260
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,660
Honey, no. That's not me.

261
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,200
No?

262
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,300
Then, what's this photo?

263
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,740
Technology has come a long way
while you were in bed.

264
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,570
It's called Deepfake.

265
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,280
The technology makes
fake photos look real,

266
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,810
and it's been used in crimes, too.

267
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,210
Let me reassure you
that the photo isn't me.

268
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,180
Someone edited my face
in that photo with malicious intent.

269
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,550
But that bracelet...

270
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,290
This was popular.

271
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,160
It wasn't even a limited edition,
so everyone had one.

272
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,830
You don't even see my face
in that photo.

273
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,330
As Gi Chan said, it was someone
who had malicious intent.

274
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,530
But still.

275
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,370
Honey, why would I lie to you?

276
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,610
Trust me. Okay?

277
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,250
All right. I'll trust you.

278
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,080
But still, I don't get it.

279
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,350
Why would anyone send this to me?

280
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,550
I wonder.

281
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,720
What can anyone get
from coming between you and me?

282
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,330
How brazen of you.
Let's see how far you'll take this.

283
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,460
It must've been Choi Ja Young.

284
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,700
Her mind has been everywhere,

285
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,330
so she must've sent it
when she had her sanity.

286
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,340
I don't see your mom around, Jae In.

287
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,710
She wanted to meet an old friend,
so she left for a few days.

288
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,040
Why do you ask about her?

289
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,280
No reason.
I didn't see her, so I got curious.

290
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,420
I washed my hands.

291
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,550
Are the cookies ready?

292
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,690
Not yet.
Do you want to go and see them?

293
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,030
Follow me quietly.

294
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,670
I warned you, didn't I?

295
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,270
I didn't do it.

296
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,380
It must've been Choi Ja Young.
I know it.

297
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,310
How can she send her
a picture of us?

298
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,480
Why would she have that photo?

299
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,050
You sent pictures...

300
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,920
of you two in bed to Jae In
as if you wanted her to know.

301
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,990
Who did?

302
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,490
If she had seen it,
she wouldn't have sat around.

303
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,160
Of course, she didn't see it.

304
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,930
I didn't want her to get shocked,
so I deleted everything.

305
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,830
Do you want hard evidence?

306
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,600
It's this bracelet.

307
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
I saw a hand with this bracelet...

308
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,340
sitting on top of your bare chest
with my own two eyes!

309
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,680
It was you.

310
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,750
I could never figure out
how Choi Ja Young found out,

311
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,120
and it was you.

312
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,490
- If it hadn't been for you...
- If so, then what?

313
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,420
Are you trying to say...

314
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,460
you would've kept a beautiful family
with Jae In?

315
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,860
Is that so?

316
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,130
I don't know about that,

317
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,130
but I wouldn't have become
a murderer.

318
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,970
It wasn't me. I didn't do it!

319
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,070
Stop shouting.

320
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,310
The photo happened a long time ago,
so I won't blame you for it.

321
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,840
Honey, everything is
too hard for me.

322
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,480
Let's just kick Jae In out. Please?

323
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,550
If you do anything weirder...

324
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,480
Feel free to imagine...

325
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,750
what will happen next.

326
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,900
We received a payment for
the fire damage at our old place,

327
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,200
as well
as your husband's death benefit?

328
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,230
Apparently so.

329
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,600
It was paid out under my name,

330
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,300
but I don't remember
getting anything.

331
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,540
I may have been out of my mind
after he died in that fire,

332
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,540
but I couldn't forget receiving
such a huge amount of money.

333
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,310
Someone must've pretended to be you
and taken the payment.

334
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,120
Insurance fraud.
This is insurance fraud!

335
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,550
That's crazy. Why would
someone do that under my name?

336
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,220
How would anyone know me?

337
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,960
I had no idea I even had a plan.

338
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,460
My husband must've taken out a plan
without telling me...

339
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,100
when he fell ill
because he felt guilty about me.

340
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,870
Something smells fishy.

341
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,600
And that old insurance planner,
Kim Mi Gyeong,

342
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,010
is still out of reach?

343
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,040
No. If my late husband
took out a plan,

344
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,250
it had to be through her.

345
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,250
Keep reaching out to her.

346
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,220
I don't think
this is a simple mishap.

347
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,490
Uncle Do Yun,
I'm done with my picture journal.

348
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,920
Can you check my spelling?

349
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,660
All right. Let me see.

350
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,890
Okay. Today...

351
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,530
You want to work?

352
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,330
We finished
talking about it last time.

353
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,130
I want to go back to work.

354
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,800
Shouldn't you be careful
in the early stage of pregnancy?

355
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,610
I keep imagining weird things
when I sit at home...

356
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,870
about you and Se Ri...

357
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,280
I keep telling myself to stop,
but I continue doing it.

358
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,120
I'd only feel assured
if I were around you.

359
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,150
All right, then.

360
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,890
But you have to be careful.

361
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,920
I will.

362
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,610
Goodness.

363
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

364
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,650
I'm returning to work as of today.

365
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,120
We'll see each other often,
so I look forward to cooperating.

366
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,190
I should be saying that to you.

367
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,830
Honey, let's go.

368
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
Okay.

369
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,380
You all know each other,
so no introduction is necessary.

370
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,120
She's joining
the Planning and Design Team as of today.

371
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,050
It's great to be here,

372
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,360
Team Leader Kang
and Assistant Manager Kang.

373
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,860
How is she going to work
without her memories?

374
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,360
Did Chairman Hwang approve of this?

375
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,130
People may hear that
and think you're my boss.

376
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,070
I have authority
in personnel affairs for this team.

377
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,670
You can take this desk, Ms. Kang.

378
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,410
Think of this as a training process
until your memories return.

379
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,480
Okay.

380
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,050
Mr. Kang, we must go to a meeting.

381
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,450
Yes.

382
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,820
Good luck, Jae In.

383
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,530
Why are you glaring at me like that?

384
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,500
Talk to me
if you have anything to say.

385
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,930
No, get to work.

386
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,470
Don't be delusional, Se Ri.

387
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,370
I'm not here to work.

388
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,810
I'm here to keep an eye on you.

389
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,310
What do you mean?

390
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,480
How can you ask me that...

391
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,520
after seeing that photo yesterday?

392
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,320
Kang Se Ri.

393
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,120
Do not come near my husband.

394
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,730
(Gi Man)

395
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,370
You came all the way here
just to see me...

396
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,600
and not Gi Chan? This is new.

397
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,700
It'll turn into huge trouble
if I go to Gi Chan over this.

398
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,510
We'll talk after you look at this.

399
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,080
(Test Result)

400
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,310
(Test Result)

401
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,650
(Probability of Parentage:
Unlikely, 0.012 percent)

402
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,830
It turns out that Gi Chan was
raising someone else's kid.

403
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,570
I can't believe this.

404
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,240
Someone might hear you.

405
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,970
Are you sure he doesn't know yet?

406
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,340
Not yet.

407
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,640
I thought you could make better use
of the result than he.

408
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,080
You would've shown this to him
if you wanted to expose the truth.

409
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,880
You must've come to me
because you wanted something.

410
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,120
What is it? I'll give you anything.

411
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,360
First of all, I need to set up
an investment company again.

412
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,560
Let's begin with a million dollars
for the initial investment.

413
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,130
Can I have it by tomorrow?

414
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,300
How am I going to find
that much money by tomorrow?

415
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,130
I need more time.

416
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,870
Why? Will you run over to Gi Chan...

417
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,570
and whine to him
just as you did last time?

418
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,470
No, this time, you can't do that
because you betrayed him.

419
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,780
Don't try to pull a trick
and get the money ready.

420
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,980
Let's settle this matter amicably...

421
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,420
between family members.

422
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,800
Can we check the file...

423
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,330
for the final window sample?

424
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,240
Yes, I'll share it
as soon as it's finished.

425
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,740
Mr. Kang, will you just say it?

426
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,450
Your blazing eyes are
about to turn me into ashes.

427
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,380
It's a private matter.

428
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,090
What's going on between you
and Chairman Hwang's mother?

429
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
There is nothing going on.

430
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,690
Then, why did she
come here to see you?

431
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,990
She had some passionate eyes.

432
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,230
Didn't you catch my face?

433
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,430
I almost turned into Joker,

434
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,640
trying my best
to keep a cordial smile.

435
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,710
That smile was where it went wrong.
You should've been firm.

436
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,970
Don't you know that?

437
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,840
Let me leave you
with that piece of advice...

438
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,680
because people will think
you're a gigolo.

439
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,050
Have you ever seen
a gigolo this rich?

440
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,850
I lived my life diligently
not to prey on women.

441
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,350
Isn't that so, Mr. Kim?

442
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,660
Sure. Of course.

443
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,590
I can guarantee that, Mr. Kang.

444
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,030
Let's continue with the meeting.

445
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,400
Yu Gyeong! I'm setting up
my investment company again.

446
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,070
I got a decent investment.

447
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,740
I can even let you open
your own clinic.

448
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,340
No, never mind.

449
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,110
You won't have
to work another day in your life.

450
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,550
I won't let you suffer anymore,

451
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,620
so let's get back together.

452
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,020
Stop talking nonsense
and just leave.

453
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,120
I understand
it may seem like nonsense right now.

454
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
I've done enough damage,
so I understand.

455
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,630
But give me some more time.
First off, yes.

456
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,600
I'll get myself a nice car
and come for you.

457
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,510
Look who this is.

458
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,950
I thought you might be here,
and you were.

459
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,250
Ms. Choi, you did this, right?

460
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,890
If you deleted
the photo I sent to Jae In,

461
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,890
you had to be
the only one who has seen it.

462
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,800
How did that come out into the open?

463
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,230
Why did you send it to Jae In?

464
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,370
Don't be ridiculous and leave.

465
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,700
I wouldn't have opened the door
had I known it was you.

466
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,110
I heard you have dementia.

467
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,480
Or did you put on a show
pretending to have one?

468
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,620
Look at me, woman.

469
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,960
Look at me! Look!

470
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,420
What do you think you're doing?

471
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,700
Are you okay, Ms. Choi?

472
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,100
Get her out of here now.

473
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,630
She's insane.

474
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,670
All right.

475
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,840
Didn't you hear that?

476
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,780
Get out of this house.

477
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,540
Don't you know who I am?

478
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,980
I'm the wife of YL's chairman,
Hwang Gi Chan.

479
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,520
I don't care even if you're
the president's daughter.

480
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,020
If you come in here again,

481
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,720
I'll sue you for trespassing,
so get out of here!

482
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,040
Ji Ho!

483
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,610
- Daddy!
- Hey, Ji Ho.

484
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,610
Mommy's here, too.

485
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,280
Let me say hello to Grandma.

486
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,280
No, thanks. Let's skip that.

487
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,820
What are you doing in there?

488
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,490
I'm making dinner.

489
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Someone might tamper with the food
and try to kill me,

490
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,790
so I had to make my own food
to save myself.

491
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,160
I was giving her a hand.

492
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,530
Isn't that right?

493
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,470
Yes, you may be an awful cook,
but it's better than nothing.

494
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,740
Something smells awful.

495
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,680
Do you want to go out and eat?

496
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,910
Honey, let's go out with Ji Ho.

497
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,950
- Yes. Okay.
- Let's go, Ji Ho.

498
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,920
Let's eat out, Ji Ho.

499
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,320
That girl...

500
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,190
She's...

501
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,230
She might do something
to harm Jae In.

502
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,030
It's too dangerous
to let her stay there.

503
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,800
No.

504
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,610
I'll go there and get her myself.

505
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,610
No.

506
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,720
- Gi Chan and Jae In left for work.
- Sure.

507
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,820
Hey. You can't leave like this.

508
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,190
Give me the money you promised.

509
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,090
It's going to take a while.

510
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,860
It's a lot of money, you know.

511
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,660
What kind of a trick
are you trying to pull this time?

512
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,600
I don't trust you. Give it to me.

513
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,070
Give me some time, Gi Man.

514
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,840
Everything had been
making my life difficult lately.

515
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,610
I'm not refusing to give it to you.
I'm just asking for time.

516
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,310
Can't you do that?

517
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,340
I don't care about your situation.

518
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,680
Never mind, then.

519
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,580
I'll tell Gi Chan the truth.

520
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,680
I should do it in person
instead of calling...

521
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,750
to make it easier to believe, right?

522
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,320
Okay.

523
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,520
Gi Man!

524
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,990
Gi Man!

525
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,390
Can we talk?

526
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,760
Gi Man!

527
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,430
Darn it.

528
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,470
I'll handle this my way.
Stop following me.

529
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,410
Darn it. Hey.

530
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,880
Stop acting like a kid...

531
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,480
and talk to me.

532
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,220
What did you say?
Did you call me a kid?

533
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,620
Did you call
your elder brother-in-law a kid?

534
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,450
It was a mistake.

535
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,090
I'll give you 10,000 dollars first.

536
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,690
Forget it.

537
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:00,060
What I hate the most is
comparing people,

538
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,100
but my old sister-in-law, not you,

539
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,100
would let me borrow money gladly
whenever I asked.

540
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,000
I just got too conscious
of Gi Chan to ask often.

541
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,440
My old sister-in-law
was such a kind person,

542
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,710
so I never had to blackmail her.

543
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,950
- That's enough.
- He must be crazy.

544
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,880
What an idiot.

545
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,480
What does he see in you?

546
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,990
Jae In was
a much better wife to him.

547
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,220
I'm asking this
out of pure curiosity.

548
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,290
Can you be honest?

549
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,560
Who's Ji Ho's dad?

550
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,500
Where does he live?

551
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,870
In America?

552
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,770
Or is he in Korea?

553
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,840
So? Should I expose...

554
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,810
this crazy secret?

555
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:47,630
(Queen's House)

556
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,930
Who are you?
Why are you looking for Gi Man?

557
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,330
The police station?

558
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,040
Honestly speaking,

559
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,370
I never treated Gi Man
like an older brother.

560
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,340
Should I start dating?

561
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,710
Is there someone you like?

562
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,350
- What about you?
- What?

563
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,280
I'll call you back
after checking the schedule.

564
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,960
What's wrong, honey?
