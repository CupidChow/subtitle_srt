1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,910
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,410
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,050
Bo Ram, you like
sweet pumpkin porridge, right?

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,690
What's wrong? Hey.

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,050
Do you not want some?

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,490
No.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,460
It's not that.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,430
Grandma, something is weird.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,760
In the morning,

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,300
Ms. Kang's clothes and bags were
all gone from the small room.

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,470
My friend is here, Bo Ram.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,240
Do you remember the granny
who works with me?

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,480
Yes, Ms. Mi Sook,
the lady who defeated villains.

15
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,880
Yes, she's sleeping
in the master bedroom right now.

16
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,150
Why don't you go and say hello?

17
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,250
Okay.

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,630
I brought Bo Ram home.

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,090
Are you up?

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,060
Grandma, Ms. Mi Sook is gone.

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,470
I don't see her here.

22
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,540
You're right.
Is she in the bathroom?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
Can you go there
and knock on the door?

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,740
Okay.

25
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,650
You're home.

26
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,160
Hello, Ms. Jung.

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,090
Mi Sook?

28
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,990
She just came home.

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,500
I got worried and called.
She suddenly left without a word.

30
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,600
I hope everything is okay.

31
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,670
Yes, everything is fine.

32
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,940
Okay, then.

33
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,110
Goodbye.

34
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,810
Yes, goodbye.

35
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,750
Is something going on?

36
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,690
It must've been
a huge surprise for Ms. Jung.

37
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,390
She must be shocked, too.

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,900
I should've left
when CEO Jung found out who I was.

39
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,270
I knew this would happen,

40
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,740
but I still hesitated...

41
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,970
because I wanted too much.

42
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,580
My stay at your place was...

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,450
like a period of healing for me.

44
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,120
I loved the way
she offered her kindness,

45
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,920
her smile,

46
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,990
and caring words to me.

47
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,630
I also cherished
the time I shared with Bo Ram.

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,030
It felt like...

49
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,800
I was really a part of your family
when I was there, and I was just...

50
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,810
happy.

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,950
My mom is
just deeply disappointed in me.

52
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,010
And it's my fault, too.

53
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,620
I was the one who brought you home.

54
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,190
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,790
No.

56
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,720
I should be sorry...

57
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,760
for hurting everyone in your family.

58
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,230
I must've seemed so shameless
in Ms. Jung's shoes.

59
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,570
She probably thought I had
no shame or a sense of guilt.

60
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,700
Don't be so hard on yourself.

61
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,070
It wasn't your fault.

62
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,640
After you moved in with us,

63
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,510
my mom became much happier,

64
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,980
and Bo Ram also got better,
so I didn't want to lose that.

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,680
I should've told her
before this happened.

66
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,920
It's mostly my fault
for not telling her earlier.

67
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,030
I couldn't even say goodbye
to Bo Ram.

68
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,360
Please tell her goodbye for me.

69
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,730
I will.

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,430
I hope one day,

71
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,700
I'll get my chance
to apologize to Ms. Jung.

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,770
I really hope that day comes.

73
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,110
It won't be anytime soon,

74
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,310
but there will come a day
when my mom understands you.

75
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,180
So, how did she find out?

76
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,750
Did Gi Chan send her something?

77
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,060
Director Kang visited her
at the restaurant.

78
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,330
My aunt?

79
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,100
It looks like
she slept in the office.

80
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
Her suitcase was here, too.

81
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,840
Hey, Dr. Do.
I have a favor to ask you.

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,380
I knew you'd get it as her friend.

83
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,550
Please take care of Jae In.

84
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,280
As I said,
I can't take her home anymore.

85
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,890
All right. Let's stay in touch.

86
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,700
Are you coming
from DH Holdings' headquarters?

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,600
Yes, I had a lot to do.

88
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,170
What happened yesterday,
Uncle Oh Seong?

89
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,570
You went out to get some air,
but you stayed the night out.

90
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,840
I already told you.

91
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,370
I got too drunk
at the bar and fell asleep.

92
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,710
Forget about that.

93
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,350
Has she not come to work?

94
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,950
No, she went to see
Director Kang Mi Ran.

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,890
Director Kang? Why?

96
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,220
Right. I see.

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,060
Okay.

98
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,330
I heard you went to see
Director Kim Do Yun's mother...

99
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,570
and exposed my identity
in your own words.

100
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,600
Do you feel better now?

101
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,040
Do I look like it?

102
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,140
No, I don't feel any better.

103
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Is it a fault to share a fact?

104
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,150
You didn't have to do that.

105
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,820
You could've given me
a chance to explain.

106
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,750
I didn't get a chance to explain myself
to Seung Woo, either.

107
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,860
That was why you exposed me?

108
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,820
Because you were angry with my mom?

109
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,390
Yes, that's it.

110
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,190
You only care about yourself,
don't you?

111
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,100
No matter how angry you were,

112
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,130
you didn't even consider
how shocking it would be...

113
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,570
for Director Kim's mother.

114
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,200
Those are my words.

115
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,340
Where did you get the idea
to stay there?

116
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,610
Haven't you any conscience?

117
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,780
Don't you know
why your mom killed Ms. Kim Do Hee?

118
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,180
Do you really think
that's a good enough excuse...

119
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,220
for what you did?

120
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,160
You didn't do this because you were
worried about Ms. Kim's mother.

121
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,090
You exposed me out of spite...

122
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,860
only because you hated my mom.

123
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,060
What do you think you know about me
to denounce me?

124
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,860
Exactly.

125
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,530
The aunt I always knew
wasn't like this.

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,140
I'm starting
to find you frightening.

127
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,210
You seem like a monster.

128
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,440
If you have the slightest bit
of conscience left,

129
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,980
don't ever visit her again.

130
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,950
Do not hurt her anymore.

131
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,930
Yes, it's this part.

132
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,310
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,480
Let's focus on work when we're here
and discuss our family affair later.

134
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,850
Yes, sir.

135
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,850
But I thought I should mention this.

136
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,960
Yun Hee is very soft-hearted.

137
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,190
She must've felt greatly betrayed,

138
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,030
but it just means
she adored you that much.

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,070
Yes.

140
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,700
All right. Let's get to work.
Come on over.

141
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,400
Yes, sir.

142
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,510
First of all, I'll make
a strong demand to Hwang Gi Chan...

143
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,710
about Kang Se Ri's position at work,

144
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,010
so you two can stop minding her
and focus on work.

145
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,550
Have you found anything
on H and K Company?

146
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:34,820
Our US headquarters is
tracking its funds,

147
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,160
and I noticed many suspicious things
after finding out who Catherine was.

148
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,590
Hey, there.

149
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,770
What are you doing?

150
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,440
Your eyes are bloated.

151
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,670
Did you eat ramyeon late last night,

152
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
or did you cry a river?

153
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,380
What are you talking about?
I didn't cry.

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,750
Right.
You don't know anything about me.

155
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,090
I was infamous for not crying
since I was a kid,

156
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,090
so my friends would worry
and wonder if I had ever cried.

157
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,860
- I have dry...
- You have dry eyes?

158
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,430
Yes, I do have dry eyes!

159
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,760
Get it?

160
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,930
Never mind, then.

161
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,770
But Mr. Kang, a man should cry
only three times in his life.

162
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,340
You can't cry too often.

163
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,340
What are you talking about?
I said no. I didn't cry!

164
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,870
Never mind, then.

165
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,780
What?

166
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
Are you teasing me?

167
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,110
And watch what you say.

168
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,220
Gender doesn't matter
when it comes to crying.

169
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,420
Why can't men cry?

170
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,850
Is it wrong to cry?

171
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,550
That's an old-fashioned stereotype.

172
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,920
Have you only cried three times?

173
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,930
That's a secret.

174
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,370
What's with him?
Why did he smirk like that?

175
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,240
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

176
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm here, Director Kang.

177
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,490
Are you going to continue to come?

178
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,630
Yes, I'm an adult,
so I should do my part...

179
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,160
and be responsible.

180
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,240
Seung Woo.

181
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,280
All I can do right now is
treat you as a boss.

182
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,910
I don't know about anything else.

183
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,480
I don't know
what my decision will be.

184
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,420
I need some time.

185
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,750
Yes, you should take your time.

186
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,020
I'm just grateful
that you decided to brace yourself.

187
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,990
You should get to work.

188
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,100
Yes, ma'am.

189
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,040
I waited this long,

190
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,570
so I can wait some more.

191
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,480
Yes, I will.

192
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,750
I have to go to LA alone?

193
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,680
Yes.

194
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,950
Are you trying to get rid of me?

195
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,690
A Korean-style apartment complex
will be built in Koreatown,

196
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,520
and we got the interior job.

197
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,530
I'll create a shell company
as the agency...

198
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,160
and send the investment
from DH Holdings there.

199
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,330
We have H and K Company.

200
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,130
DH Holdings probably knows
about H and K Company already.

201
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,300
It was a subcontractor for YL Group.

202
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,610
We should get rid of all suspicions
to reduce further trouble.

203
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,450
Chairman Hwang,
the CEO of DH Holdings is here.

204
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,290
Hello.

205
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,120
I stopped by my office
and came by to say hello.

206
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,530
You're still coming to work.

207
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:04,760
I'm guessing you like your seat
in the staff lounge.

208
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,700
I have to keep coming
until we hire a replacement.

209
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,070
It sounds like you want to keep coming
if there is no replacement.

210
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,640
The rule still stands.

211
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,940
If you're trying to buy time
with the temporary seat in the lounge,

212
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,080
you'll leave us no choice
but to press you harder.

213
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,050
Promises are important to me, too.

214
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,420
It's the root of our trust,
so of course, I'll keep the promise.

215
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,550
Please give us a bit more time.

216
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,190
All right, then.

217
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,190
I must've interrupted
the married couple...

218
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,100
from having a conversation.

219
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,400
Please excuse me.
I've said my hello.

220
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,290
Let me go first.

221
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,290
Nothing happened.

222
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,860
We were both completely drunk,
so how could anything happen?

223
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,030
It was just an accident.
Just think of it as a mishap.

224
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,970
It was nothing more, nothing less.

225
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,840
Thank you.

226
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,510
You just said
exactly what I wanted to say.

227
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,180
I'm glad we're on the same page.

228
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,710
As you want, I'll consider that
nothing happened last night.

229
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,850
Excuse me.

230
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,030
I'll leave first.

231
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,870
Goodbye. I'll also leave
right after I finish this.

232
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,310
All right. See you tomorrow.

233
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,390
Did you leave something...

234
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,790
Hey, Yu Gyeong.

235
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,500
What brings you here?
You didn't even call.

236
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,170
If you're here to see Director Kim,
he just left.

237
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,700
I came to see you.

238
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,010
Let's go.

239
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,280
What are you doing? Give me that.

240
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,950
We're going to our place.

241
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,380
Dr. Kim told me everything.

242
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,020
I was a little disappointed.

243
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,050
Why didn't you ask
your friend for help? What is this?

244
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,290
My mom is staying there, too.

245
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,060
I couldn't be another nuisance.

246
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,560
I'll find a motel to stay at
later tonight.

247
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,030
What do you mean, a motel?

248
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,360
Stop arguing with me
and come to my place.

249
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,630
Your mom will get mad at me
for not caring if she finds out,

250
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
and I don't want her
to be mad at me.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,140
Let's go.

252
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,410
Come on in.

253
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,620
I told her to stay here for a while.

254
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,190
Please excuse me, Mr. Do.

255
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,920
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,790
Don't say that.
Of course, you should stay here.

257
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,530
It's all right.

258
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,260
I'll make dinner.

259
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,670
Put your stuff down,
get changed, and come out.

260
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,130
Ms. Choi is in the room, too.

261
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,570
Okay.

262
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,840
Dad. Dr. Kim's mother...

263
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,380
I mean the owner
of the chicken place.

264
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,450
She found out
who Jae In's mother was.

265
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,850
So, she was
kicked out of their home?

266
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,860
Yes, so, can Ms. Choi
continue to work there?

267
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,960
If she does,
the owner may find out who she is.

268
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,670
How...

269
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,870
can this be?

270
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,170
Ms. Jung was Kim Do Hee's mother?

271
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,710
How can fate be so cruel?

272
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,480
She was the first person
I could talk to, so I liked her.

273
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,290
Mom, I'm here.

274
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,420
Mom?

275
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,830
What's on your mind?
You didn't even realize I was here.

276
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,730
It's nothing.

277
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,000
Anyway, why are you here?

278
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,210
What's that?

279
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,640
Something happened at the place
I was staying, so I had to leave.

280
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,310
Yu Gyeong said...

281
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,310
I could stay here with you,
so I came.

282
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,180
Is that okay?

283
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,990
I don't know
what's happening with that family,

284
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,320
but don't they have any courtesy?

285
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,190
How can they suddenly kick you out,
no matter what happened?

286
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,890
Things just happened
out of the blue.

287
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,560
It wasn't their fault.

288
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,930
They are at fault for...

289
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,570
My daughter passed away.

290
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,640
Then, someone who was
as lovely and nice...

291
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,200
as my daughter came into my life.

292
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,840
She wasn't in a good situation,
so I told her to stay here.

293
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,240
My granddaughter, Bo Ram,

294
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,980
also adored her like a mother.

295
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,120
I thought she was a present
and treasure sent by my girl.

296
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,550
But she turned out to be...

297
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,820
the daughter of the woman
who killed my daughter.

298
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,930
No, had she been staying
at her place?

299
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,830
At that...

300
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,800
Why are you looking at me like that?

301
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,370
Never mind. It's nothing.

302
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,640
The people I stayed with...

303
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,310
weren't evil people
as you thought they were.

304
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,880
They're great people.

305
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,850
There was a circumstance
that made me leave,

306
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,860
and it was inevitable.

307
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,530
So, it was that place.

308
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,930
I need to get some rest.

309
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,530
Yu Gyeong is making dinner,
so let's eat first, Mom.

310
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,190
Do you need something, Bo Ram?

311
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,990
No, I miss Ms. Kang.

312
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,900
Uncle Do Yun, why isn't she coming?

313
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,900
She won't come anymore.

314
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,500
Why not?

315
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,300
She moved to a nicer place.

316
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,470
So, stop asking for her. Okay?

317
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,280
This is your favorite side dish.

318
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,080
Chew it well.

319
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,910
I'm going to feel sick later.

320
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,790
I need some water.

321
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,440
Do you want more soup?

322
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,840
No.

323
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,110
Don't be upset.

324
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,210
- Jae In...
- Enough.

325
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,650
I don't even want to hear that name.

326
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,120
Just thinking about how
she and I shared the same air,

327
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,280
laughed, and chatted together
makes me shudder.

328
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,790
It's appalling.

329
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,990
She wanted to tell you,

330
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,360
but I stopped her.

331
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,360
What are you talking about? Why?

332
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,660
I didn't want you to be shocked.

333
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,330
Is that all?

334
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,830
Or are you really into her?

335
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,470
Why won't you say anything?

336
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,440
Is that the case?

337
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,170
No.

338
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,480
Of course, you should say no.

339
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,780
She's our enemy.

340
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,410
She's our enemy's daughter.

341
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,980
I should've listened to you
instead of letting her stay here.

342
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,650
You were
completely against the idea,

343
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,090
so I brought this upon myself.

344
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,860
Don't ever mention her name again,
even to Bo Ram.

345
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,260
As you just said,

346
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,370
I'll consider that you did this
to prevent my shock,

347
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
so don't ever do that again
unless you want to end my life.

348
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,010
If Kang Mi Ran didn't tell me,
you and your uncle...

349
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,380
would've lied to me until the end.

350
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,980
What are you talking about?
Kang Mi Ran?

351
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,980
That woman told you about Ms. Kang?

352
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,190
I guess so.

353
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,250
She must've gone crazy.

354
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,360
She came here and announced
that our family was dysfunctional.

355
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,490
You need to remember this, too.

356
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,330
If you hide anything else from me,
that'll be the end of you, too.

357
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,830
Oh, my. How scary. All right.

358
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,640
Mi Sook asked me
to give this to you.

359
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,810
She's quitting.

360
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,150
She doesn't need a letter of
resignation to quit a part-time job.

361
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,920
No, forget that. Why?
Why is she suddenly quitting?

362
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,820
Did something happen at home?

363
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,450
No, it's not that.

364
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,020
She seems unwell.

365
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,560
Come to think of it,
she had been taking medicine lately.

366
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,130
She said it was a health supplement,
so I figured that was so.

367
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,700
She came to my place yesterday
and left without a word,

368
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,200
but she didn't pick up her phone
when I called.

369
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,140
That was why I called you.

370
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,270
Mi Sook was at your place yesterday?

371
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,940
Yes, and she suddenly says
she wants to quit today,

372
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,080
so I began to wonder
if I did something yesterday.

373
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,820
She can quit,

374
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,190
but can you ask her
to stop by one of these days?

375
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,750
I thought we were good friends.

376
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,360
It's such a shame
to say goodbye like this.

377
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,390
All right. I'll let her know.

378
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,430
It's such a shame,
no matter how much I think about it.

379
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,600
A new business opened this quickly?

380
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,750
Hello.

381
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,920
Why are you here?

382
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,060
It's my store.

383
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,560
Why are you here?

384
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,060
I had to beg you...

385
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,530
to help your husband
when he ran a business.

386
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,900
Then, you'd come reluctantly
and leave as soon as you were done.

387
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,700
Was this why you made my son
wrap up his business?

388
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,240
All you wanted was this space,

389
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,140
so you divorced him
by putting on a show,

390
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,070
pretending like you wanted
to get pregnant, even quitting your job.

391
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,110
Try to make some sense.

392
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,380
Does it make any sense
that you took over...

393
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,080
my son's store
as if you had been waiting?

394
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,350
Forget it. The divorce is canceled.

395
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,720
Your divorce is invalid.

396
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,920
It was a scam.
Yes, it was a sham divorce.

397
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,590
That's not a thing.

398
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,960
The decision was made this morning,

399
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,190
and I reported my divorce
at the borough office, too.

400
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,000
He and I are
now strangers on paper, too.

401
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,600
I never knew
you were this shameless.

402
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,810
You're going to end this
as you like...

403
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,640
and get a fresh start on your own?

404
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,840
My son is wilting every single day
because of you!

405
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,950
Are you going to continue?

406
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,020
Then, I'll call the police.

407
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,320
What now?

408
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,520
I can't believe this girl.

409
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,690
Haven't you any respect
for your elders?

410
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,560
I was talking to you as an elder,
but you want to call what?

411
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,970
Hello? Is this the police?

412
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,600
- I'm calling from...
- My gosh. Look at this girl.

413
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,170
You're really calling them?

414
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,670
You're the worst.

415
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,980
Fine. I'm leaving!

416
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,980
Hello? Yu Gyeong? What's going on?

417
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,190
Hey. It's nothing.

418
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,250
I was wondering
how you were feeling today.

419
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,860
All right. I won't drink tonight.

420
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,430
I'm a man of my word.

421
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,760
Don't you trust me?

422
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,300
Okay.

423
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,670
Right. My shirt.

424
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,140
I'll stop by after work.

425
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,940
Okay. See you later.

426
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Hey, who were you talking to?

427
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,850
It's not your business, Ms. Hwang.

428
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,020
What was that?

429
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,120
Are you trying to pull a tacky trick
to make me jealous?

430
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,560
Hey.

431
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,160
I'm not that uptight.

432
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,790
I'm such an easygoing type.

433
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,660
I don't care if my boyfriend has
lots of female friends.

434
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,830
I have lots of guy friends, too.

435
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,100
Do you want to see them?

436
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,370
Look.

437
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,570
What?

438
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,380
Darn it. That was ridiculous.

439
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,810
You're home.

440
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,450
"You're home?"

441
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,320
You sit around like a bum and say,
"You're home?"

442
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,150
So, why were you so hung up
on a woman like an idiot?

443
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,920
You're going to make me throw up
all the liquor I had.

444
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,830
I was never hung up on a woman.

445
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,290
Yu Gyeong is
the only woman in my life.

446
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,800
Stop talking about her!

447
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,000
She took over the store
that was your old restaurant.

448
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,100
You have no idea.

449
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:34,040
If you hadn't put on that show
with Kang Jae In,

450
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,670
you could've at least lodged...

451
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,210
a divorce suit against her
and made her lose her spirit!

452
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,080
She must've saved a lot of money
without telling you...

453
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,250
while she worked as a doctor.

454
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,610
You wouldn't have been
this big of a mess...

455
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,850
if you got half of what she had.

456
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,750
She said...

457
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,960
she reported her divorce
and ended everything today.

458
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,990
My attorney told me.

459
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,030
I already signed the paperwork
ages ago.

460
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,130
You said I couldn't go to prison.
What other choice did I have?

461
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,460
Yes, so why did you let this happen?

462
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,100
Anyway, Yu Gyeong opened a business
at our old store?

463
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,270
What kind of business?

464
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,000
No, I should go and celebrate.

465
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,010
Celebrate, my foot.

466
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,170
Don't you dare go.

467
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,040
Yes, I shall dare to go.

468
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,310
You idiot!

469
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,250
Good grief, he's my mortal enemy.

470
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,890
What did I do so wrong
in my past life? Goodness.

471
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Honey!

472
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,430
No one here is your honey.

473
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,630
Congratulations on the new business.
I came empty-handed in a rush,

474
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,830
but I'll send a plant tomorrow.

475
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,570
So...

476
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,500
Yu Gyeong.

477
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,510
Hey.

478
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,980
Hey, my brother-in-law.
I have to talk to my wife.

479
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,680
You should go. I'll handle him.

480
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,550
I can't do that to you.

481
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,960
It's okay. I'll win.

482
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,860
All right. Then, please do that.

483
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,500
It's hard for me to even face him.

484
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,270
Honey. Yu Gyeong. Honey...

485
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,700
Hey.

486
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:16,010
You keep calling her your wife
and me your brother-in-law,

487
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,540
but both my sister
and Yu Gyeong are...

488
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,380
done with your family,
so don't get them involved.

489
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,280
Don't be so cruel, my brother.

490
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,280
You and I were
the two troublemakers.

491
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,860
I've never even thought
of kidnapping my nephew.

492
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,230
I'm doing my best...

493
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,500
not to punch you
for kidnapping Eun Ho,

494
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,000
so leave while I'm still nice.

495
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,600
I'll count to three.

496
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,770
One. Two.

497
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,740
I'm leaving. I'll go. Fine. I'll go.

498
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,190
You got home early.
I thought I'd be back first.

499
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,630
I worked out of the office,
so I came home early to make dinner.

500
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,800
You should've told me.
We could've gone grocery shopping.

501
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,700
I wanted to do everything today.

502
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,740
Where are Dad and Ms. Choi?

503
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,700
She went to bed early.

504
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,910
Mr. Do said he'd be late
after meeting a friend.

505
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,870
Anyway, the food is getting cold.

506
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,310
Come with me.

507
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,680
What's all this?

508
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,150
Congratulations on your divorce.

509
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,820
And this is a present.

510
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,190
This is such a surprise.

511
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,560
When did you prepare all this?

512
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,630
I kept wondering
what I should give you as a present...

513
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,330
and chose a pair of shoes.

514
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,410
A superstition says you'll run away
when you get new shoes as a gift.

515
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,620
That's right. Run, Yu Gyeong.

516
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,720
Forget all about the past,
the people, and the memories...

517
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,520
that tortured you,
and just run forward.

518
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,230
You're now free to go anywhere...

519
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,970
and do whatever you want.

520
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,340
Thank you.

521
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,080
Thank you, Jae In.

522
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,310
I'll look at these shoes from you
and stay strong...

523
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,150
whenever I find myself
regretting this decision.

524
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,320
I mean it.

525
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,890
You've been through so much,

526
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,190
and you've done well.

527
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,080
Why did you want to see me
as soon as I got to work?

528
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,810
I need to ask you for a favor.

529
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,580
You need to persuade your mom.

530
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,950
Seung Woo is my son,

531
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,590
and although it's belated,
I'll put him on my family registrar.

532
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,730
You must also feel annoyed
to see him as a younger brother,

533
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,160
although he actually isn't.

534
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,560
On top of that,
you found out he was my son,

535
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,130
so it must be worse.

536
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,200
Seung Woo and I lived
and grew up together for 27 years.

537
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,840
You may be his birth mother,

538
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,540
but the fact that he's my brother
will never change.

539
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,210
So? You're going to turn me down?

540
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,250
I want to,

541
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,220
but that decision
isn't up to my mom, me,

542
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,490
or you, but Seung Woo.

543
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,260
Just tell him
that you gave him birth.

544
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,260
Let me make this clear once again.
Seung Woo is my son.

545
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,310
(Queen's House)

546
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:44,870
Are you sure?

547
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,280
That was why she always covered
for Kang Seung Woo.

548
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,650
It's an agreement that says
you agree to endorse...

549
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,510
Kang Seung Woo
as the chairman after your office.

550
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,620
She was drawing a big picture
to leave YL Group to her son.

551
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,390
I'm her mother,

552
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,890
yet I adored
my enemy's daughter so much.

553
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,530
This means they didn't join us
just to do business as an investor.

554
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,700
If Kim Do Yun had a say in this,
it couldn't be just an investment.

555
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,260
What does he want?

556
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,570
Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee?

557
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,700
How far does this go?
