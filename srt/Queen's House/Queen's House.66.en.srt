1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,950
(Episode 66)

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,750
Did you do this, Mother?

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,490
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,530
Why? What's up? Did we get robbed?

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,300
I'm sorry, Mother.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,600
Please forgive me.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,000
What do you mean?

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,740
Why are you apologizing to me?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,610
I should've taken a hint.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,610
I should've returned...

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,040
all the clothes I shopped for
when you rebuked me...

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,350
for splurging
Gi Chan's hard-earned money.

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm sorry, Mother.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,490
Good grief.
I can tell what's going on.

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,160
Why did you do that, Mom?

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,560
No, I didn't do this.

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,100
I told her
that she was spending too much,

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,030
but I didn't do this.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you sure it wasn't you?

23
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,500
Last time,
you ripped your own clothes.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,670
Be quiet.

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,010
You should've given those
to me instead.

26
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,810
Have you gone mad?
Those are all really expensive.

27
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,980
Can we talk?

28
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,220
Goodness. Oh, my.

29
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,290
Was it you?

30
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,300
You can be honest with me.

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,000
It wasn't! I didn't do it!

32
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,270
How many times do I have to say it?

33
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,140
Why would I do that to new clothes,
not even the ones she already had?

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,610
That must've cost a fortune!

35
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,140
You did that last time.

36
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,610
It was because of you.

37
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,210
What would I get
from harassing her now?

38
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,380
So, it really wasn't you?

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,880
It wasn't!

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,920
I'm denying it because it's true.

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,690
Do I ever lie to you?

42
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,190
No one else would do this.

43
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,490
Why not? Isn't it obvious?

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,790
Don't you get it?
She tried to kill me.

45
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,560
Yu Gyeong was...

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,570
already furious to know
that your ex-wife was still alive,

47
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,940
so she decided to protest
after you let her live here.

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,240
She thought
she had become Kang Jae In,

49
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,610
but she's now in danger
of becoming the knockoff again.

50
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,010
Don't you get it?

51
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,750
Who else under this roof would
hold a grudge against her?

52
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,060
Honey, I heard Mother destroyed
all of Jae In's clothes.

53
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,500
She can be cute at times.

54
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,060
She must've had to vent that way.

55
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,840
And? Did that help you vent?

56
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,200
- What?
- It was you.

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,910
What? I did that?

58
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,810
Me?

59
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,380
It wasn't Mom.
Then, who would it be?

60
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,210
Did she blame this on me?

61
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,720
You need to stop.

62
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,690
Stop doing what? What did I do?

63
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,260
Stop making me exhausted.

64
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,830
You already know
why I let Jae In live here.

65
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,390
So put up with it
even if you dread this.

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,660
Why do you keep saying this to me?
I said it wasn't me.

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,830
Why won't you believe me?

68
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,970
This time, it was Mother.
I know it was her!

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,910
Fine. Let's say she did it.

70
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,810
But she has no reason to lie to me.

71
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,140
She must've felt nervous...

72
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,280
that you and Jae In
might get back together.

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,820
You're talking about yourself.

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,320
She doesn't feel that way.

75
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,350
- I know...
- That's enough.

76
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,520
If you know why I let
Jae In live here, deal with it.

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,020
Tolerate her.

78
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,090
I'll make up an excuse
and say it was Ji Ho,

79
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,660
so you need to stop.

80
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,020
Why don't we go out to eat
when you're free?

81
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,450
My ankle feels much better,
so I want to thank you.

82
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,460
(Kang Mi Ran)

83
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,560
Okay.

84
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,240
Going out to eat once
shouldn't be a big deal.

85
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,250
Why are you drinking tea
and not going to bed?

86
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,760
Hey. I couldn't sleep.

87
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,560
You should've called me out
for a glass of beer.

88
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,860
You're busy.
I didn't want to bother you.

89
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,660
Do Yun is running quite late.

90
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,460
He has a lot of work to do.

91
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,630
He said he'd be back before midnight,
so he'll come soon.

92
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,570
It's true that you never know
what life has in store for you.

93
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,110
What's wrong? Did something happen?

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,810
All my sadness has passed by.

95
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,110
I'm talking about Jae In.

96
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,020
I hear she has amnesia.

97
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,020
I felt bad about her,

98
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,920
as well as Choi Ja Young.

99
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,860
She's on my mind, too.

100
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,090
Why are you so nosy?

101
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,530
I get why you worry about Jae In,

102
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,360
but why do you worry
about that woman?

103
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,770
She doesn't deserve that.

104
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,100
She has dementia.

105
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,440
Who does?

106
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,670
Choi Ja Young. She has dementia.

107
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,910
Come on. You must've been fooled.

108
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,250
She had been acting weird lately.

109
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,550
You know
who Min Jun's daughter is, right?

110
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,920
The doctor who runs the medical device
store across the corridor.

111
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,160
She told me.

112
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,090
So, she really has dementia?
Are you sure?

113
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,960
She got examined by a doctor.

114
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,170
Jae In doesn't know
her mom has dementia, does she?

115
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,970
I'm not sure,
but she probably doesn't.

116
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,310
Jeez. Jae In has to live
such a tough life.

117
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,510
You never know
what life has in store for you.

118
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,480
You're right about that.

119
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,720
Honey, you forgot something.

120
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,530
What?

121
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,570
Oh, my. Se Ri.

122
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,370
I should've done that in our room.

123
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,810
I didn't know you were there.

124
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,110
I apologize
if we made you feel awkward.

125
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,910
No, that was cute.

126
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,620
- Very much.
- Is it inconvenient to live here?

127
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,550
Not at all. I feel at home.

128
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,260
I see.

129
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,060
I feel bad for saying this,

130
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,660
but you should find
a place to move out to.

131
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,030
What do you mean?

132
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,030
Are you telling me to leave?

133
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,370
Please don't take it the wrong way.

134
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,740
Ji Ho adores you like his mother,

135
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,170
so it's hard for us to get closer.

136
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,540
I'm his mom, so I want to be one.

137
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,540
I also thought it'd be odd
for you to keep living here,

138
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,950
so it'd be best if you moved out.

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,380
Don't you think so, honey?

140
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,820
I don't know. Let's think about it.

141
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,590
I might run late.

142
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,420
- Bye.
- Bye.

143
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,930
Bye, honey.

144
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,790
Se Ri.

145
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,860
Please do that for me.

146
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,050
Gosh, my back.

147
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,480
Darn it. This is way over the line.

148
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,320
You're living off me,

149
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,360
so it's about time
you get off the bed.

150
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,620
Don't you think so?

151
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,030
Ms. Noh. You're living off me.
It's not me doing that.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,830
What? Jeez.
She should've been an actress.

153
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,770
She can lie without even flinching.

154
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,350
Gosh, I feel so heavy.

155
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,320
There's so much pain.

156
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,090
Come on, Seung Woo.
You should stay in another room.

157
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,090
Why are you
putting me through this, too?

158
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,660
Man, look who's talking.

159
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,670
You're living off your family, too.
I'm not taking this from you.

160
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,630
You and I aren't the same!

161
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,700
You two are different.

162
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,340
Seung Woo is sensitive
when it comes to his sleep.

163
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,610
He's putting up with you
and letting you stay with him.

164
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
You should be grateful.

165
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,780
I have my mommy, too.

166
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,520
My son.

167
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,990
Why don't we go out for a movie
after work? It's been a while.

168
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,530
I'm not here
to deal with mood swings...

169
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,300
whenever you have a change of mind.

170
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,870
No, who said that?

171
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,740
Or do I still look like a little kid
who'll run into your arms...

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,580
at a small hint of affection?

173
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,450
I get all kinds of thoughts
whenever you do something like this,

174
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,410
thinking you must have a plan...

175
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,850
to take advantage of me.

176
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,690
That's why I dread
and resent you even more.

177
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,860
Seung Woo.

178
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,060
Just...

179
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,230
continue to hate me, blame me,
and curse me, as you always have.

180
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,800
That'll be much easier for you, too.

181
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,170
Seung Woo!

182
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,880
What's with him?

183
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,550
I should send you the file
for the meeting via e-mail, right?

184
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,750
Okay.

185
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,460
Uncle Oh Seong.

186
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,260
- You need to see this.
- What? What is it?

187
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,040
Isn't she the woman
who sued you for sexual assault?

188
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,310
(Hello, my name is Park Ji Su.)

189
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,180
My name is Park Ji Su,
and I have previously sued...

190
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,250
Mr. Kim Do Yun for sexual assault,
the director of DH Holdings...

191
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,320
and a former doctor
at YL Group's in-house clinic.

192
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,360
I want to clarify...

193
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,290
that I was never
sexually assaulted...

194
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,360
and that Mr. Kim Do Yun is innocent.

195
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,400
I was in need of money,
so I had to do as I was told.

196
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,870
I can't tell you who it was.

197
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,680
I signed the contract
on the condition...

198
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,550
that I never say anything
about who's behind this.

199
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,620
The compensation is
too much to bear,

200
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,350
and my family and I will
fall into danger, too.

201
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,650
But I can tell you
one thing for sure.

202
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,790
Mr. Kim Do Yun...

203
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,390
did not commit sexual assault.
He is innocent.

204
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,330
I'm so sorry.

205
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,970
Why did she change her mind...

206
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,510
and send me this?

207
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,780
I don't know what the reason is,
but let's send it to your attorney.

208
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,080
Vindicating you is our priority.

209
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,980
And send me one, too.

210
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,950
What is this? I already paid her.

211
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,820
Get her on the phone now.

212
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,390
She sent this video
to her attorney...

213
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,960
and disappeared.

214
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,930
She also sent that video
to Director Kim Do Yun.

215
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,930
I got a call from our legal team...

216
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,840
that his attorney turned in...

217
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,800
the same video to the court.

218
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,170
The victim admitted
that there was no harm done,

219
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,980
so the case will be closed.

220
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,280
You should've done a better job.

221
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,150
Did she say anything
about who was behind her?

222
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,350
Are you sure this is the only video?

223
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,950
Is there anything else?

224
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,420
No, she got paid
to keep her mouth shut,

225
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,490
and she did,
so you don't have to worry.

226
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,800
But more importantly, Director Kim
is continuously tracking...

227
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,900
the flow of funds
for H and K Company.

228
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,070
He's also contacting
former employees...

229
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,540
to get more information,
so what should I do?

230
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,540
Find out how much he knows...

231
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,940
and how accurate the information is.

232
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,420
That's all. You may leave.

233
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,550
Yes, sir.

234
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,990
What brings you here?

235
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,260
It's the residential complex project
in collaboration with Louis B.

236
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,930
I already shared
the entire schedule,

237
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,370
including the opening ceremony.

238
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,270
As you already know,
the CEO of Louis B...

239
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,670
and I go way back.

240
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,940
You know
you begged and pleaded...

241
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,010
for us to collaborate with them,
so I gave you the contact.

242
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,250
I'm aware.

243
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,380
I got a call from the CEO.

244
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,820
The project may be run
by someone on their end and you,

245
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,350
but I was asked
to keep an eye on it.

246
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,320
You need to do this right.

247
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,090
They are
a world-renowned luxury brand.

248
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,460
Do your best
not to harm their image.

249
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,500
If this project becomes a success,
we can also become global,

250
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,370
as big as their brand.

251
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,670
It's that important.

252
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,040
I must do that, and I will.

253
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,610
You don't have to worry.
I'll bet my life and death on it.

254
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,260
Jae In.

255
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,490
What brings you here without a call?

256
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,930
Do you feel all right?

257
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,100
Of course. I stopped by in passing.

258
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,740
Wait, you're now
the managing director?

259
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,280
You must've been disappointed
when Gi Chan became the chairman.

260
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,950
That changed the unspoken rule
that YL's chairperson...

261
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,720
shall be someone of the Kang family.

262
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,390
That's true.

263
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,520
But it hasn't changed completely.

264
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,290
We can discuss that later.

265
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,930
What brings you here?

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,400
I began to feel stupid
sitting around at home all day.

267
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,740
A lot has changed
over the last seven years.

268
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,870
So, Aunt Mi Ran,
I want to return to work.

269
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,680
Return to work?

270
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,780
Shouldn't you focus on
restoring your health?

271
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,280
I hate feeling like I'm behind.

272
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,620
I need to know
what the recent trend is,

273
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,520
so I thought it'd be better
if I returned to get the feel of it.

274
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,820
I can join either the Design Team...

275
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,260
or join yours and learn from you.
What do you say?

276
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,400
Do you still not remember anything?

277
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
No, not at all.

278
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,300
Was there
something I should remember?

279
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,410
No. Let's consider it.

280
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,440
Okay.

281
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,950
Hey, Yu Gyeong.
Are you free after work?

282
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,180
Do you want to catch a movie?

283
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,690
I feel like I have to watch a movie
with someone else tonight.

284
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,360
What kind of feeling is that?

285
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,960
Yu Gyeong. Please?

286
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,430
Please watch a movie with me.

287
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's do that.

288
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,740
I also want to go to the theaters
for the first time in a while.

289
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,570
Okay!

290
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,880
I'll get the tickets.

291
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,980
You can go with me.

292
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,520
Don't you know
the concept of personal space?

293
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,390
Let's keep our distance.

294
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,520
It's because you're trying
to win my attention...

295
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,460
by asking someone else
out to a movie.

296
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,730
I don't get jealous,

297
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,400
so don't waste your time
trying to make me jealous.

298
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,670
You can watch a movie with me.

299
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,370
What are we watching?

300
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,610
Ms. Hwang,
I'm going to say this to you...

301
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,710
just this once
with all seriousness, so listen.

302
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,450
What's going on?
Is he asking me out?

303
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,180
I seriously think...

304
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:57,960
you should see a doctor.

305
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,330
Okay, I'd love to.

306
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,930
What? A doctor?

307
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,730
What doctor?

308
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,600
Is he telling me
to get more plastic surgery?

309
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,640
Where? How much?

310
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,590
Jae In.

311
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,460
Hey. Hello.

312
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,590
Are you doing well?

313
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,260
I am.

314
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,400
I wanted to find out
the recent trend in interior design,

315
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,770
so I was browsing.

316
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,240
Do I have something on my face?

317
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,010
Are you sure you're doing okay?

318
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,310
I am.

319
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,020
I'm home, so of course,
I'm doing well.

320
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,590
I'm so happy that I finally woke up.

321
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,460
Don't trust Hwang Gi Chan.

322
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,800
What? What do you mean?

323
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,900
We need to talk.

324
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,100
I can't just
keep watching you like this.

325
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,470
There's just too much
that you need to know.

326
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,970
Tomorrow...

327
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,210
I have something important
coming up tomorrow.

328
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,110
Are you free
to have lunch in two days?

329
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,410
In two days?

330
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,880
Yes.

331
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,420
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

332
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,220
He's been tracking
H and K Company's funds?

333
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,200
What do you want to know,
Kim Do Yun?

334
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,430
Honey.

335
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,100
Hey, what brings you here?

336
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,100
I wanted to go home with you.

337
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,310
Anyway, I guess
I wasn't allowed to come.

338
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,610
Both Aunt Mi Ran...

339
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,450
and that man named
Director Kim Do Yun...

340
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,310
asked...

341
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,850
why I was here.

342
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,280
You saw Director Kim?

343
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,520
Yes, I ran into him
while I was looking at the showroom.

344
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,090
And he must have
something important to say.

345
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,930
He wanted to see me in two days.

346
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,530
Do you know anything?

347
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,330
No, I don't.

348
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,570
It seemed important.

349
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,570
What could it be?

350
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,620
She's here again.

351
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,660
- Wait, Ms. Choi.
- Leave her alone.

352
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,760
She's not in her right mind.

353
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,530
I'll take a dry dishrag
and wipe the tables once again.

354
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,260
I guess.

355
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,910
My gosh. Yun Hee.

356
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,970
I thought that woman quit.

357
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,110
Stop showing off your ignorance.

358
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,580
Keep quiet when you are
in another person's business.

359
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,280
What about you? Did you kill someone
because you were educated?

360
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,960
I wasn't going to say this
because you said she quit,

361
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,690
but she's a murderer!

362
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,030
She hit an innocent woman,
thinking her son-in-law...

363
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,860
was having an affair with her!

364
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,730
I know.

365
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,170
You do?

366
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,380
Ms. Choi!

367
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,380
You should leave the apron.

368
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,310
Look at her.

369
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,250
She's running away
after getting exposed.

370
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,520
How can she be so brazen?

371
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,390
How can she walk around...

372
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,060
after killing someone?

373
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,430
Anyway, when did you find out?

374
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,360
Aren't you scared to know
that you had hired a murderer?

375
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,470
Why would I be scared of a criminal?

376
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,170
She's just an awful criminal
who thought...

377
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,210
other people's lives were petty.

378
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,840
It's a waste to be scared of her.

379
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,510
I was hoping to see you
pull her hair out for lying.

380
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,090
You should stay for a cup of tea.

381
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,190
Are you leaving so soon?

382
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,690
I have uninvited guests
sitting around at home,

383
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,560
so I can't stay away for too long.

384
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, my. You are...

385
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,600
Mi Gyeong, right?

386
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,070
Do you know me?

387
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,310
Everyone in the neighborhood
took out insurance plans from you.

388
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,840
Kim Mi Gyeong,
the queen of insurance.

389
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,310
Sook Ja, you remember her, right?

390
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,020
I don't know. I'm not so sure.

391
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,820
Well, you didn't even recognize me
when we ran into each other.

392
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,390
You remember her, right?

393
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,960
She's Na Ra's mother,
who used to rent out a room in our place.

394
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,660
You know, things were
bustling at our place...

395
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,530
with her kids and my kids.

396
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,370
Right. I remember you now.

397
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,040
Na Ra's mother
became much more stylish,

398
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,840
so I had a tougher time
recognizing her.

399
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,980
You must have some money now.

400
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,720
Look who's talking.

401
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,620
It's been so long,
so let's meet for a meal sometime.

402
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,330
We have a lot to catch up on.

403
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,760
Isn't that so?

404
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,530
Then, I must be somewhere,
so excuse me.

405
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,930
Sure. See you around.

406
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,920
Hey, you're back. You're late.

407
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,550
I had work to do.

408
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,090
Here.

409
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,420
You seemed busy with work,

410
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,330
so I went to the real estate office
to get information.

411
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,460
It's a townhouse,
and it seemed pretty nice.

412
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,760
Take a look.

413
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,770
It's fully furnished,
so it'll turn into a nice place...

414
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,030
once you get your stuff inside.

415
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,640
You may say you feel at home,

416
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,870
but living in another person's home
must feel inconvenient.

417
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,910
You don't have to worry about us...

418
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,470
and go out to live comfortably.

419
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,780
Wouldn't that be better?

420
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,180
All right. I'll take a look.

421
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,180
(Premium Townhouse)

422
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,720
What's that, Mommy?

423
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,690
What? It's garbage.

424
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,000
You have to throw out garbage
in a garbage can, Mommy.

425
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,470
You're right. I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

426
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,200
Listen up, Ji Ho.

427
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,070
Don't say anything
to your fake mommy out there,

428
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,640
but go talk to Daddy...

429
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,740
and tell him
you want to live here with me.

430
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,250
Do we have to move out, Mommy?

431
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,610
Maybe.

432
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,720
But you want to live here
with Mommy and Daddy, right?

433
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,450
Then, go tell Daddy
what I just said to you.

434
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,160
Okay?

435
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,230
What?

436
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,860
Catherine's identity
has been exposed?

437
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,160
Yes, sir.
He showed a photo of Ms. Kang...

438
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,630
to a former employee of H and K
and had it confirmed.

439
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,870
All right.

440
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,140
Is Kim Do Yun going to expose
the truth to Jae In?

441
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,180
He now knows who Catherine is,

442
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,450
so he can always come after me.

443
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,750
I have a job for you.

444
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,590
Do you remember Kim Do Yun?

445
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,060
Make him bedridden for a while.

446
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,160
Just make sure he isn't dead.

447
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,040
Tomorrow's the D-day.

448
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,910
Make sure your work is done
without trouble.

449
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,480
Ji Ho said he had something to say.

450
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,350
Hey, Ji Ho.

451
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,090
Daddy, can we live...

452
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,190
with Ms. Se Ri?

453
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,290
She says she's moving out,
and I don't want her to.

454
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,160
I want to live with her.

455
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,930
I like Ms. Se Ri.

456
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,500
Let her live here.

457
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,800
Daddy!

458
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,180
All right, Ji Ho. Don't cry.

459
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,450
I'll talk to her.

460
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,780
Ji Ho...

461
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,360
How's Ji Ho?

462
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,170
He just fell asleep.

463
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,070
You must be disappointed.

464
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,640
I never got to live as his mom,

465
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,080
so Se Ri must feel like one to him.

466
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,380
While we're on the subject,

467
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,080
why don't we
let her stay here for a while...

468
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,920
until Ji Ho finds his peace?

469
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,850
We should do that for him.

470
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,160
All right. We should do that.

471
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,200
Thank you.

472
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,470
No, I should be thankful for Se Ri.

473
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,600
She was a mother to him
on my behalf.

474
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,870
I wanted to have a drink with you.

475
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,980
Thank you for waiting for me
without a change of heart...

476
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,610
for the last seven years.

477
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,620
You don't have to thank me.

478
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,920
Here.

479
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,740
For your unchanging love...

480
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,940
and my love for you.

481
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,440
I love you, honey.

482
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,910
Me, too. I love you.

483
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,950
Do you mean it?

484
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,020
If you do, bottoms up.

485
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,290
Cheers.

486
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:27,010
(Director Kim Do Yun)

487
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,220
That was heavy.

488
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,460
He needs you to read these
by the end of the day.

489
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,620
All these? By the end of the day?

490
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,690
Yes. "We need DH Holdings
to approve..."

491
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,000
"even a simple decision
on finding an agency,"

492
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,930
"so how can we proceed
with everything else?"

493
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,370
Those are the words
from Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

494
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,970
It must've been heavy. Thank you.

495
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,340
I'm glad you know.

496
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,380
If he wants to keep me
in the office this late,

497
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,320
it must mean today's the D-day.

498
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,270
You're right, honey.

499
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,770
Seung Woo should
find a wonderful partner, too.

500
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,110
I don't know. Some say
their youngest daughter is...

501
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,780
actually born of the mistress,
not his lawful wife.

502
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,250
We let Jae In marry
into a nameless family already.

503
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,760
I don't know if we can do that
with Seung Woo, too.

504
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,630
We should ask him first.

505
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,860
Mom?

506
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,100
Hey, Jae In.

507
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,000
Your dad must want
to get Seung Woo married.

508
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,870
Dad?

509
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,340
He's not around.

510
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,180
Yes, we should ask Jae In...

511
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,680
Mom?

512
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,020
I forgot that I had to be somewhere.

513
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,660
I have to go.

514
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,830
Mom? Wait. Mom!

515
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,180
Hello, Ms. Choi.

516
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,690
You're getting a call.
You should pick it up.

517
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,620
A call?

518
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,630
(My precious daughter)

519
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,930
Let me get that for you.

520
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,770
Hello?

521
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,340
Hey, Jae In.

522
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,310
Ms. Choi came to my store.

523
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,720
Darn it.

524
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,760
Watch where you're going.

525
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,460
You ran into me first,
so it's not for you to say.

526
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,670
You should know your fight
before you pick one.

527
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,900
You're a talkative one.

528
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,040
Do your thing and go.

529
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,770
I can't listen to this punk anymore.

530
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,150
Take this! Darn it.

531
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,080
Darn it.

532
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,080
You! Let go of me!

533
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,100
You're a strong guy.

534
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,610
(Queen's House)

535
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:54,180
There's a record that
I made a claim for fire damage?

536
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,580
That's impossible.

537
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,210
I never took out a plan
or received the payment.

538
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,020
I brought
my husband's notebook here.

539
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,820
Where did I put it?

540
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,190
I thought it'd be better
if I heard it with my husband.

541
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,800
I wanted to confirm
if she really didn't remember.

542
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,360
But you two are
sitting here like this,

543
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,200
so it must be true.

544
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,370
It must be exciting for you.

545
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,940
Who's your real wife?
I'm getting curious.
