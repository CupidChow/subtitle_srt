and unrelated to reality.)

(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,550
I found it in the bag Do Hee had
on the day of her accident.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,950
I want to know
why this was found in her bag.

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,790
There's no evidence
this belongs to me.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,590
Even if he finds out it's mine,

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,330
it can't be used as evidence
to prove that I killed her.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,760
(Episode 43)

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,630
It's not mine.

11
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,000
Don't you see the initials?

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,640
Are you claiming it's mine
just because of the initials?

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,870
It's not mine.

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,910
No.

15
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,310
I had it order-made,
so I remember it clearly.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,210
I know it's yours.

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,380
You were missing a cuff link
when you came home...

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,090
on the night of her accident,
so I asked you about it.

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,360
Back then, you said you lost it.

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,490
So, how come he found this
in Ms. Kim's handbag?

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,230
I knew
you weren't in your right mind.

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,330
Your delusion is just endless.

23
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,370
This was why I told you to
stay in the mental hospital for treatment.

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,210
You may want to treat me like
I'm crazy, but I clearly remember.

25
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,110
This is yours.

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,710
I hope you won't believe
everything she says.

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,550
You know better than I do
that she had been hospitalized.

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,420
If you're talking about
the forced hospitalization, I know.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,890
She was found as normal
in an examination after that.

30
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,460
Her words are your only evidence
that this belongs to me.

31
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,890
I'm suddenly getting curious, too.

32
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,200
Why are you
trying to insist this is mine?

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,800
I want to know
why it has to be mine.

34
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,170
I plan...

35
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,200
to find out the reason starting now.

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,780
Your office is all set up.

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,140
Welcome to YL Group.

38
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,480
I look forward to your endeavors.

40
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,500
Please let me live.

41
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,270
Hello?

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,670
Hello?

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,680
Was it that moment?
Did I lose it then?

(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

45
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,450
Who on earth is that man?

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,590
Jae In knows
he's Kim Do Hee's older brother,

47
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,120
and he also knows Jae In is
the daughter of the woman...

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,060
who killed his sister,
yet they continue to stick around.

49
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,660
What are they thinking?

50
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,600
His eyes wavered
as soon as he saw the cuff link.

51
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,640
I find it suspicious
that he had to treat me...

52
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,580
like I was a madwoman
to tell that lie.

53
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,850
He couldn't have denied it
if we presented the other side.

54
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,210
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

55
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,780
It's all right.

56
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,820
I wouldn't have known this was his
if it hadn't been for you.

57
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,160
That was already a great help.

58
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,190
And his attitude already showed...

59
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,660
he was certainly involved
in Do Hee's accident.

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,130
You're right. He could've said
it was his and made up an excuse.

61
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,270
He could've said he lost it
at the cafe before the accident...

62
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,740
or that she must've kept
something she picked up at work.

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,910
But he flatly denied this was his.
Something is weird.

64
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,110
What do you think he's hiding?

65
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,190
I heard Mr. Kim Do Yun came
as the director of DH Holdings.

66
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,130
You have a knack for hitting on men.

67
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,570
No matter how good I am,
I can never surpass you.

68
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,900
You're an adulteress who hit on
a married man with a child.

69
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,900
You win.

70
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,740
Enjoy.

71
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,520
This should've been evenly fried.
What is this?

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,790
Crunchiness is key
to our fried chicken.

73
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,090
You'll see it's perfectly fried
once you try it.

74
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,260
I guarantee that it tastes good.

75
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,260
It's not my preference,
but I'll try it.

76
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,770
Bring me a bottle
of your most expensive wine.

77
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,270
Wine?

78
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,440
We don't serve wine here.

79
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,640
Then, go out and get one.

80
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,510
Don't you know
that the customer is always right?

81
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,610
We don't accept orders
for things that aren't on the menu.

82
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,510
I'll give you
some beverages on the house.

83
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,680
You have the worst kind of service,

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,380
but sure, whatever.

85
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,160
Your food was awful,
and the service was the worst,

86
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,290
but don't worry.

87
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,130
I'll write you a positive review.

88
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Wait, excuse me.
You haven't paid yet.

89
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,500
My gosh. Don't you know who she is?

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,340
Who is she?

91
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,210
Lady, the land for the shopping arcades
around here is all mine.

92
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,850
You should be thanking me
for coming out to check on you.

93
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,580
It's a piece of cake...

94
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,850
for me to talk to your landlord
and close down your business.

95
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
I feel like my ears are rotting
from listening to these scammers.

96
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,230
The land around this area
belongs to Chairman Jung Myeong Il...

97
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,000
of Haseong Apparel,
starting with the fashion street.

98
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,900
The chairman is male,

99
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,970
and he was widowed a few years ago
and remained single.

100
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,910
Ms. Jung,
they aren't worth your time.

101
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,340
You should report them
to the police...

102
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,780
for impersonation, defamation,
and dining and dashing. Now.

103
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,720
Wait! I'll pay.

104
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,990
The police are busy,
so don't bother reporting this.

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Is the land around this area
all owned by Haseong Apparel?

106
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,240
How do you know this, Mi Sook?

107
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,010
My acquaintances are...

108
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,210
An acquaintance told me.

109
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,760
Ms. Kang, does this mean
Ms. Mi Sook defeated the villains?

110
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,830
Yes, she defeated the villains
who came to Grandma's place.

111
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,030
My gosh.

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,500
They tried to scam her
into giving them free food,

113
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,330
but they got humiliated instead.

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,800
Anyway, I thought that lady,
Mi Sook, wasn't so good at her job.

115
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,000
But she seems quite witty.

116
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,570
It's her first time working a job
like this, so she's a bit lost.

117
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,910
But the way she handled
obnoxious customers today...

118
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,550
made me think I could leave
the business with her very soon.

119
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,350
Yes, you hired two people now,

120
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,850
so you should take the day off
on slow days.

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,250
I plan to do that.

122
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,650
She'll be in elementary school soon,

123
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,890
so I want to spend
more time with her while I can.

124
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,390
Try this one.

125
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,290
Eat up. You have to eat well.

(YL Planning and Design)

127
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,200
What are you two watching
instead of working?

128
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,240
Gosh, Ms. Kang.
Did you lie about your education?

129
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,880
What are you talking about?

130
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,810
Take a look at this yourself.

131
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,850
You're watching Exposé World,

132
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,250
exposing the dirtiest and most
disgusting scumbags of the earth.

133
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,190
I brought the latest news
on the darkest history...

134
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,590
of the worst scumbag.

135
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,120
This crazy jerk is doing this again?

136
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,830
This is a graduation photo...

137
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,690
of YL Group's daughter...

138
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,360
and the design team leader,
Ms. Kang Jae In.

139
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,730
So, what's the problem
with the graduation photo?

140
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,970
Because it's a graduation photo
from a nameless university.

141
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,240
Doesn't it seem suspicious to think
YL Group's daughter...

142
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,340
and the design team leader
went to a university like this?

143
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,980
Also, what's this photo?

144
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,320
It's a photo of Ms. Kang Jae In.

145
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,550
But I hear this is
also her wedding photo.

146
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,690
Was she married twice?

147
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,560
Or is this her doppelgänger?

148
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,760
Don't you think
everything is suspicious?

149
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,200
Her history doesn't seem like
that of YL's daughter.

150
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,000
Is she really
the actual Kang Jae In,

151
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,770
just as YL Group claimed?

152
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,300
Am I the only one
who's questioning this?

153
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,740
Don't you feel the same way?

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,210
Should I open the comment section...

155
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,910
to receive reports from people?

156
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,780
Maybe I should make a report.

157
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,050
It's unpleasant to be treated
like your doppelgänger.

158
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,990
You. Kang Jae In.

159
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,890
Do your best to stop the media
from covering this.

160
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,890
And release our statement
and say we'll take legal action...

161
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,460
for spreading false information.

162
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,630
Ms. Kang Se Ri, follow me right now.

163
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,410
As you already know,
we publicized your wedding photo...

164
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,520
by switching out
Jae In's face for yours.

165
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,080
I put out my own face
and announced...

166
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,290
Ms. Kang Se Ri was
the real Kang Jae In.

167
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,160
So, what was that wedding photo?

168
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,730
It was Photoshopped.

169
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,690
He knows about it, too.

170
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,530
She's right.

171
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,670
Someone sent that photo to me.

172
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,930
Who? For what reason?

173
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,540
It was Director Kim Do Yun.

174
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,240
Why would Director Kim do that?

175
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,640
Because of Kang Jae In, obviously.

176
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,910
She must've egged him on
to come between us.

177
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,680
Jae In and Kim Do Yun
might be in a serious relationship.

178
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,980
Are you suggesting Director Kim is
somehow connected to that YouTuber?

179
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,620
I don't know about that,

180
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,290
but it's under investigation,
so we'll find out soon.

181
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,430
Handle this properly
when the investigation is over.

182
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,290
Yes.

183
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,830
That's that. Ms. Kang.

184
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,570
You said you majored in Practical Design
at Koyeon University.

185
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,440
The diploma and the graduation photo
the YouTuber exposed...

186
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,910
were from a nameless university,

187
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,680
and you studied humanities,

188
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,080
not interior design, design,
or even architecture.

189
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,810
What's going on?

190
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,320
Were the portfolio and resume
you gave me...

191
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,880
all faked? Is that so?

192
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,890
Did you know about this?

193
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,120
It may sound like an excuse,

194
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,760
but I had to attend a university
I could get into with my grades.

195
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,600
I I've always been interested
in interior design since childhood.

196
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,430
I wanted to get into this industry,
so I got licensed...

197
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,800
and worked in the field
since I was in America.

198
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,000
My job history is all real.

199
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,270
So, you just confessed
you forged your academic background.

200
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,380
And you got your previous jobs
with that faked background.

201
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,720
For one last time,
I'll handle everything.

202
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,820
And why?

203
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,420
Because I worked with you two...

204
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,490
and lied to the world,
saying you were my niece.

205
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,160
But remember this.

206
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,760
This is the last time. No more.

207
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,170
Thank you, Director Kang.

208
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,700
I won't let this happen again.

209
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,870
Ms. Kang.

210
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,740
I won't give you another chance
if you fail to perform well.

211
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,740
You must step down
from your office...

212
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,110
if another scandal
of your personal life breaks out.

213
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,250
You don't hold that office
to make it easier to handle your scandals.

214
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,720
Isn't that so?

215
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,690
I'm done.

216
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,670
Ms. Noh, you're looking
much younger these days.

217
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,840
Did you get something done?

218
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,840
What did you do?

219
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,650
Share your secret with us.

220
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,580
I didn't get anything done.

221
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,680
I was just born pretty.

222
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,050
This smells great.

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,890
This is the kind of tea
only the royals drink,

224
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,260
so make sure you finish every drop.

225
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,830
Doesn't it seem...

226
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,330
kind of off balance
to drink this at a pig's feet place?

227
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,200
Off balance?

228
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,570
Pig's feet have good balance, too,

229
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,070
so stop complaining
and drink your tea.

230
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,740
My gosh. Isn't this about your son?

231
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,450
Goodness, turn that off.

232
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,320
That punk is
such an evil con artist.

233
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,650
He found out my son was
the chairman of a big corporation,

234
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,820
so he went around
spreading this false video...

235
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,890
to blackmail my son
into giving him money.

236
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,260
My gosh. I found something else.

237
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,360
(The lady of YL Group
faked her educational background?)

238
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,800
Good grief.

239
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,330
These are all lies. Lies.

240
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,070
You just ruined my mood.
You both need to go.

241
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,370
I'm not in the mood
to sit elegantly and drink tea.

242
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,840
Get up.

243
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,810
- Go, now.
- My gosh.

244
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,410
- Just go.
- Okay, fine. We're leaving.

245
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,450
- Let's go.
- Jeez.

246
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,020
You need to come home now!

247
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,160
Were you at the chairman's office?

248
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,470
You're behind that video, right?

249
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,770
You must be the reporter.

250
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,000
There must be someone else
who wants to get revenge on you.

251
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,410
It wasn't me,
but I'm dying to know who it is.

252
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,410
Tell me. You must know.

253
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,480
No one else other than you
would treat me like this.

254
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,220
It has to be you. I know it's you.

255
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,220
Sure. It was me.

256
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,620
I guess whatever I said came true.

257
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,530
I asked you last time if you
really graduated from that university,

258
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,460
and who knew
it turned out to be true?

259
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,200
If you think this is unfair,
go ahead and expose my face.

260
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,670
You can show people
that someone who married Gi Chan...

261
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,240
eight years ago wasn't you, but me.

262
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,870
Then, everyone will find out
I'm the real Kang Jae In.

263
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,010
Is that all right? I don't mind.

264
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,850
So, it really wasn't you?

265
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,180
I wouldn't have told a YouTuber.

266
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,420
I would've shown it
to Gi Chan myself.

267
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,290
It would've been great to see him
fall apart with my own eyes.

268
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,220
I'm so jealous of you.

269
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,330
You're full of endless surprises.

270
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,100
Gi Chan will never get bored of you.

271
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,130
What do you think you're doing?

272
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,200
- What's going on?
- It's not a big deal.

273
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,100
Mr. Kang and I were
going to the showroom.

274
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,570
Please excuse us.

275
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,980
Let's go, Mr. Kang.

276
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,350
I don't care what you do,
but don't mess with my family.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,170
Can we go now?

278
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,170
Yes, I'll drive on our way back.

279
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,820
Can we take a look
at the cabinet doors?

280
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,990
May I take a look at this one?

281
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,430
What do you think
about the finishing?

282
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,170
- I think it looks good, too.
- Right?

283
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,440
Can we change
the color of the cabinet?

284
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,040
I think this translucent door would
look great with sand beige doors.

285
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,380
What do you think?

286
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,620
I think white would be closer
to what the client wants.

287
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,120
That might be the case.

288
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,560
- Please use satin white, then.
- Yes.

289
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,430
I'm home.

290
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,430
You cursed brat.

291
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,460
What's that wedding photo?

292
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,300
And what was that
random nameless university?

293
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,470
I thought you were a lucky girl
for snatching my dear son...

294
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,870
and becoming his wife,

295
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,640
but you were just a scammer.

296
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,010
I'll kill you today
and kill myself, too.

297
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,810
Mother, it's a misunderstanding.

298
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,010
Misunderstanding, my foot.
Get over here!

299
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,750
What are you doing?

300
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,020
Mother, Gi Chan is
the only one for me.

301
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,860
I've never been married
to another man.

302
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,730
He's my first love...

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,560
and my last love,

304
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,870
and Ji Ho is the proof!

305
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,740
Why are you slandering me
without asking me first?

306
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,570
- Then, what about that video?
- It was Photoshopped.

307
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,580
Jae In is doing everything she can
to slander me...

308
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,250
and come between Gi Chan and me!

309
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,110
I'm being falsely accused, Mother.

310
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,990
I'm sorry, Mother. I was wrong.

311
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,730
I didn't want to make
Gi Chan's life hard,

312
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,590
but it was all because
I wasn't enough.

313
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,030
I'm so sorry, Mother.

314
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,030
I'm glad you're here.

315
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,200
Is Kang Jae In
really behind everything?

316
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,640
I mean that video.

317
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,270
Probably.

318
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,110
Ji Ho is around,
so you should stop here.

319
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,420
Should I make dinner, Mother?

320
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,650
What's this nonsense?

321
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,420
Did you ask me about dinner
while our family was in this mess?

322
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,190
Did something happen?

323
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,060
I dozed off.

324
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,800
Why won't you get up?

325
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,400
I'll go upstairs.

326
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,110
Mother, did something happen?

327
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,610
Why?
Do you want something to happen?

328
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,510
You're the root of all evil
in this family.

329
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,910
You should be out there praying
with all of your heart...

330
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,820
after quitting your job
to get pregnant.

331
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,450
All you ever do is sit around and nap.

332
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,620
How ridiculous.

333
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,290
You told me to pull out...

334
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,420
all the bedding we had and wash it,
so I washed and dried it.

335
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,860
You told me to clean
all the dishes we had, so I did that, too.

336
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,660
That's the least you can do
as you sit idly.

337
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,530
Women who stay home...

338
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,470
raise their children
and do chores at the same time.

339
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,570
You don't even have a kid.
What's so tiring about that?

340
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,470
How can you get pregnant
if you're that weak?

341
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,710
It's impossible.

342
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,510
You're the problem.

343
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,350
Make dinner.

344
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,880
Grill some meat
and make spicy fish soup, too.

345
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,790
I traced the IP address
of the recently uploaded video,

346
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,900
but a few different countries
popped up at once.

347
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,630
It's not easy to find a trace.

348
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,170
Have you looked into Patrick Jung
of DH Holdings?

349
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,870
Everything about him is
highly confidential,

350
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,940
so I couldn't even find
his nationality or age.

351
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,550
All I know is that he's single
and living in America.

352
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,850
But basically,
he's always on the road on business.

353
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,090
His actual residence
may be different.

354
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,360
I understand for now.
Keep digging into it.

355
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,700
What's the relationship
between Kim Do Yun and Patrick?

356
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,470
Get out.

357
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,880
Honey, will you hear me out?

358
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,850
Why? Is there anything else
you want to stab my back with?

359
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,520
I wanted to tell you the truth many times
while we were together.

360
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,890
You continued
to rise up higher and higher,

361
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,420
but I was...

362
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,660
I felt like nothing compared to you,

363
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,260
so I couldn't make myself
tell you the truth.

364
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,730
How am I going to believe that?

365
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,100
At this point, I can't even believe
that the wedding photo is fake.

366
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,840
No, that much is true.

367
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,210
There's nothing else
I'm deceiving you with. I swear.

368
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,880
I'll sleep in Ji Ho's room,
so don't bother me.

369
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,720
Before we begin,

370
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,260
YL Group seems like
the hottest issue these days.

371
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,100
I enjoyed the video.

372
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,770
You seem to get attacked
by that YouTuber regularly.

373
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,530
There must be bad blood
between you and someone.

374
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,700
That's a question
I want to ask Director Kim Do Yun.

375
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,370
I believe you provided information
to that YouTuber.

376
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,710
Me?

377
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,250
I don't know who that YouTuber is,
and I haven't provided anything.

378
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,680
Please refrain from spreading
a groundless rumor.

379
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,620
I may sue you for defamation.

380
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,090
Yes, right.

381
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,060
It's a present.

382
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,390
For me?

383
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,600
If these risky incidents
continue to break out,

384
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,140
you'll have to eat your hat soon,

385
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,800
so you should
take care of your hair.

386
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,880
That will never happen.

387
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,980
We've chatted for too long.
Let's start the meeting.

388
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,150
If you don't have anything to discuss,
let's end it here.

389
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,390
Recent designs
released by YL Group...

390
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,120
seem complacent.

391
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,890
What do you know about designs...

392
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,730
to blurt out such ignorant words?

393
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,630
The number of sales proves
that my opinion isn't wrong.

394
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,970
Ms. Kang,
you may return to your desk.

395
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,340
Your position isn't high enough
to sit with us.

396
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,940
No, she's the designer,
so she needs to hear this.

397
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,410
Please take a seat.

398
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,450
If you do not promote
trendy, new, and fresh products,

399
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,220
the business may be ruined
in just a few years.

400
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,560
You do not get to talk crudely
just because you're investors.

401
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,320
You claimed to have invested in us
because of our future value,

402
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,590
yet you were so quick to say
we would end up ruined.

403
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,360
I'm saying we will not condone
any complacency...

404
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,900
and a tendency to take
the easy way out...

405
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,870
now that DH Holdings is here.

406
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,070
We must seek something
more challenging and innovative...

407
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
to bring in the biggest profit
as the best.

408
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,310
We'll do that. I accept your offer.

409
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,950
You need to hold your horses.

410
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,510
We haven't even started.

411
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,180
Let me take over.

412
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,350
These were all
your current designers could do.

413
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,990
If they had any innovative thoughts,

414
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,530
they wouldn't have released
such repetitive designs.

415
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,100
We're saying
we'll hire a designer ourselves.

416
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,600
That's nonsense.

417
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,700
We can meet your demands.

418
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,610
You heard her. We'll do it.

419
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,010
I guess you didn't know.

420
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,110
It was one of the terms
of my investment.

421
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,780
It was already clarified
in the contract,

422
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,920
so if you wish to nitpick over this
and protest,

423
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,120
you can take it to Chairman Hwang.

424
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,650
If the chairman is
on the same page as you,

425
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,260
I will pull out the investment.

426
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,000
There's no reason to be in a meeting
with people I can't talk to.

427
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,530
We'll discuss this again
after the chairman gives me an answer.

428
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,670
Time is gold.

429
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,910
You shouldn't waste
this busy man's time like this.

430
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:57,710
Let's go.

431
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,760
I had my boys find an expert
to look into the wedding photo,

432
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,890
and it was faked.

433
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,900
This was the actual wedding photo.

434
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,530
Here.

435
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,210
They were the actual people
in the wedding photo.

436
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,680
The man died
in a car crash three years ago,

437
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,850
and the woman was living a tough life
as a single mother.

438
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,250
Please see it for yourself.

439
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,460
Have you looked into her diploma?

440
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,170
It'll stress you out,
but I'll be frank with you.

441
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,300
Even if you two get into a fight,
don't tell her I looked into it.

442
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,840
Her diploma was faked.

443
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,410
She graduated
from a nameless university.

444
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,780
That YouTuber was right.

445
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,680
The tactic seems to be...

446
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,080
mixing a bit of truth with lies
to add more credibility.

447
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,450
I can set up a meeting
with that woman if you want to.

448
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,790
Should I do that?

449
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,590
No.

450
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,730
Above all, if the wedding photo
was real, that brat...

451
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,630
I mean, Ms. Kang
would've deserved to die.

452
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,270
But forging the educational background
isn't a big deal.

453
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,900
Watch the TV.

454
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,210
There are so many celebrities
who lied about their education.

455
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,910
It's even harder to prove
if someone studied overseas.

456
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:42,910
Ms. Kang lived in America
for a long time,

457
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,320
so do you want me to forge a diploma
from a famous American university?

458
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,620
I don't want
to blow this up anymore.

459
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,760
We're done talking about my wife.

460
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,030
Yes, sir.

461
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,030
How did he respond?

462
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,240
So, he won't be suspicious of me
about that wedding photo anymore.

463
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,940
Good work.

464
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,770
You'll get the money I promised
within the day.

465
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,450
All I have to do now is
find that YouTuber.

466
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,150
Kang Jae In, if it's you,

467
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,290
I'll end your life.

468
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:37,700
What is this?
He clearly saw me walking in.

469
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,340
Is he pretending to ignore me?

470
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,410
I had forgotten about him
walking into my room,

471
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,610
and he chose to bring it up again...

472
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,240
just to apologize.

473
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,080
No way. He must be into me.

474
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,920
What is this?
If he said that before,

475
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,990
I wouldn't have been into Dr. Kim.

476
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,120
My ideal type is a pretty boy
who's also the grandson of a rich family.

477
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,160
He gave this to me on purpose
to see me again...

478
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,690
when I come to return it.

479
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,100
It's tiring
to live as a pretty girl.

480
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,440
I'll let you eat with me...
No, even coffee after the meal.

481
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,980
Well, I couldn't let go
of my ex-crush yet,

482
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,580
but I'll give you a chance.

483
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,480
Try to move my heart.

484
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,860
What's with her?

485
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,390
She's scary.

486
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,430
(Notice of Co-op President Election
and Call for Additional Candidates)

487
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,960
We're electing the new president
for the shopping arcade co-op,

488
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,670
but not enough people
have declared their candidacy.

489
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,070
They asked me to put up
the call for additional candidates.

490
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,740
Will you run?

491
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,610
Goodness, I can't do this.

492
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,140
Why not? You have to.

493
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,080
It's not a random thing.
It's for a presidency.

494
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,850
You should be the president.

495
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,150
I just need to be the CEO.

496
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,980
I don't need to be a president.

497
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,650
It's too much pressure...

498
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,490
to speak in front of people
and hold a title.

499
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,190
(Candidate 1, Noh Sook Ja)

500
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,900
People might see you and think
you're in a beauty pageant.

501
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,000
What's your theme?

502
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,570
Aren't you opening a YouTube channel
to clarify Gi Chan's fake news?

503
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,970
I'm running for the presidency
of the shopping arcade co-op.

504
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,410
I'll film a video anyway,
so I want to promote myself, too.

505
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,410
I'm candidate one, Noh Sook Ja.

506
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,680
Yes, sure.

507
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,120
Okay. Whatever.
Look over here. Okay.

508
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,350
Ready, action!

509
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,330
Hello, my name is Noh Sook Ja.

510
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,200
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
of YL Group...

511
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
did not have an affair.

512
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,100
Should I speak louder?

513
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,900
My daughter-in-law
was never married before, either.

514
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,570
Hey, but she faked
her educational background.

515
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,610
What about that?

516
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,240
Hey, let's stop.

517
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,850
You can't keep talking to me.

518
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,180
Also, don't even mention
her university.

519
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,320
Stop! Let me join you.

520
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,490
I want to be in the video.

521
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,960
It seemed like too much trouble
to open up my own channel,

522
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,690
so I'll promote
my Instagram account here.

523
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,430
I'll treat you and Gi Man...

524
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,760
to a luxury item
when I become an influencer.

525
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,870
It's like a mountain of cheese
on top of steaming rice soup,

526
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,370
such an odd mix.

527
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,870
Whatever.

528
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,400
Anyway, let's roll again.
Please look over here.

529
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,440
Ready, action!

530
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,250
The camera
couldn't contain my beauty.

531
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,620
I look much prettier in real life.

532
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,120
My tiny little face looks huge, too.

533
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,030
So, people who attacked Gi Chan
would see this video...

534
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,530
when you upload this,
just like that other one?

535
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:54,000
Technically, yes.
But don't get your hopes up.

536
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,130
There are so many people
that do this these days.

537
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,840
It won't be easy to get
a lot of views from the start.

538
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,340
- I'm the mother...
- It's me, Noh Sook Ja.

539
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,370
- of YL Group's chairman.
- Why wouldn't people watch...

540
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,440
- I'm pretty, rich,
- a woman this pretty at this age?

541
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,080
- and my skin age is in my thirties.
- Hey.

542
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,750
- I'm pretty much a queen.
- My face looks way too big.

543
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,050
- Can you make it look smaller?
- Hello, I'm Chairman Hwang's...

544
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,720
- Gi Man, do it for me, too.
- younger sister, Hwang Na Ra.

545
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,390
- My son didn't have an affair.
- Go see a plastic surgeon.

546
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,490
- I'm not a doctor.
- My daughter-in-law wasn't married.

547
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,660
- She was never married.
- Stop asking me.

548
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,130
- Do something, Gi Man.
- My son, Chairman Hwang...

549
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,630
- It'll look too obvious.
- Just a little bit, right here.

550
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,900
It'll be too obvious.

551
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,600
- This isn't a supercomputer.
- Just a little.

552
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,170
It'll look too weird
if I alter this part.

553
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,000
- Just a little.
- Or get me a better computer.

554
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,540
So, you want us to remodel
a public institution?

555
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,450
The government made the offer
as a part...

556
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,010
of the social contribution project,
so I accepted it.

557
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,950
We've signed a contract
with YL Group already,

558
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,220
and it'd be a shame
to just fund it and back out.

559
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,550
Doesn't it sound like
a great first project...

560
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,060
for DH Holdings
and YL Group's cooperation?

561
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,190
All right. We'll take it.

562
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,530
We want Designer Kang Jae In
to be in charge.

563
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,830
What do you think?

564
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,140
All right. I'll ask Ms. Kang...

565
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,770
to schedule a meeting.

566
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,310
Can you tell me
who's in charge of the project?

567
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,680
Assemblyman Goo Jin Sang.

568
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,310
Assemblyman Goo Jin Sang?

569
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,920
Yes, is there a problem?

570
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,880
No.

571
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,990
The view count is so low.

572
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,700
What is this?
"Go away, plastic surgery monster."

573
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,030
"Which plastic surgeon is it?"

574
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,970
"Did the mom and the daughter
go to the same surgeon?"

575
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,940
These comments are so rude!

576
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,600
Just wait, all of you.

577
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,610
I'll take screenshots
and make sure you're punished.

578
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,580
(Sook Ja's TV is streaming live.)

579
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,780
What?

580
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,650
It's on.

581
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,320
I am candidate one, Sook Ja,
running as the president...

582
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,820
of the shopping arcade co-op.

583
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,160
I'm sure there's no one else
to vote for except for me.

584
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,530
But if you pick me,
I'll do a wonderful job.

585
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,900
What else was I going to say?

586
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,700
Once again,

587
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,200
my son never had an affair
or set eyes on another woman.

588
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,170
Think of how frustrated I was
to make this video.

589
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,810
Okay?

590
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:22,050
The mother and the son are
both unbelievably shameless.

591
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,650
You should be groveling
for forgiveness and living quietly...

592
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,390
after giving birth to a scumbag
who cheated on his wife.

593
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,090
How brazen of you.

594
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,660
What did you just say?
Did you call him a scumbag?

595
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,060
How dare you call him a scumbag?

596
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,360
Say that again, woman!

597
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,470
What's going on?

598
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,850
(Queen's House)

599
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,320
You entered me as a candidate
for the co-op president?

600
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,220
Goodness, I can't do that.

601
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,590
I'll pay the interest first
in just three days.

602
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,560
This time, I looked overseas
and failed miserably...

603
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,600
instead of the domestic market.

604
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,130
Should I tell Jae In
that Ms. Choi works...

605
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,000
right across the hall from Ms. Noh?

606
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,840
A glass of water, lady.

607
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,240
- What do you think you're doing?
- You can't come in.

608
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,340
What's going on?

609
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,840
Honey.

610
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,420
My gosh.
