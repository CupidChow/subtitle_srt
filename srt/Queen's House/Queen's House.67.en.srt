1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,170
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,780
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,880
(Episode 67)

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,280
Darn it.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,190
Watch where you're going.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,960
You ran into me first,
so it's not for you to say.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,060
You should know your fight
before you pick one.

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,290
You're a talkative one.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,560
Do your thing and go.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,230
I can't listen to this punk anymore.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,610
Take this! Darn it.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,610
Darn it.

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,540
You! Let go of me!

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,460
You're a strong guy.

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,420
Darn you.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,890
- Are you okay?
- Jeez. Let go of me.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,170
- Come here.
- You punks! Stop right now!

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,600
Officers! Over here!

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,200
- It's them. Stay there. You punks!
- Hey, run.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,540
Are you okay, Do Yun?

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,310
Yes, you came right on time.

23
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,580
Hey, just as I was parking,

24
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,210
you called and asked for the police,

25
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,680
and she called and asked
if you were okay and that she was nearby.

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,620
Are you really all right?

27
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,190
Do you have to see a doctor?

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,660
I'm fine.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,530
But I think
we should go somewhere and talk.

30
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,370
How did it go?

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,440
They were attacked?

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,580
So, what about Kim Do Yun?

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,750
The police station?

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,320
Yes, they were caught
by the police on the scene.

35
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,160
What should I do?

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,660
He wasn't badly hurt,

37
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,230
so tell them to keep quiet
until I send an attorney.

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,400
They're first offenders,
so they'll get off with a fine...

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,730
if they cook up a good excuse.

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,100
Bye.

41
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,970
Who did this?

42
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,280
Who the heck did this?

43
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,950
You sent me the text message, right?

44
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,660
Do you remember Kim Do Yun?

45
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,930
Make him bedridden for a while.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Just make sure he isn't dead.

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,540
What are you up to, Gi Chan?

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,810
I must let Do Yun know.

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,720
(Restricted Number: Hwang Gi Chan
is after you. Be careful.)

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,420
Hwang Gi Chan is after you.

51
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,450
Be careful.

52
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,120
I should've done something
to stop this from happening,

53
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,360
but I didn't have
enough information.

54
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,330
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,130
Wait.

56
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,970
You don't remember Do Yun.

57
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,240
How did you send him a warning
about Hwang Gi Chan?

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,910
Are you...

59
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,780
Jae In, did you get
your memories back?

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,420
I...

61
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,820
never lost my memories.

62
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,820
Then, do you remember everything
about the car accident, too?

63
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,190
Yes, I do.

64
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,860
I remember everything.

65
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,370
Jae In.

66
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,740
I was worried sick about you.

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
Thank you for waking up, Jae In.

68
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,710
I'm grateful you're delighted
to see that I'm alive.

69
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,740
Thank you so much for saving me.

70
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,980
But this fight is
between Hwang Gi Chan and me.

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,390
I don't want you
to fall into danger anymore.

72
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,350
Mother.

73
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,120
Your daughter-in-law is here.

74
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,260
I will...

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,560
move into Gi Chan's place.

76
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,860
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

77
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,500
I'll return
everything they did to me.

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,540
I will.

79
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,710
Have a great day.

80
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,640
I'm dreading every second of this,

81
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,210
but I can stand it if this is
what it takes to split up you two.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,980
Bye.

83
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,130
Hey, did you see that?

84
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,960
He must feel shy.

85
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,570
What's this?

86
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
My gosh. Why is Se Ri's earring...

87
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,450
right here?

88
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,980
I doubt that.
Why would she come into this room?

89
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,920
It was juvenile of you
to throw your earring there...

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,150
to show your presence.

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,390
I didn't do it.

92
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,460
You're stifling me right now,

93
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,990
not Jae In, who lost her memories.

94
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,970
Mother.

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,700
Did you put shrimp in this?

96
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,610
Are you okay?

97
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,710
Oh, no. Mom.

98
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,850
Did you, Se Ri?

99
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,260
No, I didn't do this.

100
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,730
I told her
that she was spending too much,

101
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,600
but I didn't do this.

102
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,840
Can we talk?

103
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,340
Goodness.

104
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,350
This is why people say you should
never incur a woman's wrath.

105
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,190
It boggles my mind.

106
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,990
Doesn't it?

107
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,790
I also didn't know...

108
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,230
I could change like this.

109
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,530
No, I'm glad you did this.

110
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,170
They needed
a taste of their own medicine.

111
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,670
Don't you think?

112
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,910
He's right.

113
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,240
You did well.

114
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,580
Do Yun.

115
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,280
Everything went well
with Ms. Park Ji Su,

116
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,120
who framed you
for sexual assault, right?

117
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,520
Yes, she suddenly confessed...

118
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,730
Wait, was it you?

119
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,240
(Park Ji Su)

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,300
Is this Ms. Park Ji Su?

121
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,780
I'm calling about Dr. Kim Do Yun
of YL's in-house clinic.

122
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,510
Do not hang up
and hear me out until the end.

123
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,110
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
already set up everything...

124
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,080
to put the blame on you
if something goes wrong.

125
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,690
If you want to confirm it, go ahead.

126
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,790
But let me be frank with you.

127
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,330
What do you want from me?

128
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,160
You have two choices.

129
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,030
One, just sit around like this
after doing Hwang Gi Chan's bidding.

130
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,570
Then, when I hand over
this phone number to the police,

131
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,640
you'll be repatriated
for fraud and blackmail.

132
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,340
Two.

133
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,610
If you do as I say,

134
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,880
I'll settle everything
and call it over.

135
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,980
Doesn't that sound like
a much better choice...

136
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,550
than becoming a criminal?

137
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,650
This is your only chance.

138
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,890
What do you want to do?

139
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,660
Jae In, this is
such a different side of you.

140
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,260
Thanks to you,
he was cleared of his accusations,

141
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,260
and people on the board...

142
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,200
who protested against him
all became quiet.

143
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,400
I'm glad.

144
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,340
I wanted to expose Gi Chan
as the mastermind,

145
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,580
but there was too much going on.

146
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,850
I thought it'd be better
if I exposed everything later.

147
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,660
Yes, right.

148
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,600
I need to run an errand
for Yun Hee. I forgot.

149
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,770
- I should go.
- I have to go, too.

150
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,030
Don't leave yet.

151
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,070
You two should catch up briefly
before you go.

152
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,640
- Bye.
- Okay.

153
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,110
Are you going back to that house?

154
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,180
I should.

155
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,350
Don't you know
what that family is like?

156
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,190
I would've stopped you from going
if I knew you had your memories.

157
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,990
That was...

158
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,460
why I couldn't tell you.

159
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,470
We said we'd work together.

160
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,870
Why do you want
to deal with this alone?

161
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,140
I'm not the old Jae In anymore.

162
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,870
I came back from the brink of death.

163
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,580
Once I came back,

164
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,650
there was nothing I couldn't do...

165
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,250
or anything I was scared of.

166
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,390
You don't have
to worry about me anymore.

167
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,890
How can I not worry?

168
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,530
I worried about you
every single day.

169
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,870
My dad mentioned the house
in his last will.

170
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,610
There's something he left behind
somewhere in that house.

171
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,750
I'll leave as soon as I find that.

172
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,320
I'll reach out...

173
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,890
if I ever need help.

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,230
You have to.

175
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,540
It's late, but she hasn't come back.

176
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,670
Her memories must've returned.

177
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,040
She probably went out
to see Director Kim Do Yun.

178
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,150
Choi Ja Young is
still in the master bedroom.

179
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,880
She wouldn't have deserted
her own mother.

180
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,780
Her mom has dementia.

181
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,790
She must've noticed
when her memories came back...

182
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,220
and decided to leave her.

183
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,320
She's not like you.

184
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,460
Oh, my. You came home early.

185
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,230
Hey. Where have you been
until this hour?

186
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,670
Were you with Director Kim Do Yun?

187
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,170
I noticed yesterday that you two
seemed to have a lot to talk about.

188
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,180
What do you mean by that, Se Ri?

189
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,540
Are you saying Mr. Kim and I have...

190
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,410
the kind of relationship
where we have a lot to talk about?

191
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,850
You must know better than I do.

192
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,650
You got your memories back,
didn't you?

193
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,690
Hey, Yu Gyeong.

194
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,260
I just got home.

195
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,690
Me, too. I lost track of time
while chatting with you.

196
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,260
We should meet more often.

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,630
Okay. Goodbye.

198
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,040
Were you with Yu Gyeong?

199
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,470
Yes, she called me in the afternoon,
so I met with her.

200
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,840
You also said you'd be late.

201
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,280
Se Ri, is there something
I need to remember?

202
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,380
There's no such thing.

203
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,750
She's just saying that.

204
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,120
Isn't that so, Se Ri?

205
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,990
The way she said it
makes me concerned.

206
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,760
Did you eat dinner with Yu Gyeong?

207
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,030
Jae In. Were you with Yu Gyeong?

208
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,770
Yes, I just came back
after seeing her.

209
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,400
You should've told me.

210
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,740
It would've been great
if I saw her with you.

211
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,040
I'm tired.
I'll go upstairs and get some rest.

212
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,680
Okay. I'll go with you.

213
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,850
Be careful.

214
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,900
Mom.

215
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,470
Are you going out?

216
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,070
Yes.

217
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,570
Anyway, do you remember
what happened a few days ago?

218
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,480
You talked to Dad
as if he were still with us.

219
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,550
It must be a habit.

220
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,290
I still can't believe
your dad passed away,

221
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,720
so at times, it feels like
he's still by my side.

222
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,230
I start talking to him
when that happens.

223
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,830
It may seem odd,

224
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,370
but I do that when I miss him,
so just let it go.

225
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,700
But don't do that too often.

226
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,840
If you miss him,
we can visit him together.

227
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,040
He isn't resting far away.

228
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,310
All right. I'll do that.

229
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,110
You said you were leaving.

230
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,620
Yes, goodbye.

231
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,060
The notebook.

232
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,930
I brought
my husband's notebook here.

233
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,700
Where did I put it?

234
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,210
Hello, Ms. Choi?

235
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,780
I packed up everything
when I sent your things last time.

236
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,250
I don't know.

237
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,460
Can you tell me
the kind of notebook you're looking for?

238
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,590
Yes, all right.

239
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,760
She must be looking for something.

240
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,930
She'll be here today.

241
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,970
Is she all right?

242
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,440
Yes, she seems fine.

243
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,040
I hope she doesn't forget
to take her medicine.

244
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,780
She recently got confused again.

245
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,380
Jae In doesn't know, does she?

246
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,650
No, it might be
too much for her to handle,

247
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,090
so I couldn't tell her yet.

248
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,260
You and I should check in with her
and look after her...

249
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,960
until her memories return.

250
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,200
Why?

251
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,300
You seemed to have found
enough peace of mind...

252
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,370
and the will to go on,

253
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,440
so you can even be considerate
of Jae In. It's nice to see.

254
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,810
Yes, I found my peace now.

255
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,740
You don't have
to worry about me, Dad.

256
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,340
Gi Chan is coming with me
to the coffee shop tomorrow.

257
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,310
That's the only way
he'll stop suspecting me.

258
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,480
Pretend like you didn't know,
but I wanted to give you a heads up.

259
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,790
Hello.

260
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,820
I came with my husband
without asking you first.

261
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,100
Hello, Director Kim Do Yun.

262
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
Hello.

263
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,430
Honey.

264
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,450
You said you had something to say,

265
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,650
and I thought it'd be better...

266
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,550
if I heard it with my husband.

267
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,670
I also didn't feel easy...

268
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,640
about meeting someone
I didn't know in private.

269
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,310
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,010
It's all right.

271
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,920
I heard you had something to say.

272
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,450
Please do.

273
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,820
It wasn't anything special.

274
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,060
I wanted to confirm
if she really didn't remember.

275
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,700
But you two are
sitting here like this,

276
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,470
so it must be true.

277
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,600
It must be exciting for you.

278
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,040
Who's your real wife?

279
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,640
I'm getting curious.

280
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,380
That's all I have to say.

281
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,610
I'm sorry for calling you out here.

282
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,880
Please excuse me.

283
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,450
Well then.

284
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,600
Honey, wasn't that weird?

285
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,630
He said, "Who's your real wife?"

286
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,500
What does he mean by that?

287
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,840
Nothing. It doesn't mean anything.

288
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,270
It was just nonsense.

289
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,010
But still...

290
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,220
We're married.

291
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,720
You don't have to worry about him.

292
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,390
All you have to do is trust me...

293
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,120
and listen to what I have to say.

294
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,560
All right.

295
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,130
I'll trust only you.

296
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,730
Gi Chan.

297
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,600
Just as I paid my price
for trusting you,

298
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,740
you'll pay yours.

299
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,910
What?

300
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,650
There's a record that
I made a claim for fire damage?

301
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,720
I got the payment
along with my husband's death benefit?

302
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,060
That's impossible.

303
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,360
I never took out a plan
or received the payment.

304
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,530
Something must be wrong
in your system.

305
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,660
- I'm back.
- Yes.

306
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,270
Yes. Please check once again.

307
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,070
All right. Goodbye.

308
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,640
That's odd.

309
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,510
What is it?

310
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:37,210
I had to take out
fire liability insurance...

311
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,320
for this business
because it was mandatory,

312
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,020
but I was always concerned
about not having regular fire insurance.

313
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,220
After what happened to my husband,

314
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,920
I thought I should take one out,

315
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,860
but it seemed complicated.

316
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,330
If it's too big a hassle,
should I look into it?

317
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,260
It's okay. You're busy with work.

318
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,700
The insurance planner will check
and get back to me.

319
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,970
Anyway, aren't you busy
around this time of the day?

320
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,970
I had a meeting nearby,
so I came by for a second.

321
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,280
Should I make your favorite,
soybean paste soup, for dinner?

322
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,340
When will you be home?

323
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,550
What?

324
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,520
I have to meet someone
for dinner tonight. I'm sorry.

325
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,650
Do you have to meet someone
for work again?

326
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,020
What?

327
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,590
Yes, something like that.

328
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,090
All right, then.
I'll make it tomorrow morning.

329
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,100
I'm sorry, Yun Hee.

330
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,300
Even if I don't consider
my history with Mi Ran,

331
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,710
the fact that she's the family
of Do Hee's murderer won't change.

332
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,870
That's why I can't be honest.

333
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,740
Whoa.

334
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,750
So, what is it?
What more do I need to fix up?

335
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,050
You told me to see a doctor.

336
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,420
Dang it. Should I have gotten
the facial contouring?

337
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,660
I have to persuade my mom to do that,
so it'll take a while.

338
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,260
Anything else?

339
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,600
What else
do you want me to get done?

340
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,700
Ms. Hwang.

341
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,600
You're acting delusional,
thinking I'm into you.

342
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,240
I do not have any intention
of working things out with you,

343
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,140
not even a little bit,
so stop doing this to me.

344
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,380
I was trying to tell you
to get treated by a doctor...

345
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
or find a counselor to talk to.

346
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,720
I'm not crazy!

347
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,350
You're awful!

348
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,330
You didn't have to get me this
when you came here.

349
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,730
I thought you'd feel snacky.

350
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,130
Thank you for calling yesterday.

351
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,540
May I ask why you needed me
to make that call yesterday?

352
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,870
Of course.
I have something to tell you,

353
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,780
and there's something
I need you to do, too.

354
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,610
Yu Gyeong.

355
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,310
Don't be alarmed and listen.

356
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,950
I never lost my memories.

357
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,720
Really? Do you remember everything?

358
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,290
Yes, I remember
everything clearly...

359
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,230
without leaving anything out.

360
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,070
I'm so relieved, Jae In.

361
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm so glad.

362
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,820
All these are wrinkled.

363
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,520
- I'm home.
- You're back.

364
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,750
Where's my mom?

365
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,960
She went out.

366
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,090
It'd be nice if she could stay
and help out with the chores,

367
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,230
but she must be feeling itchy.

368
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,760
She never stays home.

369
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,430
Are you going to wash those?

370
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,570
No, I'm giving these
to the cleaner's.

371
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,370
I have to get these ironed.

372
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,810
Give them to me. I'll do it.

373
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,680
You will?

374
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,580
I'm not sure
if I can make you do this.

375
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,250
It's dinnertime soon,
so you'll have to cook, too.

376
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,650
I can do it after ironing those.
Let me have them.

377
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,420
She may have lost her memories,

378
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,760
but she's still
the same penniless girl.

379
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,630
I can't treat her
like my boss forever.

380
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,470
Then, please do that.

381
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,930
I have to get some rest.

382
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,850
Look. It's a toolbox.

383
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,150
I got it for your business.

384
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,220
It has
all the basic tools you'll need.

385
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,820
Gosh, thanks.

386
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,460
But I'm not sure
if I can use all these.

387
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,920
I didn't get these for you.

388
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,830
I'm going to use them here.

389
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,460
I couldn't change the lightbulb last time
because I needed tools.

390
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,300
You don't need any tools
to change the lightbulb.

391
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,840
What?

392
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,740
Anyway, you have a toolbox now,
so call me when something breaks.

393
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,240
Okay?

394
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,910
All right. I'll do that.

395
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,720
Look.

396
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,790
This hammer may look tiny,

397
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,160
but it's still too heavy
for you to use.

398
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,480
Did you feel...

399
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,310
the zap?

400
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,580
What?

401
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,810
Yes.

402
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
Was it static?

403
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,590
There's nothing here
that can cause static.

404
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,890
Gosh, it's hot in here.
Is it just me?

405
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,330
Yes, is the air conditioning
too weak?

406
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,870
Where's the remote control?

407
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,440
What's this smell?

408
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,350
Something smells burning.

409
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,820
What's this smell?

410
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,060
Goodness! Oh, no.

411
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,860
What? No.

412
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,330
My gosh. Look at this.

413
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,330
It's my favorite shirt!

414
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,140
I'm sorry, Mother.

415
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,070
I must've burnt it
while thinking about something else.

416
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,410
You turned this expensive shirt
into a piece of trash!

417
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,450
Why would you think
about something else while ironing?

418
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,850
You should've been focused.

419
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
I'm sorry, Mother.

420
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,090
Is that all you can say?

421
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,860
Words can't bring my shirt back.

422
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,790
Are you trying to get revenge,

423
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,200
thinking I ripped all the clothes
you shopped for last time?

424
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,400
Did you think I was a joke
because I kept putting up with you?

425
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,870
Hey! Even if I did that,

426
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,000
- you...
- Mom!

427
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,640
You need to stop.

428
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,680
What's with all the ruckus?

429
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,350
Honey, I burnt
Mother's clothes by mistake...

430
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,320
while ironing them, and...

431
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,590
It's okay. Stop crying.

432
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,860
Things like this can happen.

433
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,530
Hear me out, Gi Chan.

434
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,930
That's enough.

435
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,730
Why are you making such a scene
for burning a shirt?

436
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,600
She's still unwell.

437
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,600
This isn't something
to be so mad about,

438
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,170
and you can always get another one.

439
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,940
Gi Chan, are you taking her side?

440
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,780
Mom, this isn't about taking sides.

441
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,550
Stop it, honey.

442
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,250
It's all my fault. Don't do that.

443
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,450
I'm sorry, Mother.

444
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,960
I'll buy you
as many clothes as you want,

445
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,390
so you need to stop.

446
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,360
- What...
- Let's go upstairs.

447
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,600
Goodness gracious.
This is so unfair.

448
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,140
This isn't fair.

449
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,140
Let me see that, Mother.

450
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,410
You must be heartbroken.

451
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,680
This is last year's collection,
so you won't be able to find this.

452
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,120
I'm already stressed out right now!

453
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,550
Are you trying to tease me?

454
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,860
Well, she needed to suffer
to appreciate her daughter-in-law.

455
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,930
I thought Jae In was slow,
but she was rather sly.

456
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,470
- Cut it out.
- All right.

457
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,470
- Stop for a second. Wait for me.
- I told you to cut it out!

458
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,210
What the heck?

459
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,580
If you came alone,
go sit in a corner and drink.

460
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,950
You're getting in my way.

461
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,720
You need to stop.

462
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,460
You should drop a guy...

463
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,430
who screams at a strange woman...

464
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,630
just because he's drunk.

465
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,060
Lady.

466
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,470
Who do you think you are?

467
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,500
Who do you think you are
to tell her to leave me?

468
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,870
My girl got scared.
What are you going to do now?

469
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,950
Don't you see
that my girl is in shock?

470
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:33,180
Do you think you're in a drama?
What is this?

471
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,250
Let go of me.

472
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,620
Who do you think you are?

473
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,820
I'm her boyfriend, you punk.

474
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,760
I'll get the CCTV footage
of you picking a fight...

475
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,160
and laying a hand on my girl...

476
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,690
and make it public
to your work, your family,

477
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,460
and even your girlfriend's family.

478
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,870
It's a piece of cake...

479
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,970
for me to shun you
from all of society.

480
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,110
Go. Just go. Let's go.

481
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,190
You shouldn't have let him off.

482
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,360
A guy...

483
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,390
who treats women like that...

484
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,060
deserves to sit behind bars.

485
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,430
Darn it.
I haven't been this mad for a while.

486
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,530
So, why did you meddle in this?

487
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,570
It had nothing to do with you.

488
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,170
Why not?

489
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,610
No one is
as involved with you as I am.

490
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,410
What are we, then?

491
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,850
I thought you didn't want
anything to do with me.

492
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,170
Let's get into
that kind of relationship.

493
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,570
Are you serious?

494
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,980
Honestly, I still find your family
unpleasant and appalling...

495
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,810
because you're related
to Do Hee's death.

496
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,690
But let's get back together.

497
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,690
I want to check and see...

498
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,060
how far my feelings go.

499
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,510
Will you...

500
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,110
go out with me?

501
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,880
Everything is ready.
Come and have a seat.

502
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,390
All right.

503
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,420
(Queen's House)

504
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,650
Congratulations. You're pregnant.

505
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,620
My head hurts.

506
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,260
Gi Chan, you punk.

507
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,430
Don't you know
what her condition is like?

508
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,460
It's not your place to meddle in this,
my brother-in-law.

509
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,160
Did you call me your brother-in-law?

510
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,630
You must be absorbed in this play,
but you two are strangers now.

511
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,100
What now?

512
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,740
What will you do with my sister?

513
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,440
Can she handle everything
when her memories return?

514
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,240
What am I supposed to do, Jae In?
