1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,840
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,780
You don't have to mind this,
Ms. Jung.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,750
(Candidate 1, Noh Sook Ja)

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,920
"Ms. Jung?"

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,920
Are you two acquainted?

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,220
This is Mi Sook, my new hire.
Do Mi Sook.

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,330
Mi Sook? Does she work here?

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,760
She's not Mi Sook...

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,000
Forget it.

12
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,570
Ms. Jung will run
as the co-op president,

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,840
so you'll stay out of it, lady.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,940
Who do you think you are
to tell me to stay out of it?

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,440
And why are you calling me lady?

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,810
I'm the CEO of a business, too.

17
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,580
Call me CEO Noh.

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,750
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,420
Hey, lady.

20
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,450
You aren't my boss,

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,850
are you?

22
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,920
I can't stand this anymore.
Are you trying to pick a fight?

23
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,260
Goodness, you need to stop.

24
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,860
It'd be great
if you were the co-op president.

25
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,330
Our shopping arcade would thrive
with a worthy candidate like you.

26
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,500
Ms. Jung, this is just an example,

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,200
but what do you think
about an awful woman...

28
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,110
who colluded with her unfaithful son
and shut her daughter-in-law...

29
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,240
in a mental institution,
becoming the co-op president?

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,910
That son of hers even had a child
with the other woman.

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,250
Is that all right?

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,050
My goodness.
How can people be so evil?

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,250
People like that
shouldn't dare to run for office.

34
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,320
No, they should be
shunned from our society.

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,230
Do you want to know
who those crazy people are?

36
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,160
This world is
much smaller than you think.

37
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,400
I can't let that crazy woman...

38
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,800
blurt out nonsense to Oh Seong.

39
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,370
(Candidate 1, Noh Sook Ja)

40
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,540
Goodness.
I don't want to be the president.

41
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,480
If I had known you were running,

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,580
I wouldn't even have entered.

43
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,580
If you enter the election,
I'll vote for you,

44
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,320
so you have to run, okay?

45
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,020
Didn't you promote yourself...

46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,760
because you wanted to be one,
CEO Noh?

47
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,830
I feel like such a stranger
when you call me CEO Noh.

48
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,930
Didn't we say
we should be friends...

49
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,000
when we shared a drink together?

50
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,570
We may not go completely casual,

51
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,040
but let's call each other by name
like the time...

52
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,010
when we lived under the same roof
in the same neighborhood.

53
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,080
Okay, then.

54
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,950
Sook Ja, you should
still run for the co-op president.

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,020
If that's what you want,
then I will, Yun Hee.

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,260
I don't care
if I lose my part-time job here.

57
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,760
But you seem to care a lot.

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,700
Should I expose us both
and both be humiliated?

59
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,100
I'm done. I'll drop out.

60
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,170
I kept thinking about it
only to realize...

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,810
you'd be the best candidate, not me.

62
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,520
Give me just a week. No. Three days.

63
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,190
I'll pay the interest first
in just three days.

64
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,190
I didn't know the world would be
suddenly shaken up like this.

65
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,060
This time, I looked overseas...

66
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,130
and failed miserably
instead of the domestic market.

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,430
It plummeted and became nothing,

68
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,570
so how could I pull it out now...

69
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,740
Darn it.

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,840
Yes, okay. Just trust me and wait.
It's okay. Bye.

71
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,080
Why did that woman
suddenly show up across the hall...

72
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,350
only to make my life so miserable?

73
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,450
How dare she call me crazy?

74
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,450
Her family was ruined,
and she's now a murderer,

75
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,520
yet she interferes
with everything that I do!

76
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,990
Who?

77
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,060
I can't even show my temper...

78
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,190
in case she says something weird
to Oh Seong. Darn it!

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,160
Gosh.

80
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,230
You entered me as a candidate
for the co-op president?

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,540
Goodness, I can't do that.

82
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,040
I should go and pull myself out.

83
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,910
Why not? You have to do it.

84
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,240
It's too much pressure,
and I don't know how to do anything.

85
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,250
And if I'm going to do it,
I have to do a good job.

86
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,980
I can't do this.

87
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,320
Why not?
You can do it if you try it.

88
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,390
You're a much better candidate...

89
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,020
than the woman
at the pig's feet place.

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,660
I'll help you, so do it.

91
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,000
Anyway, you must know
the CEO across the hall very well.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,160
How do you know her?

93
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,600
She's my mortal enemy.

94
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,870
She's the most awful woman,
so be careful.

95
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,310
Nothing good will come
from befriending a woman like her.

96
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,840
She'll only betray you later.

97
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,580
Remember that.

98
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,680
Okay.

99
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,820
What's so funny?

100
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,790
You feel like an older sister.

101
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,260
I don't have one,
so it feels reassuring to have you around.

102
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,250
That laptop was...

103
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,560
the real one.

104
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,900
"It was full of beautiful sounds
every single day."

105
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,200
Daddy!

106
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,930
Hey, Ji Ho.

107
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,030
Did you study hard
at the kindergarten today?

108
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,440
Yes, Daddy. Let's play.

109
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,970
Okay. Let me get changed first.

110
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,880
- All right.
- Ji Ho, go play in your room.

111
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,450
Okay.

112
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,460
I thought you'd be late,
but you got home early.

113
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,930
Have you had dinner?

114
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,630
I don't have an appetite.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,830
Honey. Baby.

116
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,740
Look at me. Please?

117
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,840
Will you look at me?

118
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,180
I'm sorry, honey.

119
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,310
I didn't want to lie
about my education.

120
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,320
Jae In had looked down on me often
back when we were in school.

121
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,120
So, I came up with that lie
when I was 20,

122
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,820
and it just stuck.

123
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,160
I also had no idea
I'd fall in love with you.

124
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,760
I know I should've told you
at that time,

125
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,600
but I must've been afraid
you'd leave me.

126
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,400
Director Kang Mi Ran chose me
and gave me a job...

127
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
because of my talent.

128
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,970
My diploma doesn't mean everything.

129
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,080
But if you want a better one,
I'll go to a graduate school.

130
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,950
I'll be someone who's worthy of you.

131
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,510
Se Ri.

132
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,550
It's all right to lack something
and not be enough.

133
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,650
But deceit is
one thing I cannot stand.

134
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,620
I was always sincere with you.

135
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,960
I mean it.

136
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,800
I'll believe what you said.

137
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm only letting this go...

138
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,540
because everything happened
before we met...

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,470
and because your education
wasn't why I fell in love with you.

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,140
But you can't deceive me anymore
in the future.

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,750
I really love you.

142
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,990
Mom, calm down.

143
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,790
- Calm down.
- Don't talk to me like I'm a cow.

144
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,960
You're home, Mother.

145
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,060
Yes.

146
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm about to blow up and die.
Darn it!

147
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,200
Bring me some cold water!

148
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,800
Did something happen?

149
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,110
Something crazy, ridiculous...

150
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,840
"And stifling happened."
You were about to say that, right?

151
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,350
I'll end up dead
before my time is up.

152
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,280
It's that woman,
Kang Jae In's mother.

153
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,150
She's working part-time at the place
right across the hall from me.

154
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,690
That's not all.

155
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,390
Yu Gyeong's father is
also working there.

156
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,930
It's not like
they're going to prom as a pair.

157
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,360
Good grief.
And what did she say her name was?

158
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,800
She gave a fake name
and said she was Mi Sook...

159
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,030
to work there.

160
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,670
Jae In's mom works there?

161
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,300
What does she do?

162
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,370
She's a server, a part-timer.

163
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,670
You don't have to mind her.

164
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,310
She has
nothing to do with you anymore.

165
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,310
That serves her right.

166
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,210
She used to act so haughty,

167
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,680
but she's now a part-timer
at a tiny restaurant.

168
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,520
Come to think of it, you're right.

169
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,550
That serves her right!

170
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,730
I'm scared she'll pick a fight with me
over everything.

171
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,160
Why hasn't the Grim Reaper
come for that woman yet?

172
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,630
Mother, here it is.

173
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,500
Do you feel unwell?

174
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,240
You look pale.

175
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,740
I went to the hospital.

176
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,910
It must be
because of the trigger shot.

177
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,610
How ridiculous.

178
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,440
You should just live your life
if you can't have a kid.

179
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,380
You can't make this happen
by trying hard.

180
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,520
- Mom!
- Why are you yelling at me?

181
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,980
I'm not wrong.

182
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,390
Look at her.

183
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,420
She's way too thin to be pregnant.

184
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,960
Come to the business starting tomorrow
and help out your husband.

185
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Mom, she's a doctor.

186
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,430
She can't do that,
and she was born weak, too.

187
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Good grief.

188
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,100
Then what? Was I born
to run a pig's feet restaurant?

189
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,370
There's nothing anyone can't do.

190
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,770
She has to move around
to stay in good health...

191
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,470
if she wants to have a kid.

192
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,970
Look at me. My bones are
still as strong as iron...

193
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,610
even after giving birth
to you three.

194
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,510
I'll do as you say.

195
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,080
I have to go back and make dinner.

196
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,480
What are you doing?

197
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,590
What?

198
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,390
Why aren't you helping her?

199
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,890
Do you expect her to do everything?

200
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,560
I'm not a good cook.

201
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,690
- I'll set the table.
- Sit down.

202
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,830
Why are you taking this out on her?

203
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,370
She worked all day
and got off work just now.

204
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,830
Cut it out.

205
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,800
Yes, the chairman is right.

206
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,310
Yu Gyeong isn't working,
so she has to do chores.

207
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,240
I have to take her side...

208
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
because you always play favorites.

209
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,480
- Darn it.
- Look at that pushover.

210
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,230
Do you need any help?

211
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,360
Jae In?

212
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,000
What's on your mind?

213
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,870
It's Gi Chan.

214
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,510
The laptop in his office
must've been a secondary one.

215
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,710
He had been carrying around...

216
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,140
the actual laptop
that had the files we needed.

217
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,610
I'm sure
it's full of his corruption.

218
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,980
But I have no idea
how I can get to it.

219
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,420
It won't be easy.

220
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,820
I'll think about it, too.

221
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,430
Ms. Kang, Grandma wants you
to come out quickly.

222
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,400
Okay.

223
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,570
I don't really care for it,
and it's just a lot of pressure.

224
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,370
But Mi Sook turned in
the application already.

225
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,780
I'm not sure
if this is the right thing to do.

226
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm afraid
I'll only end up humiliated.

227
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,480
Why would you be humiliated?
If you don't make it, that's that.

228
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,980
You've been too busy to go
to the arcade meet-ups anyway.

229
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,690
Use this chance to get to know them
and befriend everyone.

230
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,320
Do you only want to slave away
before your time is up?

231
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,190
You have to live a little, Yun Hee.

232
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,130
I'm all for you running
as the co-op president.

233
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,130
I'm all for it, too.

234
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,500
Me, too, Mom. You got this!

235
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,200
And me, too!

236
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,270
See? Everyone is all for it.

237
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,910
You should invite Mi Sook home soon.

238
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,270
She seems like an open-minded woman.

239
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,380
I'll treat her
to a wonderful dinner.

240
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,240
It's all right.

241
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,710
I'll treat her
if I become the president,

242
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,880
including everyone here.

243
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,280
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

244
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,320
Meat!

245
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,460
Let's eat.

246
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,690
What did Ms. Jung say when you said
you entered her instead?

247
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,460
What do you think?
She said she got it.

248
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,230
I pushed her into saying yes.

249
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,430
Someone like her
should be the president.

250
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,600
How can Hwang Gi Chan's mother
want to be one?

251
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,340
She'd ruin
the entire shopping arcade.

252
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,340
And don't vote for that woman...

253
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,640
just because she's your in-law.

254
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,750
This is bad.

255
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,120
I'm sure she'll continue
to quarrel with Ms. Noh.

256
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,630
Should I tell Jae In
that Ms. Choi works...

257
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,560
right across the hall from Ms. Noh?

258
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,830
No, I don't know
how long she'll work there.

259
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,040
I don't need
to make her worried already.

260
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,270
Assemblyman Goo Jin Sang
has arrived downstairs.

261
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,590
What are you doing?

262
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,360
Assemblyman Goo Jin Sang
must use this elevator.

263
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,460
You can take the next one.

264
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,280
It's not like
this is only for his use.

265
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,710
It's empty, so let me get in.

266
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,310
Let's not waste electricity.

267
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,910
- I'm sorry.
- What is this?

268
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,080
What are you doing?
Wrap it up and get in.

269
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,180
No, please take the next one.

270
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,920
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm sorry.

271
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,990
What's going on?

272
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,660
Honey.

273
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,900
My gosh. You haven't aged a day.

274
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,530
You still look the same.

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,330
Hello, Assemblyman Goo.

276
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,440
Right. I'm sorry I couldn't be there
at Gyu Cheol's funeral.

277
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,810
I was really busy back then.

278
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,880
Why don't we get a cup of tea
and catch up on each other?

279
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,210
Please come to my office.

280
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,250
Sure.

281
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,350
Please.

282
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,170
I have to get into
Gi Chan's laptop quickly,

283
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,940
but I can't think of a way.

284
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,470
Let's not rush things
and wait for a chance.

285
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,140
I'm sure we'll see an opportunity.

286
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,220
This is the remodeling floor plan
for the daycare center project.

287
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,420
Please take a look.

288
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,820
You're here.

289
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,290
She brought the floor plan
for the daycare center project.

290
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,020
- Take a look.
- Yes, okay.

291
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,290
Do you know
who Assemblyman Goo Jin Sang is?

292
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,290
He just got here.

293
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,400
He must be here
to check the floor plan.

294
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,470
Well, that's probably the excuse.
He must be here to see my aunt.

295
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,330
It'll make her life hard.

296
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,440
Actually, he's her ex-husband.

297
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,440
Assemblyman Goo Jin Sang?

298
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,310
Yes, it had been a while
since they got divorced.

299
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,580
Why did they divorce?

300
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,550
I don't know the details,

301
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,690
but I believe they separated...

302
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,990
because Assemblyman Goo had
lots of problems.

303
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,970
Why did I join
Mom's YouTube video...

304
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,000
and humiliate myself
with my face all over the Internet?

305
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,510
Why am I in this mess?

306
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,650
What does this say?

307
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,690
Wouldn't it be better
if you took those off?

308
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,860
My gosh.

309
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,830
That's yuja chamomile tea.

310
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,800
What's he doing?
Why did he suddenly get closer?

311
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,540
You felt too shy
to ask me out first,

312
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,740
so you decided
to come and chat like this, right?

313
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,650
How does reading some words
turn into that?

314
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,720
I don't really like the shy types.

315
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,550
Well, you had the courage
to strike up a conversation,

316
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,260
so I'll let you eat
and have coffee with me twice.

317
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,430
I'm free next Monday
and Friday at dinner,

318
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,400
so call me
when you decide on the date.

319
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,730
It felt like talking to a wall.

320
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,900
There seems to be
a great misunderstanding.

321
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,410
I have to go pick up Bo Ram.

322
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,180
Please look after the place.

323
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,980
Where are the servers?

324
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,650
Why won't anyone
tell the customer to sit?

325
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,190
Our cook isn't here,
so we can't take customers now.

326
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,250
Please leave.

327
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,320
I'll wait until the cook returns.

328
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,800
A glass of water, lady.

329
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,340
Oh, my. Oops.

330
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,410
You should wipe this off.

331
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,720
I need a glass of water.

332
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,340
You're such a good server.

333
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,340
It suits you well.

334
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,280
How crude.

335
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,120
That's not the way
you should talk to a customer, lady.

336
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,750
Haven't you received any training
in customer service?

337
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,790
Apologize to me now.

338
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,760
Speak for yourself.

339
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,290
I never considered you a customer,
so leave.

340
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,900
Do you know
that Jae In works for me now?

341
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,130
Your great daughter, Kang Jae In,

342
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,470
now has me as her boss.

343
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,610
Jae In works for you?

344
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,910
Don't give me
this ridiculous nonsense.

345
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,610
I think this situation is
more ridiculous.

346
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,350
Does the owner here know...

347
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,420
that you killed a person?

348
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,460
It was all because of you...

349
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,090
So, why did you ask me
to be the spy?

350
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,560
An innocent woman died
because of you, lady.

351
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,930
You'll probably kill everyone
if you don't like them.

352
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,570
I should tell the owner here
to be careful.

353
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,410
Have you lost your mind?

354
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,050
Don't you think I can kill you, too?

355
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,220
I didn't do anything wrong.

356
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,020
You were the one who framed her.

357
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,930
Ms. Kim Do Hee died in your place.

358
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,330
That's not my karma...

359
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,530
but yours.

360
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,270
Just wait.

361
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,070
There will come a day
when you shed tears of blood.

362
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,640
How is that on me?

363
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,740
You're the murderer.

364
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,910
How despicable.

365
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,340
Get lost from before me now.

366
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,880
If you don't,
today will be the last day you breathe.

367
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,790
I'm not leaving because I'm scared.
I'm disgusted by you.

368
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,830
The office space
and daycare center were designed...

369
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,970
to flow naturally.

370
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,670
We'll install open desks
and mini counters...

371
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,510
to let the teachers easily
keep an eye on the children...

372
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,310
I'm not done explaining.

373
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,120
Let me know
if you wish to make modifications.

374
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,980
You can do as you like.

375
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,920
You don't have to continue.

376
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,330
You can't play hard to get forever.

377
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,600
You've done enough.

378
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,870
You need to stop.

379
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,930
If you're done, let's go.
I'll see you off.

380
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,310
Let's catch up a little.

381
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,140
I told you to stop.

382
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,510
What kind of indecency is this?

383
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,580
You're still
the same unfriendly woman.

384
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,780
You don't have
any soft side as a woman.

385
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,780
Who would want
to spend the night with you?

386
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,450
That was why I divorced you.

387
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,460
Did you cheat on me...

388
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,390
with so many women
because I wasn't soft enough?

389
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,330
Let's set the record straight.

390
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,000
I wanted to divorce you first.

391
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,970
You won't get anything
by getting on my bad side.

392
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,040
Try to please me.

393
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,100
You're still
as shameless as that time.

394
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,040
You're so brazen.

395
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,910
I just wanted to catch up with you.

396
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,080
Why are you
rubbing me the wrong way?

397
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,510
I told you to stop!

398
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,210
You little...

399
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,620
I didn't realize it was you,
Assemblyman Goo Jin Sang.

400
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,160
I am CEO Patrick Jung
of DH Holdings.

401
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,700
You're...

402
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,730
I'm not the type
who can beat around the bush.

403
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,670
Frankly, that was very unpleasant.

404
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,240
I volunteered to invest
in this government project...

405
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,470
because it had a great cause.

406
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,110
But from what I heard outside,

407
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,710
you were crossing the line
with overly personal questions.

408
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,220
I don't think I can trust you
as the person in charge.

409
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,050
Mr. Jung, I think
there is a misunderstanding.

410
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,490
Wouldn't it
make your life troublesome...

411
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,420
if I fall into
a deeper misunderstanding...

412
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,730
and want to pull out
the investment from this project?

413
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,000
I hear DH Holdings was
the biggest sponsor.

414
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,330
Well, what can I do
to lift your misunderstanding?

415
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,940
We should let
the working-level staff discuss these.

416
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,910
There are many eyes...

417
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,540
and CCTV cameras around,

418
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,410
so you don't have
to come here yourself.

419
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,080
I hear a tiny little scandal is...

420
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,850
enough to end a politician's career.

421
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,720
All right. Don't worry about it.

422
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,490
I'll only have our staff
come to the meetings from now on.

423
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,690
Now, our employees are out there,

424
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,400
so you should
probably leave quietly.

425
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,500
Yes, of course.

426
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,770
Bye.

427
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,150
Thanks.

428
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,480
Pretend like
you didn't see anything.

429
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,720
You married a jerk like that?

430
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,260
I thought you married
an amazing man...

431
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,530
from an affluent family
as an affluent woman,

432
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,060
but that was quite a sight.

433
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,170
You need to leave
if you're here to humiliate me.

434
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,640
I've also been humiliated
a long time ago...

435
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,900
by you, Mi Ran.

436
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,390
I'm at the restaurant.

437
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,560
Okay, you can come.

438
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,930
So, you two are running the business
after taking off with my money?

439
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,830
Who are you?

440
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,440
Do you know them?

441
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,770
Yes, they're doing business with me.

442
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,010
Let's go outside.
You can talk to me.

443
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,580
We need to talk to someone
who can actually help us.

444
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,950
I don't think you're the one
who can pay us back.

445
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,850
- I think it's her.
- No...

446
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,020
My name is Hong Man Su,

447
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,960
Doctor Do Yu Gyeong.

448
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,730
Did you tell me
you got the investment...

449
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,430
after borrowing money
from these people?

450
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:59,270
Honey, well, it's a private loan,

451
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,470
but the interest was
as low as a bank. It wasn't much.

452
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,810
You need to set the record straight.

453
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,340
The interest started low,

454
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,810
but I said it'd double
and quadruple...

455
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,750
for every day you fall behind
on paying the interest.

456
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:12,220
You can't back out of this
after signing that contract.

457
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,090
Your husband, Mr. Hwang,

458
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,250
has failed to pay the interest
for a few days now.

459
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,190
You'll need to pay us instead.

460
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,900
You're a doctor, so you can
probably find money in many ways.

461
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,430
He borrowed that money
without talking to me.

462
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,270
I'm not paying that back.

463
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,570
I should help you change your mind.

464
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,240
Boys.

465
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,940
- Yes, boss.
- Are you kidding me?

466
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,540
Darn it.

467
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,280
Goodness!

468
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,420
Please don't...

469
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,860
Who are you people?

470
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,430
Who do you think you are
to make a scene at their business?

471
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,540
This righteous young man
must have a misunderstanding.

472
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,010
We're the victims, not them.

473
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,280
We lost money
to Mr. Hwang Gi Man here.

474
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,350
If you suffered in any way,
go to the police...

475
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,950
instead of harassing them here.

476
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,450
I'll call the police for you.

477
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,390
Let's find out who the victim is
and who's here...

478
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,890
for an illegal collection.

479
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,430
Hey, I was going to call it a day.

480
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,860
Let's go, boys.

481
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,000
If you don't pay
the interest by this week,

482
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,040
this restaurant won't be the only place
that turns into a mess.

483
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,580
Are you okay, Yu Gyeong?

484
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,480
Please leave.
I need to talk to my husband.

485
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,860
Honey, let me explain
what happened here...

486
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,000
I wanted
to work things out with you,

487
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,370
so I took a leave,

488
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,800
put up with Mother's harsh words,

489
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,240
and did my best to get pregnant.

490
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,940
So, why...

491
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,780
Why won't you change?

492
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,380
What's the reason?

493
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:24,150
I knew I'd have to make a living alone
if you got pregnant,

494
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,850
so I must've become anxious
and lost my mind.

495
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,620
I won't let this happen again
and handle everything.

496
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,890
I mean it.

497
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,260
Honey. Yu Gyeong. Honey!

498
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,700
Let me take you home.

499
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,600
It's okay. I can go alone.

500
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,940
I'm not okay with it.

501
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,640
Just do as I say.

502
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,150
Do it right.

503
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,890
I'm doing it right.

504
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,020
I sent you out there
to help out with the business,

505
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,490
so you should've stayed
until you closed with your husband.

506
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,400
I can't believe
you came back early alone.

507
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,040
What?

508
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,140
She ignored you.

509
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,180
- That little...
- Mom, stop.

510
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,940
This polish is expensive.
Come back here.

511
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,710
Did you get it on my hand?

512
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,080
No. Stay still.

513
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,420
Mi Sook, can you take the call?

514
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,160
Hello?

515
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,960
A recommendation?

516
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,430
You called us, so you have to decide
what you want to order.

517
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,870
Half regular fried chicken,
half with the sweet and spicy sauce?

518
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,440
You need to know
how long it'll take?

519
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,580
Just come around when it's ready.

520
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,580
Grandma, half fried chicken
and half sweet and spicy sauce!

521
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,220
All right!

522
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,420
Grandma, are you Ms. Mi Sook?

523
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,820
I am,

524
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,260
but I'm not a grandma, kid.

525
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,360
You seem much older than my grandma.

526
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,930
What can I call you
if I can't call you a grandma?

527
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,640
Do whatever you want.

528
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,100
Anyway, why are you
asking me for my name?

529
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,870
I heard you defeated villains,

530
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,780
but why do you sound like one?

531
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,180
Listen to this kid.

532
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,110
I don't seem like a villain
in any way.

533
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:40,050
My grandma talks nicely
when a customer calls,

534
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,720
but you got mad just now.

535
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,290
And our recommendations are...

536
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,630
already starred on the menu,

537
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,190
but you didn't say anything.

538
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,330
And I'm not just a kid.
My name is Bo Ram.

539
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,780
You have to bow...

540
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,810
with your hands on your stomach
when a customer leaves.

541
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,120
Thank you for coming.
Enjoy your food.

542
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,020
Goodbye.

543
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,590
Gosh.

544
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,160
Goodbye.

545
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,560
Ms. Mi Sook said goodbye, too.

546
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,930
You have one clever granddaughter.

547
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,000
This little kid
just trained an adult very strictly.

548
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,640
She kept nagging at me
whenever I took a phone call.

549
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,240
I'm not a little kid.

550
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,140
Yes, Ms. Bo Ram. Happy now?

551
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,110
Yes, Ms. Mi Sook.

552
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,720
Yes, Mr. Jung?

553
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,660
A news article?

554
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,630
I sent it to you. Take a look.

555
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,530
Okay.

556
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,570
("AZ Design Challenges YL Group
with 1-Person Household Designs")

557
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,640
(YL Group continues to focus
on mid to large living spaces,)

558
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,510
(but AZ Design launched their
1-person household model house.)

559
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,850
This is...

560
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,160
I let you even join
our exhibition event,

561
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,900
but you decided to hand over
the design to our competitor?

562
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,630
Why did you return to YL Group?

563
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,870
("AZ Design Challenges YL Group
with 1-Person Household Designs")

(Queen's House)

565
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,530
Don't go there anymore.

566
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,290
Okay?

567
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:43,100
Yun Hee,
I'll get revenge for everything.

568
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,270
So, don't be so sad anymore.

569
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,670
That's how a mother acts
when she loses her child.

570
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,040
But that woman...

571
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,480
never wanted to see me to this day.

572
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,350
Did you say
you felt sadness and pain?

573
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,580
Don't be ridiculous.
You have no idea.

574
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,250
You couldn't know how it feels
to lose your entire world.

575
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,120
I know.

576
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,390
How would you know?
You don't even have a child.

577
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,460
I also...
