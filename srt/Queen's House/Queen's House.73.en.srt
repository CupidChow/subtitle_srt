00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,850
(Episode 73)

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,780
Jae In, please spare me.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,850
Please spare my life.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,750
Please spare me, Jae In.

8
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,250
I don't want to go back.

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,360
Sure.

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,190
I'll spare you.

11
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,360
Get up.

12
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,740
Have you forgotten what to do
when you're told to get up?

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,650
Se Ri.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,580
This right here
must seem like your biggest torture.

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,650
But no, don't be deluded.

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,920
You'll face
worse things out there...

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,790
so you'd wish
you were rather in here.

18
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,090
Good luck with your life
in a world...

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,260
where nothing goes the way you want.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,670
Put that on.

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,510
You've been discharged,

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,550
so let's go home.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,750
Stop crying.

24
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,260
Stop it.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
I miss Mommy, Grandma.

26
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,630
Can you bring her home?

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,200
- Ji Ho.
- Daddy!

28
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,370
Is Mommy very sick?

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,640
Can we go and see her?

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,510
Please take me to her.

31
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,240
All right, Ji Ho.

32
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,780
If you listen to your grandma
and be a good boy,

33
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,880
I'll take you
to see your mommy later.

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,950
Don't cry.

35
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,250
Did Jae In go out?

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,160
How would I know?

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,720
She hasn't come home.

38
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,990
I'm going out to check on Gi Man.

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm back.

40
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,130
You came back early.

41
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,100
Yes, have you been somewhere?

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,830
Yes, for a bit.

43
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,270
Why won't you come in?

44
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,440
- Ji Ho.
- Mommy!

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,180
My Ji Ho.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,950
Mommy!

47
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,950
Ji Ho...

48
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,150
Mommy...

49
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,490
What happened?

50
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,190
I thought
about talking to you beforehand,

51
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,030
but I got her discharged first.

52
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,690
Why?

53
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,930
She's been on my mind.

54
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,570
Ji Ho keeps missing her so much.

55
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,630
You said he adored her like a mother
while I wasn't here.

56
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,000
Look what just happened.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
They cried in each other's arms.

58
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,240
People who don't know better
may think they were the mom and son.

59
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,010
I began to think
I must've misunderstood,

60
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,650
even though nothing happened
between you two.

61
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,750
She also seemed to have changed
after some treatment,

62
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,950
so I brought her home
when I went to see her.

63
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,120
She's my best friend,

64
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,320
so I thought
I should take care of her by her side.

65
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,290
Is that all right?

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,830
I need the money
to bribe Chinese investors,

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,000
and I need Catherine
to get the fund...

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,830
from the slush fund
I'm keeping at H and K Company.

69
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,010
If that's how you feel,
you can do that.

70
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,840
I'm okay with it
if it's okay with you.

71
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,080
Thank you, honey.

72
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,180
Se Ri will be careful from now on.

73
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,760
It's too dangerous.

74
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,260
You said you'd send Kang Se Ri
to a mental hospital and end it there.

75
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,200
Wasn't your target Hwang Gi Chan?

76
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,270
You wanted revenge
for the late Chairman Kang and your son.

77
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,340
Even the mental institution is
like paradise for Se Ri.

78
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,980
Eun Ho died in my place.

79
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,350
And Gi Chan
wasn't the one behind it.

80
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,350
It was Se Ri.

81
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,420
I can't let her sit around
to eat and sleep in peace...

82
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,390
at the mental institution.

83
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,660
She's as evil as Gi Chan.

84
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,000
She needs to learn
what pain truly feels like.

85
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,330
You need to leave that home now.

86
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,440
It's too dangerous.

87
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,700
Not yet.

88
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,580
I have another present
for Gi Chan and Se Ri.

89
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,050
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

90
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,090
- Wait.
- Let go of me.

91
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,260
Why are you stopping me
from walking into my husband's office?

92
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,060
You really can't do this.

93
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
It's okay. You may leave.

94
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,600
Where's my husband?
Why are you sitting there?

95
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,410
Why are you looking for him here?

96
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,250
He passed away.

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,980
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,250
He...

99
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,920
He's gone? He's dead?

100
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,060
No!

101
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,830
No!

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,900
No.

103
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,800
No.

104
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,710
No.

105
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,940
Are you all right, Mother?

106
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,780
Please come home with me.

107
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,120
How's the presentation coming along
for the window project?

108
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,190
- That's...
- Everything is going well.

109
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,260
Mr. Kang was a big help.

110
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,430
I didn't even do much.

111
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,260
Thanks to Designer Kang,

112
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,560
things are smooth sailing as if the person
in charge never disappeared.

113
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,800
Director Kang, I was in charge
of the new window presentation.

114
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,800
The presentation is
right around the corner.

115
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,840
You don't get to say that
as someone...

116
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,280
who went absent with a simple notice
that you were unwell.

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,540
- It's...
- If you were that unwell,

118
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,410
you should focus on
getting back into good condition.

119
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,420
That's all for today's meeting.

120
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,390
- You should get to work.
- Yes, ma'am.

121
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,690
I'm making coffee.
You take it black, right?

122
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,290
Okay. Thank you.

123
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,600
You must feel happy
after stealing my project.

124
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,900
Se Ri, you have a good mouth,
so say the right things.

125
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,170
The new window project was a part
of the Planning and Design Team,

126
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,340
and you were just an irresponsible person
in charge.

127
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,410
Did you get me out
of the mental hospital...

128
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,910
to mess with me like this?

129
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,180
Why did you get me out?

130
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,920
What's the catch?

131
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,990
You're too stupid
to figure anything out,

132
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,250
so just live quietly
like you were dead.

133
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,590
Sending you back
to the mental institution is...

134
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,760
a piece of cake for me.

135
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,400
(YL Planning and Design)

136
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,520
Mother.

137
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,360
Why are you here
instead of the office?

138
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,330
The chairman
hasn't been in good condition,

139
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,600
so assist him with extra care.

140
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,770
In the end,
you were also just a human...

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,740
who gets ruined
with old age and sickness.

142
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,740
Yes, I'll pay more attention.

143
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,710
Mother, by any chance,

144
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,210
do you know anything
about Father's slush fund?

145
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,780
Slush fund?

146
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,620
There's a rumor
that he's keeping a slush fund...

147
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,750
in the Swiss Bank.

148
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,620
If that is so,
I need to make a move to prevent...

149
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,360
any legal problems.

150
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,360
It must be
another one of those weird rumors.

151
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,930
Even if he kept anything like that,

152
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,070
it must be an inheritance...

153
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,610
to leave for Jae In and Seung Woo,
not something to evade taxes.

154
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,240
Your father-in-law isn't someone
who shows his true intentions.

155
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,510
I want to pry about his slush fund,

156
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,380
but she's useless in this state
with incomplete memories.

157
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,890
You're here for Ms. Choi?

158
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,690
How did you know she was here?

159
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,470
He must've found out
Ms. Choi was unwell.

160
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,730
I shouldn't hide this.

161
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,340
I installed a location tracking app
on her phone.

162
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,810
Actually,
she's suffering from dementia.

163
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,550
She wanted to keep her condition
a secret from Jae In,

164
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,980
so she's been staying with me
after saying she was with a friend.

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,820
She came
to this place herself, right?

166
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:12,960
Yes, sure.

167
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,530
You should've told me
about her condition.

168
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,360
I only found out recently,

169
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,230
and I didn't think
she'd do much in that state.

170
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,410
I might have to report something
back to you,

171
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,810
and I didn't want anything bad
to happen to her in that condition,

172
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,410
so I've been tracking her location.

173
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,150
I won't tell Jae In about Ms. Choi.

174
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,790
She'd try to stay by her side
if she found out.

175
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,960
I'll find a good time to tell her,

176
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,690
so don't say anything.

177
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,560
Then, I'll take Ms. Choi with me.

178
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,300
Yes, please come with me.

179
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,650
Wait, why did my two ex-in-laws
just walk out of here?

180
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,920
And why did you come home so early?

181
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,790
I invited the shaman here
while the place would be empty.

182
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,460
You don't have to mind me.

183
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,590
I'll go and work in the study.

184
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,040
Don't have feelings for me.

185
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,570
Yu Gyeong...

186
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,090
I came to ask you out
on a date tomorrow.

187
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,260
Why don't we go on a lunch date?
How does the cafeteria sound?

188
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
Doesn't dating at work
sound really exciting?

189
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,140
That's only the case for people
in an actual relationship.

190
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,340
Ms. Hwang, there is...

191
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,680
someone I like.

192
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,580
Okay.

193
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,690
Do you really mean
that you understand?

194
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,060
I like you,

195
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,890
and you like someone else.

196
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,630
What more do I need to know?

197
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,930
Wait, Ms. Hwang.

198
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,230
I'll keep my feelings for you,

199
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,140
so you can keep your feelings
for that person, too.

200
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,310
What do you mean?

201
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,140
My feelings are mine,

202
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,110
and your feelings are yours.

203
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,340
Let's see whose crush wins
in the end.

204
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,710
Will it be my feelings or yours?

205
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,090
Begone.

206
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,730
So, will doing this
get rid of the bad luck in this place?

207
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,770
Yes, I'm telling you. Begone.

208
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,470
Begone.

209
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,070
I'm home.

210
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,850
Who is she, Mother?

211
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,150
My goodness. I'm so sorry, my deity.

212
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,950
Please spare my life.

213
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,350
My goodness.

214
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,360
Goodness, what's wrong, Shaman?

215
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,520
Are you all right?

216
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,530
My deity just said
I'd end up dead...

217
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,560
if I didn't share the truth.

218
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,200
That thing. That woman...

219
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,940
made me tell a lie.

220
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,470
My deity will curse me to death
because of her!

221
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,580
Wait, this girl?

222
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,650
Do you know my daughter-in-law?

223
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,110
No, I don't know her.

224
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,520
You do know me.

225
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,550
She wanted to kick out
your old daughter-in-law, Kang Jae In.

226
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,160
So, she told me to tell you
that your son killed someone,

227
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,460
that your son and his wife were
both having an affair,

228
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
and that
her son would be invaluable.

229
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,300
She even bribed me
to tell you only the things...

230
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,230
that'd make her look good.

231
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,670
What?

232
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,940
What's she talking about?

233
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,380
What?

234
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,880
Why are you all standing around?

235
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,580
Oh, my. And you were here, Shaman.

236
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,020
Did you receive
the written complaint?

237
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,190
I've suffered greatly
because you went to Noh Sook Ja...

238
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,160
and blurted out things
that weren't true.

239
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,730
For now, I reported you for libel
and spreading false information,

240
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,830
but I'm thinking
of doing an interview.

241
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,200
I did some digging on you.

242
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,370
Park Bok Soon, you have
eight previous fraud convictions.

243
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,340
I'll tell the world you pretended
to be a shaman to extort money...

244
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,210
out of people.

245
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,720
Are you asking for money?

246
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,850
How much? How much do you want?

247
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,260
I don't need money.

248
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,130
I won't do the interview
if you spill the truth.

249
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,770
You planned everything
from the beginning, didn't you?

250
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,240
Did you think I was such a pushover?

251
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,210
I knew something was fishy
from the beginning!

252
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,980
I'm falsely accused.

253
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,410
That shaman is the fraud.

254
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,720
Would I say something like this...

255
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,890
if I were really a fraud?

256
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,220
She's right. Her deity is
angry with her because of you.

257
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,160
This house wasn't the problem.
It was you!

258
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,300
You need to stop, Mom.

259
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,330
Don't let Jae In see this.

260
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,530
Mother, I don't know
what Se Ri did wrong,

261
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,040
but please calm down.

262
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,310
If the shaman told me
only the things she wanted,

263
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,640
then everything about
how you did something bad to someone...

264
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,380
must've been a lie.

265
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,050
Goodness. I had no idea...

266
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,780
and became suspicious
of my precious son.

267
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,590
It must've felt so unfair.

268
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,720
- Mom, you should get some rest.
- Goodness.

269
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,870
So, you won't do
that interview, right?

270
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,910
I always keep my promises.

271
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,650
You're done here, so leave.

272
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,380
Yes, all right. Goodness.

273
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,790
I'm not doing an interview,
but I reported you to the police.

274
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,860
You need to pay...

275
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,960
for slandering and deceiving others.

276
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,770
Yes, thank you.

277
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,970
I'll treat you to something nice
on the weekend.

278
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,300
Okay. Goodbye.

279
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,640
Was that Detective Son Wang Sik
on the phone?

280
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,980
Yes, he asked about Kim Mi Gyeong
with the insurance company...

281
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,610
on the business card
Yun Hee received,

282
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,710
and that woman...

283
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,680
wasn't even formally registered
as the company's planner.

284
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,120
So, the card was faked, too?

285
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,920
Wang Sik also found out...

286
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,460
she got blacklisted
by every insurance company she worked for.

287
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,430
Her ex-colleagues said...

288
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,360
her clients would always get
into big accidents...

289
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,670
and take huge payments.
There was a lot of talk.

290
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:39,640
They conducted an internal audit
but found nothing,

291
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,570
so all they could do was
dismiss her.

292
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,340
She sounds like a total fraud.

293
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,280
She could be behind
Dad's insurance money.

294
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,380
We need to find her first.

295
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,020
We should.

296
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,120
But it'll take a while,

297
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,390
because she was determined
to go into hiding.

298
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,790
- Honey.
- Shut your mouth.

299
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,330
Are you going to insist
you're still innocent?

300
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,030
Who else other than you would tell
that shaman I killed someone?

301
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,470
I'll admit that I bribed her.

302
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,870
I must've been crazy back then.

303
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,310
All I wanted to do was
get you away from Jae In,

304
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,580
so I wasn't thinking straight.

305
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,410
But I honestly never said anything
about that night.

306
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,320
All I asked her to do was
exaggerate my good sides.

307
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,790
She added more stories on her own
and misinformed Mother.

308
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,290
You know how Mother is.

309
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,290
She blows up the smallest things...

310
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,530
and even makes up things
that never happened.

311
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,160
Get out.
I don't want to see you here.

312
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,660
What can Jae In give you?

313
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,670
What can you get from her?

314
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,340
I don't understand
why you're keeping her around,

315
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,000
but it's me, Catherine.

316
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,170
You need me, too.

317
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,540
You said you needed to find
a Chinese investor.

318
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,650
I'll make a move
as Catherine of H and K Company.

319
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,180
So, pull yourself together!

320
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,420
I'm the one you need.

321
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,990
Then, prove yourself.

322
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,190
Prove yourself...

323
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,260
and make me trust you again.

324
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,030
I will.
But you need to prove yourself, too.

325
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,400
I'm talking about Jae In.

326
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,930
Mother kept saying
that she didn't lose her memories.

327
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,340
I get why you can't trust me,

328
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,370
but you need to trust her words
and start getting suspicious.

329
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,640
Do you think
it's a coincidence that...

330
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,140
our relationship got jeopardized
and all kinds of things...

331
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,310
began to happen?

332
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,720
Pull yourself together
and think rationally.

333
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,040
He fell asleep after playing here.

334
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,010
Should we let him stay here tonight?

335
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,080
He has awful sleeping habits,
so you'll have a rough time.

336
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,440
I'll get him to his room.

337
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,780
Okay. But let me take his toy.

338
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,850
I don't want him to get hurt.

339
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,050
Ji Ho never lets go of this toy.

340
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,590
It's his favorite.

341
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,890
He said a boy named Eun Ho
gave it to him.

342
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,730
Do you know who he is?

343
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,870
I'm not sure.

344
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
Is he a friend
from the kindergarten?

345
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,740
He said that boy, Eun Ho,
went to see his mommy.

346
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,580
I should find a chance
to get to know her.

347
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,980
You and Eun Ho's mother?

348
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,450
Yes.

349
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,290
I didn't know because I was in bed,

350
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,920
but I heard
it's important to keep...

351
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,860
good connections between moms
starting in kindergarten.

352
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,090
He must be good friends with Eun Ho,

353
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,230
so I want to get to know
his mom, too.

354
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,500
She can't talk about Eun Ho...

355
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,240
like he was a stranger
if she had her memories.

356
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,810
Honey, you should put
Ji Ho in his bed.

357
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,940
You should get some rest, too.

358
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,410
Yes, right.

359
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,590
See? Why would they sit
with each other...

360
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,660
if Jae In didn't have her memories?

361
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,970
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

362
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,910
Are you busy?

363
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,720
I had to talk to you
before the new window presentation.

364
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,720
What is it?

365
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,690
It's this.
Mr. Kim Do Yun just gave me this...

366
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,590
and told me to listen to it.

367
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,360
He said it was a pen recorder.

368
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,530
A recorder?

369
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,200
Yes.

370
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,800
But something didn't feel right,

371
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,340
so I was scared
to listen to it alone.

372
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,340
A guy I barely know
suddenly told me to listen to it,

373
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,840
and I have no idea what's in this.

374
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,350
I wanted to listen to it with you.

375
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,050
You're right.

376
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,550
Just in case,
I'll take a listen and let you know.

377
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,720
You don't have to listen
to anything bad.

378
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,460
Here.

379
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,400
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

380
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,960
What would I have done...

381
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,030
in this frightening world
without you, honey?

382
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,800
Thank you.

383
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,310
You have to be at the presentation.
You should go.

384
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,480
All right.
Then, please take a listen.

385
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,890
Did you want to see me, sir?

386
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,330
I want to ask
about the double contract...

387
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,830
with H and K Company.

388
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,830
Was it you?

389
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,670
No.

390
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,440
My daughter. Jae In... No...

391
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,310
No...

392
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,620
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

393
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,720
What Kim Do Yun sent
to blackmail me was...

394
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,560
only a part of the voice recording,
just as I expected.

395
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,330
This one has everything
until the moment I walked out,

396
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,500
so this must be the original.

397
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,170
He tried to make Jae In
listen to this?

398
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,610
Kim Do Yun,
things won't go the way you want.

399
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,110
She trusts me now, not you.

400
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,220
No, she wouldn't have brought me...

401
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,460
this recorder if she had her memories.

402
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,340
How did he respond?

403
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,410
He seemed to believe me.

404
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,580
Well, he has to.

405
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,190
I gave him the voice recording...

406
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,260
from the day of my dad's death.

407
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,830
This will make
Kang Se Ri infuriated.

408
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,760
She told Gi Chan
you didn't have amnesia,

409
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,260
but it was all in vain.

410
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,970
They probably can't even imagine
they're getting the taste...

411
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,770
of their own medicine.

412
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,010
I'm talking about Jae In.

413
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,680
Mother kept saying
that she didn't lose her memories.

414
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,680
I get why you can't trust me,

415
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,850
but you need to trust her words
and start getting suspicious.

416
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,180
Do you think
it's a coincidence that...

417
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,550
our relationship got jeopardized
and all kinds of things...

418
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,720
began to happen?

419
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,020
Pull yourself together
and think rationally.

420
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,340
It's such arrogance to think
only they can install bugging devices.

421
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,580
Anyway, will Hwang Gi Chan
stop being suspicious of you...

422
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,710
just because he got
a copy of the pen recorder?

423
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,950
I denied Eun Ho and pretended
like I didn't know him...

424
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,720
when I talked to Gi Chan.

425
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,620
He already knows...

426
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,790
Eun Ho is my biggest weakness,

427
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,700
the one thing
I can't talk about with composure.

428
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,370
I even gave him the voice recording,

429
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,870
so his suspicions must've stopped.

430
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,850
Shall we go and do the presentation?

431
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,390
It's difficult to stand out
in recent consumer trends...

432
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,960
if the product
only serves its basic functions.

433
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,800
We recently conducted surveys
on windows with our customers,

434
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,160
as well as a keyword survey
on social media.

435
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,870
The result showed that
the consumers wanted a good view.

436
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,540
They believe the view out the window
is a part of their space,

437
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,670
so they want
thinner window frames...

438
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,440
that don't get in the way.

439
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,280
However, it must also come
with insulation and safety.

440
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,080
Now, the Planning and Design Team
presents our new product...

441
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,120
that captures both functionality
and great design.

442
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,890
- I like it.
- That's great.

443
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,390
- Isn't that good?
- It is.

444
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,570
Excellent work, Designer Kang.

445
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,600
Good work.

446
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,300
Thank you, Director.

447
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,240
Good work.

448
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,910
Thank you, Director Kang.

449
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,580
Great job, Jae In.

450
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,350
Let's go to the meeting room.

451
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,450
- Sure.
- Yes.

452
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,850
Thank you.

453
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,220
(Slim frame with a wider view,
View Plus)

454
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,920
Where are you going,
Team Leader Kang Se Ri?

455
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,900
Everything is over, so I'm leaving.
Can't you see?

456
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,840
Were you not born
with something called a conscience?

457
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,200
What?

458
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,440
I did the presentation
for our new product on behalf of you,

459
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,180
so you should earn your keep, too.

460
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,410
You can clean up everything.

461
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,780
I already talked to Director Kang.

462
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,290
You must think you have me
in the palm of your hand.

463
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,790
But bad news, Se Ri.

464
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,200
I'm already dancing
all the way up on your head.

465
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,240
Don't go elsewhere in fright
and come home early.

466
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,140
It'll be a fun night.

467
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,890
(Planning and Design Team
Director's Office)

468
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,730
What else do you want to do?

469
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,030
Right.

470
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,470
Come in.

471
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,440
You're still here.

472
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,280
I've become a hard-working Korean
like all of you.

473
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,450
Did you want to talk to me?

474
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,350
Are you free tomorrow?

475
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,750
I think I can make some time
if you want to treat me.

476
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,460
You treated me to a drink before,

477
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,190
so this time, it's on me.

478
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,730
Okay. Send me the time and location.

479
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,030
I'll show up on an empty stomach,
so be prepared.

480
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,000
I'll bring all my credit cards.
Does that sound good?

481
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,030
Ji Ho,
I'll read you the storybook...

482
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,260
after I stop by the study.

483
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,110
What are you doing here?

484
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,210
I thought the paperwork
for Mom's gallery...

485
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,210
was here, but I don't see it.

486
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,750
- Have you seen those?
- Right.

487
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,220
I cleaned up everything
when she left for America.

488
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,090
I see.

489
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,420
Then, I'll talk to her later
and have her share it with me.

490
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,530
Why do you suddenly need
the files for the gallery?

491
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,530
I was thinking of asking Mother
to work as the gallery director.

492
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:58,200
My mom?

493
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,540
Yes, you said Mom handed
the gallery over to you...

494
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,810
and asked you to manage it
before she went to America.

495
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,010
That means you have the right
to appoint the next director.

496
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,920
I want to get on
Mother's good side. Please?

497
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,960
You want me to be
the gallery's director?

498
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,130
Yes, she recommended you.

499
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,000
What's she cooking now?

500
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,740
She wouldn't let me do that
for my good.

501
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,410
That sly girl is trying
to push me into trouble again.

502
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,020
I'm not sure.

503
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,390
I shouldn't dabble in something
I've never done before in my life.

504
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,390
We can't let the vacancy
go on for too long.

505
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,460
Should I do it if she won't?

506
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,370
I can't let that happen.

507
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,870
It's like setting the wolf
to guard the sheep.

508
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,100
I'll do it.

509
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,380
See? I told you
she'd do it if I said I would.

510
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:15,910
You were right.
She seems to know you better than me.

511
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,190
Oh, he must be here.

512
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,860
Honey, let's go.

513
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,260
We have a guest.

514
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,560
Who's here at this hour?

515
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,470
Se Ri, I prepared a surprise
just for you...

516
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,600
to celebrate your discharge.

517
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,570
Do you want a hint?

518
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,440
He was very close to you
a long time ago,

519
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,610
and he called home a few days ago.

520
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,710
He asked for you,
so I invited him here today.

521
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,350
Who is it?

522
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,050
I don't know. We only had
a brief conversation over the phone.

523
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,890
You can ask him when he gets here.

524
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,760
Excuse me.

525
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,510
Hello.

526
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,350
I'm Ji Seong Jun,
Se Ri's ex-husband.

527
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,820
Oh, my. Se Ri.

528
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,260
Have you been married before?

00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,240
(Queen's House)

530
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,380
Hello.

531
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,120
I'm Ji Seong Jun,
Se Ri's ex-husband.

532
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,480
Oh, my. Se Ri.

533
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,950
Have you been married before?

534
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,050
Those wedding photos were all real.

535
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,190
- Who are you?
- I'm sorry.

536
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,860
You're the only one for me.

537
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,860
This time, I won.

538
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,160
I'll tell him
that your memories are still intact!

539
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,470
You already did.

540
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,600
But did he believe you?

541
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
People are showing
a huge reaction to this.

542
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,740
YL Group will have to
make a decision, right?

543
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,340
What did you say?

544
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,910
He regained his consciousness?
Really?

545
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,810
