1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,410
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,150
- Se Ri.
- Hey.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,150
I must've dropped an earring
while taking a tour of your room.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,320
Gi Chan offered to look for it with me,
so we were searching,

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,820
but we couldn't find it.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,420
Yes, I came to take my call,
then found her searching.

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,430
Are we done with dinner?

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,700
Almost.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,430
- I think you were standing here.
- Right.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,940
Mommy, I found it.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,840
- Hey.
- Here it is.

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,680
Thank you.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,080
I found it thanks to you, Eun Ho.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,250
(Episode 7)

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,650
I can just go home alone.

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,960
You won't find a taxi at this hour.
Just let him drop you off.

19
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,320
I'd love to go with you,
but I had to tuck Eun Ho in.

20
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,030
He's acting like a baby today.

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,660
You don't have to come anyway.
You should get some rest.

22
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,600
Mr. Chairman and Ms. Kang,
thank you for inviting me today.

23
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,370
It was nice to meet you.

24
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,310
I hope you do a great job
with Director Kang.

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,670
I have high expectations.

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,940
Gyu Cheol, she's going to feel sick.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,480
Ms. Choi,
I enjoyed your dinner so much.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,220
It felt like
I was eating my mom's food.

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,320
You'll make your mom sad.

30
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,520
I'm sure it's not as filling
as your mom's cooking.

31
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,090
Both my parents have passed away.

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,160
Goodness.

33
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,160
I should've watched my words.

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,800
Ms. Choi, if you need my help...

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,700
or need me for anything,
feel free to contact me.

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm Jae In's friend,
so just treat me like your daughter.

37
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,440
Speak.

38
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,550
I find silence more awkward.

39
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,050
Since when have you planned this?

40
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,820
You had no plans
to return to America.

41
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,620
Why did you join YL Group?

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,960
Did you want to put me in misery?

43
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,500
Do I have to walk on eggshells
around you, too,

44
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,000
and not just around my in-laws?

45
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,500
I'm sick and tired
of keeping on my toes.

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,100
Do you have to add to this?

47
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,240
If you'll be like this,
let's just end it.

48
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,770
I don't need anything else.
Let's just end it.

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
Are you happy?

50
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,010
What?

51
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,680
Are you happy?

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,420
Be honest with me.

53
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,660
Are you happy right now?

54
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,500
I don't want you
to walk on eggshells.

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,260
I hate the idea of it.

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,530
What I want is one thing.

57
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,970
It's to live happily with you...

58
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,710
out in the open
like an official couple.

59
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,280
That's what I want.

60
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,050
What about you?

61
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,250
Can you be happy without me?

62
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,770
What do you have to say
about Director Do?

63
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,710
It wasn't...

64
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,570
his doing.

65
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,780
It was you.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,610
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,420
These are the files
regarding the dual contract.

68
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,860
Do you think...

69
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,790
a few pieces of paper
can prove my involvement?

70
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,530
I found these files on your laptop.

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,670
Mr. Kang Seung Woo doesn't know anything.
Well, not yet.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,410
He also doesn't know about
the CEO of H and K Company, Catherine.

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,680
A few days ago,

74
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,510
I heard she was in Korea,

75
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,950
so I went to her hotel
to see if it was true.

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,620
I saw you two together.

77
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,750
Ms. Kim.

78
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,060
I think there's a misunderstanding.

79
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,090
I can't say anything
about your private life.

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,190
But it's different
when it comes to work.

81
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,430
Director Do was framed unfairly,

82
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,930
so I couldn't turn my eyes away.

83
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,070
Why don't we come to an agreement?

84
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,840
We can find a way...

85
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,340
to resolve this amicably
without hurting either of us.

86
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,850
How much will it take...

87
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,180
for you to turn a blind eye to this?

88
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,050
What I want...

89
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,290
isn't money but justice.

90
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,190
Justice?

91
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,330
I want you to take responsibility
for everything...

92
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,800
and handle this situation.

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,130
That way,
Director Do can be reinstated.

94
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,870
Are you telling me...

95
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,570
to confess the truth?

96
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,350
What do you get
from making me do this?

97
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,450
Nothing.

98
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,450
Ms. Kim, why don't we...

99
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,020
resolve this in a positive way?

100
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,390
How about one million dollars?

101
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,690
- I...
- If that's not enough, 1.5 million.

102
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,430
No, two million dollars.

103
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,700
Nothing you can say...

104
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,870
will change my mind.

105
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,440
What will you do?

106
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,780
You leave me no choice.

107
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,490
I'll report this
to the chairman tomorrow.

108
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,590
Ms. Kim, wait. Calm down.

109
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,530
I'll do as you say,

110
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,130
so give me just a bit of time.

111
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,770
- Please...
- I need time to patch this up.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
It won't take long.

113
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,370
I ask of you.

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,480
Find out who she is...

115
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,150
and what she does for a living
right away.

116
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,900
I'll stop by the store...

117
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,700
and browse around
to do some market research.

118
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,300
I thought I should check and see...

119
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,400
what the current trend is
here in Korea.

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,440
Okay. If you're going to be late,
feel free to go straight home.

121
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,140
Okay. I'll call you.

122
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm leaving, then.

123
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,840
Sure.

124
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,560
Aunt Mi Ran, I'm here.

125
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
Hey, come on in.

126
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,690
Ms. Kang just went out to work.
Did you catch her?

127
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,400
No, I guess we missed each other.

128
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,870
I came to see you today.

129
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,970
Me?

130
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,680
Director Choi Ja Young?

131
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,160
Kneel.

132
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,410
An adulteress like you...

133
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,640
dares to hold your head up high
and sit across from me?

134
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,780
As far as I'm concerned,
I did not do anything...

135
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,680
worthy of getting slapped
or kneeling.

136
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,040
Do you still claim
you didn't do anything wrong?

137
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,540
Yes, I do.

138
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,140
I did meet Mr. Hwang on that day,

139
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,580
but it was because of work.

140
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,150
It was nothing like
what you imagined.

141
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,320
You could've talked to him
in the office.

142
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,920
Why did you have to call him out
in the middle of the night?

143
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,860
Tell me.

144
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,930
I'll do as you say,

145
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,890
so give me just a bit of time.

146
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,060
I need time to patch this up.

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,230
It won't take long.

148
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,830
I ask of you.

149
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,340
You should ask Director Kang.

150
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,370
If you had done that
before you met me,

151
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,480
you would've known
nothing was going on.

152
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,250
So, you'll insist that
nothing is going on?

153
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,980
Yes, because it's true.

154
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,220
I hear you have a daughter.

155
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,150
Can you stay that confident
even in front of her?

156
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,630
I lived an honorable life
to present myself as her mother,

157
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,490
and I plan to continue.

158
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,530
If what you said was a lie,

159
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,530
you'd be tortured
for the rest of your life.

160
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,100
And it's not just you. I'll end...

161
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,410
your mother's life
and your doctor brother's life.

162
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,280
I'm a woman of my word.

163
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,310
You just crossed the line.

164
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,520
I don't care what you say about me,

165
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,090
but it's just discourtesy
to bring up my family.

166
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,790
I want you to apologize.

167
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,600
I never thought
I'd do something this indecent.

168
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,880
How dare you
demand that I apologize?

169
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,710
Do you feel humiliated?

170
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,120
Then, remember...

171
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,820
what happened today and behave.

172
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,050
Getting rid of someone like you...

173
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,690
is a piece of cake.

174
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,300
You want to hold
a portrait event for the patients?

175
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,900
Yes.

176
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,600
I thought we could do that
as a part of our charity work.

177
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,700
We could provide
the outfits and makeup, too.

178
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,540
People can get depressed...

179
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,370
when they're cooped up
at the hospital,

180
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,080
without any time
to look after themselves.

181
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,210
Wouldn't they feel
at least a little better...

182
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,410
if they saw themselves
looking prettier and more stylish?

183
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,650
People also say those who take
a death portrait will live longer.

184
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,660
It doesn't have to be for a funeral.
It can be a great memory.

185
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,290
I think it'll boost
YL Group's image as well.

186
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,630
What do you say?

187
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,230
Of course, we can do this.
It's a great idea.

188
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,540
Why don't you take charge?

189
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,740
Me?

190
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,070
Don't you think you can do this
while Eun Ho is at the kindergarten?

191
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,280
It'll help bring back your game...

192
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,550
in preparation
for your return to work.

193
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,480
I'll think about it.

194
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,320
Gosh, I have to go.

195
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,090
Don't you want to see Gi Chan?

196
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,660
We try to keep it cool
when we're at work.

197
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,590
You don't want other employees
to call him the Cinderella Man?

198
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,130
Aunt Mi Ran,
he got to that position...

199
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,000
only with his talent,
not because of my help.

200
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,460
I know.

201
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,270
So, why do you feel self-conscious
after he proved himself?

202
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,070
Just present yourself confidently
to stop people from talking.

203
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,640
Okay.

204
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,710
(Director of Planning Hwang Gi Chan)

205
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,910
We better not meet for a while.

206
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,480
Don't come to my office, either.
Many people are watching.

207
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,750
What do you mean by that?

208
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,150
Do you want to break up with me?

209
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,390
Or are you dating
Ms. Kim Do Hee now?

210
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,130
What did you
and her talk about that night?

211
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,430
I got into trouble
for framing Director Do.

212
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,500
She even knows
that you're Catherine.

213
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,000
How?

214
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,870
She saw us at the hotel.

215
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
She knows about us, too.

216
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,940
Then, what do we do now?

217
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,380
I bought some time,
so I'll handle it somehow.

218
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,550
Watch what you say around her.

219
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,480
Pretend like
you don't know about this.

220
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,980
Okay.

221
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,590
Do I have to tell him...

222
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,650
about the man
who took their pictures?

223
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,660
Who is he working for?

224
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,330
I don't think Jae In saw
even the pictures I sent her.

225
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,730
Jae In.

226
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,870
Then, let's proceed like that.

227
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,430
Yes, I'll do my best.

228
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,100
Jae In.

229
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,640
I wasn't interrupting anything, was I?

230
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,240
No, I was just leaving.

231
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,010
What brings you here?

232
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,440
You never come to my office.

233
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,480
I came to see Aunt Mi Ran.

234
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,150
I wanted to pick up Eun Ho with you
and visit your mother.

235
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,520
I'm feeling unwell, so I wanted
to get some rest. Maybe next time.

236
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,850
Does your stomach still hurt?

237
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,320
You were in pain since morning.
Why didn't you see a doctor?

238
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,860
It's just stress.

239
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,860
I've had too much work lately.

240
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,590
I'm sorry. You were still with us.

241
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,100
It's all right.
You two seem so loving.

242
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,330
I'm almost jealous.

243
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,730
He has such a weak stomach.

244
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,800
Should I get you some herbal tonic?

245
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,240
Are you going home?

246
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,470
Of course. Let's just go home today.

247
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,950
What? Hey.

248
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,550
Is it raining outside?

249
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,320
I'm fine.

250
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,790
We should meet
with your husband, too.

251
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,660
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

252
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,900
We should go.

253
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,370
My gosh. What happened
to your clothes and hair?

254
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,440
I smell coffee.

255
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,040
I spilled coffee on myself
by mistake.

256
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,710
And your hair?

257
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,910
She said it was a mistake.
Things can happen.

258
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,110
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

259
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,780
Let's go.

260
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,150
Have a great day. See you at home.

261
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,090
Are Ms. Kang Jae In
and Ms. Kang Se Ri acquainted?

262
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes, they've been friends
since university.

263
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,640
You should go. I'll see you later.

264
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,510
Goodbye, Mr. Hwang.

265
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,080
Okay. See you later.

266
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,820
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

267
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,290
Hello?

268
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,100
You said you wanted to talk to me.

269
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,870
It's nothing big,

270
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,730
but I have a favor to ask.

271
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,570
Sure. Please let me know.

272
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,440
Lately, Gi Chan...

273
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,710
No, Mr. Hwang seemed
quite stressed out.

274
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,110
I thought I had been
too negligent of my son-in-law.

275
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,780
So,

276
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,850
can you find out
what his work life is like?

277
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,320
Mr. Hwang?

278
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,190
I didn't want
to start a series of rumors...

279
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,860
by asking someone else.

280
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,560
Yes, I understand what you mean.

281
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,970
Find out who he talks to the most...

282
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,900
and what his relationship
with female staff members is like.

283
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,140
Keep an eye on him, and let me know.

284
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,680
And don't tell Jae In.

285
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,480
Of course not. I can take a hint.

286
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,880
What does she want to know
to dig behind his back?

287
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,890
She didn't say the staff members,
but only female staff members.

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
(Jae In)

289
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,200
Jae In's mom...

290
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,810
must've seen the pictures I sent
instead of Jae In.

291
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,610
The man who was
secretly taking pictures...

292
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,450
must've worked for her mother, too.

293
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,080
She thought Ms. Kim was
his woman on the side,

294
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,190
but she couldn't find a spy at work,
so she asked me to watch him.

295
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,820
She saw us at the hotel.

296
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,860
She knows about us, too.

297
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,940
She must've met with Kim Do Hee.

298
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,610
Did she spill everything already?

299
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,810
No, if she had,
Ms. Choi would've tried to kill me.

300
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,650
This may be for the better.

301
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,980
I sent those pictures for a reason.

302
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,790
I must face this problem
to make Gi Chan mine.

303
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,990
She doesn't know about me yet,

304
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,860
so I must play a move first
before she does.

305
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,500
You've all been waiting for this.
Here are the top five items...

306
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,940
that are leading the economy
right now.

307
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,410
E Energy, Mare Solution...

308
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,340
- I have your half-and-half chicken.
- And Ocean Chemicals.

309
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,380
And among them, what's the best?

310
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,810
- Ilcheon Chemicals!
- Goodness.

311
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,320
They recently sealed a contract
worth 100 million dollars.

312
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,160
Ilcheon Chemicals is
a must-have in your portfolio.

313
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,030
The times may be confusing
for the Korean stock market,

314
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,960
but in these times...

315
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,130
He's studying hard.

316
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,030
It'll all come back in the future.

317
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,700
I thought he was just unemployed.
Did he start studying later in life?

318
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,340
This may be your last chance.

319
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,670
Please remember that.

320
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,920
You're back.

321
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,620
You got home early.

322
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,530
Yes.

323
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,860
You must be
having fun at work lately.

324
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,460
What a shame
you had to come home early.

325
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,030
Why? Does it sound like
I mean something else?

326
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
No.

327
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,170
Do you really think so?

328
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,670
That I don't mean anything else?

329
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,040
We'll see.

330
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,470
Mom, why are you acting like this?

331
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,680
What did Gi Chan do?
Why do you treat him like this?

332
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,610
You don't know anything,
so just be quiet.

333
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,480
He deserved it.

334
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,280
What don't I know?

335
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,190
I need to know
why you don't approve of him...

336
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,090
to help him correct himself.

337
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,390
You said you wanted me to be happy.

338
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,190
I do.

339
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,000
Then, you need to accept him
as a part of our family.

340
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,560
Isn't that so?

341
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,030
Jae In, I want only your happiness.

342
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,900
Just remember that.

343
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,710
If you can't accept him,

344
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,410
we'll move out.

345
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,180
Give me a month's time.

346
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,520
Everything will be resolved
within that time.

347
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,290
If Gi Chan loves you...

348
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,520
with an unchanging heart,

349
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,690
then I'll accept him, too.
Are you happy?

350
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,800
You promised.

351
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,000
All right. You should go.

352
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,430
I need to get some rest.

353
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,270
Thank you, Mom.

354
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,450
I can't let Jae In
live miserably like I did.

355
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,990
I won't let that happen.

356
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,330
Gosh, it's so stuffy.

357
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:34,100
Are you telling me
to run a restaurant?

358
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,400
Your investment company
or whatever went down.

359
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,670
You can't sit around at home
like a bum.

360
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,070
It's a sin for a perfectly capable man
to live as a bum.

361
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,240
Stop sinning and get to work.

362
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,010
I don't sit around like a bum.

363
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,440
I've been planning my business.

364
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,310
Do you have money
to start a business?

365
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,580
I don't even have
a penny to invest in you.

366
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,220
If anything, you owe me much more.

367
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,850
I wrote down everything,
so start working to pay me back.

368
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,650
But this isn't even
a franchise restaurant.

369
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,460
Then, you can give me the money
to start this restaurant.

370
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,660
You're like a leech and a parasite.

371
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,330
How dare you
try to take advantage of me?

372
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,270
Just shut your mouth and work
instead of acting like vermin.

373
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,840
Also, I'm the owner of this place.

374
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,340
You're just a puppet boss. Okay?

375
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,770
It's not okay.

376
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,210
What now? What do you mean?

377
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,810
I said no. I don't want to do this.

378
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,310
I'd rather get a job somewhere...

379
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,850
than work for you.

380
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,050
I'm a man with pride.

381
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,420
Hey!

382
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,650
- Darn it.
- That little...

383
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,130
- Goodness.
- I'm sorry.

384
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,370
- Watch where you're going.
- Okay.

385
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,040
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

386
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,480
- You're here.
- Yes. Where's Bo Ram?

387
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,210
She's inside.

388
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,580
- Hey, Do Hee.
- Yes?

389
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,920
What happened to your face?

390
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
Your cheek is red.

391
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,790
I slammed into a wall.

392
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,990
A wall?

393
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,790
How did that happen?

394
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,090
I slipped.

395
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,800
Mom, give me that.
Let me sweep the floor.

396
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,430
Goodness, no.

397
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,200
Bo Ram is waiting for you.
Go inside.

398
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,200
And your clothes...

399
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,470
Well, I spilled coffee on myself.

400
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,110
- I was clumsy.
- Mommy!

401
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,480
Hey, Bo Ram. Hey, there.

402
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,810
Were you a good girl to Grandma?

403
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,280
- Was the kindergarten fun?
- Yes.

404
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,750
Let's go.

405
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,970
You're home, Yu Gyeong.

406
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
Yes, where's Mother?

407
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,640
Don't mess with her.

408
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,980
She's in the worst mood
because of Gi Man.

409
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,450
They must've had a fight
in the afternoon.

410
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,680
Do you want me
to find out the reason?

411
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,220
- No, is Gi Man in the room?
- Yes.

412
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,090
I got a bottle of perfume for you.

413
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,490
What?

414
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,830
Gosh, what is this?

415
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,490
I wanted to ask her
to set me up on a date.

416
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,200
You know I'm a white-collar worker
and a university graduate.

417
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,600
How can she tell me
to run a restaurant?

418
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,210
I know my mom thinks little of me,

419
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,740
but this is just wrong.

420
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,610
How can I touch...

421
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,040
pig's feet
with these delicate hands?

422
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,450
Who cares about blue-collar
and white-collar workers these days?

423
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,110
And why is that important?

424
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,520
Why not?

425
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,990
I'd make so much more money
if I got a job somewhere.

426
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,850
And can you find one?

427
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,620
The financial world
and investment companies...

428
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,090
probably heard
all about your failures.

429
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,590
Did you get any job offers?

430
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,500
You're the head of this family.

431
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,200
You need to do whatever it takes
to support your family.

432
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,540
This time, I'm on Mother's side.

433
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,210
I thought you'd understand.

434
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,180
Did you forget your promise
to stop drinking?

435
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,780
Darn it.

436
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,860
What should we get
as her birthday present?

437
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,700
- What should we get?
- What?

438
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,230
You're so cute.

439
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,740
Bo Ram.

440
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,510
I washed some grapes.
You love those.

441
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,440
- Come and have some.
- Okay.

442
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,310
Uncle Do Yun, don't tell anyone
about Mommy's birthday present.

443
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,480
Okay.

444
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,260
What's that? I'm not in any pain.

445
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,830
It's for Do Hee.

446
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,530
Did she hurt herself?

447
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,930
One of her cheeks is swollen.

448
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,100
She said she bumped into a wall,

449
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,770
but I thought she was slapped.

450
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,500
Slapped?

451
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,840
I hear there are bosses
who go on power trips,

452
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,410
and some even
bully people at work these days.

453
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,540
You should go and ask her.

454
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,450
She keeps denying it,
trying not to make me worry.

455
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,850
Do Hee, I'm coming in.

456
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,550
Okay, Do Yun.

457
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,260
- Hey.
- What's up?

458
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,530
Mom told me to give this to you.

459
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,700
Gosh, I'm fine.

460
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,030
Did something happen at work?

461
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,600
No, nothing happened.

462
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,670
You said there was something
you had to resolve at work.

463
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,000
Is this related?

464
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,240
No, it's not that.

465
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,310
- Hey, Do Yun.
- Yes?

466
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,580
I guess having lots of money
doesn't give you happiness.

467
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,420
I thought money was
the answer to all problems,

468
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,880
but love wasn't one of them.

469
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,450
What do you mean?

470
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,150
And those fairy tales...

471
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,720
always say,
"And they lived happily ever after."

472
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,830
Then, it ends.

473
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,800
But I guess
real life isn't like that.

474
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,930
The princess has no idea,

475
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,330
but her mother is spiteful.

476
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,870
I would've done the same...

477
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,580
if this was my daughter's business.

478
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,810
I was jealous of her,
but I began to feel bad.

479
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,050
Do you need money?

480
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,120
No.

481
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,790
I'm saying I realized
money wasn't everything.

482
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,690
Are you sure everything is okay?

483
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,930
Yes, and I mean it.

484
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,230
Do Hee, I know
you're an independent person,

485
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,830
but you still have me,
Mom, and Bo Ram.

486
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,900
You can always reach out
and find us.

487
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,570
Like this?

488
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,040
Jeez. Come on.

489
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,510
I'm so happy to have you
as my older brother.

490
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,740
Thanks, Do Yun.

491
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,200
Goodness, are you okay?

492
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,840
- Thanks...
- I'll call 911.

493
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,470
I'll be fine after a while.

494
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm sorry,
but can you get me some water?

495
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,150
I feel much better now.

496
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,280
How can I thank you?

497
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,980
It's all right.

498
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,950
Do you want to go to lunch?

499
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,220
Let's eat together.

500
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,690
I want to be your friend.

501
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,330
I don't know anyone at work yet,

502
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,760
and it feels lonely to eat alone.

503
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,470
You're Catherine, aren't you?

504
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,940
How do you know my English name?

505
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,880
Didn't Mr. Hwang mention this?

506
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,640
What do you mean?

507
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,950
I hear you were friends
with his wife since university.

508
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,750
Don't you feel bad for her?

509
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,850
I must've been crazy.

510
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,920
Are you going to tell Jae In?

511
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,320
Please don't. I ask of you.

512
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,260
I felt so bad for her...

513
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,430
and became tormented
to the point of insomnia.

514
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,230
I already told Mr. Hwang
that we should end it.

515
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,070
You probably don't believe me,
but it's true.

516
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,940
He refused to break up with me,

517
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,870
so I've been tortured
between those two.

518
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,710
Jae In may die in shock
if she finds out.

519
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,950
I'll find a way to end it soon,
so please don't say anything.

520
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,180
Please believe me.

521
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,090
I ask of you.

522
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,190
What are you doing?

523
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,860
It's a token of my promise.

524
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,390
The promise to break up
with Mr. Hwang.

525
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,230
I want to see this bracelet
on your arm...

526
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,400
whenever I go to your office...

527
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,860
to remember my decision.

528
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:59,200
I understand what you mean,
but this isn't right.

529
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,200
Please just help me out.

530
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,970
You're the only one who can help me.

531
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,140
You can give it back to me...

532
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,110
after I break up with him
and prove my words to be true.

533
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,250
Please.

534
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,520
Gosh, I...

535
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,000
Hello, Ms. Choi. It's me, Se Ri.

536
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,040
I'm sending you...

537
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,880
Mr. Hwang's pictures
just as you wanted.

538
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,110
You're here.

539
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,050
Bring me a cold beverage first.

540
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,890
Please get iced coffee ready.

541
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,590
Yes, sir.

542
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,720
(Application for the Confirmation
of Divorce by Consent)

543
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,520
You need to divorce Jae In...

544
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,790
immediately.

545
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,000
(Queen's House)

546
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,140
Am I blackmailing you?

547
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,670
I'll start doing that now.

548
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,310
Confess everything you did wrong...

549
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,080
and have Ms. Choi apologize to me.

550
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,450
In the end,
you weren't Jae In's family.

551
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,220
You were her servant and a farmhand.

552
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,560
I warned you and said...

553
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,130
you'd be tortured in this life
if what you said was a lie.

554
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,200
Just wait.
