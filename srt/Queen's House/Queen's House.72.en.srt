00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,240
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,810
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,340
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,580
I'm leaving. I'm going to leave!

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,480
Untie me!

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,650
I'm going to leave!

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,560
I'm not crazy. Let me leave!

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,130
Honey.

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,660
How can you do
what you did to Jae In to me?

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
You kept provoking her...

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,300
and left me no other choice.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,470
Hang in there for a short while.

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,140
I'll free you.

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,240
No, I can't put up with this.

15
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,510
I'm leaving.

16
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,250
Let go of me! Free me now!

17
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,080
You aroused
her suspicion against me.

18
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,350
You should've just stayed quiet.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,220
Jae In doesn't have amnesia.

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,160
She's fooling you!

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
She told me
to taste my own medicine,

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,660
and that you were behind this.

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,390
I've been deceived by you
enough times.

24
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not deceiving you this time.

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,430
You're getting fooled.

26
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,230
I'm trying to patch this up, too.

27
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,900
I told Jae In
you had a psychological problem,

28
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,510
so consider this a vacation
and get some rest.

29
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,880
You can't do this to me.

30
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,310
Did you forget who I was?

31
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,280
It's me, Catherine.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,350
If I go down,
you'll go down with me.

33
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,190
I had to do this
to make Jae In believe.

34
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,830
I'll free you
once I get what I need from her,

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,430
so stop making a scene
and stay quiet.

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,070
Otherwise, I'll keep you in here
for the rest of your life.

37
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,830
Do you understand?

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,570
Don't do this, honey. Gi Chan.

39
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,570
Please don't.
I'll do everything as you say.

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,580
Please get me out of here.

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,310
I can't stay here anymore.

42
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,310
Get me out of here, honey.

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,050
Honey! Gi Chan!

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,650
You! Hwang Gi Chan!

45
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,590
Get me out of here!

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,850
Don't worry.
Gi Man will wake up soon.

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,350
Ji Ho went to the kindergarten.

48
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,020
I'm taking the day off to get
the rest I need, just as you said.

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,190
Mother must've been surprised, too.
I'll keep an eye on her...

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,230
and visit Gi Man later as well.

51
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,330
Honey, someone is here.

52
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,630
I'll call you later.

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,180
My dear shaman,
thank you for coming.

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,680
What's bothering you this time?

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,220
Why did you make
this busy woman travel?

56
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,050
We've had the worst of luck...

57
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,920
ever since we moved here.
My eldest grandson died,

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,860
my eldest son was
seriously hurt and hospitalized,

59
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,300
and my new daughter-in-law
got locked up at a mental hospital.

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,300
My family is
always caught up in a mess.

61
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,000
I was wondering
if we should do a ritual.

62
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,640
Goodness, she's still in this house.

63
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,910
I'll need at least two full days
to explain what's going on.

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,480
But you can always tell
when you see someone, right?

65
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,560
She claims to have lost her memories,
but she's totally lying.

66
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,930
She's trying
to hit on my son again...

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,860
because he's the chairman now.

68
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,160
Anyway, that's for another day.

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,200
My eldest son is lying unconscious.

70
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,570
I wanted to ask
for something I could do.

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,610
Should I serve some tea, Mother?

72
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,180
Do you see that?
She's really crafty.

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,820
Bring our best tea.

74
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,650
And put in extra care
when you boil the water.

75
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,860
She's such a supernatural woman...

76
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,630
who figured out you and Gi Chan were
both cheating on each other.

77
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,760
Is that so?

78
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,800
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

79
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,950
I stopped by
while Ms. Noh left to relieve herself.

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,650
I hear the rich
never go truly broke.

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,490
I can help if you want to work things out
with the chairman again.

82
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,300
All I need is one handsome payment.

83
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,400
Then, I'll resolve
all your troubles in a flash.

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,570
Call me anytime.

85
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,840
(Wola Good Luck Shaman)

86
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,880
Jeez.

87
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,020
My goodness.

88
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,830
Who left this out in front
without a word?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,400
It was me, Yun Hee.

90
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,370
I had one sent to every business...

91
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,740
in the shopping arcade.

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,210
You sent this
to everyone in the arcade? Why?

93
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,410
My eldest son
got into an awful accident.

94
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,410
Goodness, what happened?

95
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,580
Is he in bad condition?

96
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,620
I heard his surgery went well,

97
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,450
but he hasn't woken up.

98
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,160
So, if I did good for others...

99
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,230
and gave generously,

100
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,860
I thought fate would
show its favor on me.

101
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,060
That's why I'm doing this.

102
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,700
I know how you feel.

103
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,470
A mother can do anything
for her child.

104
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,140
Please send some prayers...

105
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,210
for my eldest son
when you have time.

106
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,180
If enough people prayed together,

107
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,850
it might even move fate.

108
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,880
I'll do that. Stay strong.

109
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,950
He'll wake up soon.

110
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,260
It doesn't even say who it's from.

111
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,060
Was it a mistake?

112
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,840
You got it, too.

113
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,810
It's from me.

114
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,870
You sent it to me?

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,810
Yes, I didn't want
to give it to you,

116
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,150
but I did, so keep it.

117
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,180
In that case, you can take it back.

118
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,310
I don't need it.

119
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,150
You have no idea
your husband is unconscious, do you?

120
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,050
I don't have a husband.

121
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,560
Anyway, unconscious?

122
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,720
Did something happen to Gi Man?

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,860
Your ex-husband is
still your husband.

124
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,860
Did you have to point that out?

125
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,600
He was badly hurt,

126
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,640
and he's been lying unconscious
for days.

127
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,110
What did the doctor say?

128
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,880
He said the surgery went well,

129
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,240
but he hasn't woken up.

130
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,350
That's why I'm trying to do good...

131
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,050
to help him wake up.

132
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,950
People say we should go
the extra mile for our enemy.

133
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,120
I wondered who I hated the most,

134
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
and it was you.

135
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,700
If I showed you my generosity,

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,560
it might return
as good luck for Gi Man.

137
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,940
Don't be evil and begin to think...

138
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,440
that he deserved this.

139
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,870
You should pray day and night...

140
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,740
for him to wake up.

141
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,550
I even swallowed my pride
and came to see you.

142
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,010
You said the surgery went well.

143
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,780
He'll be fine.

144
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,450
You talk as if he's just a stranger.

145
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,690
You little...

146
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,020
I need to be patient...

147
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,060
to save Gi Man.

148
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,930
I'll end up reaching nirvana
with this kind of patience.

149
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,740
We sent proposals
to all these investment companies.

150
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,650
I don't understand
how not a single one responded.

151
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,880
DH Holdings has
a huge influence in the industry,

152
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,150
so no one seems to dare
to defy them and join us.

153
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,220
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

154
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,690
What about the Chinese investor
I told you to contact?

155
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,660
Connections are a must
if you wish to do business in China,

156
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,400
so it's not easy
to even deliver the proposal.

157
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,430
The amount of money
the middleman demanded...

158
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,170
to set us up with the investor
is simply ridiculous.

159
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,340
It's too much money to lose...

160
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,740
just to kick out DH Holdings.

161
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,680
I understand for now. You may leave.

162
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,050
I need to get
to the Chinese investor...

163
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,620
even if I must use
H and K Company to bribe them.

164
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,230
But I need Catherine to do that.

165
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,700
I wouldn't need
to worry about this...

166
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,870
if only I could get
to Kang Gyu Cheol's slush fund.

167
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,280
I'm always happy to show up to
whatever occasion you put together.

168
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,350
Yes, let's stay in touch.

169
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,120
Hwang Gi Chan is
going around here and there,

170
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,150
trying to find another investor.

171
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,820
No one will jump in easily
while we're around, right?

172
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,560
Of course not.

173
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,690
Don't forget about
the kind of connections I have.

174
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,930
I already talked to everyone,

175
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,760
so no one would make a rash move.

176
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,400
He'll try to contact China, too.

177
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,000
Can we let him continue?

178
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,810
It's already tough enough
to find anyone there without us.

179
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,240
They ask
for more than what he can get.

180
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,770
Hwang Gi Chan will...

181
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,680
slowly realize
we aren't that easy to dispose of.

182
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,780
We'll become something...

183
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,880
he can't keep or let go of.

184
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,490
That's what we want.

185
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,790
He doesn't deserve to live
a single day in peace.

186
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,260
Anyway, what were you looking at?

187
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,200
That designer, L,
won another huge award.

188
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,430
We're here as YL's investors,

189
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,670
so I must keep an eye
on the industry.

190
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,540
L received another huge award in America
for a townhouse design.

191
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,340
That's amazing.

192
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,310
It's the designer who designed the space
for a famous ad, right?

193
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,780
Why don't we recruit this person?

194
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,780
We have Jae In's vacancy.

195
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,150
I hear the designer
never goes public,

196
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,850
but there are people
who have worked with L.

197
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,420
Should I make contact?

198
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,560
I'm sure many companies
have already reached out.

199
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,630
Do you think so?

200
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,930
But that's a talent
I really want to work with.

201
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,630
Look at this design.
Isn't it amazing?

202
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,400
I liked this one, too.

203
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,170
(L, the faceless genius designer,
wins another international award.)

204
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,240
Nice.

205
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,180
(The judges said L was evidently leading
the recent design trend.)

206
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,820
It's not in this room, either.

207
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,330
It wasn't in the study
or any other rooms.

208
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,130
But my dad said it was at home.

209
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,860
Where could it be?

210
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,200
The memo...

211
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,870
I saw in Dad's notebook
might be the hint.

212
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,170
That must be
why Mom's been looking for it, too.

213
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,610
But we lost the notebook.
What do I do now?

214
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,710
Right. Hwang Gi Chan said he took
the clothes you were wearing...

215
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,220
at the time of the accident
from the hospital.

216
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,720
Did he tell you?

217
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,850
No.

218
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,320
Was there anything special?

219
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,990
I had taken
the voice recorder right away,

220
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,760
so there was only a note.

221
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,360
I think it said...

222
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,800
the word home and a house number.

223
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,600
Gi Chan must've gotten
wind of something.

224
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,480
Goodness, I'm already
stressed out beyond my limit.

225
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,350
Why is he playing
with a dead kid's toy?

226
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,480
Give me that, Ji Ho.

227
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,920
No!

228
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,290
I told you to throw it out
because it's bad luck.

229
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,260
I'll get you a better one,
so give me that.

230
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,960
Okay?

231
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,930
Give me that thing!

232
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,070
Why won't you ever listen?

233
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,730
You're back.

234
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,700
Why were you in that room?

235
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,340
I was cleaning.

236
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,010
You can go upstairs and play, Ji Ho.

237
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,110
I'll bring some snacks.

238
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,410
Grandma is too scary.
She's like a witch!

239
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,110
What did you say?

240
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,820
That rude little boy.

241
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,550
This is why people say
a family needs a good woman...

242
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,260
to marry into their family.

243
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,460
Is this funny to you?

244
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,330
Yes, technically,

245
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,200
the Hwangs were ruined
when you married into the family.

246
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,470
What did you say? Ruined?

247
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,410
Did you just insult me?

248
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,140
A woman named Noh Sook Ja
married into the Hwang family...

249
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,410
and gave birth
to the most problematic sons.

250
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,710
Don't you think you ended up ruining
your daughters-in-law's lives?

251
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,220
What did you say?

252
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,390
Play stupid games,
win stupid prizes.

253
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,490
I don't know what kids say these days,
but I know that one.

254
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,060
You ruined your own life.
Why are you blaming me?

255
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,500
You're right.
So, I should return that stupid prize.

256
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,230
Play stupid games,
win stupid prizes.

257
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,800
I'll remember that.
What a great phrase.

258
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,170
That little...

259
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,540
She's now an expert
at demeaning her mother-in-law.

260
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,150
Jeez.

261
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,250
Goodness. I must be patient.

262
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,420
I must do good
to let Gi Man wake up soon.

263
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,690
I must be patient to get good luck.

264
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,660
I'll be patient.

265
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,060
Time for some snacks, Ji Ho.

266
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,370
You must be feeling down
because Grandma got mad at you.

267
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,450
We should try to understand, Ji Ho.

268
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,650
She's just in a foul mood...

269
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,250
because Uncle Gi Man is sick.

270
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,920
Okay.

271
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,190
This toy must be your treasure.

272
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,160
Yes, Eun Ho gave it to me.

273
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,430
Eun Ho?

274
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,000
My mommy told me not to mention him.

275
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,840
It's all right.

276
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,070
So, this is from Eun Ho?

277
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,940
Yes, I miss him,

278
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,310
but both my dad and mom
won't let me see him.

279
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,920
He doesn't know that Eun Ho is dead.

280
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,150
This is a cool robot.

281
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,160
Right?

282
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,690
Eun Ho gave it to me
as a birthday present...

283
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,230
when he went to see his mommy.

284
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,060
When he went to see his mommy?

285
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,360
Yes, my mommy told me...

286
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,630
to keep it a secret...

287
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,670
It's all right.
Are you talking about Se Ri?

288
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,640
Yes, my mommy, Se Ri,
called Eun Ho's mommy...

289
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,010
and said she would
let her meet Eun Ho.

290
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,510
So, I told Eun Ho in secret.

291
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,010
He thanked me and gave me this.

292
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,550
Ji Ho, have some snacks and play.

293
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,560
I need to go to the bathroom.

294
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,290
Okay.

295
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,000
Ji Ho told Eun Ho...

296
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,830
that he could see me?

297
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,340
It was Se Ri.

298
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,740
Se Ri put Hong Man Su
up for the job, not Gi Chan.

299
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,620
So, Eun Ho died in my place.

300
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,650
Gi Chan knew it was Se Ri
when he covered it up.

301
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,970
Isn't Mother staying
at her friend's place for too long?

302
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,140
You're right.

303
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,840
How long is she staying?

304
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,880
I told her to come home,
but she was adamant about staying.

305
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,210
She must feel uncomfortable here
after spending many years away.

306
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,350
I'll call her tomorrow
and tell her you asked her to return.

307
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,650
No, she doesn't like me.

308
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,920
It's all right.

309
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,620
No way. She's fond of you.

310
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,730
When we got married, she said...

311
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,160
she wanted to split us up,

312
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,900
but she gave her blessing
when she realized your love for me.

313
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,770
She really said that?

314
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
Yes, of course.

315
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,440
You can ask her
if you don't believe me.

316
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,410
She didn't tell me the details,

317
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,010
but she said she met with you alone
and talked to you.

318
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,910
Is she talking about the day
when she gave me a blank check?

319
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,720
What did you two talk about? Hey.

320
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,950
Tell me.

321
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,890
Come on. What is it?

322
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,050
It's a secret.

323
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,440
How are you feeling? Are you okay?

324
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,710
Yes.

325
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,110
I'm almost scared
that I feel too fine today.

326
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,880
Do you remember
what happened two days ago?

327
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,180
You had left home
early in the morning.

328
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,780
Did something happen?

329
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,190
Two days ago?

330
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,250
Yes.

331
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,290
I went to see Jae In, and...

332
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,800
If you tell anyone
about what you saw here,

333
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,700
I'll do the same to her!

334
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,580
What's wrong, Ms. Choi?

335
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,280
I...

336
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,720
I don't know anything.

337
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,180
I don't know anything.

338
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,130
Are you okay, Ms. Choi?

339
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,500
What's going on?

340
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,070
What happened to her?

341
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,740
I don't know.

342
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,520
She calmed down...

343
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,220
and decided to call it a night.

344
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,490
What suddenly happened?

345
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,030
I told you last time
that she seemed to be shocked...

346
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,730
but wouldn't tell me
what it was, right?

347
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,800
Yes, you did.

348
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,230
She was in good condition,

349
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,700
so I asked her about it again,
and that happened.

350
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,070
So, something must've happened.

351
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,810
Yes, she seems frightened
just to recall those memories,

352
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,750
so it must've been serious.

353
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,480
Let's keep an eye on her
and make sure...

354
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,680
she doesn't go out alone.

355
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,220
She keeps forgetting,
so you should charge her phone...

356
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,020
when she goes to sleep.

357
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,990
Okay. And we'll need to take
another measure...

358
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,300
to prevent her from going missing.

359
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,070
Jae In may...

360
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,770
talk Gi Chan into doing her bidding
while I'm stuck in here.

361
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,180
And what if Gi Man wakes up?

362
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,780
No, I need to do
whatever I can to get out.

363
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,250
Ms. Kang, I'm here
to take your temperature.

364
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,330
Ms. Kang! Ma'am!

365
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,560
Hey! Get that patient!

366
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,500
Get her!

367
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,400
- You can't leave!
- Grab her!

368
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Let go of me! Let go!

369
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,800
- Stop it, ma'am.
- I'm not crazy!

370
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,770
No! Let go of me!

371
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,610
- I'm not crazy!
- Tie her down.

372
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,940
I don't belong here!

373
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm not crazy! Let go of me!

374
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,550
Let go of me. Let go!

375
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,980
I'm not crazy!

376
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,850
Let go! Let go of me!

377
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,060
We need Ms. Kang to finish
the new window design project.

378
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,930
Jae In?
She hasn't been back for long.

379
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,770
We can't put this off any longer.

380
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,140
Team Leader Kang Se Ri was
in charge of this,

381
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,740
but she suddenly had to go on leave,
so we're in a tough spot.

382
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,080
I hear she's in awful health.

383
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,450
Yes, she was hospitalized.

384
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,950
It must be serious.

385
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,120
So? Can you do this?

386
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,550
If you can't,
I'll give it to the design team.

387
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,160
I'll do it.

388
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,860
The files were all left behind,
so leave me to it.

389
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,490
Don't strain yourself.
You aren't in full health yet.

390
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,230
I know I can pull this off
with your help, Mr. Kang.

391
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,870
Okay.

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,140
It won't be easy,
but you two should do your best.

393
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,770
All right.

394
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,210
Gi Chan went to a meeting,
so he's not here.

395
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,080
I know.
But he'll be back soon, right?

396
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,280
I wanted to eat lunch with him.

397
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,520
You can feel free
to go to lunch, too.

398
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,860
My brother will get mad, so don't touch
anything and just sit there.

399
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:02,890
All right.

400
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,440
Yes? Do you have something to say?

401
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,940
No, never mind.

402
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,060
It must be here
if it wasn't in the study.

403
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,970
What are you doing over there?

404
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,910
Can't you see?
Your desk was a mess, so I wiped it off.

405
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,910
I'm all done.

406
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,610
I wanted to eat lunch with you.

407
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,080
Oh, no.

408
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,050
It's a notebook.

409
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,460
Isn't this Dad's handwriting?

410
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,230
It must be his.

411
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,060
Did you keep this to give it to me?

412
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,400
What? Yes, of course.

413
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,870
I had kept it to give it to you.

414
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,770
I've been missing him.

415
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,340
Thank you, honey.

416
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,220
He left lots of notes
in that notebook.

417
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,850
Some of them
may be significant to you.

418
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,860
Really?

419
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,990
He had a bucket list.

420
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,430
I'll let you know
if I find anything interesting.

421
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,140
Okay. Let's eat lunch.

422
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,970
How was lunch?

423
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,410
It was great.

424
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,980
It's nice to date at work.

425
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,350
I get to work and date.

426
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,050
Keep it low.
What if someone notices?

427
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,220
Right. I thought you should know.

428
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,920
Do Yun found out about us.

429
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,790
Director Kim Do Yun?

430
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,160
So, does your sister know?

431
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,730
We aren't trying to get married
at this age,

432
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,340
so I told him to keep it quiet
because we were just dating.

433
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,670
I'll keep it a secret from Yun Hee.

434
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,780
Does she ever tell you
to get married?

435
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,110
She can't say it enough.

436
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,650
"It's not too late."

437
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,480
"You still need a child."

438
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,250
If I had a child now,

439
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,160
I'd be 60 by the time
my kid is in kindergarten.

440
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,890
That's way too much to ask.

441
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,000
How would you feel...

442
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,630
if you...

443
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,440
suddenly had a grown son?

444
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,510
It must be because
I got diagnosed with menopause.

445
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,550
I was just curious.

446
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,150
I don't know.
I suddenly have a grown child?

447
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,730
That's awful.

448
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,790
I don't like it.

449
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,560
Why not?

450
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,470
Even a parent and a child
need time to grow on each other.

451
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,100
So, if I suddenly had a kid,

452
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,800
not only would it be odd,

453
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,740
but I'd probably wonder
if the kid really was mine.

454
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,680
It'd be much easier
if I didn't have one.

455
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,680
I don't care for a child.

456
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,910
Hey, Jae In.

457
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,010
I heard Gi Man got into an accident
and was hospitalized.

458
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,150
Has he woken up?

459
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,250
So, he's still unconscious.

460
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,360
All right. Thanks. Bye.

461
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,260
Yu Gyeong!

462
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,600
I came to take you home,

463
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,430
and I would've missed you
if I were a little late.

464
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,900
Let me give you a ride home.

465
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,770
Seung Woo.

466
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,940
I really came just to take you home.

467
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,910
I didn't come to whine
and demand an answer I want,

468
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,920
so don't make that face. Please?

469
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,790
Seung Woo.

470
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,060
Don't.
I don't want to hear it today.

471
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,630
Don't have feelings for me.

472
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,030
Yu Gyeong...

473
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,970
I can't accept your feelings,

474
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,400
and I shouldn't.

475
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
Your feelings are...

476
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,410
a luxury I can't afford,
something out of my reach.

477
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,310
Why do you say that?

478
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,380
I want to go home alone today.

479
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,320
I'm sorry.

480
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,180
Wait, Yu Gyeong...

481
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,030
One, two, three. Right?

482
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,440
You're also thinking
what I'm thinking, right?

483
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,810
What's on your mind?

484
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,510
It was more fun to play this game
when it was the three of us,

485
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,780
with Ms. Kang, right?

486
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,380
Perhaps it was only fun...

487
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,220
because she gave you hints
and let you win.

488
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,350
No way. Just watch me.

489
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,390
I'm going to win against you.

490
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,760
Hey, I'm looking forward to that.

491
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,860
I'm home.

492
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,830
Little Grandpa's home.

493
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,670
Little Grandpa! You're home.

494
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,470
- You're back, Uncle Oh Seong.
- Hey, there.

495
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,970
Were you playing with Uncle Do Yun?

496
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,480
Yes, I'm playing
a board game with him,

497
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,680
and I'm going to win.

498
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,010
Come on, Uncle Do Yun.

499
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,910
You have to watch me win.

500
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,880
- You should run along.
- Okay.

501
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,450
All right.
Let's see what you got, Bo Ram.

502
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,700
Yun Hee, have you reached
that insurance planner...

503
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,800
named Kim Mi Gyeong yet?

504
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,770
No, and it's not just that
she isn't picking up anymore.

505
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,570
Her number isn't available.

506
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,610
Her phone number
is suddenly unavailable?

507
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,170
Exactly.

508
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,780
It was the same number
written on the business card she gave me.

509
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,250
Did she suddenly
have to change her number?

510
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,020
No, this means something is...

511
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,250
definitely fishy.

512
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,760
You called her so many times,

513
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,460
so she must've seen
the missed calls.

514
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:18,130
She never called you back,
and suddenly changed her number.

515
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,730
Doesn't it seem odd?

516
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,070
It means something is going on.

517
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,730
Does it?

518
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,040
Otherwise,
she should've called back...

519
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,270
when she saw the missed calls,
or at least texted you.

520
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,940
People these days don't pick up calls
from a number they don't know,

521
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,450
but most people would respond
if someone kept calling.

522
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,980
I had left her many text messages
in case she didn't pick up calls...

523
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,920
from a number she didn't know.

524
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,190
See? Something is really fishy.

525
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,990
I'll ask a detective I know
to look into this.

526
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,860
Can you send me...

527
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,790
a photo of the business card
that woman gave you?

528
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,960
All right. The compensation...

529
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,730
for my husband's tragic death...

530
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,330
completely disappeared
without our knowledge.

531
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,170
I'll find my peace
only after I find out...

532
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,170
what really happened.

533
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,210
What?

534
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,690
Open the door, ma'am!

535
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,540
(Haesung Psychiatric Hospital)

536
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,770
Don't come near me.

537
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,510
No. Don't come!

538
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,350
No, don't come!

539
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,620
Please don't come. Please don't.

540
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,570
Kang Se Ri.

541
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,800
How does it feel
to be locked up in here?

542
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,440
Why are you even asking?

543
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,640
It's awful.

544
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,380
It's torture.

545
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm not going back there.

546
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,850
Jae In, please spare me.

547
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,790
Please spare my life.

548
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,660
Please spare me, Jae In.

549
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,330
I don't want to go back.

550
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,560
Please spare me.

551
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,300
Please spare me.

552
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,870
Please spare me, Jae In.

553
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,280
(Queen's House)

554
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,280
I miss Mommy, Grandma.

555
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,480
Can you bring her home?

556
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,650
It's too dangerous.

557
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,190
You said you'd send Kang Se Ri
to a mental hospital and end it there.

558
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,190
Eun Ho died in my place.

559
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,030
Not yet.

560
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,630
I have another present...

561
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,700
for Gi Chan and Se Ri.

562
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,800
Mother, by any chance,

563
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,230
do you know anything
about Father's slush fund?

564
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,600
What are you talking about?

565
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,810
He...

566
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,340
Mr. Kim Do Yun just gave me this...

567
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,180
and told me to listen to it.

568
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,050
He said it was a pen recorder.

569
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,310
A recorder?
