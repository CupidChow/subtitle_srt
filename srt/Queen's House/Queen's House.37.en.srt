1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,070
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,420
Say that again, Oh Seong.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,820
How dare you tell her to leave?

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,490
She's my guest.

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,690
I invited her to stay here.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,690
Yun Hee!

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,260
This is driving me crazy.

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,360
You invited her as your guest?

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,330
She needs to leave this home,
so is it my fault for saying it?

12
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,370
Have you lost your mind?

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,170
What is this nonsense?

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,770
Don't just stand there
and tell her yourself.

15
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,270
Am I the one at fault?

16
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,710
Have I lost my mind?

17
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,040
That's enough.

18
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,110
Why are you
suddenly making this scene?

19
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,110
You're really bad, Little Grandpa.

20
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,150
Have you always treated her like this
whenever I wasn't around?

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,950
And what about you?

22
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,590
You should stop him
instead of just standing there.

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,060
Come on!

24
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,690
If you want anyone to leave,
you can go.

25
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,830
Stop picking on the wrong person!

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,970
Uncle Oh Seong!

27
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,840
Mom, you should've calmed him down.

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,540
Why would I do that
after what he did?

29
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,940
- I'll go after him.
- Leave him alone.

30
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,540
He has nowhere else to go.

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,710
He'll get some air
and come back to sleep.

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,720
I should probably leave.

33
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,150
Don't say that.
You don't have to mind him.

34
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,520
He had been acting strange
with a frown on his face...

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,320
since this afternoon.

36
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,930
Just think that he's venting on you
after something else happened.

37
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,800
He's usually not like this,
but he's acting weird today.

38
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,300
Ms. Kang, stay with us.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,770
Don't go anywhere else.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,170
What?

41
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,170
I'm having a drink.

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,570
I'm not a kid, Yun Hee.

43
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,310
Don't worry about me.

44
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,610
Don't worry, and go to sleep.

45
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,220
Darn it.

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,540
Hey, Bo Ram. You were still up?

47
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,880
Yes, may I sleep here?

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,350
Of course. Come on in.

49
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,990
It's nice to sleep here next to you.

50
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,400
Your uncle says it's nothing,

51
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,740
but I know something is going on.

52
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,240
He's not someone
who'd say such harsh words.

53
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,380
I kept asking him,
but he just wouldn't tell me.

54
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,180
Did something go wrong
with his business?

55
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,820
I doubt that.

56
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,950
I became furious
and got mad at him back then,

57
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,520
but I became worried.

58
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,020
I'll ask him
when I see him tomorrow.

59
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,890
I'm sure it's not a big deal.

60
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,230
All right.
Let me know if anything is going on.

61
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,670
Of course.

62
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,630
You should go to sleep. It's late.

63
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,880
(Husband)

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,360
Are you not going to pick it up?

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,230
Hello?

66
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,970
Why did you pick up my phone?

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,770
You didn't, so it kept vibrating.

68
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,710
I was annoyed.

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,380
Even so, how can you pick it up?

70
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,180
Have you got any manners?

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,820
I don't think
there's enough oxygen...

72
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,520
to share with you in this room.
I feel stifled.

73
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,350
Isn't that so?

74
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,120
Why don't you go home
and sleep comfortably...

75
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,190
instead of staying
in this tiny room?

76
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,490
Why are you here
instead of your huge place?

77
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,890
It must feel uncomfortable.

78
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,700
It's my dad's place.
Why would it feel uncomfortable?

79
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,260
I'm at ease.

80
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,630
If you feel uncomfortable,
you can sleep outside.

81
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,300
Outside? Where?

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,040
There are only two rooms
in this house,

83
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,570
and I'm staying here.

84
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,540
You can enjoy your space in peace
in the living room.

85
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,310
Darn it. Jeez.

86
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,190
- Did you sleep out here?
- Yes.

87
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,520
I told you to quit drinking.

88
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,920
Are you
still not in your right mind?

89
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,030
Cut it out. I don't want
to hear you nagging this early.

90
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,630
You'll end up making
another drunken mistake.

91
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,470
Don't go anywhere near Ji Ho.
This is my warning.

92
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,300
It was you, right?

93
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,840
You did it.

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,010
Yes, it must've been you.

95
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,450
I kept thinking about it,
and it had to be you.

96
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,520
You told Se Ri that I was the one...

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,680
who kidnapped Eun Ho.

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,820
Why are you bringing that up now?
It's nothing to brag about!

99
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,390
Exactly! You knew
it was nothing to brag about.

100
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,220
Why did you tell her
and make a mess out of my family?

101
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,960
My wife left home
because of you. Okay?

102
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,500
- Yu Gyeong is gone?
- Yes, you punk.

103
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,370
Why would you go around telling people
about your brother's mistake?

104
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,200
How do you call yourself
my younger brother?

105
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,000
How can we
consider each other brothers?

106
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,500
I never told her.

107
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,140
Then, how did she find out?

108
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,380
My wife never speaks ill of me,

109
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,510
not even to my father-in-law.

110
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,950
Se Ri said Yu Gyeong told her,

111
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,720
but that had to be a lie.
It was you.

112
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,150
You're why my wife got berated by Mom
for having a big mouth.

113
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,090
You need to bring her back!

114
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,520
I said it wasn't me!

115
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,290
Why would I share anything
that'd humiliate my family?

116
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,660
Did I tell you?

117
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,930
It wasn't him, Gi Man.

118
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,900
Then, what?

119
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,770
Are you saying it was my wife?

120
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,100
Well, I somehow ended up
overhearing you and her...

121
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,370
in a quarrel.

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,640
I didn't eavesdrop on purpose.
You two were in the kitchen.

123
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,280
In the end, it was you.

124
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,080
Darn it. I told you
to be careful with what you say.

125
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,550
Why are you telling me this now?

126
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,890
- What?
- What's with you?

127
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,390
Did you get us into a fight
on purpose?

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,090
Back then,
you said it was Yu Gyeong!

129
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,890
I did?

130
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,530
I don't remember saying that.

131
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,830
I must've been confused
at that moment.

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,940
Darn it.

133
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,320
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

134
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,680
Come on.

135
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,050
Mom, I'm leaving.

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,290
Wait, I need to talk to you.

137
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,020
Why? I have to go.

138
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,260
I set up a blind date for you
this Saturday.

139
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,190
What? I don't want to go.

140
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,390
Why not?

141
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,100
He's from a great family.

142
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,370
Mom, I'm not interested.

143
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,830
Is it because you...

144
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,200
and that punk hit it off?

145
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,410
Was that why you said
you'd marry before me?

146
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,070
Mom, don't call him a punk.

147
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,110
He's a doctor. A doctor in medicine.

148
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,650
Who is this guy?

149
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,810
You'll get sick
of a good-looking guy...

150
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,550
in less than a year.

151
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,920
It's not about a guy's looks.
It's all about his money.

152
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,350
That's the real deal.

153
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,520
What about you?
Is the guy you like ugly?

154
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,630
No, he's unbelievably handsome.

155
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,300
Hey, you and I are different.

156
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,600
I only have
one-half of a life ahead of me,

157
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,900
and I'm made of money,
so I'm allowed to want good looks.

158
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,000
That's not fair.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,370
Then, I'll go against you.
Stop dating that guy.

160
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,910
You little...

161
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,350
Mother, Ji Ho is still asleep.

162
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,750
Don't say anything weird
when his tutor gets here.

163
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,320
Please let her focus on him.

164
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,720
All right?

165
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,890
Fine.

166
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,120
So... Tu what?

167
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,590
Tutor. Do you get it?

168
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,490
I'm leaving.

169
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,200
Bye, Mom.

170
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,830
All right. Bye.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,040
Tu... Tu?

172
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,540
Tutu?

173
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,710
These darned English words are
giving me a headache.

174
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,680
So, he found out
after seeing me with my aunt.

175
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,010
I think I'm only causing disruption
in your family.

176
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,750
He feels...

177
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,350
more betrayed by me than you.

178
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,250
I've been thinking about it,

179
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,190
and I think I should leave.

180
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,230
Give me some time...

181
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,230
to deal with Mom and Bo Ram.

182
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,760
And my uncle isn't that heartless.

183
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,630
He's only mad at me,

184
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,130
so let's keep an eye on him
for a while.

185
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,440
One second. It's Hwang Na Ra.

186
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,880
She must be calling
because I told her you quit.

187
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,080
Let me have that.
I'll talk to her and end it.

188
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,850
I'll get rid of the number, too.

189
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,250
Hello?

190
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,990
- Hey, Na Ra.
- Geum Ja.

191
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,790
Why didn't you pick up your phone?
I was worried about you.

192
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,660
Why did you quit?

193
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,200
It's something personal.

194
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,100
Then, do you want
to meet up for lunch?

195
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,270
Where are you?

196
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,100
I'm at home.

197
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,470
You're home? Where do you live?

198
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,670
Hello?

199
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,410
What was that? Was it disconnected?

200
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,310
Why are you here, Jae In?

201
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,190
She was here for a consultation.
You should go.

202
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,490
Okay.

203
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,570
(Geum Ja, Hwang Na Ra)

204
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,200
No way.

205
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,670
You were Geum Ja?

206
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,470
Na Ra, it's...

207
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,710
It's her, right?

208
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,980
She was Geum Ja, right?

209
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,420
Yes, it was me.

210
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,520
And you knew about this?

211
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,820
You two deceived me?

212
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,530
I had no idea and was happy
that I found myself a good friend.

213
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,800
I really liked Geum Ja!
You're so awful!

214
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,530
I liked you, too.
It was a good friendship.

215
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:37,100
And I had to go out of my way
to find the ticket to the concert...

216
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,470
because you liked the artist.

217
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,600
You're lying!

218
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,610
- Na Ra.
- And you're the same.

219
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,010
You should've been honest with me.

220
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,080
Get away from each other!

221
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,950
I hate both of you!

222
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,260
What do we do?
She'll tell Hwang Gi Chan all about it.

223
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,320
It doesn't matter.

224
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,860
What could he do to me
even if he found out now?

225
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,500
Don't worry about it.

226
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,000
(Bo Ram's Fried Chicken)

227
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,150
If you're up, don't just sit around.
Come and eat breakfast.

228
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,530
That feels much better.

229
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,000
I know I'm opening late today,

230
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,670
but you can't sleep here
at my business.

231
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,070
You're a rich man.
Why didn't you go to a hotel?

232
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,670
I had to chug down alcohol
to soothe my turbulent heart,

233
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,310
so I wasn't in my right mind.

234
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,110
What is it? Hey.

235
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,950
What made you do these things
you've never done before?

236
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,320
What's wrong?
Is your business not going well?

237
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,090
- Yun Hee, it's Ms. Kang.
- No.

238
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,090
You need to leave.

239
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,790
Yun Hee.

240
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,500
Why do you want to kick out...

241
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,060
that poor woman who lost her son
and is now alone?

242
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,240
She's a stranger. Yes.

243
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,370
She's a total stranger.

244
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,670
How is she a stranger?

245
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,610
We're family if we eat together
and sleep under the same roof.

246
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,710
I'm sure you also felt that
our home became much warmer...

247
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,880
ever since she moved in.

248
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,180
Above all,
Bo Ram adores her like a mother,

249
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,520
and she doesn't seem
depressed anymore.

250
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,190
She shows such a big smile.
Aren't you grateful for her?

251
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,890
I also feel like
the emptiness of losing Do Hee is...

252
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,490
slowly healing,
thanks to her presence.

253
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,100
She needs a place to live,

254
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,230
and we need her.

255
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,200
Jeez.

256
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,440
She's not overly sensitive
or particular.

257
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,440
She's gentle, kind, and friendly.

258
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,280
When I first met her,
I even wanted her as my daughter-in-law.

259
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,550
I understand what you want.

260
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,650
Are you sure you understand?

261
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,060
Understanding and accepting are
two different things.

262
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,290
Will you be like this, Oh Seong?

263
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,830
You should get ready to open.

264
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,060
I have to be somewhere, too.

265
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,930
Will you come home tonight?

266
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,600
I'll see.

267
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,040
Bye, then. You should get to work.

268
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,980
What's he going to do now?

269
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,260
I need two cups of cold water.

270
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,790
I've been too busy,
but I meant to ask you...

271
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,530
about your aunt.

272
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,030
You said you didn't have any family.

273
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,800
She isn't my immediate family.

274
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,000
We stayed in touch from time to time
after my mom passed,

275
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,840
but we had lost touch
after I went to America with you.

276
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,340
You and Ji Ho are...

277
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,740
my only family.

278
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,220
Of course, Mother, Gi Man,
and Na Ra are technically family,

279
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,620
but that's what I think.

280
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,520
Anyway, even Kang Seung Woo is...

281
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,860
making my life harder
after Jae In came.

282
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:23,230
He gets even more furious
when I make her get my coffee.

283
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,860
They're half-siblings,
but blood is still thicker than water.

284
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,730
The same would apply
to Director Kang Mi Ran, too.

285
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,940
She may be on our side now,

286
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,640
but she can always change her mind
as Jae In's aunt.

287
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,610
We're working together
only for the time being...

288
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,240
because we're after the same thing.

289
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,820
Na Ra! We aren't at home.

290
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,290
If you're going to be my secretary,
do your job right.

291
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Whatever. I'm annoyed to death.

292
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,130
You still can't do this
even if you're annoyed.

293
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,260
Quit right away
if you don't want to work.

294
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,230
You don't even know anything!

295
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,370
It's her first time working.

296
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,640
Na Ra, is something bothering you?

297
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,070
Did someone say something?

298
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,240
You can talk to me
if something's bothering you.

299
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,810
Well, it's...

300
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,720
Gi Chan, do you remember Geum Ja?

301
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,080
How would I know her?

302
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,460
Geum Ja? The employee
who worked at the clinic?

303
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,220
Yes, the thing is,

304
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,190
she was Jae In.

305
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,060
What are you talking about?

306
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,830
I'm saying Geum Ja wasn't Geum Ja.

307
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,430
She was really Jae In. Kang Jae In.

308
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,000
She disguised herself
and deceived me.

309
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,210
I knew something was odd
the first time I met her.

310
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,610
Do you remember what I said to you?

311
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,480
My gut feelings were right.

312
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,410
I was happy that I made a friend.

313
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,110
Darn it.

314
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,320
Na Ra, did you say anything
to Geum Ja...

315
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,590
No, I mean, to Jae In?

316
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,820
Like what?

317
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,960
About you two?

318
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
I don't know anything
to share with her.

319
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,830
Get out.

320
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,260
Go out and do your job.

321
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,230
Dang it. Jeez.

322
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,040
Jae In had been
keeping her eyes on us...

323
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,470
in this company.

324
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,510
Dr. Kim must've known
she was Jae In.

325
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,110
They already knew each other,

326
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,410
so he had to know.
Don't you think so?

327
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,950
I don't like how Dr. Kim works here,

328
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,450
and I think it's fishy
that Jae In is...

329
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,090
siding with him.

330
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,520
Will you let them do this?

331
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,290
Give me some time.

332
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,600
Please, Father.

333
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,500
Please let me
talk to Yu Gyeong just once.

334
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,870
She's at your place, right?

335
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,570
She won't see me at her office
or pick up her phone.

336
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,670
This is killing me.

337
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,480
She's never been like this,

338
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,110
so she must have a reason
for acting like this.

339
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,310
What is it?

340
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,980
Why did you two get into a fight?

341
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,750
Well, it's...

342
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,320
It wasn't a big deal.

343
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,620
That's the thing
with a married couple.

344
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,660
Everyone gets into a fight
over how you take off your socks.

345
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,960
That soft-hearted girl
wouldn't have left home...

346
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,730
if it was that trivial.

347
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,460
You can't do away with this
just by evading my question.

348
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,800
This is between you two,

349
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,730
so you two must
resolve the situation first.

350
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,270
She won't even pick up my calls.

351
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,200
You can't even tell me
why you two got into a fight,

352
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,510
so what can I do?

353
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,140
I had to leave shortly
during the busy hour. Bye.

354
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,480
Father.

355
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,110
Come on!

356
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,890
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

357
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,220
Thank you.

358
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,030
Excuse me.

359
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,660
Here's your food.

360
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,070
- Enjoy.
- We'd like to pay.

361
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,300
Yes, coming!

362
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,140
Just take it easy.

363
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,510
- Let me ring you up. Thanks.
- Please.

364
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,510
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

365
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,310
Ma'am, you gave me
more than you owed me.

366
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,010
I'm so out of it.

367
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,950
Thank you. Come again.

368
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,990
Another bottle of cola, please.

369
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,460
Coming!

370
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,690
More beer, please.

371
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,230
- Sure.
- A bottle of soju, too.

372
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,760
Soju, beer, and cola. Okay.

373
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,740
Goodness.

374
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,240
That was like war.

375
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,740
Good work.

376
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,550
I've made so many mistakes
in calculation. I never do that.

377
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,790
I also got the tables confused
many times today.

378
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,260
Something must be bothering you.

379
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,190
It also seems like
something is on your mind.

380
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,860
It's my grown younger brother.

381
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,800
He's not acting like himself,

382
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,830
and I don't know what he's thinking.

383
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,240
My daughter is
staying with me right now.

384
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,640
She must've gotten into a fight
with her husband.

385
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,310
I asked, but she wouldn't tell me.

386
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,380
My daughter was never like this, either,
so I became concerned.

387
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,950
They're still a young couple.

388
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,790
They're bound to fight
many times at that age.

389
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,520
It may be better for her to blow up
than to keep it all inside.

390
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,190
You should trust her
and give her time.

391
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,300
I'm sure your brother
also has a good reason.

392
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,030
Men are like that.

393
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,070
Actions come before their words.

394
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,970
You should give him some time.

395
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,470
Yes.

396
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,680
We're the good ones,
so let's stay patient and wait.

397
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,320
I've been thinking
for the last few days...

398
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,020
about hiring another part-timer.

399
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,690
The business is going well,
so we're facing lots of rushes.

400
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,060
I'm away at times
to look after Bo Ram,

401
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,690
so I thought we should have
another helping hand around.

402
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:01,260
Then, may I recommend someone?

403
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,240
Darn it.
I'm sick of eating takeout food.

404
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,010
It's full of MSG.

405
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,340
There's no point
in trying to lose weight.

406
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,810
It's all coming back.

407
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,510
Mom, look at my face.

408
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,080
I'm breaking out badly
after eating just instant food.

409
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,120
I told you to hire a housekeeper.

410
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,450
I can't just throw money away.

411
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,250
My precious son, the chairman,
worked so hard to make that.

412
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,790
And we all have a very classy taste.

413
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,530
No one can make something
good enough for us.

414
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,600
Why not, Mother?
You just have to look.

415
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,170
I know
you just don't want to do chores.

416
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,570
You don't care
about wasting your husband's money.

417
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,200
Mom, so when is
Yu Gyeong coming back?

418
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,570
I miss her food.

419
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,040
She was a shrewd girl
who did a great job...

420
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,940
at cooking and housekeeping.

421
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,850
Yes, that must be
why she's a family physician.

422
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,990
Hey, my wife didn't get certified
only to make food for you.

423
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,520
So, your mighty wife,
who's a doctor,

424
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,290
still ignores your call
and refuses to see you?

425
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,890
She read my message today.

426
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,000
She didn't even read it
until yesterday,

427
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,330
but today, she left me on read.

428
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,430
And you're proud of that? Jeez.

429
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,700
Anyway, that means
she also wants to return soon.

430
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,540
All right, then.

431
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,140
I'll escort my daughter-in-law,
who's a doctor, back home.

432
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,350
I reviewed everything on the file.

433
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,150
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

434
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,620
Good work. You may leave.

435
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,230
Did you want to see me?

436
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,970
I need you to find something.

437
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,370
The employee who died in an accident
was named Kim Do Hee, right?

438
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,870
Can you find the contact information
and address of her bereaved family?

439
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,910
Yes, ma'am.
I'll find out and report back.

440
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,450
Also, do you know where
Director Choi Ja Young is staying?

441
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,850
No, ma'am. Should I find out?

442
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,780
No, it's all right. You may leave.

443
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,080
Yes, ma'am.

444
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,690
Right. CEO Patrick Jung
of DH Holdings is here.

445
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,830
- The CEO came here himself?
- Yes, ma'am.

446
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,730
He's in a meeting with the chairman.

447
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,170
As you already know,
I can't make a reckless investment.

448
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,940
So, the process is
quite complicated.

449
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,840
Yes, of course, it should be.

450
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,980
I'm not sure if YL Group would be
able to meet our conditions.

451
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,280
We'll do our best to do so.

452
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,350
Just the fact that we received
an investment from DH Holdings...

453
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,620
would give a renewed image...

454
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,350
to YL Group within the industry.

455
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,730
Now, this is
a draft of the contract.

456
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,500
I believe you need...

457
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,970
flexible thinking and spirited drive
for a corporation to make a leap.

458
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,310
You wish to participate
in our overall operation,

459
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,640
including strategy planning
and even the design?

460
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,310
It's an outdated idea
to want to see an outcome...

461
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,250
just by investing money.

462
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,220
I've been hiring experts
in many different fields.

463
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,720
I plan to implement them one by one
as soon as our deal is sealed.

464
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,390
It'll provide a way...

465
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,660
for us to handle risks
as soon they break out.

466
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,500
I apologize,
but I can't make this decision alone.

467
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,700
Why don't we set up another meeting
after I discuss this with my board?

468
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,710
Let's do that.

469
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,070
However, time is money to me.

470
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm not the type
who waits patiently,

471
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,510
so I may end up finding
another gold mine.

472
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,180
I'll return with an answer
as soon as possible.

473
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,260
I heard the CEO
of DH Holdings was here,

474
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,230
so I came to meet you. Hello.

475
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,400
Then, goodbye.

476
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,610
He doesn't like
to make himself known,

477
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,780
so he avoids meeting outsiders
as much as possible.

478
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,480
Please do understand.

479
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,780
You can meet him
once the investment is sealed.

480
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,170
I tried to call you many times,
but I couldn't.

481
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,770
I'm so sorry.

482
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,610
I don't plan to return home...

483
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,340
until you leave that place.
Do you understand?

484
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,880
Is that all?

485
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,720
Please give me...

486
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,880
just a little more time.

487
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:53,520
I considered leaving immediately,

488
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,660
but I was concerned
about Bo Ram and Ms. Jung.

489
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,730
I don't want to hurt them even more.

490
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,370
I'll explain myself before I leave.

491
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,430
Stop saying something
you don't even mean.

492
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,540
You practically hurt them already.

493
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,070
What if they find out
who you really are much later?

494
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,140
Who's going to deal with that?

495
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm sorry.

496
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,980
I don't need your apology.

497
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,580
Just thinking about the fact...

498
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,790
that you came and stayed at my place
as if nothing had happened...

499
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,790
gives me the creeps,
so leave the place. Please.

500
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,140
You already know...

501
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,770
how precious Yu Gyeong is to me.

502
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,710
Is that so?

503
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,850
Of course.

504
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,980
I treat her like
she's my biggest treasure.

505
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,220
And what else?
Like flowers in a vase...

506
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,490
No, that's not it.
Like a bird in a birdcage?

507
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,830
No, that's not it, either. It was...

508
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,060
Well. Yes.
Like she's an overly sheltered girl.

509
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:10,570
I support her
like she's an overly sheltered girl.

510
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,240
You won't let them
get divorced like this, right?

511
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,710
Yu Gyeong always does
everything you say,

512
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,580
so please talk to her
and send her back home.

513
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,990
They're both adults.

514
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,590
I don't think
the parents should meddle with this.

515
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,360
They should figure this out
by themselves.

516
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,330
Thank you for the tea.

517
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,200
Mr. Do!

518
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,270
Darn it. That uptight man.

519
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,940
Yu Gyeong is also uptight
because she took after him.

520
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,150
Hey, I don't think
Yu Gyeong will come home,

521
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,550
so come home early and make dinner.

522
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,350
Mother, this is bad.

523
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,090
Jae In is going around at work...

524
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,120
speaking ill of Gi Chan.

525
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,020
She called him shameless
for having an affair...

526
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,320
and that he doesn't deserve
to be the chairman.

527
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,790
She even demanded
that he stepped down now.

528
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,600
What did you say?
I'll destroy that brat.

529
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,240
Mother, did you think
I married him to do chores?

530
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,170
I'm not Do Yu Gyeong.

531
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,910
Gosh, this is so heavy.

532
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,180
I brought everything you asked for.

533
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,220
Hey, I guess thieves
break into just about any place.

534
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,290
My place was robbed, too.

535
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,530
It must've been shocking.

536
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,860
I mean, there's nothing to steal.

537
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,300
I don't have anything
like jewelry or money.

538
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,900
The thief
only made a mess out of my place.

539
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,970
How am I going to clean that up?

540
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,240
Are you sure you don't have
anything else that belongs to me?

541
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,480
Yes, I'm telling you.

542
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,850
If you want to keep getting pocket money,
don't ever return here.

543
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,420
Okay, girl.

544
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,790
Why did you want to see me?

545
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,260
I wanted to apologize.

546
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,300
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

547
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,600
I found someone to work with me,
and it turned out to be Ms. Kang.

548
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,670
I just thought it'd be awkward...

549
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,110
for you two to run into each other
while she worked here.

550
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,110
Let me treat you to a cup of coffee
as an apology. What do you say?

551
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,310
Fine. I want caramel macchiato.

552
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,820
All right. By any chance,
did you tell the chairman...

553
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,890
about Ms. Kang?

554
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,920
No, nothing at all.

555
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,660
Let's get the coffee.

556
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,130
I couldn't believe it,
but you were really here.

557
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,300
- Have you been well?
- No, I haven't been well.

558
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,770
How dare you gossip
about my precious chairman?

559
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,040
An affair?

560
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,540
You two were divorced
and had become strangers.

561
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,150
How dare you yap about him?

562
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,380
You should know your place
now that your family got ruined.

563
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,080
Why are you acting up like this?

564
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,790
How dare you go inside?

565
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,290
How dare you come here?

566
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,990
- What are you doing?
- You can't get past me.

567
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,390
- Mom!
- Let go of me!

568
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,900
Mom, you need to stop!

569
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,230
Please!

570
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,940
Hey, let go of her!

571
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,540
How dare you pull out
my precious girl's hair?

572
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,710
Let go of her now!

573
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,170
I won't let go of her
if you don't let go of me first.

574
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,640
Mom, help me! That hurts!

575
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,450
- Let go of me!
- Hey!

576
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,050
Come on, Jae In!

577
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,780
Darn it.

578
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,790
I'm going to sue you.

579
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,420
Go ahead.

580
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,120
I'll counter that.

581
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,060
What? Darn it.

582
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,930
Have you lost your mind?

583
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,760
I have nothing more to lose.

584
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,030
But it's different for you,
Ms. Noh Sook Ja.

585
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,630
You just went on a power trip
because your son was the chairman.

586
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,870
This will have an impact on him
if the word gets around.

587
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,140
That's exactly what I wanted.

588
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,540
You little...

589
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,580
Who are you?

590
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,880
Do you know who I am?
How dare you meddle with me?

591
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,950
Get away from me.

592
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,820
Mom, you need to stop.

593
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,180
You must be the chairman's mother.

594
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,950
Your behavior seemed irrational,
so I had to step in.

595
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,190
What are you all doing?

596
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,090
Goodness, Mr. Chairman.

597
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,130
This brat and this punk are...

598
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,060
trying to kill your old mother.

599
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,330
- Mother.
- My son. Mr. Chairman.

600
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,640
- This is an injustice.
- Please calm down.

601
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,800
Take her with you.

602
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,570
- Mother, let's go home.
- Mom.

603
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,510
What's with you? Let's go.

604
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,880
Let's go.

605
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,180
Goodness! It's her fault!

606
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,220
Is this fun for you?

607
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,890
That's what I want to ask.

608
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,460
Does it look like I'm having fun?

609
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,860
All right.

610
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,770
Go ahead
and continue to act up, Jae In.

611
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,470
No, should I call you Geum Ja?

612
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,970
You and Kim Do Yun
made a fool out of me.

613
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,410
I should return the favor, right?

614
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,910
Look forward to it.

615
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,190
(Queen's House)

616
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,960
I'm sorry.

617
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,330
Forget it. Get up.

618
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,130
If you tell me to go die,
I'll kill myself.

619
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,970
Yu Gyeong, I can't live without you.

620
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,900
It wasn't Jae In's fault.

621
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,870
It's not even her fault,
so why are you harsh on her?

622
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,970
I'm disappointed in you.

623
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,610
Did you send this?

624
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,450
Se Ri, is Chairman Hwang Gi Chan...

625
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,150
your second husband?

626
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,920
Or are you two-timing him,
just like your current husband does?
