1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,680
I'm not sure if you remember her.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,150
You two had met at our wedding.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,420
I told you that
I recently met one of my friends.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,520
It was her, Se Ri.

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,460
Hello.

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,130
Yes, hello.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,360
It's great to meet you.

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,730
Anyway, you must've been
quite surprised to see me.

12
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,040
Have a seat, honey.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,310
I didn't tell him
this was a couples' night.

14
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,310
He doesn't like to meet
lots of new people.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,720
Honey, you must be hungry.

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,720
Excuse me.

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,240
You're home early.

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,310
I am.
I haven't been feeling well lately.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,020
Should I call Dr. Park?

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,650
No, it's all right.
It's just business.

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,090
I was just too concerned.

22
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,030
Is something bad going on?

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,030
Well, it's Director Do.

24
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,800
Never mind. It's just business.

25
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,270
You don't have to ask anymore.

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,640
Where's Jae In?

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,870
She went out with Gi Chan
for an engagement.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,880
Is Seung Woo home?

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,380
What did he say
about his life at work?

30
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,480
Did he say anything to you?

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,680
Do you want Seung Woo
to succeed as the chair of YL Group?

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,490
Why not?

33
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,190
I'm against it.

34
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,630
I thought you'd be for it.

35
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,560
It's different
when it comes to work.

36
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,630
He doesn't know anything.

37
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,170
He has no idea how this world works,

38
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,000
and all he cares about is partying.

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,540
How can you leave behind
your huge business to him?

40
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,140
That's why I'm telling him
to start learning.

41
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,110
If he could learn this quickly
in a short while,

42
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,680
I wouldn't have been against it.

43
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,050
There's too much responsibility
in that position.

44
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,750
Seung Woo doesn't have
the mental strength to handle it.

45
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,120
He's only like that
because you overprotect him.

46
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,820
It's not too late for you
to bring him up as a strong man,

47
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,830
so just ignore everything
and keep an eye on him.

48
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,360
How can I do that?

49
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,060
If the company takes a toll,

50
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,770
Seung Woo would break apart
before the business.

51
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,870
I don't want my son
to live such a difficult life.

52
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,410
Also...

53
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,340
What else?

54
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,410
Well, actually,

55
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,880
he spent a night out a few days ago,
and I got worried.

56
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,420
It turned out that
he had slept in his car.

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,620
It seemed like
he drove under the influence.

58
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,320
What did you say?

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,030
This punk
still isn't in his right mind.

60
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,360
Call him
and tell him to come home now.

61
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,260
Pretend like you never heard it.

62
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,270
I already had a talk with him.

63
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,200
How can I pretend like
I never heard it?

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,300
What if he had caused an accident?

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,270
Forget that
he would've hurt himself.

66
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,710
He could've hurt an innocent life!

67
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,810
That's not all!

68
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,210
If his case got covered
on the front page of the newspaper,

69
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,010
it could've brought
my business down with him!

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,820
Don't get mad at him.

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,450
I can never tell you anything
because you always react like this.

72
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,190
Wouldn't it be better if Jae In...

73
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,860
took over your position?

74
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,770
And not Gi Chan?

75
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,470
I haven't accepted him
as a part of our family.

76
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,510
Do you still disapprove of him?

77
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,380
He's our family now.

78
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,940
He'll be a stranger
if she divorces him.

79
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,180
How can you trust him enough
to hand over your huge business?

80
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,220
It's because I'm still uncertain.

81
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,990
You watched him closely...

82
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,430
as he dedicated his life to Jae In.

83
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,060
You wouldn't know.

84
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,500
What?

85
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,770
Anyway, whoever succeeds YL Group
must be one of the Kangs.

86
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,270
It would've been great
if your husband could join us.

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,870
It's such a shame.
I really wanted to meet him.

88
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,710
He forgot that
he had a previous engagement.

89
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,380
He said it was something important,
so he took a rain check on us.

90
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,250
We should meet together next time.

91
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,980
I want you to meet him, too.

92
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,420
All right.

93
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,490
Honey.

94
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,730
- Yes?
- He must be bored.

95
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,410
Oh, my. Se Ri.

96
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,970
I have that necklace, too.

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
My gosh. I just realized that.

98
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,850
Where did you get it?

99
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,320
Well, he gave it to me as a present.

100
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,550
Really? Mine was
also a present from my husband.

101
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,420
Goodness, really?

102
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,160
It was because
he did something wrong.

103
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,860
He tried to avoid talking about it
by giving me a gift.

104
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,000
Did you also do something wrong?

105
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,470
There's nothing like that.

106
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,510
Jeez.

107
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,820
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

108
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,850
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,620
What do we do?

110
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,020
It's awfully stained.

111
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,360
Please excuse me for a moment.

112
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,970
What do you think you're doing?

113
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,840
She wanted to do a couples' night,
so I came.

114
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,400
Is this your idea of a joke?

115
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,240
It's not funny.

116
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,810
It's not funny for me, either.

117
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,140
My husband is...

118
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,280
sitting with another woman
like he's her husband.

119
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,320
Do you think
that's easy to deal with?

120
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,180
You must've forgotten,

121
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,320
but we got married in America.

122
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,720
I'm also your wife.

123
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,290
Don't forget that.

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,570
It was such an unsatisfactory meal
without any dishes I liked.

125
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,270
Bring me some fruit
to refresh my appetite.

126
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,500
Yes.

127
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,070
Didn't you hear what I just said?

128
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,710
Bring me the fruit first
before you wash the dishes.

129
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,310
Mom, your favorite soap opera,

130
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,750
"My In-Laws' House" is on air.

131
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,280
You should go and watch it.
I'll bring it over soon.

132
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,650
Yes, I almost missed it.

133
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,820
I didn't get to watch it yesterday.

134
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,660
The female lead's mother-in-law is
the most evil woman in this world.

135
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,860
She keeps going after
her daughter-in-law.

136
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,630
My gosh. Something like that
only happens in dramas.

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,930
There can't be a mother-in-law
who's as evil as her.

138
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,600
- It's about to begin.
- Yes, right.

139
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,880
You can give those to me.
I'll do it.

140
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,750
Forget it. Your mother will
get mad at me if she sees you.

141
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,150
- If I catch you...
- Look at her.

142
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,720
Jeez. She's dying to make
her daughter-in-law miserable.

143
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,860
My gosh. A woman like her...

144
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,430
deserves to get her hair
pulled out. Jeez.

145
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,300
Hey, bring me water.

146
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
Was it you?

147
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,100
- Did you talk to my wife?
- Look at them.

148
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,840
I must've gone crazy
for a little bit.

149
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,040
I was out of my mind.

150
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,270
I'm so sorry.

151
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,240
Take this to her.

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,580
If I do something like that again,

153
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,780
I'll call myself your son.

154
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,720
She can't even have kids.
How can you be her son?

155
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,080
Mom.

156
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,790
Why? What I said wasn't wrong.

157
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,960
A man needs to have children
to get more attached to his family...

158
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,730
and start acting like a decent guy.

159
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,330
But your husband got
addicted to alcohol...

160
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,630
and began to talk
about foolish dreams.

161
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,560
Do you know whose fault that is?

162
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,270
It's yours.

163
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,800
Mother, what kind
of absurd reasoning is that?

164
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,400
It's not convincing.

165
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,440
How shameless.

166
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,770
You're about to put an end
to this family's heritage.

167
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,880
Absurd reasoning?

168
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,780
My second daughter-in-law
had no trouble having a son.

169
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,780
Why can't you have one?

170
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,110
Mom, that's enough.

171
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,250
Why are you taking out
your anger on her?

172
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,090
Yes, Mom.
You need to stop minding them.

173
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,550
These days, many married couples
choose not to have kids.

174
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,860
It's tough to raise them.

175
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,320
- It's better for them to live...
- Stop talking nonsense.

176
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,990
What kind of crazy talk is this?

177
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,400
Of course, they need to have kids
once they get married.

178
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,030
Are you trying to ruin our family?

179
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,630
Mom, let's talk outside.

180
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,800
We can talk outside.

181
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,870
What's with you? Let go of me.

182
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,900
I need to listen to what she says.

183
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,640
- Let go of me.
- Goodness, let's talk outside.

184
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,870
Yu Gyeong, you saw that
I was on your side, right?

185
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,210
I got this for you.

186
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,650
It's really delicious.

187
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,250
You can have it.

188
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm tired, so I need some rest.

189
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,820
Darn it. What is this?

190
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,520
My mom ruined everything.

191
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,460
I got this to ask her...

192
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,990
to set me up with Kim Do Yun.

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,830
He was surreal.

194
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,530
Surreally handsome.

195
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,870
Come and have some fruit.
Come out, everyone.

196
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,640
- What about Bo Ram?
- She's asleep.

197
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,010
Gosh.

198
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,180
My goodness.

199
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,450
Do your legs hurt?

200
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,750
My business was booming today,
so I must've overworked myself.

201
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,190
I'm feeling some throbbing pain.

202
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,630
Gosh, I told you
not to overwork yourself.

203
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,390
You need to consider your age.

204
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,430
Mom, you should try this.

205
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,460
What's that?

206
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,070
It was recommended
by a professor I know,

207
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,230
and I thought of you.

208
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,770
Someone who must
move around busily at work...

209
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,240
must look after themselves
before anything happens.

210
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,910
Okay.

211
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,280
I'll keep it in my room
and take it every single day.

212
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,150
Thanks.

213
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,420
What are you waiting for? Dig in.

214
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,780
- Okay.
- Yes.

215
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,820
When will you two move out?

216
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,530
You should get married.

217
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,560
Instead of us,
why don't you set an example first?

218
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,870
Bo Ram would love to have a grandpa.

219
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,570
You're not getting any younger,

220
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,400
so you should find someone nice.
Don't you think so?

221
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,270
Yes, I totally agree with him.

222
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,840
Mom, there's someone I know.
Should I set you up with him?

223
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,710
Good grief. Forget it.

224
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,780
Stop worrying about me,
and worry about yourselves.

225
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,950
I could always get married
if I set my mind to it.

226
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,550
Why are you two laughing?

227
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,860
There are many guys
who try to hit on me.

228
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,730
It's just that
I don't care for them.

229
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,660
My standards are as high as my nose.

230
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,230
Do Yun, I don't think
her nose is that high.

231
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,600
It's pretty low.

232
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,000
Is it? Let me take a look.

233
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,140
It is. Her nose job will cost a lot.

234
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,870
What? What's with you two?

235
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,540
Who do you think you took after...

236
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,580
and were born
with those pretty faces?

237
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,280
- Who?
- Your DNA is...

238
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,950
all right in here.

239
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,460
Why? It's true.

240
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,720
- Here?
- Yes, it's true.

241
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,320
You're right. Thanks.

242
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,300
Mom! Good evening.

243
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,800
Be quiet. Your father is asleep.
Don't wake him.

244
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,930
- Have you had dinner?
- Yes.

245
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,440
Hey, Aunt Mi Ran.

246
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,910
Hey, welcome home. You're late.

247
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,570
You haven't been drinking again,
have you?

248
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,110
Sniff me.

249
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,710
You can't smell anything, right?

250
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,480
Don't make me so concerned.

251
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,880
Do not take your car
if you plan to drink.

252
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,550
If you do that again...

253
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,520
I won't make you worry, Mom.

254
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,120
So, that's the end of the nagging.

255
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,420
- Go upstairs and wash up.
- Okay.

256
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,400
That was such a lovely moment.
I'm jealous.

257
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,470
This is why people say
we should have children.

258
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,800
But people also say
your life is easier without them.

259
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,370
I have only two children,

260
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,040
but I'm always facing trouble.

261
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,140
Don't you hate them for it?

262
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,180
I would, if I were you.

263
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,380
You can't bring up children
with that kind of attitude.

264
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,210
They're all my children.

265
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,220
Thank you, Ja Young.

266
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,280
For what?

267
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,550
You've gone through lots of trouble
after you married the Kang family.

268
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,990
My mom and dad
would've thanked you...

269
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,390
if they were still with us.

270
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,060
- Hey.
- We're back.

271
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,570
- Mom, what about Eun Ho?
- He's asleep.

272
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,630
You should tuck him in again.

273
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,170
I need to see you, Gi Chan.

274
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,950
Gi Chan.

275
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,050
Do you remember
the promise you made me?

276
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,920
It's great to meet you.
My name is Hwang Gi Chan.

277
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,270
(Cashier's Check)

278
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,770
You don't have to mind me
and put down a small amount.

279
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,140
I'm pretty much paying you
in return for my daughter,

280
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,580
so you may write down
however much you want.

281
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,950
In return,

282
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,280
you will leave her
without another word.

283
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,320
How much...

284
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,820
do you think Jae In is worth?

285
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,760
That's a foolish question,
but let me answer that.

286
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't put a price on my child.

287
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,300
I feel the same way.

288
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,270
I can't put a price on Jae In.

289
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,840
You can get an amount
you'll never make in this life.

290
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,510
But I could enjoy even more...

291
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,010
if I took Jae In.

292
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,780
I'd be lying
if I said I didn't care about money.

293
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,320
But I never wanted
to win the lottery, either.

294
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,260
I may seem like
just another prosecutor,

295
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,090
but I can make a living by myself.

296
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,930
Don't be deluded into thinking
we're all equal just because...

297
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,530
we live under the same sky
and breathe the same air.

298
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,240
People are
all born into their places.

299
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,070
And Jae In is...

300
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,010
too good for the place you're in.

301
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,310
You need to give up
while I'm still nice to you.

302
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,510
May I ask you a question?

303
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,520
Do you believe it is right...

304
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,320
for a parent to commodify
their child...

305
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,850
without regarding...

306
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,920
that child's emotions and opinions?

307
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,090
My parents always prioritized
their children's happiness.

308
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,860
I want to show Jae In...

309
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,530
that kind of world.

310
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,240
I allowed you to marry her
because of what you said then.

311
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,310
I didn't care about anything...

312
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,410
except for my daughter,
Jae In's happiness.

313
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,940
Do you still feel the same way?

314
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,350
Yes.

315
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,280
My priority is Jae In's happiness.

316
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,050
I never forgive anyone...

317
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,050
who makes my daughter miserable.

318
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,120
And you aren't an exception.

319
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,030
That'll never happen.

320
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,760
I'll take your word for it.

321
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,670
But remember,

322
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,930
if that was a lie,
I'd never forgive you.

323
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,570
Yes.

324
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,540
Please do not forgive me.

325
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,290
What did my mom say?

326
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,060
The same thing she always says.

327
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,130
She told me to be good to you.

328
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,130
She overreacted again.

329
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,270
You must've felt offended.

330
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,370
She says that for our sake,
so I need to understand.

331
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,670
After all,
she's crazy for her daughter.

332
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,380
(Catherine)

333
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,950
Aren't you going to pick it up?

334
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,520
No, it's one of our subcontractors.

335
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,990
She's in America,
so she probably forgot what the time was.

336
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,960
Can you grab my underwear?
I need to shower.

337
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,320
Sure.

338
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,200
You were appointed as of today,

339
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,400
so put together a planning team...

340
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,540
and show me
what you can really do this time.

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,140
I've been
getting ready for it already.

342
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,240
You can look forward to it.

343
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,840
I'll also look forward to it.

344
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,620
I heard Director Do resigned.

345
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,050
Did something happen?

346
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,590
I must've been too trusting.

347
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,290
Don't ask anymore.

348
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,060
It'd feel reassuring without me.

349
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,660
I also considered putting
both of you in charge.

350
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,870
What do you mean?

351
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,270
I want to retire
within the next year.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,940
It felt sudden when you mentioned
you'd retire within 2 to 3 years.

353
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,510
What do you mean next year?

354
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,140
You're still in your prime.

355
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,380
I agree with Aunt Mi Ran.

356
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,920
My wife is the most important to me,

357
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,780
but I was always too preoccupied.

358
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,420
I've done some wrong things, too.

359
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
It's my turn
to make up for everything.

360
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,560
Please do your best so that I can...

361
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,300
put you two in charge and retire.

362
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,300
We'll run into each other
from time to time. It's nice to meet you.

363
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,940
Sure.

364
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,770
- It's nice to meet you.
- Sure.

365
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,410
She looks a lot like Catherine.

366
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,340
Is she not her?

367
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,380
Who are you?

368
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,250
She's a new designer
for the Planning and Design Team.

369
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,920
He's the director
of the Strategy Planning Department.

370
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,860
Hello.
My name is Kang Se Ri, a designer.

371
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,430
It's nice to meet you.

372
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,430
Sure. Keep up the good work.

373
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,700
Please excuse me, too.

374
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,210
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Sure.

375
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,850
Hello?

376
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,510
What do you think you're doing?

377
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,020
I'll meet you at the hotel at noon.

378
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,190
I'm sorry.
I have a previous engagement.

379
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,750
Let's talk again later.

380
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,330
Goodbye.

381
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,200
Redo your report
by the end of the day.

382
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,400
What?

383
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,440
It took me so long
to do this. Again?

384
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,010
The price, unit, and items
all do not match.

385
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,370
It's a complete mess.

386
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,040
Check everything thoroughly
and have it redone.

387
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,880
Wouldn't it be faster
if you did it yourself?

388
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,120
Mr. Kang, you said you wanted to be
the chairman someday.

389
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,320
Then, you need to figure out
how the business actually works.

390
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,990
This department is...

391
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,860
YL Group's brain and heart.

392
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,590
Remember that with your head
and heart as you work.

393
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,960
Yes.

394
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,100
Brain and heart.

395
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,170
Yu Gyeong.

396
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,010
I must've been out of my mind.

397
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,940
I'm sorry
for misunderstanding Gi Man.

398
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,250
Yu Gyeong, please take the flowers.

399
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,190
I forgot everything,

400
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,830
so you should do the same.

401
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,430
It's nothing good to remember,

402
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,830
so let's just forget everything.

403
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,670
Thank you, my sister-in-law.

404
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,770
Thank you so much.

405
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,910
These flowers are beautiful.

406
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,880
Thank you, Jae In.

407
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,740
Do you want to eat dinner together?

408
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,980
Sure.

409
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,650
One second.

410
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,620
Hey, Mom.

411
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,290
Aunt Mi Ran is
having a guest over tonight?

412
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,020
I'm sorry.
I wanted to eat dinner with you.

413
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,360
You can't help it
if you're going to have a guest.

414
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,130
Let's do it next time. Bye, then.

415
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,140
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

416
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,510
By any chance,
may I borrow your lipstick?

417
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,850
You look wonderful.

418
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,480
Do I?

419
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,090
I didn't want my children
to see me looking so sickly.

420
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,360
They'll also take pictures,

421
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,160
so I want to be remembered
with a lively face...

422
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,830
when they pull those out to see me.

423
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,130
That way, they won't feel as sad.

424
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,330
Thank you.

425
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,930
Sure.

426
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,640
Have a wonderful time
with your family,

427
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,310
and please stay strong.

428
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,440
You're a mother.

429
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,010
Thank you.

430
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,620
Wait, aren't you the man
who saved my son?

431
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,030
Hello.

432
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,230
How's your son doing?

433
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,660
Great, thanks to you.

434
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,560
Right. How's your arm?

435
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,970
How's the arm injury?

436
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,900
Wait, are you here because of that?

437
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,370
No, I'm fine.

438
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,680
Then, what brings you
to the hospital?

439
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,980
Well, it's...

440
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,450
It was great to see you.

441
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,680
Good luck with your son. Excuse me.

442
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,050
What?

443
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,450
Goodbye!

444
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,500
Goodness, welcome.

445
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,240
Welcome.

446
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,770
What should we eat?

447
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,440
And two colas, too.

448
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,610
Why does he keep staring at me?

449
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,980
This is why life can be tiring
when you're too pretty.

450
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,130
Do you have something to say?

451
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,600
You can stop staring and say it.

452
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,230
Well, it's...

453
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,200
No, I'm not interested.

454
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,340
So, please stop staring at me.

455
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,870
No, it's not that.

456
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,310
I'm a bit of a fashion geek, so...

457
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,780
That line is so ancient.

458
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,510
Are you saying my clothes
don't match my pretty looks?

459
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,020
Forget it. I've heard it all.

460
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,520
Your top is inside out.

461
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,220
I can see the labels
behind your neck and on your side.

462
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,260
Oh, no. My goodness.

463
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,370
Hey, Se Ri.

464
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,170
You were our guest?

465
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,180
I wanted to surprise you.

466
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,940
I invited her to dinner in secret.

467
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,780
Do you know her?

468
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,080
She's the designer I hired
for the Planning and Design Team...

469
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,180
and Jae In's friend.

470
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,750
Nice to meet you, Ms. Choi.

471
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,790
I see. Hello.

472
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,290
Is it because you're her friend?

473
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,220
You seem familiar.

474
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,030
She came to my wedding.

475
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,800
She's a friend from university.

476
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,760
Really?

477
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,770
So, she went to your university.

478
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,840
It's nice to meet you.

479
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,470
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

480
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,710
I'm so sorry.

481
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,380
Please forgive Jae In
just this once.

482
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,480
Please, I ask of you.

483
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,880
"Jae In?"

484
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,690
How dare she...

485
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,220
copy my daughter's name, too?

486
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,330
(Kang Jae In)

487
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,370
Come on in.

488
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,840
I haven't cleaned up my room.

489
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,370
It looks clean.

490
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,610
I thought it'd be fancier.

491
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,510
I like things
that are natural and simple.

492
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,740
This is where I get my rest.

493
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,820
I was worried
your mother would recognize me,

494
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,480
but she didn't.

495
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,390
It's been many years.

496
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,960
She probably doesn't remember.

497
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,290
Really? I still remember it
like it was yesterday.

498
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,530
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

499
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,600
You're home.

500
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,800
You remember Se Ri, right?

501
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,030
- She was...
- We met at the office.

502
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,100
We're meeting quite often today.

503
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Aunt Mi Ran
invited her over for dinner.

504
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,740
- Mommy.
- Yes?

505
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,540
Dinner is ready.
We have to go downstairs.

506
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,050
Okay.

507
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,950
Where's Seung Woo?

508
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,780
He had another engagement.

509
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,390
If it's nothing important,

510
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,160
tell him to be home
when we're having a guest.

511
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:24,190
That's what we consider
basic etiquette.

512
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,200
All right.

513
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,470
Don't be so hard on your son
in front of our guest.

514
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,370
So, you're Jae In's friend?

515
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,100
Please enjoy your meal.

516
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,570
Yes, and please speak
casually with me.

517
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,810
Yes, Dad. You can relax.

518
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,080
Yes, but today,

519
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,310
she was invited by Director Kang,
so maybe next time.

520
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,850
Gyu Cheol, we aren't at work.
We're home.

521
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,290
Don't call me a director.

522
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,490
Do you know...

523
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,490
what younger people call
people like you these days?

524
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,230
A boomer.

525
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,870
Eun Ho, have some beef
boiled down in soy sauce.

526
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,370
Honey, have some of this.

527
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,770
- What?
- It's your favorite.

528
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,170
It's good for our body,
so you can have it first.

529
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,970
Why are you giving this to me?

530
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,210
It was for you.

531
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,350
- It was yours...
- That's hot!

532
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,110
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

533
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,180
Oh, no.

534
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,090
I'm sorry.

535
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,490
I must've been a bit nervous.

536
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,720
Please excuse me.

537
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,460
It's all right.

538
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,560
I'll go alone.

539
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,060
But...

540
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,700
Mommy, this is really delicious.

541
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,640
Eun Ho, are you eating that again?

542
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,910
You're such a big piggy.

543
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,010
Look at your tummy.

544
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,810
Look.

545
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,220
You should've put down your phone
before you sat at the table.

546
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,090
It's from work.

547
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,830
I'll take it outside.

548
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,860
He bears the brunt of leadership,

549
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,400
so, of course, he must
always carry his cell phone.

550
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,300
I get it.

551
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,070
You should eat.

552
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,080
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

553
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,850
Come out.

554
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,320
I wonder what you and Jae In did...

555
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,490
in this bed.

556
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,650
What did you two do?

557
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,090
That's enough. You need to get up.

558
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,760
I think this room suits me.

559
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,030
I want to live in this house.

560
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,230
- What?
- I want to live with you...

561
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,770
in this house.

562
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,770
People say what you want desperately
will eventually come true.

563
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm desperate,

564
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,380
almost to the point of madness.

565
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,510
We'll talk later.

566
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,050
Let's go downstairs first.

567
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,520
Kiss me.

568
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,360
Se Ri.

569
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:09,660
If you love me, prove it...

570
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,390
right now.

571
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,840
Wait.

572
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,350
It could be better,

573
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,350
but you did a good job.

574
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,190
Yes!

575
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,620
Gosh, I was so scared
you'd make me do it again.

576
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,330
Do you want to eat dinner?
It's on me.

577
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,760
Next time.

578
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,960
You may leave first.

579
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,970
Okay. See you tomorrow,

580
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,070
Ms. Kim.

581
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,490
Is she having trouble finding it?

582
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,930
I'll go.

583
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,060
It's okay. I'm done.

584
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,130
I'll do it.

585
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,140
Is she close to Jae In?

586
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,840
It seemed so.

587
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,040
Then, why haven't I heard of her?

588
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,570
She returned to Korea recently
after living in America for a while.

589
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,340
Jae In asked to find her a job,

590
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,010
so I took her portfolio,
looked over it, and loved it.

591
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,250
That was why I hired her.

592
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,220
I didn't do it for her connection,
so don't worry.

593
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,750
No matter what it is, do a good job.

594
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,990
It's your first project
after returning to Korea,

595
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,060
so there will be high expectations
and many concerns at work.

596
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,030
Make sure you prove yourself.

597
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,560
I will.

598
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,270
Seung Woo must go out often
with his friends these days.

599
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,840
No.

600
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,900
Stop it.

601
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,370
Gyu Cheol.

602
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,510
He's still a young man
in his twenties.

603
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,480
Don't be so hard on him.

604
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,580
You're only making
Ja Young's life miserable.

605
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,020
Did you hear that?

606
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,270
She's not here.

607
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,510
- Mommy, I'll find Daddy.
- What?

608
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,950
Eun Ho, take your time.
You'll end up falling.

609
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,290
Daddy!

610
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,960
Eun Ho, is he in the room...

611
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,950
(Queen's House)

612
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,810
If you'll be like this,
let's just end it.

613
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:54,380
I don't need anything else.
Let's just end it.

614
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,420
Are you happy?

615
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,950
What?

616
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,490
Are you happy?

617
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,490
These are the files
regarding the dual contract.

618
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,230
I never thought...

619
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,240
I'd do something this indecent.

620
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,540
You must be Catherine.

621
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,940
How do you know my English name?
