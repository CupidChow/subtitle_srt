1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,410
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,310
Who put you up for this?

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,720
Mr. Hong and Hwang Gi Man.

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,920
Eun Ho's uncle, Hwang Gi Man.

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,990
Hwang Gi Man did that
to pay off his debt to Mr. Hong.

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,330
The two worked together
and designed everything.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,800
Our only sin is
that we worked as their pawns.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,900
Hwang Gi Man
went to Eun Ho's kindergarten...

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,870
and brought him to us himself.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,670
What is...

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,440
Mr. Hong's name?

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,250
Hong Man Su.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,720
Hong Man Su.

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,520
Man Su,

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,250
live a good life.

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,360
Yes, sir.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,320
You saved my life.

20
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,790
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

21
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,800
You have my loyalty.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,100
Watch what you say.

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,040
Gi Chan must've known everything.

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,940
Fine. Let's say Gi Man did it.

25
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,540
So what? Nothing happened.

26
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,210
Eun Ho is fine.

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:14,980
It wasn't Gi Man?

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,180
It wasn't him.

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,150
My goodness. We were the victims!

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,860
She must've thought
our family was such a joke.

31
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,060
Noh Sook Ja knew, too.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,430
Do you know...

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,030
who Hwang Gi Chan is?

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,870
He's Hwang Gi Man's younger brother.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,870
Yes, I heard he was the one
who told Mr. Hong...

36
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,240
that he'd handle everything...

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,510
if Hong told the police
we were behind everything.

38
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,420
Has Director Kang Mi Ran made
any moves yet?

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,030
Not yet, sir.

40
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,930
Find out where Kang Jae In lives.

41
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,170
Actually, Director Kang
already made me look into it.

42
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,710
How can I not know
something that she knows?

43
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,680
I didn't think it was important.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,050
Only I decide what's important.

45
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,750
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll report everything from now on.

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,580
Handle yourself wisely.

47
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,920
Or I'll end up wondering
if you really are on my side, Mr. Yoon.

48
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,020
Yes, sir. I'll remember that.

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,030
Speak.

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,060
Ms. Kang Jae In...

51
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,730
and Director Kim
of DH Holdings are...

52
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,130
living in the same house.

53
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,100
They live in the same house?

54
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,670
Are you saying they live together?

55
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,340
The address is the same as that
of the deceased Ms. Kim Do Hee,

56
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:52,810
so it must be Ms. Kim's family home.

57
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,420
What is Kim Do Yun after?

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,520
He already knows
Jae In is Choi Ja Young's daughter.

59
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,950
What was he thinking
when he approached her?

60
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,730
You may leave.

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,600
Hello, Detective Baek.
How did it go?

62
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,600
Have you found out
who uploaded the videos?

63
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,610
Come on in.

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,550
I came to ask you something.

65
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,520
Please ask.

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,160
I want to ask
about Eun Ho's kidnapping.

67
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,130
Was your husband
involved in that incident?

68
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,030
I don't know
what you're talking about.

69
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,670
Do you really not know?

70
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,600
Be honest with me.

71
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,240
I already told you. I don't know.

72
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,680
Who told you that?

73
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,980
The kidnapper.

74
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,480
He's serving his time,
and I visited him just now.

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,290
Hwang Gi Man was involved
in Eun Ho's kidnapping.

76
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,260
Dad!

77
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,830
You don't need to hide it anymore.

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,930
It gave you a hard time, too.

79
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,560
You knew about this?

80
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,870
Yes, I did.

81
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,410
I told you that
Hwang Gi Chan blackmailed me...

82
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,710
when he found out
the late chairman...

83
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,640
had made me dig
behind his back, right?

84
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,880
I found out at that time.

85
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,420
He said Gi Man kidnapped Eun Ho,

86
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,490
so Yu Gyeong would suffer
because she didn't know anything.

87
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,220
I couldn't bring myself to tell you.

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,260
I'm sorry, Jae In.

89
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,330
Why didn't you tell me?

90
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,400
You never said
that he blackmailed you.

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,230
That's not important.

92
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,270
My dad didn't do anything wrong.
It's all my fault.

93
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,310
I stopped him from telling you.

94
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,410
At first, I didn't know,

95
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,910
and when I found out later,
I still couldn't tell you.

96
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,620
I really felt humiliated...

97
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,790
on the day I knelt before you.

98
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,090
I dreaded...

99
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,060
bowing my head to you again...

100
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,400
because of my stupid husband,
even though I did nothing wrong.

101
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,730
So, did...

102
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,370
Gi Chan know?

103
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,540
At first, he didn't.

104
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,740
But he must've found out later.

105
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,180
My husband and Mother
got into a fight over that.

106
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,020
Jae In.

107
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,790
I must go.

108
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,930
You don't have to see me off.

109
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,840
Eun Ho.

110
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,950
I was...

111
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,980
I was too foolish...

112
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,220
to protect you.

113
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,550
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

114
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,330
I'm coming in, Jae In.

115
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,830
Jae In.

116
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,100
What's wrong?

117
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,400
Did Hwang Gi Chan
do something again?

118
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,410
Then, what is it?
Are you hurt? Are you in pain?

119
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,730
Both Hwang Gi Chan
and Hwang Gi Man are scumbags.

120
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,900
Where did he get the idea
to kidnap his nephew for money?

121
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,070
I knew something was suspicious.

122
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,210
I went to the police as a witness
when the kidnappers were caught,

123
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,250
but Hwang Gi Man claimed
they had arrested the wrong people.

124
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,050
I should've known then.

125
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,220
Hwang Gi Man had
Hong Man Su stage the kidnapping.

126
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,560
After that incident,
since that time,

127
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,160
Gi Chan and Hong Man Su
must've begun to work together.

128
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,400
What's your plan now?

129
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,070
Both Hwang Gi Chan
and Hong Man Su won't say anything.

130
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,670
You can't get them arrested
solely on the kidnappers' testimonies.

131
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,780
I won't let this go.

132
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,150
I won't.

133
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,330
It's not finished yet.

134
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,730
You can see it when it's done.

135
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,500
You know this brand is
our flagship product, right?

136
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,830
I do. That's why
I'm putting in lots of work.

137
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm trying to show individualism...

138
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,710
instead of uniformity
when people design their lifestyle.

139
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,740
I won't say anything else
because you said it was unfinished.

140
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,640
Are you sure
you can win against Jae In?

141
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,610
Don't you trust me?

142
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,650
I'll destroy her,
so look forward to it.

143
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,370
When did you get here?

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,610
I had mountains of explanations
to demand from you.

145
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,880
Why did you do that?

146
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,810
Why did you cause
that much pain in my life?

147
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,650
I know you did that
to keep the Kang family's secret,

148
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,220
but you should've told me...

149
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,860
Seung Woo was Mi Ran's son.

150
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,030
I resented you so much.

151
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,370
I loathed you to death.

152
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,470
It's all your fault.

153
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,410
You turned me into a murderer.

154
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,980
You need to be punished, not me!

155
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,350
This wasn't the kind of life
I wanted to live.

156
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,220
Everything fell apart.

157
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,960
That resentment in my heart was...

158
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,390
the only thing
that kept me going in life.

159
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,700
But I can't resent you...

160
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,900
or blame Seung Woo anymore.

161
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,370
Everything is meaningless now.

162
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,740
What am I going to do now?

163
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,810
How am I supposed to go on, honey?

164
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,700
I'm going to work, Mother.

165
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,570
Did you really go to high school
with Yu Gyeong?

166
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,610
Mother, I don't have much time.

167
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,010
Please talk to me directly
instead of beating around the bush.

168
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,450
"Directory?"
I don't get what you're saying.

169
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,420
I'm saying you're her friend.

170
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,920
You need to interfere
and persuade her...

171
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,890
not to divorce her husband.

172
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,590
Are you going to sit
and watch Gi Man become dejected?

173
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,760
Mother, I'm someone
who has a conscience.

174
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,670
How can I ask her
to live with Gi Man again?

175
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,570
You'll end up...

176
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,170
swearing right in my face
if you show any more honesty.

177
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,440
Do you think
this isn't your business?

178
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,180
You need to think wisely.

179
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,910
Who'll handle chores...

180
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,950
in this huge place
after Yu Gyeong gets divorced?

181
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,010
Can you do that?

182
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,320
She had already made up her mind,

183
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,190
so I was trying to say
I didn't think I could persuade her.

184
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,460
I'll meet her today
if I can find some time.

185
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,990
Goodness.

186
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,930
We'll make new windows soon,

187
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,970
so collect and gather
related references...

188
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,600
and share them
with the Investment and Development Team.

189
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,300
Yes, I'll do that.

190
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,810
You were in a meeting.
Please excuse me.

191
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,640
I have the draft
for additional investment...

192
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,840
to cover
research and development fees.

193
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,750
(YL Planning and Design)

194
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,410
I'll look over it
and schedule a meeting.

195
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,290
Were you discussing
new window products?

196
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,960
I've seen files
on YL's windows before.

197
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,560
The cross section was designed
to keep drafts out...

198
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,060
with improved airtightness.
Is that right?

199
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,630
Yes, that's right.

200
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,700
Then, how thick is the glass panel
on the outside?

201
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,800
Well, it's...

202
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,910
And I also saw
some eco-friendly windows.

203
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,180
What materials are used?

204
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,510
What was it? I knew what it was.

205
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,460
Did you interrupt our meeting
just to pick a fight?

206
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,620
I'm not picking a fight.
I'm simply checking...

207
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,360
if you're trustworthy
of your announcement...

208
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,000
when you said
you'd be the center of YL Group.

209
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,870
Seeing you can't even answer
these basic questions,

210
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,070
I'm starting to think
you just bluffed.

211
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,440
I was originally
with the Strategy Planning Team.

212
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,170
I haven't been with this team
for too long, so how would I know?

213
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,880
The glasses vary
between 28mm double-pane glass...

214
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,580
and 39mm triple-pane glass...

215
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,910
to add increased insulation.

216
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,880
Lead-free PVC is used
to make eco-friendly windows.

217
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,290
Why do I have such information
if I'm not even a part of this team?

218
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,620
Shouldn't you act like the owner
if you want to become one?

219
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,530
You should at least know
what's going on under your roof.

220
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:13,560
At this rate,
doesn't it seem like I have...

221
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,570
the mindset of YL's owner...

222
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,070
than you?

223
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,540
Let's call it a day.

224
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,870
Ms. Kang,
don't you have a meeting outside?

225
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,910
You should go.

226
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,740
Yes, I'll go straight home
when I'm done.

227
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,850
I need to talk to you, Mr. Jung.

228
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,350
Good luck.

229
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,060
Just wait, Patrick.

230
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,630
I'll make him go silent.

231
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,810
Stop glaring at me
and cut to the chase.

232
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,510
People will take it the wrong way...

233
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,910
if you keep
wanting to see me privately.

234
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,880
An unnecessary scandal
won't benefit any of us.

235
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,990
I don't want to get involved
with you again in this life.

236
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,690
That's also what I want.

237
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,020
So, why do you
keep messing with him?

238
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,490
Mr. Kang Seung Woo
hasn't been with us for long,

239
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,930
and he recently joined
the Planning and Design Team.

240
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,600
Why do you keep picking a fight
with someone who's still learning?

241
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,500
Is it picking a fight to ask a question
related to his work?

242
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,810
Seung Woo...

243
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,710
isn't someone
you can toy around with as you like.

244
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,450
He's one of the Kangs...

245
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,150
and the successor of YL Group.

246
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,350
I know he's your nephew,
but this isn't the Joseon era.

247
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,190
Do you still live
under a social class system?

248
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,320
You keep bringing up
that Kang family.

249
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,160
What's so special about that?

250
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,860
If you want to care
about your blood and family name,

251
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,700
emigrate to a country
where it still matters.

252
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,630
Are you still not over me?

253
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,670
Is that why you're rubbing me
the wrong way like a kid?

254
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,540
Stop talking nonsense.

255
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,280
I guess you're getting old, too.
You're starting to act ridiculous.

256
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,020
You suddenly came without calling.

257
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,260
Is something going on
with Jae In or Director Choi?

258
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,860
I came to tell you...

259
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,100
that I can no longer share
their information with you.

260
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,200
Yu Gyeong filed a divorce suit
against your brother.

261
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,710
It feels uneasy
for me to keep coming here.

262
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,480
You can't say this
without my permission.

263
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,280
Do you not care
if Jae In finds out...

264
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,620
you were my spy?

265
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,390
Remember that
only I can call off this deal.

266
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
You wouldn't want Yu Gyeong
to lose her friend, too.

267
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,960
Continue to keep an eye
on everything...

268
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,730
Director Choi and Jae In do.

269
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,500
All right.

270
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,010
There's something I want you to do
to re-establish the trust...

271
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,450
you almost tore apart.

272
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,890
- Gosh, please pick up.
- The person you have reached...

273
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,250
Please, Yu Gyeong.

274
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,320
You're telling me to die...

275
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,590
if you don't want to see me
and only talk through your attorney.

276
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,200
How can I live without you?

277
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,760
How long will you stay on the phone?

278
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,300
Are you not going
to run your business again?

279
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,600
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

280
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,440
Honey!

281
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,210
Darn it. Na Ra!

282
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,180
If you're at work, get to work.
Why are you calling me?

283
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,250
Darn it. I called to tell you
that I saw Yu Gyeong here.

284
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,950
She went to the Investment
and Development Team office.

285
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,280
I think she's here to meet Mr. Kim.

286
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,390
She ignored my call
and wouldn't even see me,

287
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,590
but went to see him instead?

288
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,260
I won't condone this.

289
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,560
Hey! Where are you going?

290
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,500
A statement from a third party?

291
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,700
Of course, I can do that.
It's nothing difficult.

292
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,100
Sure, I'll write one, too.

293
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,740
The more accounts you have,
the better.

294
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,870
Thank you so much, you two.

295
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,110
Hey, look at this.

296
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,010
You two are convincing my wife
not to pick up my calls!

297
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,780
Have you lost your mind?

298
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,120
How dare you come here?

299
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,050
Why? Did I come and interrupt you
from scheming with that sly punk...

300
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,420
for a way to betray me?

301
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,620
Hey, you punk. It looks like...

302
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,790
you must have a knack
for wrecking families.

303
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,660
Don't be ridiculous and leave.

304
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,790
This is my workplace.

305
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,000
Am I wrong?

306
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,130
At first, you hit on Jae In,

307
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,270
and now, you're convincing
my wife to divorce me!

308
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,730
That's enough.

309
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,900
You stay out of this.

310
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,110
I'm going to end this
once and for all with this punk.

311
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,380
You...

312
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,480
Darn it.

313
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,450
Let go of me. Let go!

314
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,720
You should be glad
that she didn't call the police!

315
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,890
What's with you? Darn it.

316
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,830
(YL Planning and Design,
Managing Director)

317
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,000
It's been so long
since we shared a laugh like this.

318
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,040
It's so nice.

319
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,880
Right?

320
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,110
I felt so stunned...

321
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,180
when you punched him.

322
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,420
Why did I put up with him like a fool
for all these years?

323
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,590
The idea of punching him
never even came to my mind.

324
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,960
I thought hiding
his true nature was...

325
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,160
the way to keep my petty pride.

326
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,900
That's why I couldn't tell you
even after finding out...

327
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,970
he kidnapped Eun Ho.

328
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,470
You were right.

329
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,410
I was the one who blamed others
for my misfortune.

330
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,310
The one
who made my life miserable...

331
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,620
was me.

332
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm sorry, Jae In.

333
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,260
I don't want to blame you
for anything.

334
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
Let's forget all about our past.

335
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,570
Let me know
if you need anything else...

336
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,330
for your divorce.

337
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,070
I'm here to help.

338
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,290
How dare you come here?

339
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,760
Why do you care if I'm here or not?

340
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,870
I'm here to see Yu Gyeong,
so fetch her for me.

341
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
Who do you think you are
to give me an order?

342
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,470
She's not here. Leave.

343
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,310
You don't even own this place,
so stop acting like you do.

344
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,410
Why are you here?

345
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,210
This is Yu Gyeong's father's place.

346
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,050
Why do you care?

347
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,850
Right, you must live off him,

348
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,120
like a parasite.

349
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,990
Parasite?
Is that all you have to say?

350
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,590
You never treated people...

351
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,260
who worked for you
like they were human.

352
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,660
But you now live off someone
you never deemed as human,

353
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,670
so how can I treat you like one?

354
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,800
Parasite seems like
the perfect word for you.

355
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,140
Stop laughing!

356
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,240
What do you think you know about me?

357
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,210
I know what you're like.

358
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,620
Don't you remember
how you treated me?

359
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,920
Don't you remember
how you treated my mom?

360
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,490
(Kang Jae In)

361
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,930
(Kang Jae In)

362
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,000
I wondered how you acted
like you were my daughter.

363
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,030
It was that
you didn't know your place...

364
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,030
and dared to name her
the same as my daughter.

365
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,640
Goodness, I'm so sorry.

366
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,310
I'm so sorry.

367
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,940
They say the dog acts like the owner
when the owner isn't around.

368
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,380
My housekeeper
must've thought I was a pushover.

369
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,610
Did I seem like a joke to you?

370
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,520
Goodness, no. No, Ms. Choi.

371
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,750
It's a misunderstanding.

372
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,630
I hoped she would grow up
as preciously as Ms. Jae In.

373
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,300
That was why I named her Jae In.

374
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,300
Yet she didn't know her place,

375
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,100
so she acted like my daughter
and conned others.

376
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,610
And if that wasn't enough,
she tried to frame my daughter, too?

377
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,340
A young girl like you should
know better than to scam people.

378
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,580
And you did that
under Jae In's name.

379
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,710
Do you have evidence I did that?

380
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,420
I have...

381
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,350
the private social media account
you made to act like my daughter.

382
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,660
It was something to see.

383
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,160
Not only did you extort money
from people whom you befriended there,

384
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,060
but you went to the department store
and shopped under her name.

385
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,070
Do you want me to go on?

386
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,000
You must be punished for your crime.

387
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,540
Expel her.

388
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,110
Wait, Ms. Choi! Jae In... No.

389
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:21,980
I'll pay for the consequences
instead of my daughter.

390
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,420
Please, Ms. Choi.
Please show her mercy this once.

391
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,050
I'm so sorry.

392
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,620
You need to say you're sorry!

393
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,490
Beg her for forgiveness. Now!

394
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,500
Do you want to ruin your life?

395
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,600
Say you're sorry now.

396
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,430
Now. Please.

397
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,530
No.

398
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,180
You told me
to always stay confident!

399
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,780
You told me never to lose my heart
even after I do something wrong!

400
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,620
It's all my fault.

401
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,690
I'll never let this happen again.

402
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,960
If I must lay a hand on her,
I'll do that to teach her well.

403
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,800
Mom!

404
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,070
Mom, I told you.
It was a misunderstanding.

405
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,000
Our name, age, and school
were all identical,

406
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,700
so people took us wrong.

407
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,740
Right, Jae In? Isn't that so?

408
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,370
Stop calling her that.

409
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,680
Jae In.

410
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,210
You're the one and only Kang Jae In,
and that's enough.

411
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,650
No one can imitate you.

412
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,380
Change her name first.

413
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,650
Yes, of course.

414
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,050
Mom, that's crazy.

415
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,720
It's just a name.

416
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,460
Ms. Jae In. She's right.

417
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,190
Ms. Choi, I'll change her name.

418
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,490
I promise.

419
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,660
You need to apologize to Ms. Jae In.

420
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:49,630
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,070
If I hear the name
Kang Jae In again,

422
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,010
this won't be the end of it.

423
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,080
Let's go, Jae In.

424
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,120
I'm sorry, ma'am.

425
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,190
Jae In, I'll talk to my mom.

426
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,160
I'm sorry.

427
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,530
Goodbye.

428
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,150
How can I forget you?

429
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,650
I never spent a day
without thinking of you...

430
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,590
since that day.

431
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,160
Yes, you were that brat.

432
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,060
You used my daughter's name
to act like her since then,

433
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,000
and you've now stolen
her husband, her home,

434
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,600
and even her place.

435
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,270
You're just a thief.

436
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,910
It doesn't matter. You're a fake.

437
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,780
A knockoff. Got it?

438
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,850
Yes, I stole everything!

439
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,020
A knockoff? I'm not a knockoff.

440
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,390
Everything is mine now.

441
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,620
I'm the real Kang Jae In!

442
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,530
You don't even come close
to who Jae In is.

443
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,380
How dare you slap me?

444
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,550
How dare you slap me
without knowing your place?

445
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,020
What did you say?

446
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,520
Look at yourself, woman.

447
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,290
You always told others
to know their place,

448
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,930
so what about you?

449
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,360
You're just a parasite
who lives off another...

450
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,200
because you're broke.

451
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,870
Stop acting so haughty
if you have no money or connections.

452
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,240
I'll kill...

453
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,970
both you and Jae In.

454
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,430
Don't you want to know...

455
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,400
who your birth mother is?

456
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,970
She never reached out to this day
after giving me birth.

457
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,870
To me, that woman
and you are the same,

458
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,240
so I don't want to know.

459
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,670
I'll tell Seung Woo
who his birth mother is...

460
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,040
so you can have
your heartrending reunion.

461
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,050
I can't let Seung Woo find out
through anybody else.

462
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,590
You should go.

463
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,570
Excuse me.

464
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,370
How did you know I was here?

465
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,780
Did you think I followed you here?

466
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,280
I'm a regular here.

467
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,870
Some things never change.

468
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,600
Is something bothering you?

469
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,010
You have a habit of tapping
your finger when you're bothered.

470
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,320
I'll take another drink.

471
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,420
There's something I need to say.

472
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,330
But I'm afraid what I'll say
might hurt someone.

473
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,860
Well, you were once hurt, too.

474
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,730
What was that like?

475
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,940
No, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

476
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,080
That person is...

477
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,350
like a tiny little vase to me.

478
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,150
It's so precious,
so I'm afraid it'll shatter.

479
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,090
It's frightening to think
they'll get hurt and flee from me.

480
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,630
Yes, I'd better not say anything...

481
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,100
to keep them by my side.

482
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,140
I don't know who this is about,

483
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,010
but that person may be
tougher than you think.

484
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,780
If this is something...

485
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,480
they must face in their life,
even if it'll hurt them,

486
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,120
then it's better to tell them.

487
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,520
If they'll find out anyway,

488
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,490
don't let them find out too late
or through anyone else.

489
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,900
Not only will the truth hurt them,

490
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,070
but the fact that you hid it
may hurt them more.

491
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,710
How does it feel?
Does it still hurt?

492
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,850
It feels much better.

493
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,690
What would I have done without you?

494
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,890
All kinds of thoughts ran
through my head...

495
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,730
as I talked to Yu Gyeong.

496
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,100
You helped me take courage.

497
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,170
Above all, it feels like
this house has become my sanctuary.

498
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,510
Thank you
for letting me live here...

499
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,210
and always being there
whenever I was in trouble.

500
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,080
I can't thank you enough.

501
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,980
Why are you thanking him?

502
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,220
What?

503
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,990
I'm going to have some tea.
Do you want some?

504
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,660
What about you, Jae In?

505
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,100
Sure, let me give you a hand.

506
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,540
Uncle Do Yun, your face is red.

507
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,970
Does it feel hot?

508
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,940
What? Does it feel hot?

509
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,810
Yes, it does. It's hot in here.

510
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,530
Did I mention that
when I first met you,

511
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,470
I wanted to have you
as Do Yun's spouse?

512
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,500
Did you?

513
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,340
Yes, I didn't even know
you were married...

514
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,040
and had that idea.

515
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,170
Well, it's all over now.
Isn't that funny?

516
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,550
Anyway, that's Do Yun.

517
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,080
You should meet a good guy, too.

518
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,380
Do you want to start dating again?

519
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,620
I'm not ready for that yet.

520
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,520
I'd be wanting too much
if I wanted to date,

521
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,690
and it's a luxury I can't afford.

522
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,660
I see.

523
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,670
We'll conduct an interim check
for the designs,

524
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,940
so let's take a look.

525
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,270
I got
Ms. Kang Se Ri's design last night.

526
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,210
I have mine.

00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:28,120
(Saseon-dong Reconstruction
Interior Design)

528
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,220
What is this?

529
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,800
This is crazy.

530
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,030
How can the designs be
exactly the same?

531
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,900
This is plagiarism.

532
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,410
Designer Kang Jae In
copied my design!

533
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,560
(Queen's House)

534
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,930
What kind of revenge should I get
against the so-called uncle...

535
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,290
who kidnapped his own nephew?

536
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,600
Jae In.

537
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,970
No matter how hard I try,

538
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,240
it just never works.
What was I supposed to do?

539
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,610
I hear people go to dating agencies
to meet people and to get married.

540
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,440
I don't want to go that far
to meet someone.

541
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,780
Hey, I want you to date
someone who has never been married.

542
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,040
What?

543
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,380
Someone who is single
and has never been married. A miss.

544
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,480
Don't mess with my son.

545
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,450
That's my warning.

546
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,450
Her son?

547
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,560
Mi Ran had a son?
