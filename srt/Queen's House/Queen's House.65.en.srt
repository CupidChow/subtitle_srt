00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,310
(Episode 65)

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,350
Hello.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,460
- Hey, Jae In.
- Hey.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,390
Seung Woo.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,260
Why are you here?

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,200
I'm here to drop off lunch boxes.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,360
Se Ri asked me to make some.

11
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,430
Why did you make her do this?

12
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,570
Don't you know she's unwell?

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,440
I volunteered to do it.
Don't be so harsh.

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,140
Did I interrupt your meeting?

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,340
No.

16
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,950
Are you not going to say hello
to Director Kim Do Yun, Jae In?

17
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,580
Director Kim?

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,460
Nice to meet you.
I didn't recognize you at first.

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,700
We've met at the hospital, right?

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,700
You were there when I woke up.

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
Yes, I'm that person.

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,070
Do you work here?

23
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,770
Yes.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,510
My name is Kim Do Yun.
I'm with DH Holdings.

25
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,820
Oh, my. What am I thinking?

26
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,490
I hope you like it.

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,190
It has to be good if you made it.

28
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,590
You're a licensed cook in Korean,
Western, and Japanese cuisine.

29
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,790
I am?

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,130
I thought something seemed familiar
when I cooked.

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,830
I didn't know.

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,140
There must be many more things
I have to learn.

33
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,970
I'm getting curious.

34
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,010
Is your brother-in-law
not in this meeting?

35
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,510
He has no business here.

36
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,850
I should drop off his lunch box.

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,590
Please enjoy your lunch.

38
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,650
Enjoy it, Seung Woo. You too, Se Ri.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,860
Enough is enough.

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,600
Don't you know
that Jae In has amnesia?

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,630
Aren't you the one
who took things far...

42
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,900
and even held Jae In's funeral
in an attempt to hide her?

43
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,710
You were so devoted to her,
but she doesn't know you anymore.

44
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,910
I don't know what the intention
behind that question is,

45
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,880
but that was the best choice
back then.

46
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,520
I had a feeling
someone was after her life.

47
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,790
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,430
Are you saying
someone tried to kill her? Who?

49
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,860
I could be mistaken.

50
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,700
Let's eat.

51
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,840
Jae In!

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,540
I'm so happy for you.
I hope you're well.

53
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,140
I am.

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
I'm sorry to ask,
but I don't recall anything.

55
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,250
May I ask who you are?

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,750
My name is Jung Oh Seong.

57
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,060
We can say hello again
once you get your memories back.

58
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,530
Okay. I'm sorry.

59
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,470
Please excuse me.

60
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,280
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,310
Come in.

62
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,680
Honey.

63
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,320
Hey. What brings you here
without a call?

64
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,290
I brought you lunch.

65
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,930
It feels odd to see you...

66
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,660
in my dad's office.

67
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,500
Why? Does it seem weird?

68
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,100
No, it was something
I couldn't imagine,

69
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,070
but it suits you so well.

70
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,480
This place reminds me of Dad.

71
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,980
I didn't get to stay
by his deathbed.

72
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,950
I feel like such an awful daughter.

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,300
Father would understand.

74
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,340
Right. On my way here,
I ran into that man...

75
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,640
named Director Kim Do Yun.

76
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,410
Where at?

77
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,680
On my way here.

78
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,150
He was the one who visited me
at the hospital, right?

79
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,480
He must be quite close to you...

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,020
if he visited me there.

81
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,860
Yes, well, he's the director
of DH Holdings,

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,860
an investment firm
that works with us.

83
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,570
My gosh, Secretary Yoon.

84
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,300
It's been so long.

85
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,370
Hello, ma'am.

86
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,270
It's been eight years, right?

87
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,310
You've become
even more composed in that while.

88
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,840
Thank you.

89
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,910
I'll return later, Mr. Chairman.

90
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,880
No, I was about to leave.

91
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,620
You should get back to work, honey.

92
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,350
Don't skip your meal.

93
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,550
I'll be home right after work.
I'll see you there.

94
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,830
- Please excuse me.
- Right.

95
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,290
Goodbye.

96
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,140
It looks like Jae In
really doesn't remember anything.

97
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,940
My heart dropped
when she looked at me...

98
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,810
like I was a stranger.

99
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,310
It's such a sad thing
for her not to remember...

100
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,880
her acquaintances.

101
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,550
Anyway, can you leave her
at that place?

102
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,550
We already know
what those people are like.

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,990
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

104
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,760
She should be fine
for the time being.

105
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,030
Mr. Kang moved in with her.

106
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,560
He did?

107
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,100
That kiddo must be
more loyal than he looks.

108
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,310
My doctor friend
at the hospital said...

109
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,580
her memories seem to be stuck
in her happiest period.

110
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,210
In other words,

111
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,320
these recent days were
the toughest for her.

112
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,120
I can understand.

113
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,820
She wouldn't have returned
to the past if it weren't tough.

114
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,190
But shouldn't someone
help her get her memories back?

115
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,660
We can't let her go on like this.

116
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,100
She'll live in pain again
once her memories return.

117
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,970
I don't know what to do.

118
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,700
I get what you mean,

119
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,510
but doesn't she
at least deserve a choice?

120
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Looking the other way knowingly...

121
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,480
may be another form
of violence and negligence.

122
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,350
I'll think about
what would be best for her.

123
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,890
I have a meeting outside.

124
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,400
We meet again.

125
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,540
Please excuse me.

126
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,250
Have some coffee.

127
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,960
Where did you get it?

128
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,760
I got it at the new coffee shop
on the first floor.

129
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,330
We should give business
to each other.

130
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,430
- And for you.
- Thank you.

131
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,040
Do Yun told me what happened.

132
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,410
How's Jae In?
Did she get her memories back?

133
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,910
Not yet.

134
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,010
She'll get them back soon.

135
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,850
I just know it.

136
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,650
Of course. It will happen.

137
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,330
She's acting like
she owns the place.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm going to make tea.
Do you want a cup, too?

139
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,210
You never did anything
around the house.

140
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,910
What's going on?

141
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,380
I guess you can try
to make me a good cup of tea.

142
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,990
What are you waiting for?
I thought you were making tea.

143
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,320
Do you want tea?

144
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,030
Actually, I was going to make some.

145
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,200
Would you like a cup, too?

146
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,430
Have you become deaf already?

147
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,230
I want some tea,

148
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,400
so make me some!

149
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,410
Would you like a cup of tea, too?

150
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,750
Darn it.
Is she doing this on purpose?

151
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,720
How many times
does she have to repeat that?

152
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,390
I've been developing eye bags
from sleeping on the floor,

153
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,290
and she's now teasing me
with her well-rested face.

154
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,090
Gosh. Life must be good for you.

155
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,630
Darn it.

156
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,100
Darn it. Why do I
have to run out of my room?

157
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,940
I'm home.

158
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,640
Hey. You're home early.

159
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,910
I am. Where's Ji Ho?

160
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,280
He's playing in his room.

161
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,260
Goodness, are you all right?

162
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,860
Yes, I think the cut is pretty deep,

163
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,330
but I have to prepare dinner.
What do I do?

164
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,960
Can you do it instead of me?

165
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,300
What are friends for?

166
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,270
You should make use of her.

167
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,640
Me? But I'm a guest here.

168
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,270
Darn it.

169
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,850
Friends should
help each other in times of need.

170
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,580
Jae In's friend,

171
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,480
our family motto is,
"We never take a free lunch."

172
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,550
Why do I have to treat her
with respect?

173
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,560
Anyway, you should go upstairs,
put a bandage on it, and rest.

174
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,230
Okay. Thank you, Mother.

175
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,460
She's allergic to shrimps,

176
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,270
so just keep that in mind
when you cook.

177
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,470
Thanks.

178
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,770
Goodness.

179
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,780
Look at her.
She used to be such a friendly girl.

180
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,810
Honestly, she was the best daughter-in-law
I could ever ask for.

181
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,880
If Gi Chan hadn't fallen
for your temptation,

182
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,080
he wouldn't have made a mess
out of our family,

183
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,150
and they would've lived a good life.

184
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,120
Mother, I'm now
your daughter-in-law.

185
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,560
How can you say that to my face?

186
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,260
Don't you think you're too harsh?

187
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,990
What I said wasn't wrong.

188
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,460
You're only mad
because that was the truth.

189
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,570
What about her mother,
Choi Ja Young?

190
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,140
Do you want to continue to live
feeling belittled as her in-law?

191
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,740
She never treated you like a human.

192
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,940
Shut your mouth.

193
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,240
Her family is still far better off
than your no-name family.

194
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,350
I know you're dying to become her.

195
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,520
You were named Kang Jae In,
but you were a lowly nobody.

196
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,550
So you became jealous of her...

197
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,190
because she was an upper-class girl
and the daughter of YL Group.

198
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,390
Is that all you have to say?

199
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,760
Am I wrong?

200
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,330
Make dinner.

201
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,330
"We never take a free lunch."
Got it?

202
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,290
Mommy! I made
something awesome with blocks.

203
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,350
Let me show you. Come with me.

204
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,960
I'm busy.

205
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,530
But I want to show it to you.

206
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,630
All right. We have to eat dinner,
so let's take a quick look.

207
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,930
Okay!

208
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,140
My mom doesn't have an appetite.
She'll eat later.

209
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,110
Then, let's eat.

210
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,440
- Okay.
- Ji Ho.

211
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,320
This is too salty. It's so bad.

212
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,350
I hurt my hand,

213
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,220
so Se Ri did her best on my behalf.

214
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,790
Please enjoy it
even if it's not as good.

215
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,640
- Mother.
- What's wrong, Mom?

216
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,370
It's...

217
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,480
Did you put shrimp in this?

218
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,910
Did you, Se Ri?

219
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,490
Do you feel better, Mother?

220
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm so relieved we had first aid.

221
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,460
You should go to the bedroom
and get some rest there.

222
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,730
No.

223
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,470
Jae In must be alarmed.

224
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,210
You can take her
and help her calm down.

225
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,880
She's right. Let's do as she says...

226
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,040
and go upstairs.

227
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,680
She's worried about you.

228
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,150
Then, please excuse me.

229
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,190
You should get some rest, Mother.

230
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,770
What?

231
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,470
Right. Mom. I have to take a shower.

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,370
I hope she'll be okay.

233
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,410
Does she need to see a doctor?

234
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,880
She'll be fine.

235
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,610
Anyway, did you know
she was allergic to shrimp?

236
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,580
She told me,

237
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,320
so I told Se Ri not to use shrimps.

238
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,750
I guess she forgot.

239
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,520
It's all my fault.

240
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,960
I should've paid more attention.

241
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's all right.

242
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,850
How can you be so evil
and try to kill me?

243
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,550
It's a misunderstanding.

244
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,820
A misunderstanding, my foot.

245
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,120
You can't kill a person
and say it's a misunderstanding.

246
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,490
It really wasn't me.

247
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,120
I only made a little comparison
between you and Jae In.

248
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,460
Did that make you that mad?

249
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,630
You should've considered
fixing your behavior...

250
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,130
instead of trying to kill me!

251
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,230
How many times do I have to say it?

252
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,530
It wasn't me!

253
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,870
What?

254
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,300
Who's your daughter-in-law now?

255
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,170
It's me! Get yourself together!

256
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:04,480
What is wrong with you?

257
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,010
How dare you yell at me?

258
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,580
Once again, I...

259
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,780
Shut your mouth! Shut it!

260
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,750
Are you actually allergic to shrimp?

261
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,620
- What?
- You look too fine.

262
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,420
Did you put up an act...

263
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,930
to kick me out?

264
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,830
I can't believe this. I look fine?

265
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,470
My insides feel the worst,
and you call this fine?

266
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,670
If you dare to pull a trick
with the food we eat again,

267
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,070
not only will you get
kicked out of this place,

268
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,810
but you'll have to face my rage.

269
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,480
I won't let you get away with it,
so you better watch it!

270
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,210
I'm so strong that I was once told
to become a shot put athlete,

271
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,550
so brace yourself!

272
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,020
Hey! I haven't turned off
the fuse box!

273
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,690
- It burns!
- Hey!

274
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,360
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

275
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,160
What? Probably not.

276
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,230
You must be electrocuted.

277
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,960
That could've been bad.

278
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,460
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

279
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,060
- Darn it.
- Are you okay?

280
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:37,700
Don't men usually hold the woman
in their arms in this situation?

281
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,770
You'll catch a cold
if you don't dry your hair,

282
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,110
so dry your hair.

283
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,570
Will you do it for me?

284
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,010
That's always been a dream.

285
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,910
Why should I dry your hair?

286
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,050
Weren't you told as a kid...

287
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,880
always to do your own job?

288
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,320
Good luck.

289
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,350
Thanks, I guess.

290
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,960
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

291
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,070
I'm in the study. I need to see you.

292
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,640
(I'm in the study.
I need to see you.)

293
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,580
Let go of me!

294
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,150
I can't put up with this anymore.

295
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,950
Wake Jae In up.

296
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,490
Wake her up and tell her everything!

297
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,550
Be quiet!

298
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,490
Are you going to wake
my entire family?

299
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,360
How long do I have to be patient?

300
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm seeing my husband
in bed with another woman.

301
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,000
Do you expect me
to put up with that?

302
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,300
She has amnesia.

303
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,400
Are you going to use her amnesia...

304
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,400
as an excuse
to have an affair with her?

305
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,740
Have you forgotten?

306
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,210
This happened to her because of you.

307
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,410
Are you kidding me?

308
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,050
So what?

309
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,110
Do you expect the same
to happen to me? Are you crazy?

310
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,380
I'm just stating the fact.

311
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,850
You came when I was about
to pull my arm out without waking her.

312
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,550
I didn't do anything
to make you mad.

313
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,860
We're only sharing a room.
Nothing happened.

314
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,830
Anyway.

315
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,700
I heard Jae In told you
my mom was allergic to shrimp.

316
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,870
What's going on?

317
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,670
Did you
do that to her intentionally?

318
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,900
It wasn't me. It wasn't.

319
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,770
Why won't anyone believe me?

320
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,010
I've been fooled by you enough times
to stop believing your words.

321
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,280
Be honest.

322
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,010
You can't handle this
if she finds out the truth later.

323
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,020
She's scarier than you think.

324
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,050
I didn't do it. I promise.

325
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,020
If I really did that,

326
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,890
I would even kill myself
if you told me to.

327
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,760
Apologize to her
and say it was a mistake.

328
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,060
Why should I apologize
for something I didn't do?

329
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,500
Jae In did that
even when something wasn't her fault.

330
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,330
That's the etiquette
you show your elders.

331
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,570
I don't want to make comparisons,
but Jae In knew when to back down.

332
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,510
You should learn that from her.

333
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,040
She'll notice if I'm away
for too long, so I have to go.

334
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,710
If you have anything to say,
do it at work tomorrow.

335
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,080
Also, do not barge into that room.

336
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,650
This is a warning.

337
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,240
What are you doing here?

338
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,980
I was thinking about my dad.

339
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,510
He'd go to his study...

340
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,780
and read the newspaper
the first thing in the morning.

341
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:14,180
I'd always come over
and ask him to eat breakfast.

342
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,720
Do you remember that?

343
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,490
Of course, I do.

344
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,390
And I did that today, unknowingly.

345
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,830
I finished serving breakfast
and automatically came here.

346
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,500
I can't believe
Dad isn't here anymore.

347
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,250
Father will be heartbroken...

348
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,250
to see you sad.

349
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,790
Let's keep smiling...

350
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,320
to let him rest in peace
on the other side.

351
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,200
My son, you've been
looking thinner lately.

352
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,740
Is something bothering you?

353
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,940
In that case, let me know.

354
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,980
You know
I'm always on your side, right?

355
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,410
You need to stop.

356
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,310
No one is looking.

357
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,050
You're going to leave
without giving me a hug?

358
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm leaving.

359
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,270
I love you, my son.

360
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,910
- Bye, Jae In.
- Bye.

361
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,480
Goodbye.

362
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,710
Have a great day.

363
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,760
Hello.

364
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,100
May I ask you
to fill out this survey?

365
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,900
Hello.

366
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,070
We've been developing
a new line of windows.

367
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,070
We're conducting a survey...

368
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,610
to reflect what our customers want.

369
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,610
Could you spare some time?

370
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,910
- Sure.
- Thank you.

371
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,450
This is a list of agencies...

372
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,450
that'll take up the project for
the Korean-style apartment complex.

373
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,590
Director Kang and I agreed
to pick one from the list.

374
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,190
I'm not here to get your opinion,

375
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,930
but there are procedures to take,
so I'm here to let you know.

376
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,230
You can't do this
without my permission as the chairman!

377
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,900
ES Agency's parent company...

378
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,600
may have been a subcontractor,
H and K Company,

379
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,710
but the agency itself was
proven to be free of trouble...

380
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,480
as a newly established business.

381
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,180
Chris, the CEO of ES Agency.

382
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,180
Naturally, I thought
he must be a non-Korean.

383
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,780
But I found something interesting
during my research.

384
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:05,290
His Korean name was Jung Hyeon Su.

385
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,100
Manager Jung of your competitor
framed Ms. Kang Jae In...

386
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,360
for leaking the contest design
and disappeared.

387
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,830
How did he become
the CEO of ES Agency,

388
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,870
a business affiliated with YL Group?

389
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,970
If you do not agree
to change the agency,

390
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,480
I plan to open a fact-checking committee
regarding this matter.

391
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,480
So?

392
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,980
Should I blow this up, too?

393
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,020
Let me know
when you decide on the agency.

394
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,960
I'll do that.

395
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,870
Come to my office. Now.

396
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,780
Mother was nearby,

397
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,280
so she came to see you.

398
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,020
Why did you want to see me?

399
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,150
I'll talk to you later.

400
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:13,260
Gi Chan, on my way here,
I ran into that doctor...

401
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,360
No, was he a director now?

402
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,100
Anyway, I ran into that punk,
Kim Do Yun, again.

403
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,300
Is everything okay?

404
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,830
Why would that punk
be a problem for me?

405
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,340
Na Ra told me
that his younger sister was...

406
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,910
the employee
who was killed by Jae In's mother.

407
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,480
Are you sure you can
let him lurk around at work?

408
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,010
It doesn't feel right.

409
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,780
Kicking out just her brother
isn't the end of it.

410
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,420
His uncle is around, too.

411
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,050
What? His uncle? Who's his uncle?

412
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,290
Patrick Jung of DH Holdings.

413
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,520
CEO Jung Oh Seong.

414
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,390
What? What did you say?

415
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,390
Oh Seong is... No.

416
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,600
That punk is the CEO's nephew?

417
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,100
My gosh.

418
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,640
This world can't be that tiny.

419
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,010
How did things
become this complicated?

420
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,380
Let's see.

421
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,450
Kim Do Yun and Oh Seong are
a nephew and his uncle.

422
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,820
Oh Seung's older sister is
the owner of the chicken place.

423
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,720
So, her daughter...

424
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,390
got framed
for having an affair with Gi Chan...

425
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,890
and was killed by Jae In's mother.

426
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,530
It's so complicated,

427
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,900
and it doesn't feel right.

428
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,600
Wait a minute.

429
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,910
My son isn't involved in this.

430
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,370
He never had an affair
with her daughter.

431
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,580
It's not like he killed her.

432
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,150
Yes, everything is good...

433
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,610
as long as Oh Seong
and I are into each other.

434
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,250
Who cares about others?

435
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,650
All right.

436
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,690
I'm home.

437
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,890
What's all that?

438
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,890
I've been bedridden for too long,

439
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,460
so I didn't have
anything decent to wear.

440
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,770
I went shopping.

441
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,840
People might hear that and think...

442
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,970
you're still the daughter
of a rich and affluent family.

443
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,740
I don't mean to brag,

444
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,810
but people do call my family
rich and affluent, Mother.

445
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,250
You're now married,
so you've become one of the Hwangs.

446
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,590
So, the money
you're splurging now is...

447
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,190
all hard-earned by my son.

448
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,690
You went shopping and returned
with your hands full of bags,

449
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,460
so I thought I could do this.

450
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,640
You can't think like that
just because I spend his money.

451
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,940
He lets me do that
as a good son to his mother.

452
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,650
You need to remain humble,
stay home, and assist him.

453
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,050
You can't want to live your life...

454
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,020
just as you have as a single woman.
Do you understand?

455
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,890
All right. I'll be careful, Mother.

456
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,960
(Investment and Development Team)

457
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,770
I sprained my ankle
after a meeting out of the office.

458
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,380
Did you see a doctor?

459
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,050
I'm fine.
I'll put some ice on it at home.

460
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,880
You can't drive in that state.

461
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,620
Come with me. I'll give you a ride.

462
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,210
Show me your foot.

463
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,850
It's all right.

464
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,190
Keep it there for a while.
I also got pain relief patches.

465
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,960
Are you sure
you don't need to see a doctor?

466
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,860
You're still the same.

467
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,530
You're still caring.

468
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,540
You'd run over to the pharmacy...

469
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,010
whenever I coughed a little.

470
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,380
I tried to bury those memories,
but they surged back to me.

471
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,350
You're right.
I also had forgotten...

472
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,380
I was like that.

473
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,220
Hold it.

474
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,300
It hadn't been long
since you started your investment firm.

475
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,470
What did you do before then?

476
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,470
I was out in the sea.

477
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,640
I worked as a navigator
and lived all around the world.

478
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,880
You must've been
with a lot of women abroad.

479
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,390
I'd be lying if I said I didn't.

480
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,890
You even married another guy,

481
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,890
so it would've been unfair
if I remained single.

482
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,690
Start driving.

483
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,330
But I couldn't find anyone.

484
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,100
I was pushed
out into the sea because of you,

485
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,610
but I never found anyone
who was like the wind,

486
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,210
someone who could push me back here.

487
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,910
I never found anyone like that.

488
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,090
I'll start driving now.

489
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,660
- You must've forgotten.
- Goodness.

490
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,030
That woman is
so harsh on her daughter-in-law.

491
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,230
How can there be
such an evil mother-in-law?

492
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,240
What do you mean?

493
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,640
You know where to look.

494
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,240
Does this feel unfair?
Do you feel wronged?

495
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,480
- Do you want to remain here?
- I'm home.

496
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,210
- Then, kill me.
- Hey.

497
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,360
Did you do this, Mother?

498
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,490
(Queen's House)

499
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,090
I feel bad for saying this,

500
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,330
but you should find
a place to move out to.

501
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,830
Are you telling me to leave?

502
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,160
This is way over the line.

503
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,760
You're living off me.
It's not me doing that.

504
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,730
Isn't she the woman
who sued you for sexual assault?

505
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,070
I want to tell you
that Mr. Kim Do Yun is innocent.

506
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,270
- I want to return to work.
- Return to work?

507
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,110
Catherine's identity
has been exposed?

508
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,340
Don't trust Hwang Gi Chan.

509
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,340
There's just too much
that you need to know.

510
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,250
Is Kim Do Yun going to expose
the truth to Jae In?
