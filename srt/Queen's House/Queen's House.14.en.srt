(Episode 14)

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,750
Did you hear that the wife
of YL's chairman is in the VIP ward?

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,360
It's highly confidential.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,460
I don't care.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,190
His wife killed someone
and was detained.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,430
What?

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,360
No way.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,700
So, how did she get hospitalized?

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,800
She's allowed to leave
if she's severely ill.

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,440
She got a thorough checkup...

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,770
and was diagnosed
with stomach cancer.

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,540
No way.

16
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:40,250
She's in stage three right now.

17
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,450
The cancer cells have spread...

18
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,120
to the surrounding tissues
and lymph nodes.

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,620
She cannot be helped
with simple surgery.

20
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,490
Are you saying
she can't get surgery?

21
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,620
No, sir.

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,330
First, we'll implement
many treatment methods...

23
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,900
to make sure
the cancer doesn't spread anymore.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,170
We thought that this method
would be better,

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,070
and then do the surgery
after seeing the results.

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,970
Please do your best.

27
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,510
Of course.

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,620
How does it feel to hear
that I'll die soon?

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,220
Are you happy?

30
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,020
Why would you die?

31
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,690
That won't happen.

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,290
Didn't you hear
the hospital director?

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,290
He said the cancer has spread
throughout my body.

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, it's just a little
around your stomach.

35
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,300
Please don't have
any negative thoughts...

36
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,240
and focus on your treatment.

37
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,540
You will live.

38
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,150
I'll help you fully recover.

39
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,320
I'd rather die than go to prison.

40
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,190
I'll refuse
to receive any treatment.

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,190
Honey.

42
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,360
Once I die,

43
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,060
you'll finally learn
to feel guilty, too.

44
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,460
You tortured me
for the last 30 years.

45
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,230
How could my body and mind
have remained healthy?

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,170
You ruined me.

47
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,010
The more I see you,
the more pain I feel in my body,

48
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,480
so leave.

I thought money was
the answer to all problems,

68
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,080
but love wasn't one of them.

69
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,650
The princess has no idea,

70
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,890
but her mother is spiteful.

71
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,650
I would've done the same...

72
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,320
if this were my daughter's business.

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,660
I was jealous of her,
but I began to feel bad.

74
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,900
That woman, Choi Ja Young, doesn't
hesitate to use money and power...

75
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,000
to attack, blackmail,
and even murder someone.

76
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,970
She'll do anything.

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,340
She took another woman's life
like it meant nothing,

78
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,150
just to protect
her only daughter's happiness.

79
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,820
Your sister's life...

80
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,450
came to nothing
because of Kang Jae In.

81
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,990
You want to enjoy your life...

82
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,190
in the VIP ward
without paying for what you did?

83
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,700
Does she have no remorse...

84
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,060
for my sister's unfair death?

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,000
My niece lost her mother,

86
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,540
and my mom lost her daughter.
They struggle to keep living.

87
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,180
Choi Ja Young, you're pure evil.

88
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,980
If the law cannot punish you,
I'll do it myself.

89
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,350
Watch and see
how your dear daughter...

90
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,950
crashes and falls.

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,390
I'll destroy her happiness,

92
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,860

you wanted to protect.

Hey, you're here.

96
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,180
Hey.

97
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,950
Have you heard?

98
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,320
Director Choi Ja Young
was hospitalized.

99
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,850
Hospitalized? Here?

100
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,890
Yes, she has cancer.

101
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,320
I heard it was either stage 3 or 4.

102
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,730
So, you didn't know?

103
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,860
Shouldn't you tell your friend?

104
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,430
Those above kept it confidential
to keep this on the down low,

105
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,600
so she might have no idea.

106
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,530
You're right.

107
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,240
Hello? Hey, Jae In. It's me.

108
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,610
Can you come to the hospital?

109
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,350
Yes, okay.

110
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,320
She's on her way here.

111
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,820
Is that so? That's good.

112
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,490
Bye, then. Have a good day.

113
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,090
Hey, it's Kang Jae In!

114
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,460
- Ms. Kang!
- Are you Ms. Kang?

115
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,530
Was your mother,
Director Choi Ja Young, detained...

116
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,260
for attempted murder
in a hit-and-run accident?

117
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,400
Is it true that she forged
her medical document...

118
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,400
for stomach cancer to be suspended
from her detainment?

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,600
Is your father,
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol, aware of this?

120
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,570
Did Chairman Kang
exert his influence...

121
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,510
to suspend Ms. Choi's detainment?

122
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,440
Did he abuse the justice system?

123
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,240
- Please explain, Ms. Kang!
- Ms. Kang.

124
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,610
- Ms. Kang!
- Please explain the situation.

125
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,480
- Say something, Ms. Kang!
- Are the allegations true?

126
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,150
Please wait. Please.

127
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,150
Ms. Kang!

128
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,090
- Ms. Kang!
- Goodness. Is she okay?

129
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,400
Hey.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,100
Are you okay?

131
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,900
Yes, I'm fine.

132
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,940
Thank you.

133
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,280
I'll handle the situation here.
You should go.

134
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,880
Okay.

135
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,180
I told you
not to let the information leak out.

136
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,690
Why won't you do your job?

137
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,490
If you can't keep your employees
under control,

138
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,160
how am I going to trust you
and continue as a sponsor?

139
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,490
You run your hospital...

141
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,630
with the annual contribution
YL Group makes.

142
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,660
If this is how you'll do your job,

143
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,900
we'll call off the agreement
to sponsor the cancer center.

144
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,310
Find out who the whistleblower is.

145
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,040
You may leave.

146
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,090
Come on in.

147
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,490
I thought you weren't well.

148
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,900
Do you want me to be unwell?

149
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,300
Mom.

150
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,330
I'm unwell. I'm quite unwell.

151
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,970
My only daughter is
refusing to see me.

152
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,570
How can I be well?

153
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,340
I was asking...

154
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,710
if you had stomach cancer.

155
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,910
Be honest with me.

156
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,010
Do you really have stomach cancer?

157
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,920
So, the reporters were
all telling the truth.

158
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,760
You don't have to mind
whatever they say.

159
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,260
Just ignore them.

160
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,760
You're too cowardly.

161
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,560
I knew you had elitism
and a sense of entitlement,

162
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,060
but I still thought
you were a great woman.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,100
You were confident and dignified
wherever you went,

164
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,640
and you seemed honorable.

165
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,170
But those were just elitism...

166
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,840
and your sense of entitlement.

167
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,950
Those things are
not important right now, Jae In.

168
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,210
What's really important is that
you must secure your place.

169
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,150
And to do that,
you must pull out the weeds.

170
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,650
Mom.

171
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,990
Yes, Jae In.
You need to listen to me.

172
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,720
First, divorce Gi Chan.

173
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,730
That's the best move
you can make for yourself.

174
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,330
I'll do anything for you.

175
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,900
Do you understand?

176
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,870
I'm pregnant.

177
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,500
Abort it now.

178
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,980
How can you say that?

179
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,680
You need to wake up, Jae In.

180
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,410
Face the reality.

181
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,850
I know he's having an affair.

182
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,120
- You're delusional.
- I'd rather it be a delusion.

183
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,390
But I'm sorry.
I saw it with my own two eyes.

184
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,460
I can still picture
the photos I saw on your phone.

185
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,860
Photos?

186
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,730
The other woman sent those to you
as if she wanted you to see them.

187
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,130
I don't even want to speak of it.

188
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,640
I thought
you'd be shocked to see those,

189
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,540
so I deleted the message.

190
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,580
I didn't want you to live like me.

191
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,380
I wanted you to be happy.

192
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,650
Is that wrong?

193
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,320
You keep saying
you'll do anything for me,

194
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,220
but I just don't get it,
no matter how hard I try.

195
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,220
Why didn't you tell me back then?

196
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,590
This is all your selfishness.

197
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,460
And I don't plan
to break up my family...

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,100
because of that.

199
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,400
I will not divorce him.

200
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,600
You're stabbing yourself
in the back.

201
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,810
Go back into detention
and get tried.

202
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,140
That's what you need to do
if you really will do anything for me.

203
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,010
And come back to me...

204
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,050
when you can stand tall again.

205
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,650
Please do that, Mom.

206
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,620
I don't need a daughter
who doesn't want her mother.

207
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,420
I don't care
for either you or your father.

208
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,160
Goodbye.

209
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,680
Goodness.

210
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,750
Gi Chan, I'm in your office.
Where are you?

211
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,750
Why did you come without calling me?

212
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,190
I'm busy right now.

213
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,390
I came because I couldn't discuss this
at home.

214
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,060
What happened between you
and Jae In's friend?

215
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,860
Did you end it with her?

216
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,900
You'll have your second child, so...

217
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,470
Hello?

218
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,510
Gosh, he's driving me crazy.

219
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,680
What if Jae In finds out?

220
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,850
Goodness, Ms. Noh. Hello.

221
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,820
Director Hwang isn't here.

222
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,590
Why don't you have a seat?

223
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,990
I'll call him.

224
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,030
You evil brat.
How dare you walk in here?

225
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,360
How dare you seduce him?

226
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,500
- What are you doing?
- How can you hit on...

227
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,830
your friend's husband?

228
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,240
You evil brat.

229
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,100
Ms. Noh!

230
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,910
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

231
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,180
He won't pick up his phone.

232
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,750
Ms. Noh?

233
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,450
If I made a scene at work, then...

234
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,220
I'd like to speak with you quietly
outside of the office.

235
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,790
When can you do that?

236
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,900
Actually, I prepared
a present for you.

237
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,030
Should I come to your place later?

238
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,010
Meet me here after work.

239
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,280
Okay, Ms. Noh.

240
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,920
What can I say to her
to scare her out of her wits?

241
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,290
I can already tell...

242
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,060
that she's not an easy girl
to deal with.

243
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,260
Ms. Noh.

244
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,740
This is a present for you.
I got you a bag.

245
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,110
It's made with crocodile leather,
and it's a limited edition.

246
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,210
I don't want it.

247
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,710
I don't know what your story is,

248
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,580
but you got the wrong person.

249
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,150
Ms. Noh.

250
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,750
Shut your mouth!
Stop acting so friendly.

251
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,290
You make it impossible
for me to be nice.

252
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,560
How can you seduce...

253
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,420
your friend's husband
and keep him as another man?

254
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,490
If you want to have an affair,
do it with someone else!

255
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,990
Goodness.

256
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,460
Ms. Noh, it's not an affair.
We're in love.

257
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,100
Gi Chan and I are in love.

258
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,000
Haven't you heard?
Jae In is pregnant.

259
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,710
Would he do that if he loved you?

260
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,280
Well, that can happen.

261
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,780
What's more important is that
his heart is with me.

262
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,980
Stop talking nonsense.

263
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,350
You're so shameless.

264
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,190
I've never seen
another married woman...

265
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,890
as brazen as you.

266
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,160
Hey, does your husband know
you're out here doing this?

267
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,860
Would you like to meet my husband?

268
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,230
He's someone
you know better than anyone.

269
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,960
What?

270
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,730
I want to get along with you,
Ms. Noh.

271
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,700
Mom, I got all these.

272
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,840
What do I do now?

273
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,040
- Ms. Noh!
- Goodness, Mom!

274
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,550
Ms. Noh.

275
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,710
This is my answer.

276
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,680
You are like...

277
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,720
these discarded bones to my son.

278
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,290
How long do you think
he'll gnaw on the bone...

279
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,420
instead of perfectly good meat?

280
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,420
Learn your place and get lost...

281
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,890
before I throw you into a trash can.

282
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,760
You'll never win against me.

283
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,430
Today was just the beginning.

284
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,570
You know what to do
if you don't want this to be worse.

285
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,200
Ms. Noh, please excuse me today.

286
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,770
I hope to meet you
with a smile next time.

287
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,110
Have you gone crazy?

288
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,010
- Mom, you need to stop.
- You!

289
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,980
You have to stop, Mom.

290
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,220
If you go out,
the neighbors might see this.

291
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,990
It'll take a while
to get rid of that girl.

292
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,920
I'll return this to her.

293
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,030
Why would you do that?

294
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,460
I'm sure Gi Chan spent
a fortune on her.

295
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,760
She has good taste, though.

296
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,970
Anyway, is Gi Chan
having an affair with that woman?

297
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,870
Shut your mouth.

298
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,140
It's a secret.

299
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,080
I have the half and half.

300
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,610
- It's for table two.
- Okay.

301
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,150
Please enjoy.

302
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,260
His suit makes this place
seem like a classy restaurant.

303
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,430
Right?

304
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,060
I feel like
I'm at a high-end restaurant.

305
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,300
Your outfit will
make my business look good.

306
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,300
I believe I need to show
good manners with my attire, too.

307
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,940
Right. Didn't you say
your granddaughter is waiting?

308
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,480
You should go.

309
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,110
I'll finish up.

310
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,320
It's great to have...

311
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,220
someone I can
trust with the business.

312
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,650
Thank you.

313
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,960
Here.

314
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,600
Goodness.

315
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,770
You don't have to do this.

316
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,880
Please.

317
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,550
Thank you.

318
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,890
What's your plan?

319
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,690
Reporters are all over the hospital,

320
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,430
so there is no way to stop them.

321
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,430
And our office phone will
ring off the hook, too.

322
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,670
We can't patch this up.

323
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,640
We'll find a way
to reduce damages to YL Group.

324
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,940
Is Ja Young out of her mind?

325
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,840
I know she grew up
as a snobby princess,

326
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,710
but doesn't she know
what the world has become?

327
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,350
How can she do this?

328
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,880
Let's discuss this tomorrow.

329
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,290
We have to persuade Mom
and send her back to jail.

330
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,920
We should.

331
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,900
What is it?
What's taking you so long?

332
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,170
What is it?

333
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,100
It's about the culprit
who killed Do Hee.

334
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,570
She faked her medical diagnosis
and got hospitalized.

335
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,440
I told reporters about it,
and it'd be on the news tonight.

336
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,110
Great job. Good call.

337
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,110
The world needs to know.

338
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,320
And about Do Hee.

339
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
That woman killed her...

340
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,020
because she thought her son-in-law
was having an affair with Do Hee.

341
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,790
So, she didn't hit her
by accident and run off?

342
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,790
Do Hee...

343
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,200
Do Hee was her target?

344
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,870
Did she say
Do Hee was his other woman?

345
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,970
That's impossible.

346
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,510
- No.
- You're right.

347
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,780
It can't be Do Hee.

348
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,080
I don't know if she's mistaken
or misunderstanding,

349
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,710
but it wasn't Do Hee.

350
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,290
I wanted to keep it a secret,

351
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,020
but I didn't want you to be shocked
after seeing the news.

352
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,490
The media had to catch the story
to stir the public's interest...

353
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,660
and have her punished
for what she did.

354
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,900
We should do that.

355
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes.

356
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,030
She must be punished.

357
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,070
The wife of a corporate chairman is
currently detained...

358
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,210
and under investigation
for a hit-and-run case.

359
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,770
She reportedly received
a false medical diagnosis...

360
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,740
and was hospitalized
in the VIP ward of this hospital,

361
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,480
only to continue living in luxury.

362
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,850
What's more serious is that...

363
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,750
the incident
may not have been a simple accident.

364
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,120
It is alleged that...

365
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,290
she mistook the victim
for her son-in-law's mistress...

366
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,820
and struck her intentionally
with her car.

367
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,660
I'm sorry, Mother.

368
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,500
You don't have to apologize,

369
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,030
but she should've been punished
for what she did wrong.

370
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,900
She tried to pull a trick
but humiliated the family.

371
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,910
This doesn't feel so great.

372
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,970
An affair?

373
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,210
That's enough.
Don't make this harder for Jae In.

374
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,580
Let's go.

375
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,990
Mom, is this true?

376
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,490
She killed the woman,
thinking Gi Chan was having an affair?

377
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,920
I don't know. Be quiet.

378
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,320
You're all dismissed.

379
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,170
He was so lucky.

380
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,970
Gosh, my mom should be an actress.

381
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,940
She could've made it in Hollywood
with that talent.

382
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,480
She's very good.

383
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,680
How's the pig's feet restaurant
working out? Is it doable?

384
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,780
Why are you asking me
about pig's feet now?

385
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,880
Don't take me as a joke
just because I sell pig's feet.

386
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,620
You should be grateful
for a husband like me.

387
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,820
I never cheat.
I only have my eyes on you.

388
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,490
Gi Chan only has
his eyes on Jae In, too.

389
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,430
Don't tell anyone,

390
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,200
but Gi Chan had an affair.

391
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,700
It's still going on.

392
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,870
Stop lying,

393
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,240
pull yourself together,
and make your business work out.

394
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,110
Hey, why won't you believe me?

395
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,080
All right.
It's better that you don't know.

396
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,480
It'll only blow up
if Jae In hears about it.

397
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,680
That's true.

398
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,550
I need to find beer.

399
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,470
You're drinking again?

400
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,040
You'll hurt yourself
if you keep doing this every day.

401
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,470
You need to stop drinking.

402
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,620
What? I thought you just left.

403
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,690
I just heard the front door.

404
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,860
This area isn't for just anybody.

405
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,800
Just anybody?

406
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,640
There's a murder inside,
so why can't I go there?

407
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,140
Move aside.

408
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,170
(VIP Ward)

409
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,880
Bring my daughter back.

410
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,010
Bring my poor daughter back.

411
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,820
How can you do this?

412
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,220
How can you shamelessly be there
after taking someone's life?

413
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,620
How?

414
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,660
You're a murderer.
Bring my daughter back.

415
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,530
Bring my poor Do Hee back!

416
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,600
You need to stop.

417
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,060
If you keep doing this,
we'll call the police.

418
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Bring my daughter back.

419
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,710
Excuse me.
Are you Ms. Kim Do Hee's mother?

420
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,720
I am the culprit's husband.

421
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,490
I sincerely apologize.

422
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,560
Bring my daughter back.

423
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,960
Bring my poor daughter back.

424
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,500
Bring her back.

425
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,730
- Please stop.
- Bring my poor Do Hee back!

426
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,870
- Bring her back!
- Ma'am, please.

427
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,800
- Goodness.
- Mr. Chairman!

428
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,670
- Call Dr. Park. Now!
- Yes, sir.

429
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,470
Mr. Chairman!

430
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,280
Bring my daughter back...

431
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,410
Mom!

432
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,050
My daughter...

433
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,350
My poor daughter.

434
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,220
My Do Hee...

435
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,660
My...

436
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,800
How can the justice system
still favor the rich in the 21st century?

437
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,730
- How can this be?
- How can this be?

438
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,770
The judiciary must stop kneeling
before money and power!

439
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,500
- Stop kneeling!
- Stop kneeling!

440
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,770
The judiciary does not work
for YL Group as a subcontractor!

441
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,340
- Wake up!
- Wake up!

442
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,550
How can the justice system
still favor the rich in the 21st century?

443
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,310
- How can this be?
- How can this be?

444
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,250
The judiciary must stop kneeling
before money and power!

445
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,850
- Stop kneeling!
- Stop kneeling!

446
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,550
There is a strong public backlash.

447
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,590
The case turned into a social issue,

448
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,660
and people quickly put together
a boycott against YL Group.

449
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,760
Many people are demanding...

450
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,260
that they return products
they've already purchased.

451
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,700
Following that,
our stock price plummeted, too.

452
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,500
She framed one of the employees
as an adulteress and killed her.

453
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,070
If that wasn't enough,
she pulled a trick...

454
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,010
in an attempt to suspend
her detention,

455
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,610
and the news is
all over the Internet.

456
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,450
The image we established
as a corporation...

457
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,180
completely crashed
because of Ja Young.

458
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,750
There's also a protest
in front of our headquarters office.

459
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,460
Have you thought of countermeasures?

460
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,230
We should draw a line
between Mother and the business...

461
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,270
to avoid the responsibility
as much as possible.

462
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,870
Draw a line?

463
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,300
Are you telling me to divorce her?

464
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,640
If that's what you must do
to improve YL's image,

465
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,210
then that's the right thing to do.

466
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,710
A business shouldn't be tied
to a murderer and a criminal.

467
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,950
What if I forsake
my management rights?

468
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,690
Gyu Cheol.

469
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,390
It'd seem irresponsible
if I divorced her...

470
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,160
in this situation.

471
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,790
After all, we're married,
and we're family.

472
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,460
If I divorce her
because of a disadvantage,

473
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,870
it'll only seem like a deception.

474
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,600
Also, I'm partially responsible
for this.

475
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,270
Let's send her back
to the detention center,

476
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,280
and I'll step down
as soon as possible.

477
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,650
Who do you have in mind
as your successor?

478
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,890
Will it be Seung Woo? Or...

479
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,190
Let's discuss that later.

480
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,360
I told you ages ago
to find the whistleblower...

481
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,430
and bring him to me,
so what's taking you so long?

482
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,270
Even if reporters found out
about the fake medical report,

483
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
you should've insisted...

484
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,870
that it was wrong
and that no mistakes were made.

485
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,370
What do you think you're doing?

486
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,180
Do you think you'll live
after betraying me like this?

487
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,210
I'm doing my best to find out.

488
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,010
Make an official statement
that the news reports are all false.

489
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,520
Tell them someone at your hospital
made a false report...

490
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,680
with malicious intent.

491
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,560
There's no need to do that.
You may leave.

492
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,560
Didn't you hear me?

493
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,000
You should've been getting ready
to return to the detention center...

494
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,270
as soon as you got notified.

495
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,810
Will you stand here like this?

496
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,510
You seem excited.

497
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,010
Are you that happy to know
that I'll be detained again?

498
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,880
It's just as you said.

499
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,850
I'm the problem
that caused this situation,

500
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,720
and I brought it upon myself.

501
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,060
You can blame me
and resent me all you want,

502
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,430
but don't end up
hurting Jae In, too.

503
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,930
You're her mom.

504
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,200
You didn't just kill Ms. Kim.

505
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,140
You also trampled on
the trust your daughter had in you,

506
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,170
and this recent incident
destroyed her trust even more.

507
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,440
Stop making up an excuse
to blame this on me.

508
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,780
You and Hwang Gi Chan
provided the reason.

509
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,280
You two are truly evil.

510
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,380
You need to get ready.

511
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,620
I'm a patient,

512
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,850
and I'm here to receive treatment.

513
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,460
Not you,

514
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,730
not anyone in this country
has the right to stop me.

515
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,260
The more you go on,
the more you'll hurt Jae In.

516
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,270
Do you not care about the gossip
that's printed out every day...

517
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,800
about her?

518
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,000
Sue all of them for defamation.

519
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,270
You're the one...

520
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,370
who ruined Jae In's reputation.

521
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,810
Let me leave you with this.

522
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,880
If you want to get
Jae In's forgiveness,

523
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,620
go back to the detention center...

524
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,690
and stay there quietly
until your trial.

525
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,620
Don't make this worse
and let her see you get dragged.

526
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,180
My gosh.

527
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,380
Did I surprise you?

528
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,680
Of course, I was surprised.

529
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,650
You just tapped me from behind.

530
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,690
You must've done
lots of wrong things.

531
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,650
Speak for yourself.

532
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,960
Aren't we the same?

533
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,830
Don't be mad anymore.

534
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,790
I'll stop by after work today.

535
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,000
(To Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)

536
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,310
(Director Do Min Jun is innocent!
Look into H and K Company.)

537
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,880
(Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)

538
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,020
Who put this envelope...

539
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,750
on my desk?

540
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,860
It was just delivered here.

541
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,290
Can you find the deliveryman
and bring him here?

542
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,230
Who gave you this envelope?

543
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,870
Some woman.

544
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,170
I was just told to bring it here,
so I took it and brought it here.

545
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,610
Then, where did you meet her...

546
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,410
when you got this?

547
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,610
In front of the convenience store,
about 50m from here.

548
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,520
(Letter of Resignation, Kim Do Yun)

549
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,590
Dr. Park,
have you persuaded Dr. Kim?

550
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,120
We can't lose our best surgeon.

551
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,200
I haven't processed
his resignation yet,

552
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,660
so make sure you bring him back.

553
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,770
Have you found the punk
who snuck into my office...

554
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,770
and leaked the VIP record?

555
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:38,610
Yes. The CCTV footage
taken in front of your office...

556
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,580
didn't show his face
because of his cap,

557
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,910
but I confirmed him in the hallway
in front of the annex restroom.

558
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:50,850
(Hanguk Hospital, Front of Restroom)

559
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,590
Dr. Kim Do Yun.

560
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,430
This was why he resigned first
before I found out.

561
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,200
Come with us.

562
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:17,210
(A Bell Convenience Store,
Kangrim-dong branch)

563
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,450
Why did she have this delivered...

564
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,220
instead of bringing it
to me directly?

565
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,900
(A Bell Convenience Store,
Kangrim-dong branch)

566
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,750
Hello? It's me.

567
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,420
I want to see you if you're free.

568
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,330
Can you come to my office?

569
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,530
Come in.

570
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,300
Excuse me.

571
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,140
We met at the interview, right?

572
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,710
Hello, Director Kang.

573
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,880
I remember you
because you were stunning.

574
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,780
You were to begin next week,

575
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,480
but I heard you were already here,
so I came to see you.

576
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,280
I wanted to settle in
before I got started.

577
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,490
The chairman always wanted
to establish a clinic...

578
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,620
in the office
as a part of employee benefits,

579
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,960
and his wish finally came true.

580
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,800
Please take good care
of YL Group's health,

581
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
both physically and mentally.

582
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,270
Of course. If nothing else,
I'll make sure...

583
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,570
everyone stays healthy.

584
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,200
Then, I'll see you next week.

585
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,980
I'm almost here.

586
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,650
All right. I'll be there.

587
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,520
(Queen's House)

588
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,550
Can you hold an investigation...

589
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,990
on H and K Company?

590
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,030
And on Director Hwang Gi Chan.

591
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,800
What did he give to Director Do?

592
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,630
You cannot go inside.

593
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,130
You can't do this
without prior notification!

594
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,440
A tax investigation began
by securing all files...

595
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,070
related to taxes and accounting.

596
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,540
If I get asked for help,

597
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,580
should I throw
a useless tactic first?

598
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,150
I'm here, Mr. Chairman.

599
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,150
(Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)
