00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,580
(Episode 57)

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,360
Jae In.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,930
At home,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,500
there is...

8
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,230
Jae In! What's wrong?

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,770
Jae In!

10
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,380
You need to breathe, Jae In!

11
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,110
Breathe in and out slowly!

12
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,900
You don't have to worry.

13
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,900
I'm fine now.

14
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,440
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol knew...

15
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,570
all about Hwang Gi Chan
before he passed away.

16
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:15,910
I guess so.

17
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,580
He said he wanted me back home.

18
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,780
It must've been an attempt...

19
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,720
to protect me
after he found out everything.

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,290
What's your plan now?

21
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,990
I don't know.

22
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,330
I have to think about it.

23
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,730
Ms. Jung should be here
any minute now. I should go.

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,670
Please say goodbye to Bo Ram for me.

25
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,010
Let me take that.

26
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,410
You're parked
in front of my place, right?

27
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,670
What's that?

28
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,270
The articles Dad left behind.

29
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,670
I had left the things
from his office...

30
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,980
with someone I know,

31
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,110
and I got them back.

32
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,160
I need to make some tea.

33
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,240
Mommy!

34
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,350
It's great to see
my entire family...

35
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,480
bustling here all at once.

36
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,050
I thought of you...

37
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,560
when I built this house.

38
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,790
You were
still in your mom's womb then.

39
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,730
You're the rightful owner
of this house.

40
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,670
I hope you'll keep this place safe.

41
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,670
Will you do that?

42
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,970
Your father came to see me
a few days before he died.

43
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,870
He asked me about that punk.

44
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,040
He didn't elaborate,

45
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,910
but he must've found out something
and became suspicious.

46
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,680
He didn't say anything to me.

47
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,880
He would've told you
only after he was sure.

48
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,650
That's his biggest strength
and weakness.

49
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,520
At times, prudence can be poisonous.

50
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,130
If only I had listened
to Mom back then...

51
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,530
If I did that...

52
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,640
Dad, I'm sorry.

53
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,040
I'm so sorry.

54
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,640
I had no idea
you passed away like that,

55
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,880
and I even thanked that man.

56
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,080
I gave all I had to him.

57
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,740
Yu Gyeong.

58
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,740
Hey, what brings you here?

59
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,210
I was passing by,
and then I thought of you.

60
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,650
Here.

61
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,550
Is this for me?

62
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,750
Thank you for what you did
last time I got hammered.

63
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,020
My arm hurts.

64
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,600
It feels nice to get flowers
from a man after a long time.

65
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,100
A man?
Do you actually see me as a man?

66
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,230
Don't be so cute.

67
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,170
Jae In told me
that you went back to work.

68
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,240
I should. I'm a grown man.

69
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,480
Good boy. Great job.

70
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,950
Have a seat. Do you want coffee?

71
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,190
Wait, it wasn't you?

72
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,530
If you didn't put me on that bed,
then who was it?

73
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,130
- Was it your dad?
- No.

74
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,440
He seemed like an acquaintance.

75
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,110
My acquaintance? Who?

76
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,080
I don't know.
I didn't get a chance to ask.

77
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,220
Why are you laughing?

78
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,950
It's nothing.

79
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,090
Gosh, I shouldn't be laughing.

80
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,590
Do you remember
crying like a baby that night?

81
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,670
Me? No.

82
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,140
I don't remember anything.

83
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,070
I blacked out.

84
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,670
He seemed like a gentleman.

85
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,540
He left quietly
when you began to cry.

86
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,750
What are you doing?

87
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,750
Did you cry a river?

88
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,980
I didn't cry.

89
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,120
Never mind, then.

90
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,090
But Mr. Kang, a man should cry
only three times in his life.

91
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,660
You can't cry too often.

92
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,060
Dang it. What is this?

93
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,730
He already knew everything
when he teased me? Come on.

94
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,500
What's wrong?

95
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,440
No, it's nothing.

96
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,940
When do you get off?

97
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,050
I'm hungry.

98
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,510
I'll buy you dinner.

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,050
Okay. Treat me.

100
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,120
It's the weekend,
so I planned to leave early.

101
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,520
Give me just a moment.

102
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,150
I'll close, and then we can leave.

103
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,820
Let me help you.

104
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:13,400
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

105
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,010
Jae In, it's me. Dad.

106
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,580
You might be startled
after hearing this voice recording,

107
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,820
but I thought I had no other way...

108
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,620
of sharing the actual truth
with you.

109
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,290
(Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol)

110
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,260
That way, you won't get swayed
by what anyone says...

111
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,860
and come to an objective decision.

112
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,330
No matter how hard
and painful it is,

113
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,570
you still need to know
what the truth is.

114
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,790
Did you want to see me, sir?

115
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,090
I want to ask
about the double contract...

116
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,430
with H and K Company.

117
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,460
Was it you?

118
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,730
I thought it was Director Do.

119
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,240
And were you
also the whistleblower...

120
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,340
for this recent corruption report?

121
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,180
It's a misunderstanding.

122
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,510
Why would I do that?

123
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,010
It wasn't Ms. Kim Do Hee,

124
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,180
but that designer, Ms. Kang Se Ri.

125
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,650
Your other woman.

126
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,220
Go ahead and make more excuses.

127
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,660
Do it!

128
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,660
According to your logic,

129
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,830
your wife is
the filthiest of them all.

130
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,340
A scumbag who killed someone
without even blinking.

131
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,280
She wouldn't have done that
if it hadn't been for you.

132
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,440
This is why couples are
just like each other.

133
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,080
Mother blamed another...

134
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,280
for her unhappy life
and killed Ms. Kim,

135
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,720
and you're just like her.

136
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,920
Get out of here, you punk.

137
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,290
Or I'll call the police.

138
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,820
Jae In and I are complete opposites,

139
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,190
so I won't sit around
and take this like an idiot.

140
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,130
What did you say?
What the heck are you talking about?

141
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,900
I dedicated my life
to YL Group after marrying Jae In.

142
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,570
I need decent compensation.

143
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,380
I am not backing down like this!

144
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,320
No.

145
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,960
No, you punk! Give it back!

146
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,460
No.

147
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,130
My daughter. Jae In... No...

148
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,770
No...

149
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,550
Jae In.

150
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,720
At home,

151
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,830
there is...

152
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,050
Don't you know better...

153
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,650
than to walk into an empty office?

154
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,920
Get out.

155
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,060
Gi Chan.

156
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,330
You're the filthiest of them all.

157
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,860
I will rip you into pieces...

158
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
and take your life.

159
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,270
Don't even dream
of a peaceful death.

160
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,400
You don't deserve to die like that.

161
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,240
I won't let it happen.

162
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
What do you want this early?

163
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,070
Do you have the signed consent form
to change the family registrar?

164
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,340
I have
something important to tell you.

165
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,850
Who killed whom?

166
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,650
You heard what I said.

167
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,520
Gi Chan was the one who killed Dad.

168
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,190
I know you despise him,

169
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,230
but you can't just say
something like that.

170
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,060
Did you think I'd believe it
if you suddenly came and said that?

171
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,930
Seung Woo was the first person
who found your dad,

172
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,170
and he had already passed away
by the time Dr. Kim Do Yun came...

173
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,040
to provide first aid.

174
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,340
You already know
he died of a heart attack.

175
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,180
He didn't get his hands dirty,

176
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,010
but it was as good as murder.

177
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,280
He was in Dad's office...

178
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,620
before Seung Woo found my dad.

179
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,650
I know.

180
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,350
Chairman Hwang already said
he went there to make a report.

181
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,720
It's absurd to claim
he's a murderer just with that fact.

182
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,190
You need to stop.

183
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,760
Is Dad a stranger to you?

184
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,970
He's your older brother.

185
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,530
Do you have evidence?

186
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,470
Present evidence first so that I can
at least pretend to believe you.

187
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,040
His presence in the office
isn't good enough.

188
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,580
What's the evidence?

189
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,140
How am I supposed to trust you?

190
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,010
- What?
- At the last general meeting,

191
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,150
you said you'd take my side
but actually sided with Gi Chan.

192
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,150
On top of that,

193
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,590
you turned Kang Se Ri
into your niece, Kang Jae In.

194
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,660
You never took my side
whenever I got framed,

195
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,760
so how am I supposed to trust you?

196
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,000
If you don't trust me,

197
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
then why are you telling me this?

198
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,540
You're right.

199
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,810
I lost my senses
because it was about Dad.

200
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,780
But I came to a realization
as we spoke right now.

201
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,250
That you're not on my side.

202
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,220
I never took anyone's side, Jae In.

203
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,950
I'm only looking for the best way
for YL Group and Seung Woo,

204
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,190
just as your mom did for you.

205
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,190
You just admitted it yourself.

206
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,500
You despise my mom,

207
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,600
yet you're acting just like her.

208
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm leaving.

209
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,770
One last thing.

210
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,770
Are you sure there's evidence?

211
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,910
Do you think there isn't?

212
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,040
If there is, show it to me first.

213
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,210
First, make me trust you.

214
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,680
I need to know
if I can trust you or not...

215
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,880
before I show it to you.

216
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,100
Don't you think you're shameless?

217
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,070
You said you'd quit
if you lost the contest.

218
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,710
Then, you chose to hold out
and got kicked out of the office.

219
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,740
Even after that,
you're around here all the time.

220
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,710
How long are you going to do this?

221
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,350
You also skipped work
without telling anyone,

222
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,250
yet here you are.

223
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,220
We're in a similar situation,
so let's not be so harsh.

224
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,360
What? A similar situation?

225
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,860
You're Chairman Hwang's wife,
so you're going to trust him...

226
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,630
and hold out?

227
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,670
You have an easy time at work
because Director Kang Mi Ran is...

228
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,700
always looking out for you.

229
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,210
If you, of all people,
begin to point your finger at me,

230
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,910
it's just like pointing it
back at yourself. Got it?

231
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,640
If you know people are
pointing fingers, have some shame.

232
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,550
Hey! Kang Jae In!

233
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,960
Your stuff isn't here,
so you won't need a huge box.

234
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,330
Mr. Kang, if there's an empty box,
you can leave it on her desk.

235
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,960
Team Leader Kang Se Ri
will be dismissed as of today.

236
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,500
Says who?

237
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,270
Wasn't kicking me out
to the staff lounge enough?

238
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,040
I said I'd come
until my replacement comes...

239
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,170
Stop using that as an excuse,
because we aren't even hiring.

240
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,080
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
must've approved...

241
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,880
your dismissal by now.

242
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,120
A present for you.

243
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,520
If you hold out any longer,
it'll make you look disgraceful.

244
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,490
It's time to leave, Se Ri.

245
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,240
What were you two talking about?

246
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,050
You don't have to mind it.

247
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,050
You're leaving me out again?

248
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,850
What you need to do right now is
focus on your work.

249
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,650
What Se Ri said wasn't wrong.

250
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,390
If you were an ordinary employee,

251
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,520
you would've been punished
for not showing up.

252
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,020
I'll take the punishment.

253
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,060
So, what did you
and Aunt Mi Ran talk about?

254
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,470
I'll tell you
after I figure out some more.

255
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,170
Are you doing this
because I'm not your brother?

256
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,640
Why is everyone
keeping everything a secret from me?

257
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,310
I also have the right to know!

258
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,850
You said I was family, too.
Am I not?

259
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,820
He'll be shocked
if he finds out the truth,

260
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,520
and he may even run over to Gi Chan.

261
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,490
I can't let him fall into danger.

262
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,560
What's going on here?

263
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,470
Forget it.
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

264
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,750
Can we talk for a minute?

265
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,720
We have a lot to discuss.

266
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,820
I don't want to talk to you yet.

267
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,960
I told you to give me time.

268
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
I know.

269
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,820
- I know that, but...
- Please...

270
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,960
stop minding me.

271
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,660
How am I going to do that?

272
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,130
- You're my...
- No!

273
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,470
I am the son...

274
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,270
of my late father.

275
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,470
Kang Gyu Cheol...

276
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,840
is the name of my father,
and you are...

277
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,010
just my aunt.

278
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,180
So, don't say anything more.

279
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,050
Otherwise,
I may choose to disappear.

280
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,140
So, you were capable
of making a wise choice.

281
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,440
You must be busy, so you should go.

282
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,010
Honey, Jae In...

283
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,220
Ms. Kang, I heard you had a son.

284
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,080
And?

285
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,520
I also have a niece.

286
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,490
I just thought
even she knows that lying is bad...

287
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,660
and promises are to be kept.

288
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:58,400
Jae In just said
you approved my dismissal.

289
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,700
Is this true?

290
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,410
DH Holdings brought...

291
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,580
an official letter of complaint
to share with the board.

292
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,120
"As an investment firm, DH Holdings
can no longer condone..."

293
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,680
"personnel decisions..."

294
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,120
"made by Chairman Hwang
that are far from professional."

295
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,160
They said
they'd propose my dismissal...

296
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,120
for not firing you,
so what choice do I have?

297
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,160
I agreed to accept your defeat
and discard the complaint.

298
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,130
I gave you more than enough time,

299
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,600
and if you held out longer,
the employees would begin to talk.

300
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,770
You gave me time already,
so give me just a little more.

301
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,140
I'll do whatever it takes...

302
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,040
You said Kang Seung Woo was
Kang Mi Ran's son.

303
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,310
I can't be caught up
in more controversies.

304
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,750
It means she considered me
as a puppet to leave in place...

305
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,410
until she finds a chance
to put her son here.

306
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,450
Do you want to give her
a reason to attack me?

307
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,650
Why won't you think of me?

308
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,890
Then, give me just a few more days.

309
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,560
It kills my pride to think
it'll look like I'm leaving...

310
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,630
just as Jae In wanted.

311
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,300
I knew you wouldn't leave
on your own accord,

312
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,470
so I came to see you off.

313
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,110
Drag out this outsider now.

314
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,840
Let go of me. Let go!

315
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,610
I'll leave on my own!

316
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,950
Let go of me!

317
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,160
Ms. Kang must've made a big scene
as she got dragged out.

318
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,230
Yes, she always stays
within my expectations.

319
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,370
Good work.

320
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,270
You said you were going out to work.

321
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,540
Yes, I'm going to the showroom.

322
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,610
I have a consultation session
with a VIP customer,

323
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,810
and I have to be in a meeting
to set up the showroom...

324
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,010
with the design
from the last contest.

325
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,120
I'll probably stay there
and continue to have meetings.

326
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,790
All right.

327
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,850
I'll go straight home
if it goes on for too long.

328
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,590
Have a great day, Director Kim.

329
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,360
Jae In.

330
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,730
There's no need...

331
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,740
to pretend like you're fine
and strong when you're with me.

332
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,970
Everything must be tough.

333
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,680
Was it that obvious?

334
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,080
No.

335
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,080
I felt even sorrier
because it didn't show.

336
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,590
You don't have to suffer alone.

337
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,920
When things are tough,
just say it is so.

338
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,730
It would've been harder
to hang in there...

339
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,400
if it hadn't been for you.

340
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,470
Thank you.

341
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm telling you.

342
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,420
You make the best instant coffee...

343
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,590
in this country.

344
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,820
It's so delicious.

345
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,160
I should've made it more often
while you were my neighbor.

346
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,500
I didn't expect you
to close your business so soon.

347
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,030
I never got a chance
to say goodbye...

348
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,440
after putting the store up for lease,
so I came to do that.

349
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,840
Otherwise, it would've been so cold
between you and me.

350
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,380
Oh Seong is busy investing,
so he hasn't been here often, right?

351
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,050
He looked busy doing this and that.

352
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,250
Anyway, how did you know?

353
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,320
We aren't strangers.

354
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,850
I have a way of finding out.

355
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,160
If he goes to work
dressed up like that,

356
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:43,730
every woman he runs into
may fall in love with him.

357
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,160
I'm worried.

358
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,500
You should keep him under control.

359
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,840
He'll need to bring
a decent woman into the family.

360
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,410
Tell him to look around him
instead of looking elsewhere.

361
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,040
He's not young enough
to listen to me.

362
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,210
I hope he brings someone home,
just anybody.

363
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,650
Anybody?

364
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,220
Right. What about that woman?

365
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,930
I don't see that ill-tempered woman
who worked here.

366
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,930
She quit her job.

367
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,530
She did? Why?

368
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,670
Never mind.

369
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,670
No matter what the reason is,
I'm glad she's gone.

370
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,350
Delivery.

371
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,370
Time to fill up on sugar.
Have a great day!

372
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,280
Stop right there.

373
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,090
I was leaving.
I was just about to leave.

374
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,620
Take this back.

375
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,190
I got this for you.

376
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,760
The food didn't do anything wrong.

377
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,630
We're over, and it's too much for you
to give me anything, even food.

378
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,030
- Leave.
- Yu Gyeong.

379
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,130
Stop following me.

380
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,970
I'll call the police if you do.

381
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,480
What are you doing here?

382
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,610
Don't you have any pride?

383
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,720
Why did you bring that
to your divorced ex-wife?

384
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,150
I don't need pride.

385
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,450
All I need is Yu Gyeong.

386
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,320
You're so ridiculous.

387
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,590
- Get over here. Come!
- No, I'm not leaving.

388
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,560
- Now!
- I need to see Yu Gyeong again.

389
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,930
No, I'm not leaving!

390
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,830
Don't you have any pride as a man?

391
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,600
What do you see in that awful woman
to bring her that expensive dessert?

392
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,430
She was always adorable to me.

393
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,740
I wouldn't have divorced her
if you adored her the same way.

394
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,940
We could've been happy
without children.

395
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,140
I took the entire blame
for how you treated her.

396
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,750
You always compared us
with Gi Chan...

397
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,910
and Jae In.

398
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,050
Even I, your son,
didn't want to hear that.

399
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,420
So what? Everything's over.
What do you want to do now?

400
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,020
We're going to get back together.

401
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,190
So, if you give me some money
to invest as a token of apology...

402
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,790
That mouth of yours.
I'll seal it up today.

403
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,860
I need to find a needle and thread.
Where are they?

404
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,460
Darn it.

405
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,640
It's probably better to apply
the revision to the model, right?

406
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,700
I agree.

407
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,550
I have a question about the day
my brother passed away.

408
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,120
Yes? Please ask.

409
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,760
You were the last person
who saw him.

410
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,660
Did his condition seem
out of the ordinary?

411
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,670
Or did he tell you
anything in particular?

412
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,370
I don't know.

413
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,040
I would've escorted him to the hospital
if he didn't seem well.

414
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,940
Of course.

415
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,150
So, why are you
suddenly asking about that day?

416
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,750
Jae In said something odd,

417
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,590
and I had been
dreaming about him often lately.

418
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,420
I must feel guilty...

419
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,320
for letting him pass away
without doing anything.

420
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,060
I'm sorry for bringing up
something personal during a meeting.

421
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,430
Let me look through this again.

422
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,470
Something doesn't seem right.

423
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,470
Jae In also said
something weird to me.

424
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,850
You've reached Kang Seung Woo.

425
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,490
What is it?

426
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,460
Tomorrow?

427
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,230
All right.

428
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,280
Hello, Director Kang. How are you?

429
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,520
Hello. I'm fine.

430
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,760
You don't look fine.

431
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,730
Is something going on with YL Group?

432
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,400
Why do you care?

433
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,130
Of course, I care.
I invest in this business.

434
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,730
If there's a problem here,
you better not hide it.

435
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,070
I guarantee to blow it up
if I find out much later.

436
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,040
It's not about the business,
so don't worry.

437
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,280
I'm suddenly craving a drink.

438
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,660
I quit drinking.

439
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,300
Stop tempting me.

440
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,340
What was that? I didn't tempt him.

441
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,270
He must be crazy.

442
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,910
How ridiculous.

443
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,710
I'm so out of it.

444
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,520
I forgot to reach out.

445
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,120
Where did I put my bag?

446
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,520
Where is it?

447
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,960
Where did I put it?

448
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,890
Where's my bag?

449
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,430
(Bo Ram's Fried Chicken)

450
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,990
Hello...

451
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,460
Hello.

452
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,160
How shameless you are.

453
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,660
I said
I never wanted to see you again.

454
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,630
You need to leave now.

455
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,900
I wanted to apologize...

456
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Nothing I say would be enough
to console you,

457
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,640
but I'm so sorry.

458
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,740
I don't want to hear those words
if you can't bring Do Hee back.

459
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,980
Leave!

460
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,450
A few days ago, it was my son,

461
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,220
Eun Ho's birthday.

462
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,250
What does that have to do with me?

463
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,090
I don't want to hear this, so leave.

464
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,560
Do Yun told me...

465
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,260
that Ms. Do Hee got into the accident
on her birthday.

466
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,270
On Eun Ho's birthday,
I finally realized...

467
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,310
how devastating and bitter...

468
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,540
your loss must've felt.

469
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,680
I'm so sorry.

470
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,150
You were so good to me,

471
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,820
so I always felt anxious.

472
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,460
I wanted to tell you everything,

473
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,520
but I was afraid.

474
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,360
I must've selfishly hoped
to stay by your side...

475
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,330
and at your home.

476
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,670
I'm sorry.

477
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm so sorry.

478
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,910
I became a sinner to my daughter.

479
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,310
I housed you in that room,
in Do Hee's room!

480
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,180
There's no need to say this now.

481
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,760
Don't ever show up here again,

482
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,460
and quit your job.

483
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,160
I hope never to see you again,
so leave.

484
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,130
I'm here, Ms. Jung.

485
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,240
Why are you here, Jae In?

486
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,950
Mom, why are you...

487
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,240
(Queen's House)

488
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,310
Mom?

489
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,710
Did you just call her your mom?

490
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,150
She's my mom.

491
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,450
You two are less than human.

492
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,180
How can you do this to me?

493
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,090
I killed her myself for my daughter.

494
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,590
I fell into the trap
Kang Se Ri put out.

495
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,960
I'm the one
who always takes from Jae In.

496
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,490
She can't take anything from me.

497
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,660
- A voice recorder?
- Chairman Kang left a message...

498
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,330
on a voice recorder as he died.

499
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,000
It'd be a perfect crime
if the voice recorder disappeared.

500
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,700
I'll save you.

501
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,400
You can't meet the person
you're about to meet right now! Don't go.

502
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,910
The brakes. The brakes are weird.
