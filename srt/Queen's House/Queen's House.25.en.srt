1
00:00:00,547 --> 00:00:01,707
Attempted murder?

2
00:00:01,977 --> 00:00:03,677
I didn't try to kill anyone!

3
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:08,787
Wait, what is this all about?

4
00:00:08,787 --> 00:00:09,787
(Episode 25)

5
00:00:09,787 --> 00:00:11,487
You probably remember the time when you threw up blood.

6
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:13,757
You almost died from stomach perforation.

7
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:22,997
What does that have to do with Se Ri?

8
00:00:24,037 --> 00:00:26,567
Se Ri was the one who recommended that oriental doctor.

9
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,507
Don't try to pull that on me.

10
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:30,837
Your evil mother...

11
00:00:30,937 --> 00:00:32,977
fed that to my son to kill him!

12
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:36,577
It wasn't my mother. It was Se Ri's doing.

13
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,377
What?

14
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:43,087
I kept that to myself and covered it up...

15
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:45,827
because I deemed you as my friend.

16
00:00:46,587 --> 00:00:48,687
I was naive enough to be deceived...

17
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,957
by the fake tears you shed.

18
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:56,567
Is this true?

19
00:00:57,167 --> 00:01:00,167
Jae In, you're the worst.

20
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:02,637
Are you saying I tried to kill my husband?

21
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:03,977
Why would I do that?

22
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:05,807
I adore him more than my own life.

23
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:06,907
Why would I kill him?

24
00:01:07,147 --> 00:01:08,577
Everything will come to light...

25
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:10,017
once you get questioned face-to-face...

26
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:11,377
with the oriental doctor at the police station.

27
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:16,487
Jae In, doing this won't make him return to you.

28
00:01:17,117 --> 00:01:19,357
Don't be ridiculous. Wake up.

29
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:21,357
I'm over him, too.

30
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,197
I'd turn him down even if he wanted me.

31
00:01:23,557 --> 00:01:24,627
You can have him.

32
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:26,967
Let's go.

33
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,427
We received a report, so we must conduct an investigation.

34
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:31,437
Let go of me. Let go.

35
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:33,507
Honey, I didn't do it.

36
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:35,367
It really wasn't me, honey.

37
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:42,417
My goodness.

38
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,487
Congratulations on having an attempted murderer...

39
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:48,717
as your new daughter-in-law.

40
00:01:49,087 --> 00:01:52,287
What did you say? Hey!

41
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:55,527
Oh, my. What is...

42
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:58,897
My goodness.

43
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:01,727
Wait, I really didn't do it.

44
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:04,067
Why are you doing this to me? It wasn't me!

45
00:02:05,497 --> 00:02:07,807
Honey, it really wasn't me.

46
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:09,037
She's slandering me.

47
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:11,077
Be quiet. What if the employees see you?

48
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:12,577
You believe me, right?

49
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:14,607
You're the only one for me.

50
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:16,217
I get it, so go quietly.

51
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:17,817
I'll be there right away.

52
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:20,787
Come with us.

53
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:22,357
Fine.

54
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,657
I need to use the restroom before I go.

55
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:30,297
Where's my phone?

56
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:43,777
Will you play dirty until the end?

57
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:46,747
Didn't you do enough damage when you ruined my wedding?

58
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:48,807
Get your disgusting hand off me.

59
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:51,077
How dare you touch me?

60
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:55,787
You've turned into your mother.

61
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,517
Did you just say dare?

62
00:02:58,317 --> 00:02:59,587
Who do you think you are?

63
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,127
The word dare is...

64
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:02,997
too good for a scumbag like you.

65
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:04,957
You reek of trashy smell.

66
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,337
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

67
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:11,667
You're wrong.

68
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:15,007
I'm not trying to fight you. I'll simply right the wrongs.

69
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,537
I'll expose everything...

70
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:20,647
you have done to me and set the record straight.

71
00:03:21,347 --> 00:03:22,777
A scumbag like you...

72
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,047
cannot take my dad's position.

73
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:32,687
Don't you want to know how I'll reveal everything?

74
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:35,357
Look forward to it.

75
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,597
She must've forgotten it since she left in a hurry.

76
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:48,367
I thought she'd be a great partner for Do Yun.

77
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:55,917
I'm sorry. I think I left my phone here.

78
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:58,047
I just found it in the room.

79
00:03:58,517 --> 00:03:59,587
Thank you.

80
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:02,017
Anyway, why do you look so pale?

81
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,017
Have a seat.

82
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:09,357
It's all right. I should go. I've caused enough trouble.

83
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:11,457
Goodness, just have a seat.

84
00:04:12,157 --> 00:04:14,267
You look like you'll collapse any minute now,

85
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,797
so have a cup of water before you leave.

86
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,507
I thought barley tea should do good for you.

87
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:30,677
I just boiled it, so it's still hot.

88
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,147
Make sure you blow it well as you drink it.

89
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,447
I will. Thank you.

90
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:39,627
You know, Bo Ram told me...

91
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,657
you were her kindergarten friend's mommy.

92
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:44,857
Yes, that's right.

93
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,967
Didn't you say you were looking for a place to stay this morning?

94
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:51,397
Where's the child's dad?

95
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:54,067
We got divorced.

96
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:57,137
Oh, my. I shouldn't have asked.

97
00:04:58,137 --> 00:04:59,247
It's all right.

98
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:04,277
So? Have you found a place?

99
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,017
Not yet.

100
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,187
I need to look around some more.

101
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:12,457
In that case,

102
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:15,287
why don't you stay here until you find another place?

103
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:17,527
No one's using that room.

104
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,997
I don't know the whole story, but you have nowhere else to go.

105
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:23,867
Still, I can't do that.

106
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:25,537
But thank you for the offer.

107
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:29,277
Goodness, I hate people who are just talk.

108
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:31,337
I couldn't pay you back for the fried chicken I didn't deliver.

109
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:32,977
Let's call that and your rent even.

110
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:34,777
You don't have to worry about it.

111
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:36,517
Feel free to stick around until you find a place.

112
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:41,447
Bo Ram told me you were her friend's mother,

113
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:43,357
so it felt like you were my daughter.

114
00:05:52,457 --> 00:05:53,567
Mother...

115
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:58,937
She won't even pick up her phone. Where did she go?

116
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:01,667
I heard she wasn't at her business, either.

117
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,107
Na Ra, bring me some cold water.

118
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:09,817
Is she not around?

119
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:13,917
Mother, where have you been?

120
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:15,887
Do you think you're a detective?

121
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,257
Did I do something wrong?

122
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:18,957
Why are you prying?

123
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:20,987
I already have a huge headache.

124
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:23,257
Good grief.

125
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:25,457
Jae In knows everything.

126
00:06:26,497 --> 00:06:27,597
What do I do?

127
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:30,197
I mean the sleeping pills.

128
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:32,037
She came and had a go at me...

129
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,707
after finding out I prescribed it.

130
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:39,007
Did you give her my name?

131
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:42,847
How can you do this?

132
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:44,747
You're just awful.

133
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:46,887
I wasn't lying.

134
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,847
I told her you prescribed the medicine.

135
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:49,957
Is that my fault?

136
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:51,687
Don't you know what our relationship is like?

137
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,357
We're friends.

138
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,727
Hey, is your friend more important than your family?

139
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:58,497
That's not something you even need to discuss.

140
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:03,497
Forget that. Tell me about Se Ri.

141
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,167
What's she really like?

142
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:06,667
You'd know what she was like...

143
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,937
if you two were friends in high school.

144
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,477
She was close to Jae In, but not me.

145
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,207
My goodness.

146
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,807
People you trust are the ones who betray you the hardest.

147
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:18,017
My head hurts. Good grief.

148
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:20,847
I've welcomed an attempted murderer as my daughter-in-law.

149
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,147
What now?

150
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,487
What are you talking about?

151
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:29,297
Attempted murder? Who?

152
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:31,597
Didn't you hear what I just said?

153
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:34,297
Se Ri tried to kill my son!

154
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,067
How do all my daughters-in-law turn out to be flawed?

155
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:41,567
You're the biggest problem.

156
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:44,237
You're the root of all my family problems.

157
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,477
You only associated...

158
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,177
with these problematic women...

159
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,617
and brought them into my house.

160
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:52,817
Are you trying to ruin my life?

161
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,547
You're taking this way too far.

162
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:59,287
There's a limit to my patience.

163
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,527
What can you do anyway?

164
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,167
My gosh.

165
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:08,797
How dare she glare at me like that?

166
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,537
Good grief. What has the world become?

167
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,307
We're facing the apocalypse.

168
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:20,877
Do you still not trust me?

169
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:24,147
You came to the police station and saw everything.

170
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:26,217
This is your last chance.

171
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:28,487
Tell me the truth.

172
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:32,087
You really don't trust me, do you?

173
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:36,057
I gave you my everything. How can you not trust me?

174
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,957
I saw the oriental doctor's written statement from the past.

175
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:41,397
Yes, Jae In asked me about the doctor,

176
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:43,597
so it was true that I referred to his office.

177
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:46,907
I don't know if it was Jae In or her mother who went there.

178
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:49,067
What did the doctor say?

179
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:52,177
Jae In said I'd be set up for a face-to-face questioning,

180
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:54,007
but he never showed up.

181
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,547
I was going to nitpick over this as soon as I met him.

182
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,177
I wanted to know why he was dragging me...

183
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:01,117
into his trouble.

184
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:03,057
Let's say...

185
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,757
I really tried to kill you just as Jae In claimed.

186
00:09:06,127 --> 00:09:07,887
I may have been her friend,

187
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,657
but she should've reported me instead of forgiving me.

188
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:13,667
How can she forgive me when I tried to kill her husband?

189
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,297
That makes no sense.

190
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:18,667
You've been deceived by her.

191
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:21,637
She's slandering me to come between us.

192
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:24,507
What would I get after killing you?

193
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:28,147
I'll only end up taking Ji Ho's dad away from him.

194
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:32,047
Was this the level of faith you had in me?

195
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:35,587
How can you believe Jae In and not my words?

196
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:36,887
How?

197
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:50,537
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:00,907
Hello?

199
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:02,207
Where are you?

200
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,047
Have you lost your mind?

201
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,017
Why would you go to the police station?

202
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:07,147
Turn away now.

203
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:11,057
I'll give you money!

204
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,727
I'll pay you, so turn around right now.

205
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:18,557
I've dropped the charges as the victim,

206
00:10:18,997 --> 00:10:21,967
so Jae In won't be able to make an issue out of this anymore.

207
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:24,397
Don't cry.

208
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:31,007
Jae In, you'll never win against me.

209
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:36,977
Should we eat out tonight?

210
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,287
Hello, Reporter Kim.

211
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:50,157
A press conference?

212
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:54,527
I'll send you the address. Be there after work.

213
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,567
It'll be our new place.

214
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,637
Okay. Does Jae In know?

215
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:02,807
I thought it'd be uncomfortable for all of us,

216
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,407
so we decided to live away from each other for a while.

217
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,617
Do you know about this press conference, too?

218
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:13,817
As I expected, you didn't know.

219
00:11:14,647 --> 00:11:17,157
Jae In is holding a press conference tomorrow.

220
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,527
She called all reporters at TV stations and newspapers.

221
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:22,457
What's she going to discuss?

222
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:24,927
It's probably about me and YL Group.

223
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,967
She has lost her mind after failing to become the chair.

224
00:11:28,097 --> 00:11:29,227
She's gone completely insane.

225
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:32,437
She even came to me and threatened to expose everything.

226
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,237
- She said that? - Yes.

227
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:38,337
She said she'd destroy both me and YL Group,

228
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:40,147
and told me to look forward to it.

229
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:48,887
Hello?

230
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:50,987
I called about your suitcase. Where are you?

231
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,787
All right.

232
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:04,637
Hello. My name is Hwang Na Ra.

233
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:06,307
Are you unwell?

234
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:07,937
No, I'm not.

235
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:09,167
Then, please come by next time.

236
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,207
Something urgent came up for me. I'm sorry.

237
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:12,437
What?

238
00:12:13,077 --> 00:12:14,107
What?

239
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:16,877
Darn it. I should've said I was unwell.

240
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:18,447
That was stupid of me.

241
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:22,147
"The time..."

242
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:25,357
Ms. Kang, how do I read this?

243
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:28,387
"Began to dream..."

244
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:29,387
Uncle Do Yun!

245
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:30,727
Hey, you got home early.

246
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:32,897
I'll leave your clothes in the room.

247
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,027
Okay.

248
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:39,937
I told her to stay here until she found a place.

249
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:42,707
Ms. Kang, let's play a game.

250
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:43,977
Shall we?

251
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:51,347
Look how excited Bo Ram is.

252
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:53,117
She must be happy to have her here.

253
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:56,457
She kept asking her to read a book, play, and watch TV.

254
00:12:56,587 --> 00:12:59,057
She's been glued to her side as soon as she came home.

255
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:01,387
You should've asked me first.

256
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,297
Why did you decide on this alone?

257
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:05,657
Do you feel uncomfortable?

258
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:07,827
Why would I be happy...

259
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:09,997
to have a stranger at home? It's uncomfortable.

260
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,137
I felt bad for her.

261
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:16,437
It looked like she recently got divorced. Did you know?

262
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,737
How would I know anything about her personal life?

263
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:21,007
That must be why she's looking for a place.

264
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:22,777
I didn't ask her,

265
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:26,147
but it seemed like she couldn't stay with her old family, either.

266
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,687
It may feel uncomfortable, but stay with Oh Seong for a while.

267
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:31,057
Think of this as good karma.

268
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:34,957
You said helping someone in need was...

269
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:36,127
good karma for our family.

270
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:39,697
She might be a guest Do Hee sent us.

271
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,337
You should wash up and come out.

272
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,437
I need to make dinner.

273
00:13:53,807 --> 00:13:55,647
This is mine.

274
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:58,977
This is yours.

275
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:02,987
Wait, Eun Ho gave me these stickers.

276
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:09,657
Ms. Kang.

277
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,797
Which kindergarten did he go to?

278
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:15,567
I miss him.

279
00:14:22,067 --> 00:14:24,307
Bo Ram, I'm thirsty.

280
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:25,477
Can you bring me some water?

281
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:26,707
Okay.

282
00:14:30,777 --> 00:14:33,087
It must've been a surprise.

283
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:35,317
I should've told you first.

284
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,387
Please don't share...

285
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:40,457
anything about your personal life with my family...

286
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:41,587
during your stay.

287
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,157
That includes YL Group.

288
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,027
It was all over the news as a hot topic,

289
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:48,397
so it could make everyone feel uncomfortable.

290
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:51,637
Right. I'll do that.

291
00:14:52,667 --> 00:14:54,467
Thank you for your concern.

292
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:02,077
So, everything was a lie?

293
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:05,017
Jae In made up everything?

294
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:06,847
Yes.

295
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,687
She pulled a trick to come between us.

296
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:13,627
What a sly woman.

297
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,087
That's not all.

298
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:17,627
She called reporters and said she'd hold a press conference.

299
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,467
I'll handle it. Don't worry.

300
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:26,467
I'm home.

301
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:31,277
Gosh, Mom. You need to come to the business.

302
00:15:31,407 --> 00:15:33,877
I had to run the kitchen, get the counter, and serve the food.

303
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:35,807
I'm just one man.

304
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:38,077
You're making this well-educated man do physical labor.

305
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:40,047
I should report you to the Ministry of Employment.

306
00:15:40,047 --> 00:15:41,117
What now?

307
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:44,717
So? Are you actually going to report me?

308
00:15:45,157 --> 00:15:47,127
She was unwell today.

309
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:48,827
She's just pretending.

310
00:15:49,127 --> 00:15:51,127
You're now our family, so I thought you should know.

311
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:53,097
When things don't go her way...

312
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:54,867
or when she gets annoyed, she lies down first.

313
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,397
That's her thing.

314
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:57,737
Shut your mouth!

315
00:15:57,897 --> 00:16:00,937
The least you should be doing is asking me if I were all right.

316
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:02,267
What now? I'm faking it?

317
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,807
You just made me feel much worse than before.

318
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:08,407
I told you to bring me water! What's taking you so long?

319
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:12,477
Here.

320
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:14,087
Did you have to get it from a well?

321
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,017
You're awfully slow.

322
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:25,127
I finally feel better.

323
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:26,497
I need to get some rest.

324
00:16:27,297 --> 00:16:28,867
Goodnight, Mother.

325
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:29,897
Goodnight.

326
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:31,597
Why aren't you saying anything?

327
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:34,137
Goodnight.

328
00:16:34,237 --> 00:16:35,667
I had to force you to do that.

329
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:52,857
The person you have reached is unavailable.

330
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,227
Please leave a message...

331
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,267
Mr. Do, the reporters won't pick up my call,

332
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:05,537
and no one is here yet.

333
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:08,637
Gi Chan must've noticed and stopped this.

334
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:11,437
I talked to a reporter I knew on my way here,

335
00:17:11,937 --> 00:17:15,347
and YL Group sent out an official statement to them.

336
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:19,347
YL threatened and said they'd sue them...

337
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:22,787
if they spread false information regarding YL and Gi Chan.

338
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:26,357
Even so, they should've heard me out before they became a judge.

339
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:28,687
Even the higher-ups in press companies...

340
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:29,997
stopped them from coming.

341
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,227
They must've had a talk with those in power already.

342
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:13,367
I thought of you while I made a new menu at my business.

343
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,837
Why were you crying?

344
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,537
Did something happen?

345
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,977
I don't know what it's about, but hang in there.

346
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:25,777
Time heals everything.

347
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:28,017
You'll face a better day soon.

348
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,217
Do you really think so?

349
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:32,087
Of course.

350
00:18:34,327 --> 00:18:35,457
I miss...

351
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:38,297
I miss Eun Ho so much.

352
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:42,697
I miss him so much that it's driving me crazy.

353
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,267
What do I do now?

354
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:48,367
I can't live without him.

355
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,507
How can I go on?

356
00:18:52,607 --> 00:18:55,507
Hey, why don't you meet with your husband?

357
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:58,277
You aren't a stranger, and you want to see your child.

358
00:18:58,277 --> 00:19:00,547
If you beg him, I'm sure he'll let you in.

359
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:03,617
Even if you two become mortal enemies,

360
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,087
things may be different when it comes to your child,

361
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,957
so you should talk to him. Okay?

362
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:16,937
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

363
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:20,407
Hello?

364
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:22,937
Yes, I'm Eun Ho's father.

365
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:27,347
He's unwell? How?

366
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:31,647
All right.

367
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:37,087
It's me.

368
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:40,187
Didn't the kindergarten call you?

369
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:44,727
- Eun Ho is sick, so you should go. - You can't come in!

370
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:47,167
- I just need to talk to him. - Please don't do this.

371
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:51,737
Gi Chan, I need to talk to you.

372
00:19:58,277 --> 00:19:59,707
Do you have anything more to say?

373
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,377
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,277
I'm sorry for everything.

375
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:08,087
I apologize.

376
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:09,887
What's your plan now?

377
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:12,657
How do you plan on stabbing my back this time...

378
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,927
by first bowing down to me?

379
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:17,027
I don't have a plan.

380
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:18,527
If my mom and I...

381
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:20,697
hurt you in any way, let me I apologize.

382
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:23,097
I'll forget everything you did to me.

383
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,067
However, just let me see Eun Ho.

384
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:28,107
Let me see him. No.

385
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,237
Let me raise him.

386
00:20:33,277 --> 00:20:35,807
Gi Chan, I beg you.

387
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,677
Please let me raise Eun Ho.

388
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:42,917
I can't live without him. Please?

389
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:47,087
Please help me. Please.

390
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:53,527
Drop all your suits against me.

391
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,937
I will. I'll do everything as you say,

392
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:59,367
so just send Eun Ho to me. That's all I want.

393
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:01,707
Says who?

394
00:21:03,437 --> 00:21:04,807
I'm going to raise Eun Ho.

395
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:07,347
He's my son, Se Ri.

396
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:08,847
Let me raise him.

397
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:09,907
Have you forgotten?

398
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:11,647
We're married.

399
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:12,947
Eun Ho's my son now.

400
00:21:13,787 --> 00:21:15,587
How can you be so brazen?

401
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,387
How can you return here after treating me like a murderer?

402
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,827
Everything was true. You...

403
00:21:22,987 --> 00:21:25,097
Go ahead and continue to speak such nonsense.

404
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,267
I felt a bit guilty about everything,

405
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:30,197
so I put up with your nonsense.

406
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,267
But no, not anymore.

407
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:34,467
Now, continue.

408
00:21:36,737 --> 00:21:38,577
Just let me be with Eun Ho.

409
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,207
Then, you won't have to see me again.

410
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:45,277
In that case, you should be begging me earnestly.

411
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:47,187
Apologize...

412
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:49,487
for making me a murderer...

413
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,987
and forcing me to change my name!

414
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:53,487
Apologize for everything.

415
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:56,587
Mom, I told you. It was a misunderstanding.

416
00:21:56,687 --> 00:21:58,497
Our name, age, and school were all identical,

417
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:00,327
so people took us wrong.

418
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:03,227
Right, Jae In? Isn't that so?

419
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:04,967
Stop calling her that.

420
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:06,597
Jae In.

421
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:08,637
You're the one and only Kang Jae In, and that's enough.

422
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:10,837
No one can imitate you.

423
00:22:12,037 --> 00:22:13,477
Change her name first.

424
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:14,707
Yes, of course.

425
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:16,147
Mom, that's crazy.

426
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,777
It's just a name.

427
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:18,877
Ms. Jae In.

428
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,617
She's right.

429
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,217
Ms. Choi, I'll change her name.

430
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:24,557
I promise.

431
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,787
You need to apologize to Ms. Jae In.

432
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:30,757
I'm sorry.

433
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:35,167
If I hear the name Kang Jae In again,

434
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,097
this won't be the end of it.

435
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,777
I still remember that day like it was yesterday.

436
00:22:45,607 --> 00:22:48,147
You need to kneel and apologize to me!

437
00:23:00,327 --> 00:23:01,427
I'm sorry.

438
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:10,197
Drop the suits first.

439
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:12,067
I'll call you, so go.

440
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:20,747
Why did you let her go?

441
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:22,607
I need her to apologize to me!

442
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:23,677
That's enough.

443
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:25,517
She already said she was sorry.

444
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,287
You didn't have to make her kneel.

445
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,817
My mom and I knelt before her...

446
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:31,617
while my teachers were watching.

447
00:23:32,087 --> 00:23:33,987
That had been the biggest spite of my life.

448
00:23:35,657 --> 00:23:38,597
My mother-in-law had a knack for creating enemies.

449
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:40,867
Your mother-in-law?

450
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:43,767
It's just a habit.

451
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:46,337
I told you to go see Eun Ho.

452
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:49,607
I'm leaving. I'll go.

453
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:18,637
Mommy...

454
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:36,387
Tomorrow's Ji Ho's birthday. What should we do?

455
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:38,717
Should we invite his friends and hold a birthday party?

456
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:41,257
But it's also his first birthday with his family,

457
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:42,357
so should we have a family dinner?

458
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,527
I think it'll be better...

459
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:46,457
if we let Eun Ho go with Jae In.

460
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,727
I told you I'd raise him!

461
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:52,197
He's having trouble adjusting.

462
00:24:52,697 --> 00:24:53,867
Look at how he fell sick.

463
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:56,207
It's because he was psychologically unwell.

464
00:24:57,807 --> 00:24:59,207
He'll get better.

465
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:00,707
I'll pay more attention.

466
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:02,847
Anyway, about Ji Ho's birthday...

467
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:04,417
Jae In dropped the suits right away,

468
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:07,517
and I promised to let Eun Ho go in return.

469
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:12,357
Daddy, Grandma wants to see you.

470
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:13,927
Okay.

471
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,527
Mommy, let's play.

472
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:25,297
Give me a moment. I'm busy right now.

473
00:25:26,037 --> 00:25:27,107
You should play alone.

474
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:29,137
Okay.

475
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:36,407
Did he just bring up Eun Ho while I talked about Ji Ho?

476
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:38,377
He doesn't care about Ji Ho.

477
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:40,647
If Jae In gets Eun Ho,

478
00:25:40,647 --> 00:25:42,147
they can use him as an excuse to keep meeting each other.

479
00:25:43,757 --> 00:25:45,587
And he already took her side this afternoon.

480
00:25:45,687 --> 00:25:47,357
His feelings might have been moved already.

481
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:49,887
I can't let this happen.

482
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,627
Jae In, you keep standing in my way,

483
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:54,367
and I won't let you have your way anymore.

484
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:11,847
(Se Ri)

485
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:16,147
Hello?

486
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:21,527
Are you serious?

487
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:24,497
You'll let me see him?

488
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:25,857
Yes.

489
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:28,767
I'll see you at the crosswalk at his old kindergarten...

490
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:29,967
at three o'clock.

491
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,967
But don't say anything to my husband.

492
00:26:33,497 --> 00:26:35,367
He didn't want you to see him yet.

493
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:36,867
I wanted to respect his decision,

494
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:40,177
but I understood you as a fellow mother,

495
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:41,547
so I decided to let you see him quietly.

496
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,717
Thank you, Se Ri.

497
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:07,807
Eun Ho.

498
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:15,047
Eun Ho, my mommy said...

499
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,347
she'd let you meet your mommy.

500
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:19,577
Really?

501
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:22,487
Yes, I just heard her...

502
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:23,687
talking on the phone.

503
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:26,587
She'll meet her at the crosswalk...

504
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:28,087
in front of your old kindergarten.

505
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:31,257
Eun Ho, you'll meet her soon,

506
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:32,827
so don't be sick anymore.

507
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:49,707
Do Hee...

508
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:52,577
You're up.

509
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:56,747
Yes.

510
00:27:57,387 --> 00:27:58,517
What's all this?

511
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:01,987
I'm going to meet Eun Ho today.

512
00:28:02,187 --> 00:28:05,327
Gosh, something smells delicious.

513
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:08,227
You're a good cook.

514
00:28:08,697 --> 00:28:10,797
I made enough for you to have with Bo Ram.

515
00:28:11,297 --> 00:28:12,737
And please speak casually with me.

516
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:14,807
Your face brightened up.

517
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:16,137
I didn't know you were such a happy woman.

518
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:20,337
Anyway, I'm happy that you'll get to reunite with your son.

519
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,447
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Jung.

520
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:24,077
Thank you.

521
00:28:24,277 --> 00:28:25,517
Don't mention it.

522
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:33,117
It's seasoned perfectly.

523
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:35,487
You should try some, too. You love this.

524
00:28:36,027 --> 00:28:37,257
I don't have an appetite.

525
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:41,767
Why is he suddenly acting so curtly?

526
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,397
Did he not sleep well?

527
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,197
I must've done something wrong.

528
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:48,937
Goodness, no. You don't have to mind him.

529
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:50,637
You should get ready and go.

530
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:52,977
Okay.

531
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:54,977
It's really good.

532
00:28:58,177 --> 00:28:59,247
Here.

533
00:28:59,877 --> 00:29:01,087
It's a birthday present.

534
00:29:01,747 --> 00:29:04,317
Gosh, I really wanted this robot!

535
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:05,987
Is it really for me?

536
00:29:06,857 --> 00:29:08,087
Happy birthday.

537
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:10,087
Thank you, Eun Ho!

538
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:13,127
Thank you for telling me that I'll meet my mom.

539
00:29:15,427 --> 00:29:16,497
Gosh.

540
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:20,767
The catering service will get here on time, right?

541
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:21,867
Ms. Kang.

542
00:29:22,807 --> 00:29:24,207
I thought I was going to see my mommy.

543
00:29:24,537 --> 00:29:25,877
See your mommy?

544
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:28,847
You promised her to let me see her.

545
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:30,977
What are you talking about, Eun Ho?

546
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:32,447
I never said that.

547
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:34,417
What's with all the noise?

548
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:37,117
Eun Ho must've been dreaming.

549
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:39,917
Today is Ji Ho's birthday, Eun Ho.

550
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,927
You should be here to celebrate with him.

551
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:47,567
What have you done, Eun Ho?

552
00:29:47,797 --> 00:29:50,027
She's a liar!

553
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:53,067
I want to go see Mommy!

554
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:54,407
Stop crying!

555
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:56,067
Go to your room.

556
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:58,907
Go there and think about what you did wrong. Now!

557
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:02,647
Fine.

558
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:06,647
Mommy...

559
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:27,907
Mommy!

560
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:30,707
Mommy!

561
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,507
Mommy!

562
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:37,777
Mommy!

563
00:30:55,427 --> 00:30:58,767
Happy birthday to you

564
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:02,107
Happy birthday to you

565
00:31:02,207 --> 00:31:05,907
Happy birthday, dear Ji Ho

566
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:08,977
Happy birthday to you

567
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:14,247
- That's it! - All right!

568
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:17,387
Happy birthday, Ji Ho.

569
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:18,657
This is a present from Daddy.

570
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:23,857
My gosh. I wanted this!

571
00:31:23,857 --> 00:31:25,627
Thank you, Daddy!

572
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:27,327
- Sure, Ji Ho. - Let the competition begin!

573
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:29,367
This is a present from your uncle and auntie.

574
00:31:29,927 --> 00:31:31,567
Your uncle prepared a present, too.

575
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:32,667
- Let's open it. - This is from Auntie Na Ra!

576
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:35,707
- Auntie Na Ra's present! - Auntie Na Ra has one, too!

577
00:31:37,907 --> 00:31:39,137
Take this.

578
00:31:39,837 --> 00:31:40,907
Why don't we open it?

579
00:31:40,907 --> 00:31:42,207
Okay.

580
00:31:45,277 --> 00:31:48,487
Gosh, you got so many presents.

581
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:51,117
The person you have reached is unavailable.

582
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:52,357
Please leave a message after...

583
00:31:58,657 --> 00:32:00,997
(Se Ri)

584
00:32:01,897 --> 00:32:03,197
Mommy!

585
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:05,497
Mommy!

586
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:06,567
Eun Ho!

587
00:32:07,237 --> 00:32:08,807
How did you get here alone?

588
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,507
I took a taxi by myself.

589
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:14,877
I'm not a baby anymore, right?

590
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:19,417
Eun Ho, stay there.

591
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:21,217
I'll cross over when the light turns green.

592
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:23,047
Okay!

593
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:32,317
(Queen's House)

594
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:34,187
Eun Ho's gone.

595
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,627
I don't see him anywhere.

596
00:33:35,887 --> 00:33:37,697
Will Eun Ho live with his mommy?

597
00:33:38,127 --> 00:33:39,627
He went to see her.

598
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:42,067
How do you know that?

599
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,467
Yes.

600
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:46,697
I had a dream.

601
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:50,007
I'm so glad it was just a dream.

602
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:51,977
Just get the CCTV footage and track him down.

603
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:53,607
What's taking you so long?

604
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:55,077
Daddy!

605
00:33:58,547 --> 00:33:59,647
Eun Ho.
