(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,010
(Episode 85)

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,250
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,890
What's going on?

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,460
What?

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,690
Hong Man Su was caught
kidnapping Kang Jae In.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,430
The police are heading to the scene
to take him in.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,970
Were you the one who ordered this?

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,200
It wasn't me!

12
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,500
Didn't I say to catch that lunatic,
Hong Man Su?

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,970
Is Jae In okay?

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,040
Where is the scene?

15
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,050
Got it.

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,250
That jerk...

17
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,160
I told him not to make a move
without my permission.

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,730
I think I finally understand now...

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,770
why it bothers me so much...

20
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,200
when you're hurting or struggling.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,740
Now I know why.

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,010
Jae In.

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,920
I love you.

24
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,530
- Do Yun...
- Please, let me finish.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,030
I'm not asking you
to accept my love right now.

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,270
I'm not suggesting we start anything
right away, either.

27
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,370
For now...

28
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,770
When you're in danger
like just now...

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,340
and when you struggle or feel lost,

30
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,580
I hope that I can be...

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,750
the first person you think of.

32
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,550
That's enough for me.

33
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,090
I'm not asking for anything more.

34
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,500
Thank you.

35
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,870
And...

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,070
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,400
Right now, all I think about...

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,770
is getting revenge
for Eun Ho and my father.

39
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,480
My own happiness or love...

40
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,020
They feel like selfish luxuries
I can't afford.

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,850
I understand.

42
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,120
I hesitate to say this...

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,120
for Do Hee.

44
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,260
But...

45
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,400
I still wanted to tell you
how I feel.

46
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,910
All I can say for now is this.

47
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,120
When this is all over,

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,350
after we clear Do Hee's name,

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,090
and get justice for Eun Ho
and my father,

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,430
let's talk again then.

51
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,830
Just hearing you say that
is enough for now.

52
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,990
What do you think you're doing here?

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,990
I heard you were kidnapped.
Are you all right?

54
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,270
Go ahead.

55
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,040
Don't worry about me. Just go.

56
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,410
Jae In, wait.

57
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,250
That's enough.

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,820
What do you think you're doing,
keeping someone who was kidnapped?

59
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,490
You want to know?
Fine, I'll tell you.

60
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,860
I just confessed my feelings
to Jae In.

61
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,830
You'd better know your place.

62
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,070
Who do you think you are?

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,440
The way you're acting right now,

64
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,810
is a classic inferiority complex.

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,150
- What did you say?
- At least I can be honest with her.

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,020
You, on the other hand,
don't even have that right.

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,420
You had someone so precious
right by your side,

68
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,930
but you're the one
who blew every chance you had.

69
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,060
So don't you dare come around now
acting like you're somebody.

70
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,700
It's pathetic.

71
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,840
Kang Jae In forced me to confess,
and she recorded it for the police.

72
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,210
I told them I was calling my lawyer,
but I called you.

73
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,080
- You have to get me out of here.
- What exactly did you say?

74
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,250
That I kidnapped Hwang Eun Ho,

75
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,550
that you told me to kill Jae In,

76
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,650
that Eun Ho died,

77
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,390
and that you told me
to kidnap Kang Jae In's mother.

78
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,330
Are you insane?
After all the money I gave you,

79
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,260
how could you spill everything
like that?

80
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,200
Look, a recording made under duress
isn't admissible in court,

81
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,540
and other than your word,
they have no other evidence.

82
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,140
So just keep your mouth shut.

83
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,810
I'm the only one who can get you
out of this.

84
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,350
"Hey, Sook Ja, get a grip!"

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,690
I should report this jerk too.

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,620
How dare they call me just "Sook Ja"
without respect?

87
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,360
"Hey, Sook Ja?"

88
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,660
Mom, is there even a point to this?

89
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,700
I mean, I'm taking screenshots
of every single one to report them,

90
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,200
but it's harder to find one
that isn't a malicious comment.

91
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,940
"Noh Sook Ja",
with five exclamation marks!

92
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,610
"Die, you crazy mother-in-law!"

93
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,780
"Chairman Hwang Gi Chan of YL Group,
I hope you die too, you cheater!"

94
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,180
Are you serious? Stop reading those!

95
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,950
Mom, your name's all over this.

96
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,780
"Look at his mother,
No wonder he turned out like that "

97
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,520
"Looking for party members
to commit Noh Sook Ja."

98
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,920
Darn it!
The troll isn't a stranger online,

99
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,060
and he's right here.

100
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,290
Shut your mouth!

101
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,500
Oh, Gi Chan, perfect timing.
Come take a look at this.

102
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,140
Everyone who watched
that Expose World video...

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,370
is harassing us.

104
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,740
It feels like they just don't stop it.

105
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,240
Now they're at it again.

106
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,740
So, is it okay to just report them
and leave it at that?

107
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,250
I'm talking about reopening
Kim Do Hee's case.

108
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,150
They've been bothering me a lot
because of it.

109
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,620
What are people saying?

110
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,360
They say Jae In's mom
killed Kim Do Hee...

111
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,320
mistaking her for your mistress.

112
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:05,000
But since you had an affair,
and now Se Ri is your mistress,

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,060
they say you and Se Ri
should share the blame,

114
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,130
no matter who the killer is.

115
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,070
Something like that.

116
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,610
Now that I say it out loud,
they kind of have a point.

117
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,940
Excuse me, Na Ra,
who are you calling a mistress?

118
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,510
Why are you dwelling on the past?
The present is what matters.

119
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,650
I'm Gi Chan's lawful wife now.

120
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,920
Besides, who told her to jump
to conclusions and kill someone?

121
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,220
That's Ja Young's fault.

122
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,490
- Isn't that right, Mother?
- Of course it is.

123
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,160
Ja Young is the one
who needs to take responsibility.

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,630
The killer must be Choi Ja Young...

125
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,460
even if the police
start the reinvestigation.

126
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,600
She just has to be.

127
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
Follow me.

128
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,720
I told you not to act so recklessly.

129
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,620
Who are you to
order someone to kill Jae In?

130
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,360
Fine. Then you might as well
just kill me.

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,490
Because that's the only way
you'll ever get rid of me.

132
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,770
This is all your fault.

133
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,110
Do you think I want to kill her
because I'm hung up on the past?

134
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,310
No.

135
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,620
The more you want her instead of me,
the more you seek her out,

136
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,550
the more I turn into this.

137
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,660
You're the one who drove me to this.

138
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,360
It's all up to you.

139
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,030
I'm the only woman for you.

140
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,670
I'm your only wife
and the only mother of your child.

141
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,910
Your secrets are our secrets,

142
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,880
and your shame is our shame.

143
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,650
So from now on,
you focus only on me.

144
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,820
Or else, even I don't know
what I'll do next.

145
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,540
I was being blackmailed at the time.
I just said whatever came to mind.

146
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,970
This is so unfair.

147
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,010
If you're not going to believe me,
I'm exercising my right to silence.

148
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,650
You're questioning me
with a voice recording...

149
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,680
that was coerced to be testimony?

150
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,720
Did you order a hit on Kang Jae In?

151
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,820
How many times do I have to tell you
it wasn't me?

152
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,390
Do you have any proof it was me?
Any concrete evidence?

153
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,090
Of course, you don't.

154
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,500
If you had any evidence, you
wouldn't be testing me like this.

155
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,340
Call me back
when you have some actual evidence.

156
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,110
And stop dragging an innocent person
down here.

157
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,510
I'll stay and handle the rest.
You may leave first.

158
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,760
(YL Planning and Design Team)

159
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,990
So, right now...

160
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,130
are you telling me Kang Se Ri
is being questioned by the police?

161
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,830
Yes.

162
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,500
Kang Se Ri is a psycho, isn't she?
Murder, kidnapping...

163
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,200
Jae In, from now on,
let's commute together.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,510
I'll keep you safe.

165
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,040
You should, Jae In.

166
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,710
You never know what she'll do next.

167
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,250
Kang Se Ri will have to lay low
for a while.

168
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,220
Hong Man Su, who she used to order
around like a servant, kidnapped me.

169
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,690
As the victim, I was an eyewitness
and already gave my testimony.

170
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,990
So even if we can't prove
her other crimes,

171
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,490
they said she won't be able to avoid
being arrested for this incident.

172
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,530
My apologies for being late.

173
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,440
You have the nerve
to show up for work?

174
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,710
You ordered Jae In's kidnapping,
and you dare to show your face here?

175
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,980
In a way, I'm almost impressed.

176
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,120
I don't know what you've heard,
but I haven't done anything wrong.

177
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,250
Hong Man Su framed me.

178
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,790
I was so wrongfully accused that
I explained myself to the police.

179
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,030
I'll go copy today's materials.
There are too many.

180
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,170
The voice recording alone isn't
enough to get Kang Se Ri anyway.

181
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,640
We'll have to settle for keeping
Hong Man Su in check for now.

182
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,210
Don't get too worked up.

183
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,310
I'm too worked up.

184
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,750
I'm going to go grab an iced coffee.

185
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,690
Jae In.

186
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,760
Anyway, you need to be careful.

187
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,130
Even a cornered rat will bite.

188
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,890
Yes.

189
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,900
Ta-da!

190
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,970
It's a gift for you.

191
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,670
What's this for?

192
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,880
You've dealt with the police
and struggled with Jae In.

193
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,380
You've had a rough time recently.

194
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,750
It's a lucky charm.
It'll protect you, Seung Woo.

195
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,350
Aren't you going to take it?

196
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,490
That's okay.

197
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,290
But I went out of my way to buy this
because I was worried about you!

198
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,360
It only works if you keep it on you,
so make sure you do.

199
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,670
And don't you ever, ever open it.

200
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,230
It'll lose its power.

201
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,640
You got this!

202
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,470
Hey, take it back.
I told you that I'm fine.

203
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,160
What is this?
It looks like a Chinese character.

204
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
"Love"?

205
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,840
The character for love?

206
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,880
Oh, no. It's so creepy!

207
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,580
I almost fell for it.

208
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,260
Where are you going all of a sudden?

209
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,160
Director Do, what's come over you?

210
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,060
How many times do I have to tell you
I'm going to the gallery?

211
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,330
Ma'am, the gallery is closed today.

212
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,670
Director Do.

213
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,140
The gallery opening is closed
for the visitors.

214
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,270
I have even more work to do
on closing day.

215
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,910
I'm leaving.

216
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,410
Director Choi.

217
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,610
Okay, Director Do, I hate to ask,

218
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,250
but could you just drop my mom off
at the gallery?

219
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,720
I'll stop by on my way out
and try to convince her.

220
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,220
Okay, thank you.

221
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,600
Darn it. This whole museum
is empty...

222
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,470
Oh, wait. There's a guy.

223
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,570
Is he here to buy a painting?

224
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,910
Hello there.

225
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,880
Oh, hello.

226
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,820
You seem to like this painting.

227
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,220
You've been looking at it
for a while.

228
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,160
You clearly have a good eye for art.

229
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,130
That's the most expensive piece
we have.

230
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,470
You seem to work here at JY Gallery.

231
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,040
Can I meet Director Choi Ja Young?

232
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,110
I'm Lee Tae Ho.

233
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,820
The director of this gallery
isn't Choi Ja Young.

234
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,220
Now It's me.

235
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,820
I'm Director Noh Sook
Ja of JY Gallery.

236
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,890
Now, is there a painting
you'd like to buy?

237
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,590
Isn't Director Choi Ja Young
the director here?

238
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,770
Aren't you here to buy a painting?

239
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,970
Do you have Director Choi Ja Young's
contact information?

240
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,210
Why does he keep bringing up
that jinxed name?

241
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,850
If you're curious about her,
check the news. Don't ask me.

242
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,860
Darn it.

243
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,730
I was so close to making a sale,

244
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,830
but now my cheeks hurt for nothing.

245
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,130
Mom, where are you?

246
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,370
What do you see around you?
Any buildings or stores?

247
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,580
Mom, stay right there.
I'm right up ahead.

248
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,390
Hello, Mr. Lee.

249
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,900
I'm Lee Chan Seong,
your assistant in Korea.

250
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,160
Oh, hello.

251
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,870
I planned to get you at the airport,
so I'm surprised you're here first.

252
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,840
I take it there's a painting
you're looking for at this gallery.

253
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,070
No. There's someone I was determined
to find in Korea.

254
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,650
It seems word's out you're here.
My phone's been ringing nonstop.

255
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,610
It's not an official visit, though.

256
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,480
This time,
I came here for vacation...

257
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,250
and to propose a collaboration
with Designer L,

258
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,650
who’s currently in Korea.

259
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,250
And while I'm at it,
I thought I'd scout...

260
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,290
for some new Korean artists.

261
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,220
Let's take our time
with the business side of things.

262
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,260
Yes, of course.
The car is over this way.

263
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,000
- What about your other bags?
- They're already at the hotel.

264
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,640
I heard Director Choi Ja Young quit.
Please look into that for us.

265
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,870
And her daughter, Kang Jae In too.

266
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,340
Tae Ho is in the country?

267
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,010
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

268
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,150
Find out where he's staying
and what his schedule is,

269
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,280
and set up a meeting.

270
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,950
I'll be the one reaching out,
so make it fast.

271
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,430
Yun Hee.

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,740
We're having a guest over
for dinner tonight.

273
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,440
That's unusual for you.
You never brought a guest home.

274
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,480
Is it someone important?

275
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,180
Yes, a very important guest.

276
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,220
Then I'd better go grocery shopping.

277
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,490
Do you know what
their favorite food is?

278
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,020
Oh, it's fine.
We'll just eat what we normally do.

279
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,460
So you really don't need to worry
about it.

280
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,660
But they're our guest.
How can I not?

281
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,530
I'll take care of it,
so just hurry up and get to work.

282
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,840
Hey, Mrs. Park?

283
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,110
What?

284
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,050
Who's killing anyone?

285
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,350
I'm busy, so stop spouting nonsense
and hang up!

286
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,960
Darn it. It’s already frustrating
that I can’t upload the video,

287
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,590
but everyone calls me,

288
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,330
asking if an innocent person died
because of our Gi Chan's affair.

289
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,500
They say, "The news said
Choi Ja Young is innocent!"

290
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,230
They're just reveling
in our misfortune.

291
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,540
Why is Gi Chan getting all the blame
that Choi Ja Young deserves?

292
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,380
Is there any proof
that Gi Chan did it?

293
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,210
"Manipulating public opinion?"

294
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,280
Do they think I can't do that?

295
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,320
- No.
- Kang Jae In bribed the media...

296
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,460
and is spreading false propaganda.

297
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,830
The one who killed
Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee...

298
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,590
is Choi Ja Young!

299
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,730
To all the employees of YL Group!

300
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,670
Don't be fooled!

301
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,100
Because of Kang Jae In's slander,

302
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,570
my family is now in shambles.

303
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,080
My eldest son was so stressed out
by this whole thing...

304
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,280
that he's lost his mind.

305
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,750
And I can barely swallow
my food each day,

306
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,420
so I'm nothing
but skin and bones now.

307
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,160
(Kang Jae In,
Stop Media Manipulation and Lies)

308
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,160
Look at me.

309
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,330
Look at me.

310
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,860
Look at me.

311
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,070
- Mom, what are you doing?
- What if Gi Chan finds out?

312
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,470
He'll praise me when he finds out.
Tell him his mom came here to fight.

313
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,740
Let me see that.

314
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,910
Stop the media manipulation
and the lies!

315
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:47,250
- Stop the lies and manipulation!
- Stop it!

316
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,450
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

317
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,460
Mom...

318
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,730
What? My mother's there?

319
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,000
Well, Chairman Hwang,
aren't you something?

320
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,340
As if your wife wasn't enough,
now your mother supports you too.

321
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,810
Now, even the employees
who didn't know will find out.

322
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,180
That the Kim Do Hee case
is being reinvestigated,

323
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,310
and that Jae In's mom
might be innocent after all.

324
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,080
Since your mother is going
to shout it from the rooftops,

325
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,220
should I be thanking you?

326
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,560
If Director Choi Ja Young
is innocent, then I guess so.

327
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,330
Then there's always
Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo.

328
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,600
If you don't want his name
to be dragged through the mud,

329
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,060
I suggest you leave.

330
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,270
It won't do you any good
to provoke me.

331
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,300
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

332
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,810
Keep my Seung Woo's name
out of your filthy mouth.

333
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,920
Why don't you try stopping
your own mother?

334
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,220
I'm embarrassed for you.

335
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,440
Stop the media manipulation
and the lies!

336
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,910
Hey...

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,180
(Innocent If Rich, Guilty If Poor)

338
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,080
Come with me now!

339
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,400
Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
The bathroom.

340
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,740
What were you thinking?

341
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,370
How could you take my brother
to work and do something like that?

342
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
No, but...

343
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,580
I was doing it for you.

344
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,610
I told you I would handle it.

345
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,620
When I tell you to stay out of it,
you stay out of it!

346
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,790
Why would you humiliate me publicly?

347
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,020
Have you no shame?

348
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,090
You might as well
just tell me to die!

349
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,430
I'm so sorry.

350
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,530
I was just trying to help you.

351
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,340
Because you're all I have.

352
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,640
You're right. I was wrong.

353
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Bo Ram.

354
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,360
Ask your uncle to buy you a treat.
All right?

355
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,600
Okay. Uncle, can I have pizza?

356
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,370
Sure. Pizza it is.

357
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,740
Your uncle must be bringing someone
really important home,

358
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,970
kicking you and Bo Ram
out of the house.

359
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,040
Have you heard anything?

360
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,050
It seems to be someone
very important to him.

361
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,580
Come on, Bo Ram. Let's go get pizza.

362
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,220
- Okay, let's go!
- Let's go.

363
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,290
She's so excited.

364
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,870
I cooked so much because you said
an important guest was coming,

365
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
but what is all this about?

366
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,810
She is important to me.

367
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,750
We're getting back together.

368
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,350
Jung Oh Seong!

369
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,790
Do you have any self-respect?

370
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,290
So what if it's in the past?
Can you just forget about it?

371
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,490
Why do you think you spent
nearly 30 years drifting at sea?

372
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,900
It was because of this woman,
Kang Mi Ran, and her family.

373
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,670
I know time can soften old memories,
but this is ridiculous.

374
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,270
About what happened back then,

375
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,170
there are no excuses
for what my family and I did.

376
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:45,720
My family was cruel,
and I was cowardly and selfish.

377
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,150
Even though my family
was completely against it,

378
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,790
I should have been honest
with Oh Seong about everything,

379
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,130
so that we could have
overcome it together.

380
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,330
I'm not romanticizing the past.

381
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,070
She just ghosted me,

382
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,740
and I lost my career
and was forced out to sea.

383
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,770
I could never forget any of that
even if I tried.

384
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,880
And trust me,
I resented her for a long time.

385
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,110
I even gave her a piece of my mind
when we met again.

386
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,910
All I could see was
what I'd been through...

387
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,420
and how it made me feel.

388
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,920
So why the change?

389
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,520
I realized that, just as much as me,

390
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,790
she was in pain and struggling,

391
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,660
and that she had to face it all
on her own.

392
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,360
Suddenly, the past didn't seem
to matter anymore.

393
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,930
So I looked at how I feel right now.

394
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,140
And I realized...

395
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,510
I'm still in love with her.

396
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,110
You know what they say, "You can
read a person by one thing."

397
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,420
Fine. Let's say what she did
to you is in the past.

398
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,550
But what about what she did
to her own niece, Jae In?

399
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,260
Can't you see she's been merciless,
even to her own flesh and blood?

400
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,430
People don't change that easily.

401
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:08,230
So, she was hurting as much as you.

402
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,830
Fine.

403
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,800
But are we supposed
to understand her...

404
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,770
when she says
she feels hurt and victimized...

405
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,240
while stabbing her loved ones
and making them bleed?

406
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,760
The mistakes and all the wrongs
I've committed,

408
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,400
they're all my fault,

409
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,000
it's a reflection
of my own shortcomings.

410
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,410
I'm not trying to pretend
none of it happened.

411
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,840
To Oh Seong...

412
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,210
and Jae In,

413
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,650
I'll spend the rest of my life
making up for what I've done

414
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,020
and begging for their forgiveness.

415
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,620
So, please,

416
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,360
just one more time,

417
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,160
give me one last chance.

418
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,400
I'll make things right.

419
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,910
She apologized to Jae In,
and Jae In forgave her.

420
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,550
So, Yun Hee.

421
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,620
Please try to be happy for us
and support our relationship.

422
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,020
Fine. She apologized to them
and they forgave her, so it's done.

423
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,220
But that's where it ends.

424
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,330
I still don't want you
involved with our family any more.

425
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,160
You brought her here on your own,
so you can see her out yourself.

426
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:26,970
We need to talk.

427
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,610
Fine, my dear son. If you
have something to say, say it.

428
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,150
If it will make you feel better,
get it all off your chest.

429
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,850
Today, you'll meet a special guest
as the director of the gallery.

430
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,820
Oh my goodness.
So, is this my debut as Director?

431
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,390
Something like that.

432
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,130
This is an important day
for both of us,

433
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,060
so be at the meeting place on time.

434
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,730
I'll text you the time and location.

435
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,070
Okay. I promise
I won't let you down.

436
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,610
I'll be on my best behavior,
so you can count on me.

437
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
I'll see you later.

438
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,680
Hold on.
This is no time to stand around.

439
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,190
What should I wear
to leave a good impression...

440
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,320
on our important guest?

441
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,780
Mother, it uses high-frequency waves
all through your body.

442
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,780
Welcome. How may I help you...

443
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,680
It's meant to relieve your various
aches and pains.

444
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,950
A sudden gift? What's the occasion?

445
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,090
Well, I have
that important meeting today,

446
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,460
so I guess I should give it a try.

447
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,670
And the buttons are very easy
to use.

448
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,540
This is amazing.

449
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,940
I just put my feet on it,
and my whole body feels warm.

450
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,510
But, Mother.

451
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,350
About your meeting today.

452
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,220
Are you sure you'll be okay?

453
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,150
I heard the person you're meeting
only speaks English.

454
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,620
What? English?

455
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,160
Darn it.
They should learn to speak Korean.

456
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,030
You know how on edge Gi Chan is,

457
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,000
if you mess up this meeting,

458
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,640
I can just picture
how he'll tear into you again.

459
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,710
Still, what can I do?

460
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,310
He said I should be there.

461
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,710
There might be one way around it.

462
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,450
Mother, where are you?

463
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,190
Why aren't you here yet?

464
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,650
Gi Chan.

465
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,030
- What are you doing here?
- I'm representing your mother.

466
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,230
She insisted that I come
in her place.

467
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,570
I'm not here as your wife.

468
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,870
I'm here
as Director Noh Sook Ja's representative.

469
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,750
You'd better do this right.

470
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,010
Don't worry.

471
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:26,480
(Queen's House)

472
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,480
Now that the news
of a reinvestigation is out,

473
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,180
it won't be long
before the truth is revealed.

474
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,580
"A reinvestigation?"

475
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,920
There's news
about a reinvestigation?

476
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,350
I don't want to drive a company
we've worked hard to grow together...

477
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,460
off a cliff.

478
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,530
I don't need that.

479
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,460
As we agreed,
I want you out of YL Group.

480
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,200
Please disregard
Chairman Hwang's statement.

481
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,730
What?

482
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,370
They changed the prosecutor on the case?

483
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,140
Detective...

484
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,310
Please, save me.

485
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,780
Please save me.

486
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,010
Please save me.
