00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,550
Hwang Eun Ho! Your uncle is here!

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,620
- Goodness.
- Your uncle is here.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,350
Gi Chan! Hey, Jae In.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,160
Goodness, Mom!

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,890
I'm here, your pathetic eldest son!

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,560
Goodness.

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,900
Gi Man, pull yourself together.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,440
We're at Gi Chan's place.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,070
Stop humiliating yourself.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,170
Let go of me.

14
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,940
Gi Chan! My big brother!

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,080
From now on,
I'll be your younger brother.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,180
Gi Man, what are you talking about?

17
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,950
You're his older brother.

18
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,220
No, that's not the case, Jae In.

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,620
Goodness, no. Where are my manners?

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,490
I'm so sorry,
my big brother's sister-in-law.

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,960
He seems quite drunk.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,830
- Lay him down in the guest bedroom.
- No.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
No, Mr. Chairman. I'm not drunk.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,800
I... I'm sorry.
I'm not drunk at all.

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,470
I came here today...

26
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,240
to tell everyone something.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,510
I have...

28
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,710
My dear nephew.

29
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,050
My dear nephew, I have...

30
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,490
- My gosh!
- Goodness!

31
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,090
- Who was that?
- My goodness.

32
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,190
You should've been careful.

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,860
- No, I have...
- I get it, so shut...

34
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,790
That's enough. Stop it.

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,830
My gosh.

36
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,570
I feel embarrassed
that you had to see this.

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,100
Something bad
must've happened to him.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,270
I should take him home right away.

39
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,740
Get my bag.

40
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,480
Hey, Eun Ho. Eun Ho...

41
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,750
Let me take you back home.

42
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,980
You should go back
and finish your dinner.

43
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,050
Gi Chan and I will
take you back home.

44
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,020
Aunt Mi Ran is here,
so you should stay.

45
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,590
I'll be back.

46
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,090
Goodbye.

47
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,960
All right. We won't see you off.

48
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,990
Goodbye.

49
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,230
Please invite us again next time.

50
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,060
Let me see them off.

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,510
Gi Chan.

52
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,150
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

53
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,950
I get it, so just go to sleep.

54
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,590
Hey, I really...

55
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,060
I really wanted to live.

56
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,870
I couldn't find a way
to get any money,

57
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,770
so I couldn't help it.

58
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,170
And I promise.

59
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,410
I didn't let Eun Ho get hurt
in any way.

60
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,210
I made sure he wasn't frightened.

61
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,680
I took him
to an amusement park, too.

62
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,820
I did my best
to make sure he wasn't scared.

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,090
I promise you that. I do.

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,260
What are you saying?

65
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,930
It was you?

66
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,200
Did you kidnap Eun Ho?

67
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,370
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,480
I'm so sorry.

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,580
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,710
I'm sorry...

71
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,530
Gosh, he makes me so frustrated.

72
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,430
Get Gi Chan out of there...

73
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,600
before Gi Man begins
to talk nonsense.

74
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,630
Okay.

75
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,370
Did you know about this?

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,170
- Know what?
- That Gi Man...

77
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,080
kidnapped Eun Ho.

78
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,580
That's crazy.

79
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,010
He's not insane.
Why would he kidnap him?

80
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,550
Right, Mom?

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
No way. Mom, is this true?

82
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,520
Was it Gi Man?

83
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,330
Good grief.
I should've stitched up his mouth.

84
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,630
I told him to take it to his grave,

85
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,060
but he couldn't hold it in
for a day.

86
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,300
Mom!

87
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,540
I only found out about it today.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,810
I couldn't believe
what I was hearing,

89
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,740
and my heart began to race, too.

90
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,310
I told him to stay quiet
because I thought...

91
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,480
Jae In would faint if she found out.

92
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,750
I heard him out,

93
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,220
and he didn't mean
to cause Eun Ho any harm.

94
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,350
He just wanted to get some money.

95
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,320
- Are you kidding me?
- My gosh.

96
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,820
Please do not shout.

97
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,990
You're going to give me
a heart attack.

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,130
What if my in-laws found out?

99
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,900
What would they think of my family?

100
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,700
What would they think of me?

101
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,570
They already look down on
how I came without pedigree.

102
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,310
Do you want me
to stay married or not?

103
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,910
Who looked down on you?
Who looked down on my son?

104
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,880
You were a prosecutor.

105
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,550
That's not a job for just anybody!

106
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,220
You need to stop going on
about how I was a prosecutor!

107
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,090
So what if that was my job?

108
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,420
I felt embarrassed
whenever you brought up...

109
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,890
how I was a prosecutor
because it sounded like...

110
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,400
that was the only thing
our family could brag about.

111
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,900
Whenever people said I married my way
into an affluent family...

112
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,170
and that I was like
the male Cinderella,

113
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,200
I'd try to prove myself
with my talent.

114
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,470
But all my hard work
comes to nothing...

115
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,140
because my family is here,
trying to ruin my life!

116
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,280
If this is how it'll be,
I'll cut my ties with all of you.

117
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,010
I'd be more at peace that way.

118
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,920
Gi Chan, I can't do that.

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,920
I can live without Gi Man,
but not without you.

120
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,360
You're my crown jewel,
my sky, and the reason I live.

121
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,760
How am I going to go on?

122
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,860
I really didn't know about this.

123
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,600
If I had known,
I would've broken his legs...

124
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,270
and tried to stop him.

125
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,640
I already berated him
and told him...

126
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,670
never to do anything
this ridiculous again.

127
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,310
So, please think of me
and let it go just this once.

128
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,010
Please, Gi Chan?

129
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,580
Gi Chan...

130
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,020
Does Yu Gyeong know?

131
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,320
If she did, there would've been
a whole new set of problems.

132
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
I'll keep your brother quiet,

133
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,020
so just trust me.

134
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,630
I won't tell anyone, either.
I'll zip my mouth.

135
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,500
Anyway, I'm worried
about the ones...

136
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,970
who were caught by the police.

137
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,940
I'll manage.

138
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,410
I'm leaving.

139
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,010
Okay.

140
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,270
What's going on? What?

141
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,270
How do you call yourself human?

142
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,840
Even beasts look after their own.

143
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,070
How can you do this
as the eldest son?

144
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,910
I told you again and again
to keep your mouth shut,

145
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,780
but you ran over
to Changpyeong-dong and said,

146
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,980
"Eun Ho, your uncle is here."

147
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,210
Darn you.

148
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,050
I went to Jae In's place?

149
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,550
Good grief. You...

150
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,390
I can't remember anything.
I was so wasted.

151
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,660
Does Jae In's family know?

152
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,500
Why did you drink so much
if you couldn't handle it?

153
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,640
Aren't you too old to be doing this?

154
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,200
And do you ever use your brains?

155
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,710
Try something called thinking...

156
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,140
if you even graduated
from a university.

157
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,440
How can you
humiliate Gi Chan like this?

158
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,780
What's going on?

159
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,820
Did you do this, Mother?

160
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,990
This is considered assault.

161
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,120
Did you know that?

162
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,720
I don't know what he did to Gi Chan,

163
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
but you could've just talked to him.

164
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,790
Did you have
to humiliate him like this?

165
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,600
My gosh.

166
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,430
Honey, please stop.

167
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,670
She didn't do anything wrong.
It was my fault.

168
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,270
See? I didn't do anything wrong.

169
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,970
You could've just said it in words.

170
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,470
You always corner him like this,
so he never learns any better!

171
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,440
Stop talking nonsense!

172
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,680
Learn what?

173
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,780
Mom, let's go out and talk.
That's enough.

174
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,480
- You...
- Get some rest. Let's go.

175
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,290
You're a doctor who can't even treat
your husband for alcoholism.

176
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,590
You're a quack,
so just quit your job.

177
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,520
Mom, please.

178
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,600
I would've appreciated it
if you told us in advance.

179
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,700
Then, I could've gotten
a room ready for you, Mi Ran.

180
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,140
I guess I didn't want to bother you.

181
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,380
Gyu Cheol cares very much about you.

182
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,610
You should settle here
instead of returning to America.

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,820
I'd love to be around my family.

184
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,590
But what about the US branch?

185
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,320
I'll promote
the vice president there.

186
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,590
But we don't promote people
so suddenly in this period.

187
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,930
I've been thinking about retiring.

188
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,530
That means I need to make sure
I have a solid successor...

189
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,200
who'll keep the business going.

190
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,240
I've worked hard to this day.

191
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,440
"You only live once."

192
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,940
I hear that's shortened to YOLO.

193
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,180
I only live once,

194
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,920
so I want to do whatever I want
and enjoy my life.

195
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,290
I'll wrap up everything...

196
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,620
within 2 to 3 years,

197
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,520
and I want to start traveling
around the world with you.

198
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,990
What do you say?

199
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,600
Well, whatever makes you happy
also makes me happy.

200
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,830
But it's still too early
for you to retire.

201
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,500
You're right.
You're still in your prime.

202
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,370
I want to find my second life.

203
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,710
I know Gi Chan is here with us,

204
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,210
but you need to train
just Seung Woo.

205
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,280
Are you going to leave it
with Seung Woo?

206
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,520
How is he going to handle
the responsibility and pressure...

207
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,790
of acting as a chairman?

208
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,520
He doesn't have enough experience,

209
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,920
and he's still too young.

210
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,560
Goodness.

211
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,130
I'm back.

212
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,070
Hey, did you take them home safely?

213
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,600
Yes.

214
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,840
My mother wanted to tell you
once again that she was sorry.

215
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,870
I'm sorry, Aunt Mi Ran.

216
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,380
It's fine by me.

217
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,380
Please tell your mother
she doesn't have to worry.

218
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,980
It seemed like Gi Man was
quite stressed out...

219
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,820
because of his work.

220
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,620
It can happen.

221
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,090
It was a relief
that we were having dinner at home.

222
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,460
What if we were outside?

223
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,330
Your family has nothing to lose,
but that isn't the case for us.

224
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,530
It would've been humiliating
if any press had reported on this.

225
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,270
I...

226
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,670
I'm home!

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,540
Hey, Aunt Mi Ran!
When did you get here?

228
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,000
Just now.

229
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,170
Please excuse me, then.

230
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,510
Hey, you're looking even cooler now
compared to the last time we met.

231
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,180
I took after my mom
and was born with style.

232
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,490
Mom, I need to eat dinner.

233
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,850
I'm hungry.

234
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,890
- Did you work without eating?
- Yes.

235
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,100
You need to have a talk
with his direct superior.

236
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,070
She has to let him eat
if he must work overtime.

237
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,000
Goodness, Ja Young.
You're such a fool for your son.

238
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,370
Nothing bad will happen
just because he skips one meal.

239
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,600
Something bad will happen.

240
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,810
Seung Woo was born weak,
so he must eat well.

241
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,840
Isn't that so, Seung Woo?

242
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,880
I knew you'd be like that, Mom.

243
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,880
Cut it out.

244
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,980
Make sure
you learn how to do your job.

245
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,290
Okay.

246
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,260
Hey, is Eun Ho asleep already?

247
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,160
Yes, he just fell asleep.

248
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,040
Anyway, are you sure
everything is okay with Gi Man?

249
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,700
Yes, he's fine.

250
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,910
He wouldn't act like that
without a reason.

251
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,810
Should I sound Yu Gyeong out?

252
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,550
Don't do that.

253
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,320
He asked me not to tell Yu Gyeong
that he had come here.

254
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,680
Don't say anything.

255
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,590
Hey, anyway,

256
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,890
why did Aunt Mi Ran suddenly come?

257
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,060
She was appointed here.

258
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,530
Appointed?

259
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,600
I haven't heard anything.

260
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,330
Did you know about this?

261
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,000
I also heard it just now.

262
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,800
She's my dad's only sister,

263
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,570
so he must've been worried
that she lived alone abroad.

264
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,510
Is this his way of saying
he'll support Seung Woo?

265
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,980
Is it because
we're all getting older?

266
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,480
I guess everyone wants to return.

267
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,480
I recently met a friend of mine.

268
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,520
Do you remember Se Ri,
my friend who lives in America?

269
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,850
You met her at our wedding.

270
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,160
Do you remember her?

271
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,660
How would I remember
if I met her once?

272
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,760
And?

273
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,100
She came back to Korea.

274
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,300
We met, and it seemed like
she returned for good.

275
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,640
Ms. Jae In,
Ms. Choi wants to see you.

276
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,300
All right.

277
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,950
Why didn't you tell
Gi Chan to come, too?

278
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,980
He has an early day tomorrow.

279
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,780
It's probably no fun
to live with a workaholic.

280
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,090
Don't you get lonely?

281
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,590
I'm busy trying to raise Eun Ho.

282
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,020
And Gi Chan is doing his best
to find his balance.

283
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,130
I'll never live like him.

284
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,100
I only live once,
so I'll enjoy it to the fullest.

285
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,830
My gosh.

286
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,700
It's so easy to tell
that he has Gyu Cheol's DNA.

287
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,470
That was exactly what he said.

288
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,400
What? My dad said that?

289
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,910
No way.

290
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,410
I agree with him.

291
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,310
I don't want him to get caught up...

292
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,650
in a chase for power and money.

293
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,120
I want to let him live freely.

294
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,390
If he's born as a Kang,

295
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,390
he'll have to do his job,
no matter what he wants.

296
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,090
What can he do?

297
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,690
Who else is going to do it?

298
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,560
Will it be Gi Chan?

299
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,500
Ja Young,
you may find this upsetting,

300
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,570
but YL Group must be carried on
by one of the Kangs.

301
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,970
Seung Woo isn't the only Kang.

302
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,170
Jae In is here, too.

303
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,610
Mom, leave me out of this.

304
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,140
I don't care about
business management.

305
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,380
Your maternity leave ended,

306
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,680
so you can return
and start learning.

307
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,020
You were the youngest
to become a team leader.

308
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,390
That's not all.

309
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,590
Who designed
YL Group's top products?

310
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,120
It was you.

311
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,060
You have more than enough talent
to work as an executive.

312
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,160
It could happen
if Jae In wanted to do this,

313
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,330
but designing is
different from business management.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,900
It'd be much wiser
to let Seung Woo marry a girl...

315
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,770
from a family
that could become his support.

316
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,040
Aunt Mi Ran, no way.

317
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,570
Don't say that.

318
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,540
I don't want to get...

319
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,010
into an exhausting marriage
of convenience.

320
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,880
Mom. I'll marry someone you like.

321
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,120
I'll find
the best woman in the world.

322
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,890
Who's going to come between
the two loving mother and son?

323
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,430
I'm already worried.

324
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,930
I'm thinking of creating
a new planning team.

325
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,200
You can work with me
when you return.

326
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,100
I want to take some more time off.

327
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,110
Why?

328
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,040
I want to spend
more time with Eun Ho.

329
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,310
But I know a great designer.
Can I make a referral?

330
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,950
Really?

331
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,180
If she isn't talented enough,
she may not get the job...

332
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,750
even if you refer her.

333
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,090
Let me make that clear now.

334
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,590
Okay.

335
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,000
Daddy?

336
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,340
Hey, you're up.

337
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,980
Did I wake you?

338
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,310
No, I had a dream.

339
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,850
Was it a nightmare?

340
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,480
A little.

341
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,020
These evil people harassed Mommy,

342
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,650
so I defeated them.

343
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,790
You're a brave guy.

344
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,630
Eun Ho.

345
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,930
Did you go to an amusement park
with Uncle Gi Man's friends?

346
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,300
It was a secret.

347
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,940
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,380
You can't do this again, okay?

349
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,780
I'll let it go just this once.

350
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,310
We'll keep it a secret
from Mommy, too.

351
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,080
So, don't do that again. Okay?

352
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,650
Okay.

353
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,560
All right. Go back to sleep.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,070
- Gosh. Mr. Chairman.
- Oh, no.

355
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,710
You're really good.

356
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,010
- This isn't a big deal.
- Goodness.

357
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,610
- Can you hold her?
- You can try, too.

358
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,750
I'll have her.

359
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,350
I can do it.
Keep watching the drama.

360
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,450
No, it's all right.

361
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,350
All right. One second.

362
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,960
Come here.

363
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,940
What is it, Mom?

364
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,340
He's 32 years old,

365
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,150
and he's a civil servant,
so he'll never get fired.

366
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,150
His parents farm
in the countryside...

367
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,480
Did you mention that I had a kid?

368
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,890
You can meet him
and see if you two like each other.

369
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,250
Then, you can tell him.

370
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,120
If he can't deal with it,
I can always raise Bo Ram.

371
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,760
Stop talking nonsense.

372
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,890
I'm her mom,
so why should you raise her?

373
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,360
You're her mom,
but I'm also your mom.

374
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,970
Think of the time
when you were pregnant with Bo Ram.

375
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,340
Her father turned away from you
while in the army and left.

376
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,770
Think of how I felt
as I watched you.

377
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,040
You don't have to bring up the past.

378
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,580
My daughter.

379
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,780
My beautiful daughter.

380
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,580
You're still young enough,
still in your twenties.

381
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,250
Are you going to waste it...

382
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,020
just raising Bo Ram
without living your own life?

383
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,520
I'm not telling you
to get married right away.

384
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,790
You can date someone
and go out a little.

385
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,460
That'd be really nice.

386
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,360
I've never been happier, Mom.

387
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,070
I mean it.

388
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,370
I'm having fun raising Bo Ram,
and I'm content with my job.

389
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,600
I'll also continue to study...

390
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,070
and earn my master's degree
and even Ph. D.

391
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,240
Different flowers bloom...

392
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,380
in spring, summer, fall, and winter.

393
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,550
Just like that,
people all have different primes.

394
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,950
I know I'll see my glory days, too.

395
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,890
Just wait and see.

396
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,520
I need to tuck Bo Ram in.

397
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,930
Will you please get out there
and live your life?

398
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,510
You understand
what Mom means, right?

399
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm the one
who made her cry a river.

400
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,350
Of course, I know.

401
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,480
But thanks to Bo Ram,

402
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,320
Mother, you, and me,
all of us can laugh.

403
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,790
It's all that matters.

404
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,420
- Do Hee.
- Yes?

405
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,760
I may be here acting like her dad,

406
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,730
but she'll still feel
her dad is missing.

407
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,730
I'm not telling you to marry.

408
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,870
But I thought...

409
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,570
you could quit your job.

410
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,470
What?

411
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,610
It's realistically impossible
to look after Bo Ram,

412
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,040
work, and study at the same time.

413
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,680
Look what happened today.
You worked overtime and came late.

414
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,610
You can look after Bo Ram,

415
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,510
start studying,

416
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,750
and go to graduate school, too.

417
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,150
I'll support you until then.

418
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,650
I make enough money
to do that now.

419
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,190
You've done well thus far.

420
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,860
We can trade now.

421
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,100
Feel free to pass me
that responsibility.

422
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,530
I'll do that.

423
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,300
Do you mean it?

424
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,640
Yes.

425
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,110
I have something to wrap up
before I quit.

426
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,140
I worked here all my life
after graduating from high school.

427
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,310
People say no one has
one job for life these days,

428
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,010
but it was like that for me.

429
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,720
I met a wonderful boss
who showed me lots of consideration,

430
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,890
helping me raise Bo Ram
without trouble.

431
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,320
I can't say
it's my way of paying back my debt,

432
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,660
but I won't turn away
knowing everything.

433
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,430
Above all,

434
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,800
I don't want to be
a shameful mother to Bo Ram.

435
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,070
I'll finish that up...

436
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,540
and quit.

437
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,680
I'm calling to check...

438
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,580
because there seems to be
some issue with the contract.

439
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,650
It seems that the amount
and terms changed slightly.

440
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,760
Could you send me a copy via e-mail?

441
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,430
Please check and get back to me.

442
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,700
Hello, this is Do Hee Kim...

443
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,170
from YL Group's
Strategy Planning Team.

444
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,370
I'd like to speak
to the CEO of H and K Company.

445
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,810
On vacation?

446
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,110
Could you possibly know
when he'll be back?

447
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,090
I'll get back to you.

448
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,160
How may I help you?

449
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,130
I heard Hwang Gi Chan was
a director here.

450
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,230
Is he around?

451
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,660
Can you tell me what this concerns?

452
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,760
That's none of your business.

453
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,230
I don't talk to rank-and-filers.

454
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,140
Just tell me
if Director Hwang Gi Chan is here.

455
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,310
I am Hwang Gi Chan. Who are you?

456
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,440
Hello.

457
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,950
I'm the man doing business
with Mr. Hwang Gi Man.

458
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,680
My name is Hong Man Su.

459
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,820
Come inside.

460
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,770
(Waiver of Bodily Rights)

461
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,200
(If his brother, Hwang Gi Chan,
pays back, no bodily harm shall be done.)

462
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,700
He owes me the principal
and the interest.

463
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,370
I'm not sure if you already know,

464
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,640
but your son was kidnapped, right?

465
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,370
We were going to split that in half.

466
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,880
Your older brother
planned out everything.

467
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,350
You already knew everything.

468
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,520
My boys are
about to take the blame unfairly.

469
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,790
I need money to get them out,

470
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,390
and we'll also need compensation.

471
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,330
It's not like
I can just kill a man...

472
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,430
like he's a fly.

473
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,100
If you refuse,
I want to contact the chairman...

474
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,040
and at least talk to him about it.

475
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,770
Just let me...

476
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,780
handle everything.

477
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,120
Thank you so much.

478
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,050
I made sure they put up cameras
without creating a blind spot.

479
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,790
But I'm worried...

480
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,130
that this may seem like
pressure on the teachers.

481
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,100
It's outside and not inside,
so they're actually happy with it.

482
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,270
The event will begin soon. Let's go.

483
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,600
All right.

484
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,640
(A Day of Experiencing With Mommy)

485
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,070
Here. This is my present.

486
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,010
It looks so pretty.

487
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
Thank you.

488
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,380
I'll give you one, too.

489
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,580
My grandma said...

490
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,450
sharing good things will
make people happier.

491
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,490
You're all done.

492
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,520
- Thank you.
- Sure.

493
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,960
What do you want me to paint,
Eun Ho?

494
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,060
You can do Bo Ram first.
She got here first.

495
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,630
Hello.

496
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,430
My name is Kim Bo Ram,
and I'm Eun Ho's friend.

497
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,060
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

498
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,530
You're a pretty girl.

499
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,830
Are you two besties?

500
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,100
Mommy, what does besties mean?

501
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,670
Is it food?

502
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,310
She's asking if we're best friends.

503
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,180
Bo Ram, you must be
good at language studies.

504
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,250
I need to know
many different words...

505
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,150
to talk to my grandma.

506
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,120
Not only are you pretty,
but you're also kind.

507
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,990
I don't mean to boast,
but I'm kind of nice.

508
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,260
Not very much, though.

509
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,590
You're so good with your words.

510
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,690
Then, what do you want me to draw?

511
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,160
A rainbow.

512
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,030
A rainbow? Okay.

513
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,700
Director Do.

514
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,400
Hello, Ms. Kim.

515
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,270
Well, I have something to tell you.

516
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,880
Can you spare some time?

517
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,740
Sure.

518
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,310
The thing is,
I think I found dual contracts.

519
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,490
Hello?

520
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,620
Do Hee Kim?

521
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,560
Yes, she works in our department.

522
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,100
She asked about the contract?

523
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,540
Let's talk upstairs.

524
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,840
You didn't say anything
about the dual contract, did you?

525
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,410
Okay.

526
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,520
Just send it to her.
The original contract.

527
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,150
And you'll say
you don't know anything else.

528
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,160
Okay. Bye.

529
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,860
Aunt Mi Ran, I'm on my way.

530
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,130
I'll see you there. Bye.

531
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,380
My goodness! No.

532
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,050
My gosh.

533
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,680
Goodness.

534
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,960
I'm sorry.

535
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,600
Let's take everything
to the sidewalk first.

536
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,900
Okay.

537
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,100
Walk over with me.

538
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,580
Are you all right?

539
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,580
Yes. Thank you.

540
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,250
Next time, you should cross first,
no matter how much food is wasted.

541
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,120
It could lead to a serious accident.

542
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,250
It's very dangerous.

543
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,320
You saved me.

544
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,960
It must be hard to carry everything
with a broken bag.

545
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,430
Give me a moment.

546
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Here.

547
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,340
It won't snap anymore.

548
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,640
Goodness,
how can I thank you enough?

549
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,780
Thank you.

550
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,740
You should travel safely.

551
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,950
Be careful of cars.

552
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,750
One moment.

553
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,890
Please take this.

554
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,520
It's my chicken place.

555
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,320
I'll fry some tasty chicken for you,
so come by sometime.

556
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,890
I'm just so grateful.

557
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,360
Okay. Then, you should go safely.

558
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,330
Make sure you come!

559
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,380
Aunt Mi Ran.

560
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,610
Hey, you're here.

561
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,210
- I'm a little late.
- It's okay.

562
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,680
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

563
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,450
May I go home
and take time to look over it?

564
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:05,020
Sure. Take your time,
and then call me.

565
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,860
No pressure, though.

566
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,160
All right.

567
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,230
Where in America did you live?

568
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,930
I was in New York.

569
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,100
I was in LA.

570
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,370
You should get some tea.

571
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,240
Yes, but let me go
to the ladies' room first.

572
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,110
Hey, Jae In.

573
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,050
Hey, Na Ra.
Are you here with your friends?

574
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,980
Yes, this is
the hottest place right now.

575
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,820
How's Gi Man?

576
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,720
He's still the same.

577
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,960
It must've been
shocking for you, too.

578
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,130
I was in shock, too.

579
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,590
Gi Man must be out of his mind.

580
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,060
How did he come up with the idea
of kidnapping Eun Ho?

581
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,970
What are you talking about?

582
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,500
Did Gi Man kidnap Eun Ho?

583
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,800
Yes, I'm telling you.

584
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,810
You didn't know?

585
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,080
I thought Gi Chan told you.

586
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,020
Goodness, I never said anything.

587
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,100
Aunt Mi Ran, something came up,
so I have to go.

588
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,500
Se Ri, you can talk to my aunt.
I'm sorry.

589
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,570
I have to go.

590
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,980
She looks like
Jae In's sister-in-law.

591
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,950
Or maybe not.

592
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,420
- The person you have reached is...
- Why won't she pick up?

593
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,840
(Princess)

594
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,340
- Why won't you pick up?
- The person you have reached is...

595
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,840
(Gi Man)

596
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,380
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

597
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,380
- after the tone.
- Come on!

598
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,020
(Gi Man, Mom, Gi Chan)

599
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,560
Hello? Gi Chan.

600
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,130
Goodness,
it's my second daughter-in-law.

601
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,470
Come on in.

602
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,200
Will you please wait?

603
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,010
I'm only one person,
so I can't be everywhere at once.

604
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,140
What a busy day.

605
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Hey, Gi Chan.

606
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,450
She just came.

607
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,650
Yes, she rang the bell.

608
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,990
What? Don't open the door for her?
Why not?

609
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,120
Mother.

610
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,420
My goodness.

611
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
You're here, Jae In.

612
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,860
Where's Gi Man?

613
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,400
Is he in his room?

614
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,900
Hello, Jae In. You're here.

615
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,440
I heard something weird,

616
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,170
so I came to check.

617
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,080
Did you do that...

618
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,950
to Eun Ho?

619
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,650
Do what?

620
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,990
Did you...

621
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,590
kidnap Eun Ho?

622
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,230
Did you really...

623
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,530
Did you really do that?

624
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,240
My goodness.
Have you lost your mind?

625
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,740
Goodness, Jae In.

626
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,840
It's all my fault.
I'm the sinner here.

627
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,350
Mother, please get up.
Why are you doing this?

628
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,910
I'm just too ashamed.

629
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,880
I'm the sinner here. It's my fault.

630
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,290
I'm home...

631
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,830
What are you doing? Kneel.

632
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,860
You need to kneel with us.

633
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,900
A married couple is like one,
so kneel.

634
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,300
Did you tell her to kneel?

635
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,700
Shut your mouth and listen to me.

636
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,670
Kneel. Just kneel.

637
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,210
Mother!

638
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,610
Shut your mouth and do it...

639
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,880
if you want to save your husband.

640
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,280
You need to kneel, too.

641
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,220
Mother!

642
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,450
You need to stop!

643
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,320
Gi Man.

644
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,920
Tell me.

645
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,260
Why did you do that to Eun Ho?

646
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,060
How can you do this?

647
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,530
What's the reason? Huh?

648
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,430
Why won't you say anything?

649
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,070
Say something!

650
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Jae In, please forgive him.

651
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,040
You two need to beg, too.

652
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:54,840
Jae In, it's all our fault.

653
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,780
We're sorry.

654
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,290
What do you think you're doing?

655
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,350
(Queen's House)

656
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,650
I would've succeeded
if it hadn't been for him.

657
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,990
How did that punk...

658
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,950
find out about it and show up?

659
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,060
You knew everything
and made him do it, didn't you?

660
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,790
What's going on between you two?

661
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,330
I'll figure out a way
to handle this.

662
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,570
Do not make a move
and meddle with this.

663
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,000
Just wait.

664
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,380
I'll live as Kang Jae In.
