1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,070
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,850
I wanted to eat somewhere romantic.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,390
I thought it'd all be too crowded...

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,720
for us to have a conversation.

7
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,190
I wanted to eat quietly,
alone with you.

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,790
Quietly and alone with me?

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,660
I ordered this from a good place.
Do you not like it?

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,030
No, it's delicious.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,410
So, where's Geum Ja?

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,210
She probably went out for lunch.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,840
Please excuse me.

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,450
Darn it.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,750
What do you want?

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,820
I told you to print out
the contract...

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,390
and give it to Secretary Yoon
this morning.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,520
Didn't you do that?

19
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,690
Yes, right. I forgot.

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,420
Get it together, Na Ra.

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,230
I'll be upstairs soon,
so have it ready.

22
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,130
What? Right now?

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,600
Hello? Gi Chan?

24
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,730
I mean, Mr. Chairman...

25
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,730
What's wrong?

26
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,340
Who are you?

27
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,140
How did you get in here?

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,750
Wait, lift your face.

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,620
Hey.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,660
Geum Ja!

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,300
What are you doing?

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,730
Those are my words.

33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,340
My gosh, Geum Ja. Why are you here?

34
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,610
I came to give you a concert ticket.

35
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,210
The door was open,

36
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,110
so I walked in to look for you.

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,810
After that,
I was just about to leave.

38
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,380
But he got mad at me
and made me scared.

39
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,520
Please don't cry, Geum Ja.

40
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,020
He's the chairman.

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,290
He's the chairman?

42
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,960
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,660
I didn't know you were the chairman.

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,000
Dr. Kim, what if I get fired?

45
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,900
Calm down
and go back to the clinic. Okay?

46
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,770
Come on.

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,540
Na Ra.

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,510
Goodness. Thank you, Geum Ja.

49
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,080
She started here recently,

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,920
so she didn't know
her way around the office.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,950
Let me apologize on her behalf.

52
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,820
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,260
You don't have to apologize.
It's all right.

54
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,560
She might have walked in by mistake.
Why did you get mad at her?

55
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,800
Did you hide
some kind of treasure in here?

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,500
There's nothing for her to take,

57
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,170
and she came for me to give me this.

58
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,200
Na Ra, the chairman could
take this the wrong way.

59
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,470
She shouldn't have done this.

60
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,910
I'll tell her to be careful.

61
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,780
Then, please excuse me.

62
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,580
See you later, Dr. Kim.

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,480
Hey, Na Ra.

64
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,120
Since when
did you befriend that doctor?

65
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,020
Wait, forget that.

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,120
Was that woman named Geum Ja...

67
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,460
the one who looked like Jae In?

68
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,660
Yes, she doesn't resemble her
in any way.

69
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,030
I was just mistaken.

70
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,030
Here.

71
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,670
That was close.

72
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,700
But I didn't find anything.

73
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,540
I should've gotten into his laptop.

74
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,370
You couldn't?

75
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,180
I couldn't find the password.

76
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,910
I typed in the numbers
that came to my mind,

77
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,050
but they were all wrong.

78
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,150
How am I going to find it?

79
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,750
You shouldn't make a move
for a while.

80
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,250
You better be careful
after what happened today.

81
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,290
I can't go down like this.

82
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,330
I must start doing something.

83
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,030
First, I'll look for a job
at a gallery somewhere.

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,840
(Gi Man)

85
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,640
Father, it's me.

86
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,450
Do you want to eat lunch
if you haven't eaten yet?

87
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,780
How about some eel?

88
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,120
Hello?

89
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,420
Your family must be
having a blast feasting...

90
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,590
after breaking up my family
into pieces.

91
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,020
Hello?

92
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,760
Did I call the wrong number?

93
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,190
No, I didn't.

94
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,890
Wait, who are you?

95
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,230
Isn't that my phone?

96
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,470
Hello?

97
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,980
I'm at home.

98
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,180
The woman?

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,450
I'll be at the business soon,
so let's talk there.

100
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,750
Goodbye.

101
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,120
That's why she's staying
at my place for a while.

102
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,620
Don't say anything unnecessary
to Yu Gyeong.

103
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,260
No, don't worry about that.

104
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,090
I'm not the type
who blurts out nonsense.

105
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,400
Think about last time.

106
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,770
You got caught
because Yu Gyeong suddenly barged in.

107
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,400
I never told her...

108
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,140
that you had been working
as a part-timer at the chicken place.

109
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,270
No, I haven't.

110
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,340
Who's working where?

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,110
Mr. Do.

112
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,550
Was what he just said true?

113
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,050
Yes, Ms. Noh.

114
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,450
I'm working
at this fried chicken place.

115
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,590
Why did you stay silent
after seeing him do this?

116
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,560
Hey, Min Jun.

117
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,030
Hey, you're here.

118
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,230
You always look great,

119
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,300
but you look
even more fabulous today.

120
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,300
I have to go somewhere later.

121
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,910
Why, hello.

122
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,110
Hello.

123
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,810
Something came up at home,
so please excuse me.

124
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,020
Wait, I have to run
the business alone? Again?

125
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,120
Wait, Mom.

126
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,950
Bye.

127
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,360
You need to run back home now.

128
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,360
You better come
before I barge into the hospital.

129
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,470
The winner of the blind contest...

130
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,840
will join our team.

131
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,940
That's great news.

132
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,170
It wasn't easy to cooperate
with the design team alone.

133
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,310
That's that. Anyway.

134
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,450
Dr. Do Yu Gyeong is your friend
from high school, right?

135
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,620
Yes, and she's now my family.

136
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,820
She's my brother-in-law's wife.

137
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,590
Schedule either lunch
or dinner with her sometime.

138
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,790
What does this concern?

139
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,660
She was Seung Woo's...

140
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,600
I heard she was Mr. Kang's tutor
back when he was in school.

141
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,170
She seemed to check in on him
from time to time,

142
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,970
so I wanted to eat with her
and thank her.

143
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,970
I'll ask for her schedule
and let you know.

144
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,580
Mr. Kang.

145
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,690
You should call me
if you want to discuss something...

146
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,890
or talk to someone.

147
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,860
I was closer to Jae In
than Yu Gyeong.

148
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,830
I heard a lot about you, too.

149
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,030
Why did you just laugh?

150
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,100
Do you not believe me?

151
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,570
I was wondering if a close friend
would stab her in the back.

152
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,370
To me, there are
only two types of people.

153
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,610
Those who are good,
and those who are evil.

154
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,080
Those who are good
aren't always good,

155
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,880
and those who are evil
aren't always evil, either.

156
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
Someone good may seem evil,

157
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,150
depending on your outlook.

158
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,190
What kind of a person are you...

159
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,230
to Jae In right now?

160
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,700
A good person? Or...

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,100
an evil person?

162
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,100
I'm going to the design team.
Let Ms. Kang know if she needs me.

163
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,070
That woman...

164
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,920
Watch where you're going.

165
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,220
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,360
Jae In. Kang Jae In.

167
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,200
Kang Jae In.

168
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,070
What are you doing?

169
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,940
Who's Kang Jae In?

170
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
You need to make a proper apology.

171
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,250
I did. I said sorry.

172
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,480
- You tried to pick up that book...
- This is hot!

173
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,620
Oh, my.

174
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,590
You need to apologize.

175
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,000
Hey, Jae In.

176
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,500
I thought you, me, and Dr. Do
should meet up sometime.

177
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,540
Really?

178
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,540
I'll call you later, Jae In.

179
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,050
What are you doing here, Geum Ja?

180
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,080
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

181
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,720
You need to apologize.

182
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,990
Jae In wouldn't use
this kind of perfume.

183
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,530
And if she acted up like this,
she'd only get noticed.

184
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,400
Her burn scar seemed
rather old, too.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,270
She's not Jae In.

186
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,070
We both made a mistake,
so let's call it even.

187
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,950
That was really close.

188
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,220
I think I need another plan.

189
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,950
I need to show proof
that I really am not Kang Jae In.

190
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,200
She never leaves your place
but only stays home?

191
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,700
And no one
has contacted her, either?

192
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,130
No.

193
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,040
Only Jae In came by once,
but nobody else came.

194
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,840
Keep an eye on her, just in case.

195
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,140
Reach out right away
if anything happens.

196
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,910
Yes, sir.

197
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,460
I'm home.

198
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,600
Are you deaf?

199
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I told you to come instantly.
Look at the time now!

200
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,640
How can I come home
when I had patients to see?

201
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,070
But you had enough time...

202
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,740
to come home with your husband
as a shield?

203
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,910
We met out front.

204
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,280
How am I supposed to believe you?

205
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,550
Your wife controls
everything you say and do.

206
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,920
I had no idea my in-law was
frying chicken across the hall.

207
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,950
I found out recently, too.

208
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,090
And so did Yu Gyeong.

209
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,460
So, you knew about it?

210
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,930
Wasn't it enough that your husband
began to sell pig's feet?

211
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,730
Why don't you just start
an animal farm or something?

212
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,870
Good grief.
He's a disgrace to our family.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,070
My gosh.

214
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,070
I'll tell him to quit.

215
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,310
I'll handle this.

216
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,540
You should make dinner.

217
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,680
Come on.

218
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,120
We run a restaurant, too.
Why can't Father work there?

219
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,490
Hey, you punk. We're...

220
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,260
You know. That thing.

221
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,820
Yes, it's our family business.

222
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,490
He's working there as a part-timer.

223
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,630
You seemed to be close
to the owner of the chicken place.

224
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,530
Does she know you're this nasty?

225
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,170
Stop making this worse.

226
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,800
If he hears
something weird about me,

227
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,910
it'll be a disaster
for my dating business.

228
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,510
It's already giving me a headache.

229
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,910
What business?

230
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,910
Whatever.
Tell him to quit right away.

231
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,920
Father said the nicest things about you
to people at the chicken place.

232
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,090
What? He did? Why?

233
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,520
He never says
anything bad about anyone.

234
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,390
Do you remember that man you saw
in front of our business?

235
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,460
He's the owner's younger brother,

236
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,700
and he's really nice to Father.

237
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,630
That business had
such a great opinion of him.

238
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,770
How am I supposed to tell him
that he has to quit?

239
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,970
Hey, wait.

240
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,440
Tell him to keep working there.

241
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,080
Make sure her brother
also hears good things about me.

242
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,420
Gosh. I had a good talk with her.

243
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,090
Why does she care so much
about the fried chicken place?

244
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,730
How did Mother find out?

245
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,830
That?

246
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,360
I called your father,

247
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,560
and some woman picked up,
so I asked why a woman was at his...

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,770
He's seeing a woman?
And she was at his place?

249
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,710
Darn it. Father's going to kill me
when he finds out.

250
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,170
Honey!

251
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,150
Well, my former
sister-in-law's mother moved in.

252
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,880
She didn't have anywhere else to go.

253
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,320
You saw Mr. Do?

254
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,020
I don't know what he discussed
with Hwang Gi Chan,

255
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,420
but I was a bit concerned.

256
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,630
Are you sure you can trust him?

257
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,730
Let's pretend like we don't know
and keep an eye on him.

258
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,030
That'll be our best move.

259
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,640
Okay.

260
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,640
Actually, my mom is staying...

261
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,740
at his place.

262
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,710
She was released
from the detention center?

263
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,320
Yes.

264
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,980
She'll be tried without detention.

265
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,320
It looked like Gi Chan helped her...

266
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,590
in return for a portion
of YL's shares and her assets.

267
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,030
I hear a reinvestigation was opened
for your sister's accident.

268
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,630
Did the police reach out?

269
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,700
No.

270
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,870
I thought Hwang Gi Chan
didn't get along with your mother.

271
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,510
Isn't that so?

272
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,780
They don't get along.

273
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,050
That's why I don't understand
why he let her go.

274
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,110
But what I do know is...

275
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,680
that my mom got scammed
and lost her entire fortune,

276
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,250
and Gi Chan seemed to be behind it.

277
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,160
I should've told you before,

278
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,530
but I was out of it, too.

279
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,230
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,240
Ms. Kang, let's play.

281
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm bored.

282
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,240
May I play with her?

283
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,020
That was easy.

284
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,790
- Which colors should we use here?
- What? Yes.

285
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,990
Can I add more colors here?

286
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,690
Yes, it looks great.

287
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,790
This one.

288
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,830
The sky blue is so pretty.

289
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,500
- You're back.
- Hey, there.

290
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,640
Bo Ram adores her.

291
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,140
Okay.

292
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,720
Were you reminded of Do Hee?

293
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,390
It must be heartbreaking,
but just keep it inside.

294
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm just happy to see
that Bo Ram can be happy.

295
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,630
I thought she was kind of odd
to live off us like this,

296
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,940
but I could tell she was kind
by the way she treated Bo Ram.

297
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,540
Anyway, will she be okay
working with you?

298
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,110
She knows
all about Do Hee's incident, right?

299
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,780
I know it's nothing dangerous,
but it still concerns me.

300
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,090
- Move aside.
- You can't go in, Jae In.

301
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,020
- I told you to move.
- You can't do this!

302
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,630
- Move aside.
- Hey, no!

303
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,160
You can't do this.
Gi Chan is going to kill me.

304
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,500
Dang it.

305
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,000
I came to say something.

306
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,470
I have nothing to say.

307
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,340
But if you must say it, you should.
Have a seat.

308
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,870
Jeez.

309
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,050
I want a cup of latte...

310
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,490
No, a cup of caramel macchiato...

311
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,460
with lots of whipped cream.

312
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,490
What? My gosh.

313
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,900
Hello?

314
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,500
Hey, Geum Ja. I'm busy right now.

315
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,310
I'm wondering
what I should eat for lunch.

316
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,210
What are you craving?

317
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,910
Why did you take my phone?
Give it back.

318
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,080
Take it outside.

319
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,480
Darn it.

320
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,280
Hello?

321
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,620
Hey, Geum Ja.
What now? I didn't get that.

322
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,860
Geum Ja, I need
three copies of this file.

323
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,230
Yes, Dr. Kim.

324
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll call you later, Na Ra.

325
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,570
That should've been enough.

326
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,670
Say what you have to say and go.

327
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,880
I ordered coffee.

328
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,380
I'll stay for it.

329
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,680
You must have
lots of time on your hands.

330
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,720
That's right. So, I came
to demand money from you.

331
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,990
I need money...

332
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,320
to start a business or something.

333
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,220
I don't owe you anything.

334
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,660
You made me a mental patient
and took my assets, too.

335
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,900
I also realized
I never got a penny of alimony.

336
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,230
I met with my mom.

337
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,670
You took all of her shares
and the gallery.

338
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,100
Your mother...

339
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,840
could've been locked up
for the rest of her life.

340
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,940
Fine. Let's forget
what you did to her.

341
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,150
But I still need alimony.

342
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,880
How about five million dollars?

343
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,080
Was that too little?

344
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,020
Ten million dollars.

345
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,790
All right. I'll show you mercy.
Give me ten million dollars.

346
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,460
Ten million dollars.

347
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,230
How dare you blurt out
such nonsense?

348
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,130
Ten million dollars?

349
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,900
You're giving me a headache.

350
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,070
You must be out of your mind.

351
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,210
Do you think
ten million dollars is nothing?

352
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,610
You're as good as a thief.

353
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,510
A thief and a murderer.

354
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,580
How dare you call him a thief?

355
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,950
And he's not a murderer!

356
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,320
You already know
that your son is a thief.

357
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,650
And there must be people
who died because of him.

358
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,020
You! Shut your mouth!

359
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,500
Get out.

360
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,340
I'm not leaving
before you give me the alimony.

361
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,170
Get lost before I throw your mother
back into prison.

362
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,150
You're right.
We should demand alimony from you.

363
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,280
You were the one who had the affair!

364
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,380
Demand the alimony now.

365
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,690
Ask her for 10 million dollars,
no, double it and make it 20.

366
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:11,220
No, triple it
and demand 30 million dollars!

367
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,160
I can finally see
who that man took after.

368
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,560
What? You...

369
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,330
Wait, Gi Chan.

370
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,970
She just insulted me, right?

371
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,970
My gosh. I'm getting hot.

372
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,280
Anyway, that darned woman,

373
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,640
Jae In's mother.

374
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,080
Can you let her roam around freely?

375
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,920
Yes, you don't have to mind her.

376
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,680
How can I not mind her?

377
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,320
Do you know what the scariest thing
in this world is?

378
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,020
It's money.

379
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,160
You can use money
to control even people's lives.

380
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,390
She doesn't have
that kind of money or power.

381
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,030
She's broke.

382
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,960
Are you sure?

383
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,830
Yes, I made it happen.

384
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,010
That serves her right.

385
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,110
Come in.

386
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,850
What brings you here?

387
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,220
The director here
wanted to eat with me,

388
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,590
so I stopped by to see you.

389
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,020
I see.

390
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,220
Do you want to go out
for a cup of coffee?

391
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
Why are you here?

392
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,770
I called her here.

393
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,840
Bo Ram asked me
to get crayons to draw with you,

394
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,840
and I didn't know
how many colors she'd need.

395
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,940
With Jae In?

396
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,440
Isn't Bo Ram your niece?

397
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,450
Yu Gyeong, can we talk?

398
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,880
Let's go outside.

399
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,450
Please feel free to do it here.

400
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,650
You can come after you talk to her.

401
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,800
Am I the only one
who doesn't get this situation?

402
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,030
It's a long story,

403
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,370
but I'm staying at Dr. Kim's place.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,310
You're living at his place?

405
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,210
Why? Why his place?

406
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,350
I had nowhere else to go.

407
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,080
Do you expect me to believe that?

408
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,250
Did you know that your mom is
staying at my dad's place?

409
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,020
Yes.

410
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,190
You and your mother are
both shameless.

411
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,090
You have no money
to rent out a place?

412
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,630
That's nonsense.

413
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,030
You can ask Gi Chan
if you want the answer.

414
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,500
He has
all of my mom's and my assets.

415
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,500
And you played a part.

416
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,140
Don't say it like it's my fault.

417
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,010
Why are you framing me?

418
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,180
I'll find a place
as soon as I find enough money.

419
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,010
So, please understand until then.

420
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,850
Do I have to give you...

421
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,980
my understanding
whenever you demand it?

422
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,920
- Yu Gyeong.
- Leave Dr. Kim's place now.

423
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,420
I'm saying this for your sake,
so do it.

424
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,390
I'll manage.

425
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,830
Do you know whose place that is?

426
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,530
That's Ms. Kim Do Hee's family,
the woman your mother killed.

427
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,100
Ms. Kim was
Dr. Kim's younger sister!

428
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,470
You...

429
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,940
knew about this?

430
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,310
I do.

431
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,640
Yet...

432
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,550
Yet you choose to stay there?

433
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,580
How?

434
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,450
I want to know
why you're bringing this up now.

435
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,150
You already knew a long time ago...

436
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,320
who Dr. Kim Do Yun was.

437
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,390
- That's because...
- Yu Gyeong.

438
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,390
Are you really saying this...

439
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,800
for my sake
because you're worried about me?

440
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,630
If you wanted me to be stunned,
it failed.

441
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,970
Please excuse me
if you have nothing else to say.

442
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,040
That'd probably be better.

443
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,400
Hey, Seung Woo. It's me.

444
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,500
You wanted to know
where Director Choi Ja Young was, right?

445
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,110
The number is busy.
You will be redirected to...

446
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,350
Yu Gyeong said she was nearby.
Why isn't she here yet?

447
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,780
She won't pick up her phone, either.

448
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,300
You're still here?

449
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,370
Na Ra told me everything.

450
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,600
I heard
you begged my husband for money.

451
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,070
So, the great Kang Jae In
became penniless and had to beg.

452
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:55,870
Why don't you beg me, too?

453
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,940
Who knows? I may help you.

454
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,810
What right do you have?

455
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,080
- What?
- Do the employees here know...

456
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,250
that you're Gi Chan's wife?

457
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,320
What are you getting at?

458
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,690
I demanded an alimony from Gi Chan,

459
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,120
but I'm a bit confused about you.

460
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,920
Are you just his affair?

461
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,360
Or are you his current wife
who destroyed his former family...

462
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,560
and managed to marry him?

463
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,960
Don't you think the amount...

464
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,230
of compensation will change
depending on your current situation?

465
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,030
Why are you asking
such an obvious question?

466
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,770
You already came to my house
and saw who I was living with.

467
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Yes, I saw you there,
but the employees here had no idea.

468
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,680
I wasn't sure if you two made...

469
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,880
your marriage official.

470
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,410
You can still live with him
even as a woman on the side.

471
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,690
You were at my wedding.
What is this nonsense?

472
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,820
The wedding you held in secret
only with the family?

473
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,630
My late father always went
with my mother...

474
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,100
to the economic forum luncheon.

475
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,730
If your claim is true,

476
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,100
then you'll be there
at the luncheon.

477
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,040
Hello? You've reached Choi Ja Young.

478
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:10,080
I'm about to go to the interview.

479
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,050
It got canceled?

480
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,090
May I ask for the reason?

481
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,890
I scheduled the interview
after just reviewing your resume,

482
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,420
but I found out that
you were awaiting trial.

483
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,930
We mostly work
with people of high social status,

484
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,630
so I don't think we can have you.

485
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,030
Hey, there are many criminals
among those who are affluent.

486
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,400
There are economic criminals
and political criminals, too.

487
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,300
Don't you know they use money
and power to handle everything?

488
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,540
Forget it.

489
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,140
I don't want to be there
even if you came asking.

490
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,650
Why do they act like
they're so clean?

491
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Butler Lee, get the door.

492
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,790
Who's here?
Why are they ringing the bell?

493
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,610
I hoped it wasn't true,

494
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,110
but you really were here.

495
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,150
Did you come to check that?

496
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,350
If you're done, leave.

497
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,820
You need to be
at the detention center.

498
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,720
That's only fair!

499
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,790
Does it seem that unfair
to see me out here?

500
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,020
Of course, it's unfair.

501
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,330
I've been questioned again
as a testifier...

502
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,760
for their additional investigation!

503
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,300
Why did you get me a new car
and scrap the old one?

504
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,500
What's the reason?

505
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,570
You were determined...

506
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,310
to make me the murderer
from the start, right?

507
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,610
- Isn't that so?
- You had wanted a new car,

508
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,910
so I got you one, and that was all.

509
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,080
Stop lying.

510
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
You caused that accident
and tried to destroy the evidence...

511
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,290
to put the blame on me!

512
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,220
Everything will come to light
after the reinvestigation.

513
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,120
What's bothering you?

514
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,360
Why would anything bother me?

515
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,260
Are you afraid they'll find out
that you killed that woman?

516
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,800
Did you do it?

517
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,330
Darn it! You.

518
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,380
You may have hated and despised me,

519
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,140
but did you have to go that far?

520
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,880
Try and live like I did...

521
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,680
for the next 25 years.

522
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,150
Then, you'll know.

523
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,760
Yes.

524
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,930
You should be tortured, too.

525
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,700
I had to do everything I could...

526
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,140
to hold myself back
through all those harsh years.

527
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,180
You're here.

528
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,020
Min Jun told me...

529
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,660
that you didn't know
your in-law was working here.

530
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,590
I shouldn't have said that
after getting drunk.

531
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,360
I was too drunk back then,
so I didn't remember anything.

532
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,700
It doesn't matter how I found out.

533
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,900
It'll be nice to work
so close to my in-law.

534
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,210
Are you unwell?

535
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,240
It seems like
you can't speak too well.

536
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,110
I'm trying to get prettier.

537
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,620
When Min Jun says
something nice about me,

538
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,020
please make sure
you share it with Oh Seong, too.

539
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,690
Sure.

540
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,360
Do you know...

541
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,200
how Jae In ridiculed me today?

542
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,840
You don't have to respond
to everything.

543
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,740
You already know
she's a shell putting up a fight.

544
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,940
A shell. A shadow.

545
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,510
Those are all me.

546
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,350
We don't have to make this hard
between us.

547
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,690
Let's stop here, okay?

548
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,090
Fine. Let's stop.

549
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,590
I should stop this here.

550
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,230
Let's get divorced.

551
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,800
No, I'll just kill myself.

552
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,300
I'd rather die than
be treated like I didn't exist...

553
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,770
even though I was by your side.

554
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,080
What are you doing, Se Ri?
Spit it out now!

555
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,810
Spit it out!

556
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,520
No!

557
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,750
Mommy?

558
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,830
Do you have to do this
in front of our kid?

559
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,830
Mommy!

560
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,800
Why won't you acknowledge me?

561
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,400
Why should I live
if you won't have me as your wife?

562
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,180
Mommy!

563
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,980
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

564
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,650
Thank you.

565
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,720
Hello.

566
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,630
My name is Patrick Jung.

567
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,030
The CEO of DH Holdings,
Patrick Jung?

568
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
You must know who I am.

569
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,440
Of course, I do.

570
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,410
Everything you do
becomes a huge success,

571
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,410
so investment firms in the US
and Hong Kong are lined up...

572
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,640
to invest in your business
before you get listed.

573
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,350
So, it was true...

574
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,950
you were looking for a place to invest in
to expand your business.

575
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,420
You know,
I heard he was very particular.

576
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,360
It's impossible
to schedule a meeting with him.

577
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,530
He's a guy
who never showed himself...

578
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,730
or did his business publicly.

579
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,230
I'm thinking of investing a little.

580
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,810
My name is Hwang Gi Chan,
YL Group's chairman.

581
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,440
Nice to meet you.
My name is Patrick.

582
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,740
It's very great to meet you here,

583
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,810
so why don't we
have dinner sometime?

584
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,680
When would be a good time for you?

585
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,520
I don't know.
If we're meant to meet,

586
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,620
I'm sure we'll have a chance later.

587
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,020
Hey.

588
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,070
- What?
- What was that sound?

589
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,670
- What's going on?
- What?

590
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,070
(The 43rd Korea Economic Forum)

591
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,240
(Exposé World)

592
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,380
Surprise, everybody!

593
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,050
You're watching Exposé World,

594
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,350
exposing the dirtiest
and most disgusting scumbags of the earth.

595
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,280
Let's get started.

596
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,420
Who's the woman in this picture?

597
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,160
She's the faithful wife
to Hwang Gi Chan of YL Group...

598
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,930
and the daughter of
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol, Ms. Kang.

599
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,100
- Hwang Gi Chan drugged her,
- Is this true?

600
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,900
made her temporarily insane,

601
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,130
and extorted her assets.

602
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,230
After that, he forced her
to sign the divorce paper...

603
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,100
and locked her up
at a mental institution.

604
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,270
What is this?

605
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,770
Turn it off now!

606
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,240
What do you think the reason was?

607
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,910
It was because Hwang Gi Chan was
secretly with another woman,

608
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,250
a woman with whom he had a child,

609
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,080
a relationship he had kept
for a very long time.

610
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,250
Do you want to find out
who that adulteress is?

611
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,490
What kind of nonsense
is that crazy man saying?

612
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,220
Allow me to present...

613
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,930
the home wreckers,
the criminal couple of the century!

614
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,260
YL Group's new chairman
and his wife,

615
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,830
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri!

616
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,180
(Queen's House)

617
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,520
If it started as an affair,
wouldn't it always remain an affair?

618
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,120
Everyone, please be the judge.

619
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,630
Turn the screen off now! Now!

620
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,600
Nothing is more effective
than playing the media...

621
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,160
by exposing the actual truth.

622
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,900
I'll fix the wrong information...

623
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,240
and expose the actual story.

624
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,340
Just tell people
that everything was fake.

625
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,870
No one can win against that.

626
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,410
That's the best move.

627
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,780
It feels like Do Hee sent me
such a great present.

628
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,610
I'll find a new investor.
