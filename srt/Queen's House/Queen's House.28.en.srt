00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,310
(Mom)

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:10,780
Hello, Mom?

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,450
Do Yun, has Jae In called you?

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,420
No, is something going on?

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,460
The police called and said...

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,360
the hit-and-run driver
turned himself in.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,960
It's been a while since she left,
but I haven't heard back from her.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,560
Her phone is turned off, too.

12
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,570
Is that so?

13
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,140
I'll look into it.

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,300
(Episode 28)

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,610
(Kang Jae In)

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,280
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,610
You will be charged...

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,100
Eun Ho, everything is my fault.

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,300
I finally came to a realization.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,070
The worst happened to you
because of me.

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,080
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,380
I'm sorry I let you pass away alone.

23
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,520
Eun Ho, I'm coming
to ask for your forgiveness.

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,990
You won't have to wait too long.

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,330
Ms. Kang! Jae In!

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,060
Ms. Kang!

27
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,900
What do you think you're doing?

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,000
Come with me.

29
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,910
Have you lost your mind?

30
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,550
What are you doing?

31
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,020
Let go of me. Let this go.

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,480
I have to go.

33
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,790
I have to go and be with Eun Ho!

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,520
Pull yourself together, Ms. Kang!

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
Do you really think
Eun Ho wants something like this?

36
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,930
Is that all he would want?

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,170
What do you know?

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,670
Who do you think you are
to slander my son?

39
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,840
I may not know him,

40
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,040
but you must know what he's like.

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,380
I miss him.

42
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,850
I miss him to death.

43
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,760
Do you think Eun Ho will be happy
if you died after him?

44
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,790
Would you want him
to die after you...

45
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,760
if you had died first?

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,470
He'd feel the same way.

47
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,770
He's your son,

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,670
so you must know him
better than anyone.

49
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,240
Then, what can I do?

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,550
I can't go on without him.

51
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,120
What do you expect me to do?

52
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,990
You have to live for Eun Ho.

53
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,460
You need to get to the bottom
of Eun Ho's wrongful death...

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,460
and help him vent his spite.

55
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,390
It may be hard,
but you must stay strong.

56
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,660
You have to brace yourself,

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,960
hold out, and live on.

58
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,990
(Managing Director)

59
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,360
You're still at work?

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,160
You can leave first.

61
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,100
If it's nothing urgent,
do it tomorrow.

62
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
I don't want to eat dinner alone.

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,870
Aunt Mi Ran, I want to prove...

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
my competence to Jae In.

65
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,710
I see. We can eat together anytime.

66
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,640
I'll make something,

67
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,510
- so have some when you return.
- Okay.

68
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,750
Bye.

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,820
What do you like to eat?

70
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,950
Let me know if you have a favorite.

71
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,390
I'm fine.

72
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,390
Don't worry about me
and get a good rest.

73
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
Okay. I'll see you at home.

74
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

75
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,310
You found out what burial day means?

76
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,210
I looked it up on the Internet...

77
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,040
and asked my teacher, too.

78
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,580
It's the day when people pass away
to the other side.

79
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,680
Bo Ram,
you're much smarter than you seem.

80
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,080
How did you remember
such a difficult word like that?

81
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,990
Little Grandpa,
you just said something bad.

82
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,820
I did? When?

83
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,690
You said I was smarter
than I seemed.

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,390
That's not a compliment.

85
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,330
Oh, my. You're right.

86
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,100
I'm sorry, Bo Ram.

87
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,070
Grandma, did Ms. Kang's son, Eun Ho,

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
who's also my friend,

89
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,170
pass away?

90
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,880
How did you know?

91
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,510
Did you tell her?

92
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,780
When Ms. Kang was sick in bed,

93
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,750
she kept calling on Eun Ho's name
and cried.

94
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,950
You did the same
every single night in your sleep...

95
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,890
after my mommy passed away.

96
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,430
I didn't know I did that.

97
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,700
It must've been
heartbreaking for you.

98
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,830
Very much.

99
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,070
But I'm not heartbroken anymore.

100
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,800
She's watching over us
from the other side.

101
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,340
You're right.

102
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,740
I won't cry anymore, either.

103
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,610
She's looking at all of us,

104
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,810
so we shouldn't cry.

105
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,590
Why aren't they back yet?

106
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,290
Goodness.

107
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,660
Strangers may see you
and think she's your daughter.

108
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,130
Because I understand her completely.

109
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,200
And we're pretty much family
if we live under the same roof.

110
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,200
Why are you two so late?

111
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,670
What happened to your clothes?

112
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,410
First, have a seat.

113
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,150
- Woo Seong, boil some water.
- What?

114
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,180
- Let's make some hot tea.
- Yes, okay.

115
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,220
Goodness.

116
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,820
My gosh.

117
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,560
My goodness.

118
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,740
Your clothes are wet,
so you'll get cold.

119
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,110
You shouldn't catch a cold.

120
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,010
You'll feel warmer soon
if I do this for you.

121
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,010
Uncle Do Yun, wait just a little.

122
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,550
I'll give you a hug, too.

123
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
Ms. Kang.

124
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,930
Are you crying?

125
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,660
It feels so warm.

126
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,400
That's why.

127
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,600
Thank you, Bo Ram.

128
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,170
Thank you.

129
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,760
Jae In's mother came here?

130
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,690
I thought she was
at the detention center.

131
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,260
How did she get out?

132
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,600
How would I know?

133
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,300
It must mean...

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,370
she has an amazing connection.

135
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,240
I'm home.

136
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,810
Hey, did you eat dinner?

137
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,210
I don't have an appetite.

138
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,280
Honey, Jae In's mother got released.

139
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,550
I know. I let her go.

140
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,820
What?

141
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,550
What is this utter nonsense?

142
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,890
Have you gone crazy?

143
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,760
She's dying to take your life.
Why did you set her free?

144
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,560
Don't worry about her.

145
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,060
I'll go upstairs and get some rest.

146
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,000
What?

147
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,860
I'll go upstairs, too.

148
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,000
Goodness, that pushover.

149
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,070
Did he feel bad
for his ex-mother-in-law?

150
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,910
Why didn't you tell me?

151
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,180
Why did you let Jae In's mother go?

152
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,550
The hit-and-run driver who took the job
for Mr. Hwang turned himself in.

153
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,120
What do we do?

154
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,890
What if he spills everything?

155
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,490
Mommy, please read this book.

156
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,260
Hey, Ji Ho.

157
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,330
Do you want me to read it for you?

158
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,700
Yes!

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,330
- Let's go.
- We have to talk first.

160
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,970
I'll manage.

161
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,740
Don't do anything unnecessary.

162
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,510
All right. Let's go.

163
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,650
What's his plan?

164
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,820
My hair feels so soft
even without conditioner.

165
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,390
It smells so good, too.

166
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,640
My gosh, look at my hair.

167
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,180
All I did was blow-dry my hair,
but it has so much volume.

168
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,290
Right. Why didn't I think of that?

169
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,360
This will be
a perfect present for Yu Gyeong.

170
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,960
Then, she'll say something nice
about me to Dr. Kim, right?

171
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,670
My mind feels like
a tangled ball of thread.

172
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,840
I don't know
what's real and what's a lie,

173
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,010
who's with me and who's against me,

174
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,580
and when and how
everything went haywire.

175
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,920
Everything is confusing.

176
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,760
Ms. Kang! Jae In!

177
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,090
I have to go.

178
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,400
I have to go and be with Eun Ho!

179
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Pull yourself together, Ms. Kang!

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,970
I miss him to death.

181
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,070
I miss him.

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,920
Hey, do you want to grab a drink?

183
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,190
Sure.

184
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,270
What's going on?

185
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,570
I'm not sure
if it's right for me to target...

186
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,740
an innocent person.

187
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,940
I wanted that person's life...

188
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,010
to fall apart painfully.

189
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,850
I truly wanted that.

190
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,580
Now, my wish came true.

191
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,190
I thought a weight would be lifted,

192
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,220
but instead, I got scared.

193
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,290
I don't know who you're talking about,
but stop the hate.

194
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,460
It makes you more awful...

195
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,000
if you hate the innocent.

196
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,110
It's not an easy thing
to loathe another person.

197
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,670
The same amount of hatred...

198
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,980
will end up ruining your life, too.

199
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,710
Don't go around looking
for too many ups and downs in life.

200
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,480
Just let the person go
and forget about it.

201
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,060
I'm speaking from experience.

202
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,160
Do Yun.

203
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,160
Don't live your life like I did.

204
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,630
Jeez.

205
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,710
It's me, Gi Man.

206
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,710
What's Yu Gyeong up to?

207
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,850
She went to work already?

208
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,190
No, it's nothing serious.

209
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
I'll see you at work later.

210
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,930
He's at the hospital?

211
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,100
He's terminally ill
with some kind of disease.

212
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,070
He wasn't in good condition.

213
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,840
Which hospital is he at?

214
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,180
I just want to see
if he's really ill.

215
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,280
Or you can come with me...

216
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,610
and see if I do anything weird.

217
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,350
May I come in for a moment?

218
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,450
Sure.

219
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,960
All right, then. Goodbye.

220
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,100
I came to see if you were all right.

221
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,800
How do you feel?

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,370
I feel much better.

223
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,300
Thank you. You saved my life.

224
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,940
Who did you just talk to?

225
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,380
The police.

226
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,810
I heard from my mom
that the culprit was caught.

227
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,110
Did something happen
at the police station?

228
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,180
He wasn't caught.
He turned himself in.

229
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,990
I wanted to see him today
to hear more about the accident,

230
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,190
but the police called me.

231
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,390
They said
it was a drunk-driving accident,

232
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,630
and the culprit got hospitalized.

233
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,130
He collapsed during the questioning.

234
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,640
You should find out
what his condition is.

235
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,470
Do you know which hospital he's at?

236
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,080
There was a woman?

237
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,380
That's impossible.

238
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,480
He would've told me.

239
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,280
He's not a mommy's boy.

240
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,880
Why would he share
every detail of his life with you?

241
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,590
It's only natural for him
to date someone without telling you.

242
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,320
So? Why did he
break up with his girlfriend?

243
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,290
I don't know the reason.

244
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,730
It looked like he got dumped.

245
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,060
That's crazy.

246
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,400
Why would anyone dump him?

247
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
He's such a sweet,

248
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,540
kind, and diligent man.

249
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,910
You're only siding with him
because he's your son.

250
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,010
You don't know what really happens
between a man and a woman.

251
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,980
Things were hectic at home,

252
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,480
so he probably
couldn't pay her enough attention.

253
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,520
Don't talk to him
like you know something.

254
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,220
This was a secret between two men.

255
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,290
He won't tell me anything again
if you leak this information.

256
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,590
I need to know what's going on
to look after him.

257
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,060
All right.

258
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,160
Make sure you comfort him.

259
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,710
I checked to see
if she was feeling okay.

260
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,180
Good job.

261
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,650
You should eat and get to work.

262
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,480
Jae In, come and have a bite.

263
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,050
You have to gain more energy
to do something.

264
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,290
Okay.

265
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,160
Eat up.

266
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,170
Mom, you should eat, too.

267
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,400
Do Yun.

268
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,710
Don't worry about your family
and do whatever you want to,

269
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,540
like dating someone or whatever.

270
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,110
- Yun Hee.
- Let's eat.

271
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,090
Didn't you go to work?

272
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,700
I said I'd be late.

273
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,830
I wanted to go to your place,

274
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,100
but I didn't know where you lived.

275
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,300
Are you not going to tell me?

276
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,270
You should've called.

277
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:07,840
Can we talk?

278
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,410
Have a seat.

279
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,710
Do you want coffee
or anything else to drink?

280
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,050
You need to quit your job.

281
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,590
It'd be humiliating
if my mother-in-law found out.

282
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,830
You're right across the hall,
so she'll find out very soon.

283
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,690
Why would it be humiliating?

284
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,430
I had too much time on my hands
and got bored after retiring,

285
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,770
so I took it up as a workout.

286
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,230
Then, you should
start working out at the gym.

287
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,940
I'll get you a membership.

288
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,340
I'm not doing anything bad.
Why are you acting so sensitive?

289
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,540
Ms. Noh also worked all her life,
so she would understand.

290
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,710
I'd end up feeling sick
if I sat around like a bum.

291
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,980
I'm a doctor.

292
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,080
What if someone found out
my father was working...

293
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,250
at a place like this?

294
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,290
I can't stand the embarrassment.

295
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,590
Yu Gyeong, what you just said
crossed the line.

296
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,530
Did you say you were embarrassed
with your diligent father?

297
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm not ashamed of this.

298
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,260
Why won't you think of my face?

299
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,270
If Mother finds out,
she'll look down on our family even more.

300
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,200
I hate how she does it to me,

301
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,740
but what I hate more is
how she looks down on you.

302
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,270
Why does she look down on you?

303
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,810
What's the reason?

304
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,640
Because one was the daughter
of a corporate mogul,

305
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,080
and I was the daughter
of an employee of that company.

306
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,320
So, please. You have to quit.

307
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,420
Was that why you hated Jae In?

308
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,990
Don't bring her up to me anymore.

309
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,420
She now has nothing to do with me.

310
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,490
She's your friend.

311
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,200
You must know how tough
everything is for her right now.

312
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,270
Wouldn't it be great
if you could be there for her?

313
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,970
You're worried about her again?

314
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,600
What about me?

315
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,270
Please start worrying about me.

316
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,370
She even has her mother.

317
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,540
I don't understand
why you're stepping in like this.

318
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,850
Ms. Choi is in the detention center.

319
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,110
She got released.

320
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,280
She was?

321
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,790
Wait, how?

322
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,290
How would I know?

323
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,120
You don't work
for that family anymore.

324
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,490
How Jae In lives her life...

325
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,330
is no longer your business.

326
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,760
Don't you feel bad for her?

327
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,570
I mean, the kidnapping.

328
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,270
I'm done talking. Goodbye.

329
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,060
Bring me another knife...

330
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,090
Young Woong, cheer for him
and give him some energy.

331
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,160
Daddy, stay strong. You can do this!

332
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,860
Okay. All right.

333
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,460
You can't do this, ma'am.

334
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,100
You said
you'd come by and just check.

335
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,770
Who are you?

336
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm the victim's mother.

337
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,480
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

338
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,710
I'm so sorry.

339
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,180
Please don't do this.

340
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,580
This won't undo what he did wrong.

341
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,630
Do you remember the accident...

342
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,700
from that day?

343
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,170
Why did you do that?

344
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,200
Didn't you see the traffic light?

345
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,870
It was green.

346
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,110
Did you really fail to see my child?

347
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,810
Say something!

348
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,180
Were you really drunk at that time?

349
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,810
No, he can't drink
a drop of alcohol.

350
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,020
Stop saying nonsense.

351
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,750
I did it.

352
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,490
I'll receive my punishment,
so just go.

353
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,860
- Honey.
- Daddy!

354
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,400
Honey.

355
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,730
Sir, are you all right?

356
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,870
Sir, please stay with me.

357
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,500
What's troubling you?

358
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,010
Sir.

359
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,540
Hey, Seung Woo. How did the meeting
with that business go?

360
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,280

361
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,810
All right. You can return
and finish up your work.

362
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,580
Tell Ms. Kang that
she can go straight home.

363
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,250
- Okay.
- Ms. Choi, you cannot go in.

364
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,560
It's all right. You may leave.

365
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,330
How dare he try to stop me?

366
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,600
Why are you here
instead of the detention center?

367
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,930
Did you break out?

368
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
Why? Have you finally
come to your senses...

369
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,310
now that you see me out here?

370
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,710
Well, you wouldn't have made
Gi Chan the chairman...

371
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,910
if you had the right mind.

372
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,880
I made that choice on my own...

373
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,180
in my clear mind.

374
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,320
What about the power of attorney
you took from me?

375
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,260
Have you really gone crazy?

376
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,790
How did you get the idea
to side with someone like him?

377
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,290
You're completely mistaken.

378
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,360
You're both the same to me.

379
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,130
Neither you nor Hwang Gi Chan...

380
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,770
is human to me.

381
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,870
What did you say?

382
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,170
You're both chess pieces I play
according to the game,

383
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,940
nothing more, nothing less.

384
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,010
I can side with any of you
according to my need.

385
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,310
I just need the benefit.

386
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,080
- Mi Ran!
- I thought...

387
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,880
Gi Chan would become
a better tool...

388
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,820
for the future of YL Group than you.

389
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,120
Do you get it now?

390
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,360
Goodbye, then.

(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

392
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,910
I need to see you.

393
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,410
You took
half of Ja Young's shares...

394
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,750
in return for guaranteeing
a trial without detention?

395
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,590
Yes.

396
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,560
Defending management rights is
the priority for YL Group right now.

397
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,490
At the very least,
you should've talked to me.

398
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,500
You don't know
what she'll do out here.

399
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,100
She can't do anything alone
at this point in time.

400
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,200
Don't you know about her family?

401
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,400
It won't be an easy fight
if they side with her.

402
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,440
Lions drop their cubs
off of a cliff...

403
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,640
and only raise the ones
that survive.

404
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,950
That family won't take back...

405
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,280
a woman who has already fallen.

406
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,120
Anyway,
I cannot let my sister-in-law...

407
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,390
covet YL Group.

408
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,590
Remember that.

409
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,320
Of course.

410
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,730
I'll never
have to hand over YL Group.

411
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,060
Please don't worry.

412
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:15,000
I'll also make sure...

413
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,600
neither you nor Kang Seung Woo
can ever lay a finger on YL Group.

414
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,070
I will do that.

418
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,930
I was already questioned
more than enough...

419
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,100
when I got framed as the culprit.

420

423
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,420
So, your older brother is
the CFO of this business?

424
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,660
Yes, it's a bio venture company
that's about to be listed...

425
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,520
both domestically and globally.

426
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,060
We've been contacting
many different investors,

427
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,100
but none of them
seemed trustworthy to me.

428
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,370
I thought
I'd feel rest assured with you,

429
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,770
so I wanted to make the offer.

430
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,870
What are the terms of my investment?

431
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,710
You'll be the biggest shareholder
after the company goes public,

432
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,180
and you'll be made the joint CEO.

433
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,020
Once this company gets listed,

434
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,590
it'll be a piece of cake
to grow the business...

435
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,590
big enough to take over YL Group.

436
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,290
All right. I'll invest.

437
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,060
Use my entire fortune
as the investment.

438
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,600
I'm investing in this
with my faith in you,

439
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,600
so make sure
it doesn't cause any problems.

440
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,570
Of course. Please leave me to it.

441
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,900
Right. What about YL's shares
you own at the moment?

442
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,140
Sell everything...

443
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,670
and add the amount
to the investment.

444
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,010
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,450
Just wait, Hwang Gi Chan.

446

with my hands very soon.

How are you unwell today?

00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,960
It's my head. No, my heart.

449
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,060
My heart beats so fast,
so I can't sleep well.

450
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,430
What do I do?

451
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,800
Dr. Kim, do you have a girlfriend?

452

454
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,380
I fell for you at first sight.

455
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,350
I like you.

456
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,620
My mom is so rich...

457
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,150
that she can give you
a whole building for your clinic.

458
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,990
Do you want to go out with me?

459
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,560
Come in.

460
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,100
I was near,
so I thought I'd stop by.

461
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,830
Na Ra, why are you here?

462
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,870
Do you feel unwell?

463
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,340
Yes, I do.

464
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,840
- How are you unwell?
- No idea.

465
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,580
Hey, Gi Chan.

466
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,910
I'm in the restroom.
I'll be there now.

467
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,620
Dr. Kim, let's talk again later.

468
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,090
Please excuse me.

469
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,930
Is she unwell?

470
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,160
No.

471
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,000
What brings you here at this hour?

472
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,770
I had a shoot with the TV station,

473
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,100
so I used it as an excuse
to take the day off.

474
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,600
Do you want a cup of coffee?

475
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,810
It was right across
from my mother-in-law's business,

476
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,910
so I found it uncomfortable
to see my dad work there.

477
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,850
I asked him to quit, but he said no.

478
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,780
It must've hurt.

479
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,150
Yes, very much.

480
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,720
I feel much better
after pouring everything out.

481
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,860
I feel comforted.

482
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,890
It's a different story,

483
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,060
but I always tell my mom...

484
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,470
to quit her business and relax,
but she'll never say yes.

485
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,600
Taking up a job...

486
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,900
may be his need to prove that
he's an active part of our society.

487
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,310
It might help you
if you thought of it in his shoes.

488
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,880
What about your husband?
Did he say anything?

489
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,750
He said everyone takes up
a job like that when they age...

490
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,220
and talked
as if it wasn't his concern.

491
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,950
Treat me to dinner.

492
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,490
I want to eat out tonight.

493
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,990
One second.

494
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,900
Hello? Yes, Jae In.

495
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,430
What did he say?

496
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,270
Let's talk more in person.

497
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,370
I'll be there now.

498
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm sorry.
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

499
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,010
That isn't the Jae In I know, is it?

500
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,250
It is her.

501
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,580
As you know, she had a tough time
after she recently lost her child,

502
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,990
so I wanted to help her
with whatever I could.

503
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,960
I really don't get it.

504
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,930
You know who Jae In is.
How can you do this?

505
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,800
Don't you know why your sister died?

506
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,000
I do.

507
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,800
It wasn't her fault.

508
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,570
She must never feel lonely...

509
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,040
with so many people
concerned about her.

510
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,480
I'm leaving.
You don't have to see me off.

511
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,560
What's the lightest one?

512
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,390
The chick. That's right.

513
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,430
Wait, I wrote down the wrong letter.

514
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,970
Wait, Eun Ho gave me this sticker.

515
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,210
I'll keep you safe, Mommy.

516
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,360
Ms. Kang.

517
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,700
Do you want to go see Eun Ho?

518
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,500
Here's something my uncle told me.

519
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,970
When people pass away,
they become stars.

520
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,210
They become stars in the sky...

521
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,310
and look over us every single day.

522
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,350
My mommy is up there, too.

523
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,120
Do you see that one over there?

524
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,990
That's my mommy's star.

525
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,160
I see.

526
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,230
You should look for him.

527
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,200
I know Eun Ho is up there, too.

528
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,230
Hey, I saw a glittering star.

529
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,300
Ms. Kang, do you see
the glittering star...

530
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,810
next to my mommy's star?

531
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,340
Yes, I do.

532
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,440
That must be Eun Ho.

533
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,180
And it's glittering like that...

534
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,420
because he wants to tell you
that he loves you so much,

535
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,820
but he's worried you're too far away
to hear his voice.

536
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,320
That's why he's glittering instead.

537
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,360
You're right.
It must be Eun Ho's star.

538
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,430
It's glistening brightly.

539
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,400
Mommy! Bo Ram is here!

540
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,870
I've been eating well...

541
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,470
and doing well, too!

542
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,710
You don't have to worry about me!

543
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,580
Eun Ho! Hi!

544
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,280
Are you doing well with my mommy?

545
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,990
I'll keep Ms. Kang safe,

546
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,060
so please keep my mommy safe, too!

547
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,130
You should say hi to him, too.

548
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,440
Eun Ho, I hope you're doing well.

549
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,710
I'm doing well, too.

550
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,980
Ms. Kang, he can't hear you
if you talk that quietly.

551
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,220
You have to be louder.

552
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,460
Eun Ho!

553
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,690
Hwang Eun Ho!

554
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,860
Mommy's doing well,

555
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,460
so you have to be well, too!

556
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,770
Ms. Kim, please look after...

557
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,940
my Eun Ho!

558
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,940
Please do that!

559
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,110
Thank you!

560
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,010
Ms. Kang.

561
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,320
Have you ever seen my mommy?

562
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,160
No, but...

563
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,460
I can tell by seeing you
that she must've been beautiful.

564
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,260
You're right.

565
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,760
My mommy's really pretty.

566
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,350
Bo Ram, let's eat dinner.

567
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,950
- Ms. Kang, look at this.
- Yes?

568
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,590
She's my mommy.

569
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,720
(Queen's House)

570
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,550
Isn't my mommy pretty?

571
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:42,530
You look so pale.

572
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,630
Do you feel unwell?

573
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,600
No, I should go to my room.

574
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,070
There must be a reason
why you're suddenly doing this.

575
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,730
I can't stay here.

576
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,240
Why did you help me?

577
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,670
What if it wasn't to help you?

578
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,410
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,780
I'm so sorry.

580
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,210
I hate myself for worrying about...

581
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,320
that woman.
