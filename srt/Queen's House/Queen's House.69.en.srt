(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,010
(Episode 69)

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,890
What is this? Darn it.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,330
Are you crazy?

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,100
What took you so long?

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,000
You're out of your mind.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,670
How dare you play the fool with me?

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,770
What's wrong, Mother?

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,510
Please let go of me!

12
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,780
You brat.

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,510
Please don't do this.

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,950
You need to stop!

15
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,390
Are you okay?

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,360
Mom, did you harass Jae In again?

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,760
You've done enough damage.

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,530
All of you have no idea!

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,530
She's the sleaziest girl
in the world!

20
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,200
I can't believe this.

21
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,770
She doesn't have amnesia.

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,340
She remembers everything,

23
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,370
but she's just
putting on a show in front of us.

24
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,480
She's a fraud!

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,150
What do you mean, Mother?

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,680
You need to explain this.

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,220
There's no need to explain anything.

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,850
Give me that.

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,390
Do you know what this is?

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,560
It's the health supplement
she got for you.

31
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,130
Health supplement? My foot.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,330
It's so ridiculous.

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,170
Those weren't health supplements.

34
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,470
Those are drugs
that make me fall asleep.

35
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,840
What? Like poison?

36
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,740
Someone else I know would do that,

37
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,710
but not Jae In. No way.

38
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,640
No, not poison.
Those are sleeping pills.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,610
No, Mother.

40
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,950
Why would I give you sleeping pills?

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,220
These are health supplements.

42
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,260
Honey, no.

43
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,120
Why would I do that to her?

44
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,190
You can confirm it yourself.

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,960
We can check and see what it is,
as she has suggested.

46
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,170
That way,
we can undo the misunderstanding.

47
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,580
Secretary Yoon,
I'm going to send you something.

48
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,380
Find out what it consists of.

49
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,690
What's going on, Gi Man?

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,030
Did something happen?

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm right, aren't I?
Those are sleeping pills, right?

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,910
I got you.

53
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,680
You need to stop, Mom.

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,850
These are health supplements.

55
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,650
Take a look.

56
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,290
He's right.

57
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,660
Why do you do this to me, Mother?

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,200
Is it because you didn't like
how I was bedridden for too long?

59
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,070
I didn't want that, either.

60
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,170
I also want to know...

61
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,840
how I got hurt
and why I was in bed for so long.

62
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,640
But I don't remember anything.
What can I do?

63
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,250
Jae In,
she didn't do this on purpose.

64
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,020
She just had a misunderstanding.

65
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,650
Wait a moment.

66
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,360
I'm in my right mind,
so this is impossible.

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,830
I went to Yu Gyeong and asked,

68
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,900
and she clearly said...

69
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,630
What?

70
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,730
Did she lie to me?

71
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,270
You met with Yu Gyeong?

72
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,040
It's me, Jae In.

73
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,380
Gi Man's mother just came here...

74
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,050
and asked me to check
the health supplement you gave her.

75
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,450
Do you know anything about it?

76
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,490
She probably wants to know
if those are sleeping pills.

77
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,560
Yu Gyeong, can you tell her
those are sleeping pills?

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,130
Is that true?

79
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,100
No, right?

80
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,230
I'll make her fumble
over her suspicion.

81
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,770
She needs to suffer greatly, too.

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,070
All right. I'll do as you say.

83
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,440
But Jae In,
these people aren't easy to handle.

84
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,880
Be careful.

85
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,060
She didn't get those just for you.

86
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,560
She got one for everyone.
What you said is absurd.

87
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,200
I looked up the one she gave me,
and those were really expensive.

88
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,130
It was famous
as an effective supplement.

89
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,630
Be honest.

90
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,040
Are you sure Yu Gyeong said
those are sleeping pills?

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,670
Yes, that's what she said.

92
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,610
Otherwise, how would I know?

93
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,340
I was never educated.

94
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,380
That's not something
you should say out loud.

95
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,880
Stop that.

96
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,950
Call Yu Gyeong.

97
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,420
She won't pick up my call,

98
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,990
so call and ask if she told her
those were sleeping pills.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,020
Yes, let's do that.

100
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,560
It's me, Yu Gyeong.

101
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,830
I heard you met with my mom.

102
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,040
She said you told her...

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,870
the pills she showed you were
sleeping pills.

104
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,540
What are you talking about?

105
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,210
I clearly told her
those were health supplements.

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,080
Listen to this girl!

107
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,450
You said those were sleeping pills.

108
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,420
Don't be unreasonable. Goodbye.

109
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,190
Good grief.
We know what you're like, Mom.

110
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,620
Everything is out in the open now,

111
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,230
so just say you're sorry.

112
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,660
That'd be the end of it.
Why are we all sitting here?

113
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,260
No, that's not true!

114
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,100
You. Tell me the truth!

115
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,370
You said you didn't have amnesia.

116
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,070
You said it yourself. You did!

117
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,280
- You.
- Mom.

118
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,680
You need to stop!

119
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,520
Don't you know
that my wife is pregnant?

120
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,920
Oh, my.

121
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,720
Your wife?

122
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,430
Stop causing trouble in the family.

123
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,230
This is why people say
there's no use in having a child.

124
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,600
Goodness.

125
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,270
This is so unfair.

126
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,080
This is an injustice.

127
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,360
Hello, Mr. Do.

128
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,520
Hey, Seung Woo. You were here.

129
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,230
Ms. Jung said she had good oil today
and gave us fried chicken.

130
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,530
Let's go home
and have some with a drink.

131
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,440
Mr. Do, I came to ask Yu Gyeong
to buy me dinner,

132
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,000
but I'm craving fried chicken now.

133
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,470
May I join you?

134
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,270
Why not?

135
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,340
- Come with us.
- Yes!

136
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,780
Mr. Do, do you remember...

137
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,780
how you used to put me
on your shoulders as a kid?

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,590
I do.

139
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,690
Back then, I could easily lift you
with my two hands.

140
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,030
I've never even been
on my dad's shoulders,

141
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,790
so you were the first
to do that for me.

142
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,630
I got excited and kept asking for a ride
whenever I saw you,

143
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,900
and it made my dad mad.

144
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,900
But later on, you'd do that first
without me having to ask.

145
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,840
I loved that so much.

146
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,240
I see.

147
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,840
Here.

148
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,120
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

149
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,760
Hello?

150
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,860
Isn't this Kang Seung Woo's phone?

151
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,630
Hello, Director Kang.

152
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,630
I'm Yu Gyeong, Jae In's friend.

153
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,500
He's at my place right now.

154
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,870
He had a drink with my dad
and fell asleep.

155
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,370
I didn't want to wake him,
so I'll let him stay here tonight.

156
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,440
I see.

157
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,880
May I come over
and see him in his sleep?

158
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,020
I haven't been able to see him
outside of work hours.

159
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,820
I just need...

160
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,160
to stop by and see him.

161
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,810
I'm sorry for coming over this late.

162
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,970
It's all right.

163
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,640
My dad's asleep in his room,
so feel free to stick around.

164
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,610
I'll go to my room, too.

165
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,610
I was once in love with this man,

166
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,510
but my family was dead against him.

167
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,750
I didn't mind how they tortured me,

168
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,290
but my family...

169
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
tried to ruin him
and his family, too.

170
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,330
Your grandfather was a feisty man.

171
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,150
I couldn't even say
my last goodbye to him...

172
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,380
before I left him.

173
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,290
Only then did I find out
I was pregnant with you.

174
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,890
My family was adamant
about aborting my pregnancy,

175
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,590
but I couldn't do that.

176
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,100
I had to make you
my brother's family...

177
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,130
if I wanted to give birth to you.

178
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,280
My family thought it'd be impossible
for me to find a husband...

179
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,050
if people found out
I was a single mother.

180
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,650
I should've told Ja Young,

181
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,620
but my dad didn't let me.

182
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,730
He said we should
keep it a secret among the Kangs.

183
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,970
Gyu Cheol was also under pressure
to divorce Ja Young...

184
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,800
because she was
unable to have a son.

185
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,870
In a way,

186
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,750
it must've been a choice
he made to protect her.

187
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,450
And...

188
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,350
before you turned one,

189
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,920
I married Goo Jin Sang.

190
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,190
It wasn't love.

191
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,830
It was a marriage of convenience
between families.

192
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,170
I think...

193
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,410
the end was evident
as soon as it began.

194
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,780
I regret
not telling Ja Young about you,

195
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,650
but I never...

196
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,120
regretted giving birth to you.

197
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,800
I'm sorry, Seung Woo.

198
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,500
I'm sorry that I'm your mother.

199
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,170
Okay. All done.

200
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,800
It doesn't look right.

201
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,510
Should I do it over?

202
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,280
No, it looks pretty.

203
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,480
I have to go
to the kindergarten soon.

204
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,950
I'll practice some more...

205
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,980
and make it
look even prettier next time.

206
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,960
I'm going to work.

207
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,660
Have fun
at the kindergarten, Bo Ram.

208
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,360
- Uncle Do Yun.
- Yes?

209
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,500
Yes?

210
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,030
Can you tell Ms. Kang
that I miss her?

211
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,370
I'll do that.

212
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,710
- I'm leaving.
- Bye.

213
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,810
Have a great day, honey.

214
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,650
Wait.

215
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,280
What if Mother sees us?

216
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,520
She's still in a foul mood.

217
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,190
She hasn't even had breakfast.

218
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,560
I'll make sure she eats
after you leave. Don't worry.

219
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,700
All right. Thanks. I'll go.

220
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,900
Bye.

221
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,500
Have a great day.

222
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,570
I'm leaving, too.

223
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,740
Are you going somewhere this early?

224
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,110
It felt stifling
to be stuck at home all day.

225
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,980
I'm leaving to plan a new business.

226
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,830
Where did I put that notebook?

227
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,100
Mom, come and eat breakfast.

228
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,040
I don't want to eat.

229
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,710
Okay.

230
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,780
- Let's go, Mom.
- Okay.

231
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,420
I can't believe that girl.

232
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,420
Darn it. Why should I starve
in my own home?

233
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
Everything here is mine.

234
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,630
What were you looking for
in your suitcase?

235
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,560
You probably don't remember,

236
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,230
but your dad left
a box of articles behind.

237
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,840
I had left it
at Director Do's place.

238
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,570
In the box, there was a notebook
that seemed important,

239
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,780
but it wasn't
at Director Do's place anymore.

240
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,210
I'm not sure where it is.

241
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,250
Let's go together
and look again tomorrow.

242
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,520
Okay.

243
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,490
Don't you see me?

244
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,630
Bring me rice and soup.

245
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,200
I can't stand all this noise.

246
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,070
Don't you have any table manners?

247
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,170
- Are you already done?
- Yes.

248
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,570
I need to get some rest.

249
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,470
Didn't you hear me?

250
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,240
I want food.

251
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,250
What are you...

252
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,100
What do you think you're doing?

253
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,870
Leave the side dishes there.

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,670
What are you...
What the heck are you doing?

255
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,240
Make your own food.

256
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,150
Have you completely lost your mind?

257
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,580
Don't you know who I am?

258
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,050
I'm your mother-in-law!

259
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,860
Pull yourself together,
Ms. Noh Sook Ja.

260
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,120
I don't have a mother-in-law.

261
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,290
Feel free to eat whatever you want,

262
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,030
but it may contain shrimp powder.

263
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,000
Be careful.

264
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,080
She's dying to kill me.

265
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,650
Good grief!

266
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,420
Hello?

267
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,120
Who?

268
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,790
Who made my dear Mr. Kang cry again?

269
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,630
Your eyes are bloated.

270
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,430
Just go on your way.

271
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,470
Are you worried about Ms. Kang?

272
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,940
Or is this about your mother again,

273
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,510
just like how you cried last time...

274
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,810
because you weren't
Jae In's real brother?

275
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,550
I must've told you
all kinds of nonsense.

276
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,080
I should quit drinking.

277
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,190
Well, you know everything already,
so here goes.

278
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,260
My birth mother told me
why she had to abandon me.

279
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,200
But I'm not so sure anymore.

280
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,530
It sounds like she had a tough time,

281
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,500
but it also feels like an excuse.

282
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,610
You should give credit
where it's due.

283
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,380
Aren't you grateful
that she gave you birth...

284
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,580
and let you have Jae In
as an older sister?

285
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,250
It may be tough
to understand her now.

286
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,950
But if you keep trying,
it'll happen one day.

287
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,420
You finally sound like an elder.

288
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,630
That was a little helpful.

289
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,900
I heard you moved...

290
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,930
into Chairman Kang's place
to protect Jae In.

291
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,340
That was commendable of you.

292
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,200
Have a great day.

293
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,750
The Swiss Bank?

294
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,820
Yes, sir.
While Chairman Kang was alive,

295
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,890
hundreds of millions of dollars
had gone into this account...

296
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,960
after all taxes were filed,
and I tracked it down.

297
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,260
It was opened almost 30 years ago,

298
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,660
and I believe it's his account,
held under a different name.

299
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,930
This is the account holder code
for the bank.

300
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,010
It's the same code
found in the notebook.

301
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,580
So, this is the number
for the account in Switzerland?

302
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,180
Now I'm sure he kept a slush fund,

303
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,250
and he accumulated this asset
for over 30 years.

304
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,250
I must get my hands on it.

305
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,620
First, my official duty is...

306
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,590
to hand over this investment review.

307
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,360
I'll look over it
and let you know right away.

308
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,830
Why aren't you leaving?

309
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,040
Well...

310
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,340
You can use that
when you get hot flashes.

311
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,180
My sister did the same before.

312
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,480
Do you want to eat lunch?

313
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,750
Tofu is supposedly
good for menopause,

314
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,950
and I know a great place.

315
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,820
Stop talking about menopause.

316
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,460
It's not a great word
to keep hearing.

317
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,030
No matter how you put it,
it's still a sad word for women.

318
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,560
Right. Sorry.

319
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,300
It's been too long since I dated,
so I'm feeling clumsy.

320
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,470
What is it?

321
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,680
Don't ask.

322
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,680
I must've thought dating was
something really difficult.

323
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,110
Well, of course, it's special.

324
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,080
But I began to think that
dating really means...

325
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,150
eating together, working together,

326
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,850
and sharing our everyday life.

327
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,760
You and I haven't shared
much time together like this.

328
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,000
It's been 28 years,
so yes, it's been a while.

329
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,930
Let's take our time
and start doing this and that.

330
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,340
Okay. Let's do that.

331
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,710
It's okay to be clumsy.

332
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,080
I also feel as lost as you.

333
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,750
As far as I'm concerned,

334
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,550
you were the perfect man for me.

335
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,840
Are you two in a meeting?

336
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,470
No, we're done. What's up?

337
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,110
I wanted to ask you out for lunch.

338
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,240
Never mind if you can't.

339
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,380
No, I can go.

340
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,680
Mr. Patrick, why don't we
take a rain check on our lunch?

341
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,950
Thank you for this. Yes.

342
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,090
Hey, Seung Woo. Let's go.

343
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,460
Mr. Kang must feel much lighter
after talking to me.

344
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,400
I'll let you off this time.

345
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,640
Is this place okay with you?

346
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,940
We could've gone to a nicer place.

347
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,410
The food is out already. Let's eat.

348
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,020
Thank you for giving me birth.

349
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,450
Thank you for giving me a chance...

350
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,120
to live happily...

351
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,390
as Jae In's younger brother...

352
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,730
and my parents' son.

353
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,630
I mean it.

354
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,730
I can't understand everything,

355
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,470
but I'll try.

356
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,570
You should eat.

357
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,110
Thanks.

358
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,120
Thank you, Seung Woo.

359
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,370
You need to come here first.

360
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,100
What is it? What's going on?

361
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,670
Look.

362
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,510
Do you know who did this?

363
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,750
It was Jae In, that sly girl.

364
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,680
She threw out everything
right in front of me,

365
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,380
saying she didn't want
to waste food on me.

366
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,590
You're back, honey.

367
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,850
When did you get home?

368
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,560
Just now.

369
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,420
Is it because I'm pregnant now?

370
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,260
I got exhausted and fell asleep.

371
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,860
I'll make dinner soon.
Wait just a little.

372
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,700
Who did...

373
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,010
Mother, you didn't do this, did you?

374
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,310
You threw out everything!

375
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,640
How dare you blame this on me?

376
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,880
Don't you think this is too much?

377
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,980
If you didn't want to eat these,
you could've said so.

378
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,650
I'm sorry, honey.

379
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,420
I need to go upstairs and calm down.

380
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,390
That girl...

381
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,960
How many times
do I have to tell you to stop?

382
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,930
What is wrong with you?

383
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,500
Who am I?

384
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,670
I'm your mother,
the one who gave birth to you.

385
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,630
You should believe me, not her!

386
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,540
She didn't lose her memories.

387
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,970
She remembers everything.

388
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,510
- Can't you see?
- Stop acting ridiculous.

389
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,780
Why would she stay here
if she didn't lose her memories?

390
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,180
Why would she treat Ji Ho
like her own son?

391
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,350
You need to stop.

392
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,850
Oh, my.

393
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,560
I feel framed. I can't believe this.

394
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,730
Honey.

395
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,970
I didn't know
Mother despised me this much.

396
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,080
Honey, this is too hard for me.

397
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,780
I had a good talk with her,
so she'll stop doing this.

398
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,480
I couldn't tell you this,

399
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,650
but after you left,
in the afternoon...

400
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,260
No, never mind.

401
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,060
I'll have another talk with her.

402
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,100
I think she's getting worse
because we're here together all day.

403
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,170
Wouldn't it be better
if we got separated for a while?

404
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,370
Do you want to move out?

405
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,670
She can't live alone,

406
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,340
so no, not that.

407
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,180
Can I go back to work?

408
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,980
I want to start working, too.

409
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,120
You're pregnant right now.

410
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,780
The doctor told you to be careful.

411
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,020
That's why.
It's harder for me to stay at home.

412
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,220
I won't overwork myself,

413
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,960
and you'll be nearby, too.

414
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,090
I'll be careful. Please?

415
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,100
All right.

416
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,100
You can start next week.

417
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,770
Thank you, honey.

418
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,340
Daddy!

419
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,510
Hey, Ji Ho.

420
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,780
Did you have fun today?

421
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,080
Yes, Mommy made me lots of snacks,

422
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,250
so I had fun.

423
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,220
Did you?

424
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,750
Daddy, can you read a book for me?

425
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,990
Let me read one for you, Ji Ho.

426
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,360
He has to get changed.

427
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,630
Let's go.

428
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,710
"He prepared breakfast alone."

429
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,280
"Seo Jun came out,
rubbing his sleepy eyes."

430
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,610
"He..."

431
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,090
Honey, can you help me?

432
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,450
Sure.

433
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,620
Good.

434
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,960
Are you craving anything?

435
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,530
I don't know. Maybe some fruit?

436
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,070
Apple mangoes?

437
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,600
You used to love those.
Should I get some?

438
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,670
It sounds like a big hassle.
I'm fine.

439
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,040
It's not a hassle.

440
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,980
Are you craving anything other
than apple mangoes?

441
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,980
Do you remember
what we had on our second date?

442
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,320
Stir-fried tripe?

443
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,890
Yes, that.

444
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,660
I'm not the one who's craving it.

445
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,000
What if Ji Ho wakes up? Be quiet.

446
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,370
I'm sorry for interrupting you.

447
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,080
This is the only place
where I can rest.

448
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,110
You're back.

449
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,050
Let's go, honey.
I don't want Ji Ho to wake up.

450
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,310
Okay.

451
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,860
Did she just laugh at me?

452
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,050
Oh, my. Thank you so much.

453
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,450
Shut your mouth. We aren't friends.

454
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,850
You must be trying to pull a trick
because you're in need of money,

455
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,690
but that fried chicken place
can't give you anything.

456
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,460
It's the chicken place.

457
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,730
You took your money,
so keep your mouth shut.

458
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,500
- Otherwise, give it back.
- Hey.

459
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,530
You can't take it back.

460
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,700
Don't worry. I won't pick it up.

461
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,610
I gave you enough money,

462
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,680
so keep your mouth shut
until you're six feet under.

463
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,010
Don't pick up her calls
and just disappear. Okay?

464
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,250
The person you have reached...

465
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,080
She really won't pick up.

466
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,520
The insurance planner said
the payment was issued...

467
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,460
from a plan we took out
under my husband's name.

468
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,660
Ms. Kim was the one who handled
all insurance plans around the area,

469
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,200
so it was probably the same
with my husband.

470
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,370
You're here.

471
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,000
Hello, Ms. Choi.

472
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,140
Hello, Mr. Do.

473
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,670
Hey, there.

474
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,410
It's nice to see you
back in full health.

475
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,710
I heard everything.

476
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,480
You should be careful.

477
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,420
Yes, please don't worry.

478
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,650
I have to go out, so feel free
to stay as much as you want to.

479
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,290
Please excuse me, Ms. Choi.

480
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,990
All right.

481
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,030
- See you later, Dad.
- All right.

482
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,430
All her stuff is still in the room.

483
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,770
Will you tell her everything?

484
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,870
It's about time she found out,

485
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,870
but I'll look
for the notebook first.

486
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,110
Mom, let me look for it.

487
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,850
I'll make some tea, Ms. Choi.
Give me just a moment.

488
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:26,130
It's not here.
She must've put it elsewhere.

489
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,430
Does she just not remember?

490
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,770
- Hey, Jae In.
- Yes, Mom?

491
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,910
Hey, Mom. About Dad's notebook...

492
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,540
Seung Woo took first place
in the math competition.

493
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,380
Who did he take after?

494
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,350
Don't you think he's a genius?

495
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,620
Seung Woo?

496
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,920
Yes.

497
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,850
Your dad wants him to study abroad
once he goes to middle school,

498
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,260
but I don't want to do that.

499
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,620
How can I let him go alone?

500
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,960
Mom, what's wrong?

501
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,030
Seung Woo isn't in middle school.

502
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,870
Why are you here?
You should be at school.

503
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,810
Ms. Choi, the tea is ready.
Come on out.

504
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,710
Who are you?

505
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,980
Yu Gyeong.

506
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,250
She's acting weird.

507
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,260
Jae In.

508
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,790
I have to talk to you.

509
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,650
Does she know?

510
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,190
Yes, she found out first...

511
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,550
and got examined at a hospital.

512
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,990
Mom.

513
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,930
Mom?

514
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,740
Jae In, don't you think
your dad is so handsome?

515
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,470
Anyway, who's this man?

516
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,850
Mom...

517
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,920
What's wrong?

518
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,460
Did something happen out there?

519
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,030
I'm sorry, Mom.

520
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,870
I'm sorry.

521
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,870
Mom.

522
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,490
Mom.

523
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:46,230
(Queen's House)

524
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,130
What did you do there?

525
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,770
I'm making dinner.

526
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,500
Someone might tamper with the food
and try to kill me,

527
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,370
so I have to do this to save myself.

528
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,540
I have no idea
why she's pretending...

529
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,240
to have lost her memories.

530
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,440
You believe me, right?

531
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,840
Of course.

532
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,510
Who else would I believe
as your daughter-in-law?

533
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,380
You need evidence
to let Gi Chan believe you,

534
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,180
so why don't you do this?

535
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,220
I'm returning to work as of today.

536
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,350
It's great to be back.

537
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,190
What's your blood type,
