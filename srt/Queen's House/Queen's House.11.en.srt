1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,510
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,010
(Episode 11)

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,110
Come in.

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,490
I was going to reach out to you...

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,920
and ask you to join me for lunch.

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,320
Are you done
with your morning sessions?

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,060
- Yes.
- Let me take a short break here.

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,000
I know everyone is worried
and concerned about me,

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,930
but it honestly feels uncomfortable.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,070
I can't even tell
if they mean it or not.

13
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,110
I know I sound crazy.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,150
I thought you were
talking in your sleep.

15
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,350
If you meant that,
then it didn't seem like you.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,690
My friend asked me
to give that to you.

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,530
She thanked you for saving her son,

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,030
and she meant it.

19
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,440
I thought good things would happen
if I went around doing good.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,240
It didn't have to happen to me,

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,210
but at least
to my family and friends.

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,380
You said
the hit-and-run driver got caught.

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,050
He was a colleague at her work...

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,050
in the same office,
the Strategy Planning Department.

25
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,990
What made me the most furious was...

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,060
the attitude
of the perpetrator's mother.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,830
She said she'd pay me
however much I wanted...

28
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,730
and told me to consider it
a present Do Hee left behind.

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,360
How can she be so brazen?

30
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,470
Didn't you say
your sister worked for YL Group?

31
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,710
Do you know the driver's name?

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,240
It's Kang Seung Woo.

33
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,080
Kang Seung Woo
in the Strategy Planning Department?

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,850
Are you sure about that?

35
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,710
Do you know him?

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,190
He's the son
of YL Group's owner family.

37
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,360
Hello? Detective?

38
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,430
The real perpetrator?

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,360
So, it wasn't Kang Seung Woo?

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,030
Yes, I'll be there right now.

41
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,840
Wait, the detective said
it wasn't Seung Woo, right?

42
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,010
I'll have to go and find out.

43
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,610
Bye.

44
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,790
Hello? Hey, Jae In. It's me.

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,760
(Operating Center)

46
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,660
Jae In, you should've called
when you came to the hospital.

47
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,130
Who's in the operating room?

48
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,400
Gi Chan.

49
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,340
What? Why?

50
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,100
Was he hurt?

51
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,540
Did he get into an accident?

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,140
He has intestinal perforation.

53
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,510
Doctor, what happened?

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,080
Is my husband all right?

55
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,250
Yes, the operation went well.

56
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,360
Thank you. Goodness, thank you.

57
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,130
Come in.

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,770
You haven't eaten, right?

59
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,440
You should have some.

60
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,910
It'll take him a while to wake up.

61
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,710
I'm not hungry,

62
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,480
and I don't have an appetite.

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,820
Do you know how you seem right now?

64
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,050
I wouldn't be surprised
if you collapsed immediately.

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,620
The surgery went well.
We'll have to keep an eye on him,

66
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,990
but there won't be a huge problem.

67
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,930
Don't be too worried.

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,230
Hey, and about Seung Woo.

69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,500
He's unrelated
to the hit-and-run accident, right?

70
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,410
I have to go somewhere for a moment.

71
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,610
Can you keep an eye on him?

72
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,590
The hit-and-run driver
wasn't Kang Seung Woo,

73
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,560
but his mother?

74
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,200
- Yes.
- That's crazy.

75
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,900
She's probably taking the blame
to protect her son.

76
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,030
Do you believe her?

77
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,300
There's evidence.

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,300
Everything was recorded on the CCTV
at Mr. Kang's parking lot at home.

79
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,910
So, Kang Seung Woo's mother...

80
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,680
intentionally took his car
and caused the accident?

81
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,580
Why would she do that?

82
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,680
It doesn't make any sense.

83
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,450
It wasn't
an ordinary hit-and-run accident.

84
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,220
We'll have
to look into it some more,

85
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,590
but she must've thought
the late victim was an adulteress...

86
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,690
Wait.

87
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,590
What did you just say?

88
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,230
An adulteress?

89
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,500
Are you suggesting
my sister was in an affair?

90
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,830
- Well, I...
- It's not true.

91
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,330
This is just wrong.

92
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,470
You can't just make such a claim
just because she's dead.

93
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,670
This is an insult to her.

94
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,770
My sister would never do that!

95
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,940
Please calm down...

96
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,580
- and hear me out...
- She suffered an unfair death,

97
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,480
and now what? An adulteress?

98
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,150
How can anyone remain calm
after hearing that?

99
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,220
Anyway, we're still investigating,

100
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,090
so we'll update you when we're done.

101
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,530
So, you... You're sure
it really wasn't Kang Seung Woo...

102
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,930
but his mother?

103
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,570
Aren't you the detective
who was at my place this morning?

104
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,910
Yes, hello.

105
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,240
I'd like to meet my mom.

106
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,710
Is that possible?

107
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,280
Sure. Come on in.

108
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,750
Okay.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,700
Why did you come?

110
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,570
You don't belong here.

111
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,340
Why didn't anyone stop you?

112
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,510
Mom.

113
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,710
Don't worry about me.

114
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,110
I'll get out soon.

115
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,450
My attorney will do the job right.

116
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,980
Was it really you?

117
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,620
Did you...

118
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,120
really do this?

119
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,930
Please say it isn't so.

120
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
Please, Mom.

121
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,330
I kept thinking
and thinking about it,

122
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,830
but I still couldn't believe it.

123
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,730
It wasn't you, was it?

124
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,700
No, right?

125
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,940
I did it for you.

126
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,640
You're the only one in my life.

127
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,450
Jae In, listen up.

128
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,580
You need to divorce him immediately.

129
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,320
You can't put it off anymore.

130
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,990
I wanted to kick him out
empty-handed,

131
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,290
but just give him the darned alimony
and get him out of your life.

132
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,590
Mom, please!

133
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,230
You should've asked me first.

134
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,660
If you had,
you wouldn't be here today.

135
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,970
How can you come
to such a misunderstanding?

136
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,430
Do you still believe him?

137
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,370
Wake up, Jae In.

138
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,470
Why do you think
he cornered me like this?

139
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,080
He knew
I found out about his affair.

140
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,210
He didn't want
to deal with the aftermath,

141
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,580
so he did everything he could
to push me off the cliff.

142
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,020
Don't you get it?

143
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,120
You caused the car accident...

144
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,020
because of your delusion...

145
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,220
I wasn't imagining this!

146
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,820
I know he has another woman.

147
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm doing my best to understand you,

148
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,630
but how can you
throw Seung Woo under the bus?

149
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,090
You shouldn't have used him.

150
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,860
How can you frame him
for everything you did?

151
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,130
He wasn't at fault.

152
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,730
How can you do this?

153
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,000
Of course, he's at fault.

154
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,740
His existence itself is a fault.

155
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,370
He should've never been born.

156
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,180
Seung Woo and your father...

157
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,880
pushed me into despair
and humiliated me.

158
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,780
Mom.

159
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,750
I just don't get it.

160
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,550
You cherished him so much.

161
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,920
I never loved him.

162
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,290
How can I love the boy...

163
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,900
who destroyed my life?

164
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,300
If he was an orphan
I adopted from a home,

165
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,670
I would've
at least felt bad for him.

166
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,180
I must've put on a great act...

167
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,580
if I managed to fool everyone
for almost 30 years.

168
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,950
Mom.

169
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,920
Are you really...

170
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,720
the same person I know?

171
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,430
Jae In, you're the only one for me.

172
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,730
You also know everything now,
so you need to be level-headed.

173
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,700
Why do you think your father
brought Seung Woo to work?

174
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,170
This is his plan
to hand over YL Group to him.

175
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,870
Do not let him have the company.

176
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,880
You're the rightful owner of YL,
no matter what anyone says.

177
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,080
He only shares half of your blood,
so he's as good as a stranger.

178
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,180
Remember this.

179
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,120
Seung Woo isn't your brother.

180
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,750
Do not let him have it.

181
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,100
Is this the police?

182
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,040
I found a thief
who stole my herbal tonic,

183
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,110
so come and arrest him now.

184
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,510
Good grief.

185
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,580
You're so pathetic.

186
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,720
My own son,
and of them all, my eldest,

187
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,490
should be getting me...

188
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,090
some herbal tonic,

189
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,590
not stealing it in secret.

190
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,130
How long do you want to live?

191
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,760
You're a terrifying kid.

192
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,400
Mom, you mean terrible,
not terrifying.

193
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,660
It's both terrible and terrifying!

194
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,030
I'm terrified that
people might hear about this,

195
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,170
you terrible kid.

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,200
Don't you have anything better to steal
than your mom's tonic?

197
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,210
I had been
feeling low on energy lately.

198
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,740
You don't even do much.

199
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,880
What do you do every night?

200
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,310
I carry pig's feet,
prepare them, boil them,

201
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,850
remove the bones,
put them in containers,

202
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,320
and serve the dishes, too.
Do you know how hard it is?

203
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,950
My hands, head, shoulders,
back, knees, and feet all ache.

204
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,820
You sit elegantly at the counter...

205
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,320
and don't even lift your finger.

206
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,520
I've been busy, too.

207
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,330
I had to type into the computer.

208
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,130
I can always do that.

209
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,000
I'd lose the business overnight...

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,300
if I left it in your hands.

211
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,240
Stop whining and get to work.

212
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,270
I'm not taking this for myself.

213
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,710
I'm doing it for all of you.

214
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,310
Who do you think will suffer
if I fall ill?

215
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,310
Hey, honey.

216
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,150
What? Gi Chan got surgery?

217
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,890
You were quite late today.

218
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,890
I was.

219
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,670
I heard the police came
to the Strategy Planning Department.

220
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,780
I thought of calling Jae In,

221
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,710
but I didn't want to bother her
if things were hectic.

222
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,710
Seung Woo wasn't
the hit-and-run driver.

223
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,950
Right?
I couldn't believe it, either.

224
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,550
I'm very glad.

225
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,890
Then, did they catch
the real culprit?

226
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,590
It seems like
Director Hwang hasn't come, either.

227
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,930
Nothing's going on
with Jae In, right?

228
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,430
No.

229
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,630
Director Hwang wasn't feeling well,
so he got hospitalized.

230
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,970
What? How is he ill?

231
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,740
I'm not sure, either.

232
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,580
Can you visit the hospital for me?

233
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,950
You're Jae In's friend,
so please do me a favor.

234
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,280
Sure.

235
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,770
Baby, are you okay?

236
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,070
What happened?

237
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,510
How did you fall ill?

238
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,580
Give me a second.

239
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,910
I don't know what happened, either.

240
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,550
Just stay on the bed.

241
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,290
What happened to Jae In's mom?

242
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,420
Did it fail?

243
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,500
You did it.

244
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,530
So, she must've gotten arrested.

245
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,840
- I'm sorry.
- That hurts.

246
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,880
Gi Chan! My son!

247
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,250
Goodness, Gi Chan.

248
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,180
I heard you got surgery...

249
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,550
and almost died from devastation.

250
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,750
Goodness. Are you all right?

251
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,520
My gosh.

252
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,030
So, who are you?

253
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,230
Hello. My name is Kang Se Ri.

254
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,300
Oh, she's a colleague.

255
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Yes, and I'm also Jae In's friend.

256
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,610
Goodness, you're Jae In's friend?

257
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,680
So, what does your father do?

258
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,680
Which corporation does he own?

259
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,120
Mom, where's Jae In?

260
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,050
She ran out
because of urgent business,

261
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,020
but I couldn't find out the details.

262
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,890
Anyway, how did you end up
getting surgery?

263
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,560
I'll get the doctor.

264
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,260
It'd be more accurate
if you heard it that way.

265
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,530
(VVIP Ward 1202,
Hwang G. Chan, 37, male)

266
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,770
The surgery went well.

267
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,500
But the important thing begins now.

268
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,140
You must take good care of yourself.

269
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,870
We put you on a respirator
during surgery,

270
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,170
so please do
some breathing exercises, too.

271
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,340
So, is intestinal perforation...

272
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,780
something really scary?

273
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,880
If he had come any later,

274
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,750
he could've died
from peritonitis or shock.

275
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,920
- Goodness.
- Please pay extra attention...

276
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,290
to your diet for at least a month.

277
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,990
And stay away from anything
that can cause inflammation,

278
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,760
including alcohol, smoking,
and spicy or strong-tasting food.

279
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,360
When can I be discharged?

280
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,000
We'll have to see,

281
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,400
but you'll be out within a week.

282
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,970
Excuse me.

283
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,070
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

284
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,870
You're such a fool.

285
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,840
No one will commend you
for losing your life after overworking.

286
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,880
Don't even dream of going home,
and get a good rest.

287
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,650
Anyway, I can't believe
my in-laws aren't here.

288
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
Se Ri.

289
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,020
Mother, you're here.

290
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,760
You're here,
my dear daughter-in-law.

291
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,000
You almost ended up living my life.

292
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,270
Sorry?

293
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,830
You almost became a widow.

294
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,870
He worked all the time
for YL Group...

295
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,870
to the point his bones were crushed,
and his stomach was perforated.

296
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,340
You must feel
very bad and grateful for him.

297
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,710
I'm sorry, Mother.

298
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,220
Goodness, don't say that.

299
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,180
You didn't do anything wrong.

300
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,090
And I'd rather have him sick.

301
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,060
If you had fallen ill,

302
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,260
I would've fallen ill with you.

303
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,760
That's how much I adore you.

304
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,040
Mom!

305
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,910
Mom!

306
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,080
She's not at the gallery,
and her phone is turned off, too.

307
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,420
Did she go somewhere to pray...

308
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,880
because of me?

309
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,120
I'm tired.

310
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,120
I'm going to get some sleep,
so wake me up when she comes.

311
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,130
She needs to be the first
to hear about the good news,

312
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,330
so don't tell her I'm home.

313
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,130
Mr. Seung Woo is here.

314
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,140
I'm almost at the realtor's office.

315
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,670
Goodbye.

316
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,210
Yu Gyeong will probably faint...

317
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,150
if she finds out
I even sold my house.

318
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,750
But I'd rather do this
than depend on her.

319
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,430
And I should find a job
to support myself.

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,530
(Closed temporarily
due to personal reasons,)

321
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,330
You don't have to see me off,
but how can I stop you?

322
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,470
It's not easy to care for the sick,
so you should go back.

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,940
- Goodness.
- Oh, my. Mother.

324
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,870
Are you all right?

325
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,080
I thought of Gi Chan,
and my legs gave out for a moment.

326
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,320
I can still
hear the doctor saying...

327
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,750
that he could've lost his life...

328
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,890
if he came any later.

329
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,990
I'm sorry, Mother.

330
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,790
You don't have to be sorry.
Why do you keep saying that?

331
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,400
You didn't do anything wrong.

332
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,370
Let's do this.

333
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,000
You're too thin and frail,

334
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,270
so what if you fall ill
while looking after him?

335
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,240
I don't even want to imagine that.

336
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,710
Let's hire a caregiver.

337
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,580
I'll pay, so please don't protest.

338
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,580
He'll feel much more at ease
if I look after him.

339
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
I'm healthy,
so don't worry about me.

340
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,490
If that's what you want,
then I can't stop you.

341
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,660
I should take you back home, but...

342
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,860
Let me give her a ride.

343
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,730
Ma'am, please come with me.

344
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,700
Thank you.

345
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,840
Mother, please go with my friend.

346
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,070
Let's go, ma'am.

347
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,380
Let me take you home.

348
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,940
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Bye.

349
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,650
- Let's go, ma'am.
- Right.

350
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,320
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Bye.

351
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,430
Hey, what about my mom?

352
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,200
She just left.

353
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,030
Se Ri offered
to give her a ride home.

354
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,300
It must've been a tough day.

355
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,600
Hardly.

356
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,670
It must've been harder for you.

357
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,010
I was trying to help Seung Woo,

358
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,710
but I never imagined
it could be your mother.

359
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,580
All kinds of thoughts
raced through my head...

360
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,550
as I watched her
go into the police station.

361
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,320
I began to wonder
if I shouldn't have done that.

362
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,090
I feel like I hurt you,
so I'm starting to regret this.

363
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,730
You didn't do anything wrong.

364
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,530
My mom was at fault for everything.

365
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,470
But we wouldn't be here...

366
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,000
if I didn't step in.

367
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,210
You've done well.

368
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,210
Otherwise, Seung Woo
would've taken the blame.

369
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,710
It means she'll add
one more crime to her list.

370
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,480
I'm glad you did that.

371
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,890
I haven't mentioned my mom
to your mother.

372
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,260
I didn't know where to begin
and how to tell her.

373
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,590
Everything is a jumble in my head.

374
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,360
I can't think straight.

375
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,530
You don't have to mind that.

376
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,400
I'll manage.

377
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,670
Honey.

378
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,410
Look at me.

379
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,140
Jae In.

380
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,310
Come closer.

381
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,880
I don't think I can face you.

382
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,050
I didn't know my mom would
misunderstand you that much.

383
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,620
It must've been hard.
Why didn't you tell me?

384
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,330
- If you had...
- If I had,

385
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,460
I would've made you more miserable.

386
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,560
I promised to make you happy
when we got married,

387
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,130
and I wanted to stay true to that.

388
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,270
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,440
I'm so sorry, honey.

390
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,810
Will you come closer?

391
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,710
I can't do that right now.

392
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,120
I didn't want to hurt you.

393
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,790
Please do understand.

394
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,130
Just forget...

395
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,430
whatever she says.

396
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,100
It may seem harsh,

397
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,930
but I'll only focus on you
and Eun Ho from now on.

398
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,970
That's how I can
keep my family safe.

399
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,340
Please just trust me...

400
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,640
and only listen to me from now on.

401
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,550
Can you do that?

402
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,130
My goodness.

403
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,270
Mom, I'm hungry.

404
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,470
How about some hangover soup?

405
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,070
Or we can eat intestine soup.

406
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,010
Na Ra, take that thing off your face.

407
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,710
I drank all night yesterday,

408
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,610
so my stomach hurts.
I need to relieve my hangover.

409
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,880
Na Ra, stop talking...

410
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,350
and get me a cup of tea.

411
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,350
What? What's with you, Mom?

412
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,250
Did you eat
something wrong out there?

413
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,990
You're acting so weird.
That's not like you.

414
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,760
Stop joking around.

415
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,030
We have a guest here.

416
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,700
- Hello.
- My gosh!

417
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,040
Thank you for the ride.

418
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,540
You should stay for a cup of tea.

419
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,780
Sure, thank you.

420
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,880
You must've been shocked
in many ways today.

421
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,920
My heart literally dropped.

422
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,920
Why did his stomach
suddenly become perforated?

423
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,090
I really don't understand that.

424
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,960
Jae In's mom gave him herbal tonics
good for his stomach,

425
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,100
so I heard he had been taking them.

426
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,200
Then, he should've become better.

427
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,770
Why do you think it was perforated?

428
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,140
That's what I'm saying!

429
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,770
Anyway, it must've been shocking.

430
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,880
It's probably because
she loved her son-in-law so much.

431
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,410
I understand that she got mad...

432
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,450
at her son-in-law's affair,

433
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,520
but still,
how could she kill someone?

434
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,780
Who's having an affair,

435
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,720
and who killed someone?

436
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,090
I'm talking about Jae In's mom.

437
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,960
She thought Director Hwang had
another woman on the side.

438
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,490
Goodness, you didn't know?

439
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,360
Oh, my. This is my mistake.

440
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,500
I'm sorry.

441
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,270
No, wait. Jae In's friend.

442
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,540
You need to explain everything.

443
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,080
I don't understand
what you're saying right now.

444
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,910
Well, the thing is...

445
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,890
Bo Ram.

446
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,350
Why won't you eat your food?

447
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,420
Eat up.

448
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,760
Grandma.

449
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,500
I don't think Mommy loves me.

450
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,760
What do you mean?

451
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,900
She loves you so much.

452
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,140
She doesn't love me or miss me.

453
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,710
That's why she won't even call.

454
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,140
Yes, right. Do Yun.

455
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,550
Didn't you say
she called late in the night?

456
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,080
Uncle Do Yun, is this true?

457
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,980
Well...

458
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,490
Yes, right.

459
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,490
I forgot to tell you.

460
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,490
Bo Ram,
she's in a different time zone.

461
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,730
When it's day here,
it's night there.

462
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,930
When it's night here,
it's day there.

463
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,570
That's why she called late
while you were asleep.

464
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,270
- Really?
- Yes.

465
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,300
She told me to tell you this.

466
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,810
She misses you a lot...

467
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,010
and loves you so much.

468
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,910
And she told you
to listen to Grandma and eat well.

469
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,410
Then, she'll...

470
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
She'll come and see you later.

471
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,920
- Really?
- Yes.

472
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,190
Good for you, Bo Ram.

473
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,860
Let's eat.

474
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,760
Okay.

475
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,830
Eat up.

476
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,480
But her identity has been confirmed.

477
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,850
All right.

478
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,020
Make sure no word gets out.

479
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,720
Keep an eye on everything.

480
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,460
So?

481
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,830
There's a possibility
she'll destroy evidence,

482
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,730
so they decided
to keep her detained.

483
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,970
What's your plan now?

484
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,940
She's under investigation,
so let's discuss this again...

485
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,480
when the result is out.

486
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,910
Who cares about the result?

487
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,450
She admitted to everything!

488
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,650
Don't you know
what she has done to Seung Woo?

489
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,120
This is considered grooming!

490
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,330
Hey.

491
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,900
How's Gi Chan?
Did you leave him there alone?

492
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,800
He thought Eun Ho would worry,
so he told me to go home.

493
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,570
I'll go back early in the morning.

494
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,140
Wouldn't it be better
to hire a caregiver?

495
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,140
You've never done this before.
It'll take a toll on you.

496
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,510
I'm going to do it.

497
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,850
He had felt unwell
and had pain in his stomach lately.

498
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,480
I just thought
he was stressed out about work.

499
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,450
But it was all Mom's fault.

500
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,620
I'm sorry.

501
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,990
It's all my fault.

502
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,730
Yes, you're at fault, too.

503
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,260
You're also responsible...

504
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,860
for what happened to Mom.

505
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,130
Hey, Jae In.

506
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,370
Aunt Mi Ran,
think about this as a woman.

507
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,270
She couldn't tell anyone.

508
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,610
She couldn't even tell me...

509
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,340
and had to put up with this
all her life.

510
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,510
Do you think
that's a normal way to live?

511
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,810
So what?

512
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,110
Are you saying she's justified...

513
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,850
for killing someone
and framing Seung Woo for it?

514
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,420
If she didn't want to raise him,
she should've said no.

515
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,890
- If she had...
- That's enough.

516
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,690
In the end, it's all my fault.

517
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,700
I was wrong.

518
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,130
I'm not taking her side.

519
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,670
Of course,
she should get punished...

520
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,170
for killing an innocent person.

521
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,170
And Dad,
you're partially responsible,

522
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,370
and so am I.

523
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,410
I've committed...

524
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,850
such a grave sin
against all of you as a parent.

525
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,180
I'm so sorry.

526
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,590
I'm worried about Seung Woo.

527
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,490
How will
that soft-hearted kid take this?

528
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,260
I'll find a good day
to explain everything.

529
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,200
Don't tell him about his mom...

530
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,700
until then.

531
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,130
Who's his mom?

532
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,470
Fine.

533
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,540
Forget everything else.

534
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,610
The fact that
Ja Young is at the police station...

535
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,540
- as the hit-and-run driver...
- What are you talking about?

536
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,850
What now?

537
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,490
Jae In, why is Mom
at the police station?

538
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,120
What is this
about the hit-and-run driver?

539
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,120
Wait.

540
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,230
Did she take the blame for me?

541
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,830
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

542
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,930
I know it's true!

543
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,970
It's true, isn't it?

544
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,640
- Mommy!
- Hey, Eun Ho.

545
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,180
Seung Woo.

546
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,610
Let's do this later.

547
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,350
Eun Ho is here.

548
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,290
Mommy.

549
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,020
Is Daddy really sick?

550
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,060
No, he's fine.

551
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,430
He's much better now.

552
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,100
Who's having an affair,

553
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,170
and who killed someone?

554
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,440
I'm talking about Jae In's mom.

555
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,270
She thought Director Hwang had
another woman on the side.

556
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,710
I'm so furious.

557
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,340
I'm so mad.

558
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,810
Jeez.

559
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,520
Mother, your herbal tonic.

560
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,390
It's from your in-laws
in Changpyeong-dong.

561
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,890
Are you trying
to make me more furious?

562
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,560
Get this away from me!

563
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,130
Hey, I've never seen anyone...

564
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,900
who's as double-faced as you.

565
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,930
You must've known everything,
you evil brat.

566
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,300
What do I know?

567
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,000
What do you know?

568
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,370
Your dad is a director at YL Group.

569
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,270
It means
you must've known everything.

570
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,540
I heard Ms. Choi thought
Gi Chan had another woman,

571
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,480
lost her senses,

572
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,510
and caused a car accident
to kill that female employee!

573
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,280
Did you think I'd want this tonic
after hearing everything?

574
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,790
I don't want to see you here,
so get out!

575
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,530
My father resigned from YL Group.

576
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,260
Goodnight.

577
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,570
What kind of nonsense is this?

578
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,630
That little... Darn it!

579
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:27,100
Good grief. This is so unfair.

580
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,610
Is this true?

581
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,340
It was Jae In's mom?

582
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,510
You can ask Jae In.

583
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,050
I'm not the old liar anymore.

584
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,880
I grew out of my high school habit.

585
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,950
Yu Gyeong, you're making me sad.

586
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,420
I want to get along with you,

587
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,460
but it's kind of disappointing
when you feel so distant.

588
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,200
When did I do that?

589
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,700
I wasn't like that.

590
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,770
Is that so?
Then, do you want to eat lunch?

591
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,870
You called me all the way here,

592
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,140
so treat me.

593
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,570
Sure.

594
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,740
I got to make a great memory
thanks to you.

595
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,080
How can I thank you enough?

596
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,020
I'm glad to hear you liked it.
That's all I want to hear.

597
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,390
Yes.

598
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,890
- Stay strong and beat this illness.
- Okay.

599
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,260
Thank you.

600
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,320
Don't mention it.

601
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,030
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

602
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,430
Excuse me. Hello.

603
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,470
Hello.

604
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,900
I got the gift. Thank you.

605
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,610
You saved Eun Ho's life.

606
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,140
- We can't thank you enough.
- It's Jae In.

607
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,010
Should I share this or not?

608
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,480
I'm torn.

609
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,420
Is that doctor
acquainted with Jae In?

610
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,120
He's the older brother
of the woman her mom killed...

611
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,420
in that accident.

612
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,100
May I see you
around this hour tomorrow?

613
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,400
I have to return something.

614
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,830
Oh, to me?

615
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,970
Yes.

616
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,900
I'll see you tomorrow.

617
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,340
Right. Okay.

618
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,960
Whose handkerchief is that?

619
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,460
Your girlfriend? Yes?

620
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,630
My gosh. No. Last time...

621
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,100
If I may answer your question,
no, I'm not dating.

622
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,840
Come on.
You need to start going on dates.

623
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,670
Don't you think
your standards are too high?

624
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,540
I'm tall,

625
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,010
so of course, my standards are high.

626
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,150
- What?
- See? Look.

627
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,480
I'm standing much higher than you.

628
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,910
Come on. You're so silly.

629
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,150
This is why
you can't find a girlfriend.

630
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,940
This is the driver
who killed your sister...

631
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,580
and her daughter.

632
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,490
But those who are alive must go on.

633
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,590
It's too harsh to make him...

634
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,660
an ex-convict after one mistake.

635
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,230
He's still young.

636
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,400
I'll compensate you
as much as you want.

637
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,120
Did I keep you waiting?

638
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:46,100
(Queen's House)

639
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,100
I've been deceived my whole life.
Did you think I'd be fooled again?

640
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,240
How dare you leave?
I'm not done talking to you!

641
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,840
I was told
not to even tread on your shadow.

642
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,140
I'm so sorry.

643
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,420
Forgiveness?

644
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,380
I'll turn myself in
and bring Mom back!

645
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,120
So, move aside!

646
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,590
You cannot go!

647
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,720
You idiot!

648
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,890
What's more important to you?
Your business or Mom?

649
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,990
I choose Mom!
