1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,870
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,750
So, a fire broke out at the place
you lived in as a child...

5
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,550
because of a mistake you made?

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,650
Yes.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,790
And? What happened after the fire?

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,260
I told you. I wailed in fright.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,700
I could've died
if my mom didn't show up.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,330
I'm much better now,

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,000
but back then,
I'd dream of it every day.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,040
I'm ashamed to admit this,
but I wet my bed often, too.

13
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,610
You must've moved after the fire.

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,010
The place was burnt to the ground
and was uninhabitable.

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,950
Thankfully, we had lots of money,

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,520
so we moved to a better place.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,190
I thought I had forgotten everything
because I was way too young.

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,290
But I recently began to get scared
whenever I saw fire.

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,930
I have to light up some candles,
and it scares me to think about it.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,700
What should I do?

21
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,370
It'd be better
if you saw a psychiatrist...

22
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,110
to receive counseling
and treatment at the same time.

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,710
If you want me to refer you
to a doctor, I'll do that.

24
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,140
All right, then.

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,350
It's been five minutes, right?

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,610
Goodbye.

27
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,790
Are we on the same page?

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,230
Yes.

29
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,000
The fire that killed my dad...

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,300
was caused by Hwang Na Ra's mistake,

31
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,400
and Noh Sook Ja covered it up,
although she knew the truth.

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,610
Don't you think it's odd...

33
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,740
that they moved to a better place
after living with us as tenants?

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,980
Our place was burnt to the ground.
Where did they get the money?

35
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,250
Hey, Wang Sik.

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,920
You caught Kim Mi Gyeong?

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,660
She was an insurance planner
only in the past.

38
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,330
She's just a fraud now.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,370
She made fake business cards
with names of insurance companies...

40
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,240
to scam lots of people
here and there.

41
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,370
How was she involved
in my brother-in-law's case?

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,510
Frauds also learn
and develop their methods.

43
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,380
She probably became a fraud
after she made some money...

44
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,720
with your brother-in-law's case.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,290
You can get the details from her.

46
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,490
I told her to cooperate...

47
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,360
if she wanted to negotiate
reducing her sentence...

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,790
for additional crimes
she committed recently.

49
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,060
Thanks, Wang Sik.

50
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,740
All right. Whatever.

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,440
The statute of limitations
has expired ages ago.

52
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,070
Why wouldn't I tell you?

53
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,880
Did my father
take out insurance with you?

54
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,220
At first,
I wanted to sell some plans,

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,520
so I had him take out
a few insurances.

56
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,220
Then, when I heard
he died in a fire,

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,160
I was about to tell his wife,
Ms. Jung Yun Hee, about his plans.

58
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,060
But that woman,
Noh Sook Ja, stopped me.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,400
She said she'd pretend to be
his wife to collect the insurance,

60
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,600
so that we could split the money
between us.

61
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,870
All I did was
tamper with a few things...

62
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,880
to let her pretend to be his wife
to take the money.

63
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,280
Noh Sook Ja was the one
who planned and staged the act.

64
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,820
I only did as she asked.

65
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,790
Why did you disappear...

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,560
after running
into my sister recently?

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,960
As you said,
the statute of limitations had expired,

68
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,600
and my sister had no idea.

69
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,060
Noh Sook Ja made me
keep my mouth shut.

70
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,530
She offered to pay me
to keep my mouth shut forever...

71
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,200
about this ancient story.

72
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,170
Who would say no?

73
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,550
Hwang Gi Chan's family was
our sworn enemy from the start.

74
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,390
They took both Dad
and Do Hee's lives.

75
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,990
I won't forgive them.

76
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,300
We must think rationally
in times like these. You know, right?

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,630
I do.

78
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,570
At this point,
we can't legally hold her responsible.

79
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,700
We need to think of another way.

80
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,010
All right.
Let's share this with Yun Hee...

81
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,070
and discuss what we should do next.

82
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,480
You should run to Jae In first.
That's more urgent right now.

83
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,410
Have you seen
someone who looks like this?

84
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,720
No.

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,590
Excuse me, sir.

86
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,520
Have you seen someone
who looks like this in this area?

87
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,660
This woman. I know her.

88
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,400
She had such a great style,
so I remember her.

89
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,400
By any chance,
did you see her yesterday?

90
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,970
I have.

91
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,710
I said hello to her while she was
walking with a younger man.

92
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,610
She said she was on her way
to see her daughter.

93
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,710
A younger man?

94
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,410
Do you remember what he looks like?

95
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,880
He must've been in his 40s.

96
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,990
He had his hair combed back,

97
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,290
and his face was rather broad
with a dull complexion.

98
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,490
He didn't seem like an ordinary man.

99
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,860
Hello.

100
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,800
Did you find out anything, Jae In?

101
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,600
Hong Man Su.

102
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,600
It had to be Hong Man Su.

103
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,040
He must've taken my mom.

104
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,380
If he did this...

105
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,540
It was Kang Se Ri.

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,080
Wait.

107
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,720
She won't tell you the truth
even if you press her.

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,160
Hey, Uncle Oh Seong.
Can you put a tail on Kang Se Ri?

109
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,790
She seems to be the one
who abducted Ms. Kang's mother.

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,660
All right. Let me know.

111
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,200
He'll put a tail on her and tell us
if she goes somewhere fishy.

112
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,410
Thank you.

113
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,640
Will she be all right?

114
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,740
She'll be fine.

115
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,980
This is the man
who claimed to have received...

116
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,520
Jae In's design
from the design contest...

117
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,020
through one of their competitors?

118
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,220
That's correct.

119
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,320
Find this man and bring him to me.

120
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,860
Yes, ma'am.

121
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,210
Hello, Oh Seong?

122
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,140
All right.

123
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,480
Kang Se Ri visited her aunt's place.

124
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,450
That place must be empty now.

125
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,790
Her aunt went abroad
and isn't in Korea.

126
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,390
They weren't even in contact...

127
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,790
until the moment you found her.

128
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,260
So, if she's at her aunt's place
when she isn't around...

129
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,000
I think we found
where she's keeping your mother.

130
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,970
Hong Man Su?

131
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,270
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

132
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,400
That punk.

133
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,880
Eat this unless you want to die.

134
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,620
Don't you want to live?

135
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,050
Don't you want to see Kang Jae In,

136
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,360
your daughter?

137
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,700
I'll free you when you tell me...

138
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,030
where Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol
hid his slush fund.

139
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,240
I'll let you be
with your daughter again.

140
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,370
What do you say?

141
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,010
I don't know anything.

142
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
So, you don't care
if Kang Jae In dies?

143
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,520
You already saw
what I did to Hwang Gi Man.

144
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,790
I don't know.
I really don't know anything!

145
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,220
I don't know anything.

146
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,690
Sure. So, stop yelling
and keep thinking about it.

147
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,270
I'm hungry.

148
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,900
Right, lady?
So, eat this and think about it.

149
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,810
Here.

150
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,510
Have you lost your mind?

151
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,250
Kang Jae In is on her way here
with Kim Do Yun!

152
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,880
The police are coming, too.
Get out of here!

153
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,150
Come!

154
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,320
Let go of me!

155
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,020
Free me!

156
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,740
This is the place.

157
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,420
Mom!

158
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,620
Are you okay, Mom?

159
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,960
Jae In, it was Kang Se Ri.

160
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,730
It was her voice.

161
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,090
I know it.

162
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,600
What do I do?
She said she'd kill you,

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,630
and she would do that.

164
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,940
I've seen her do it.
She did the pushing!

165
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,540
It's okay, Mom.

166
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,210
You don't have to be afraid.

167
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,690
Don't take this the wrong way.

168
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
I really didn't know.

169
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,660
I was also worried about Mother,

170
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,890
so I came
after I had some people find her.

171
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,700
It was Hong Man Su
who brought her here.

172
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,100
And who works with him?

173
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,270
It's either you or Se Ri.

174
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,310
It wasn't me. This time, I mean it.

175
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,180
Trust me.

176
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,410
Shut your mouth.

177
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,680
I don't care if it was you or Se Ri.

178
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,750
To me, you two are the same kind
of disgusting human garbage.

179
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,960
- Jae In.
- Yes.

180
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,230
Let's go, Mom.

181
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,640
Detective Baek.

182
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,880
Find that punk,
Hong Man Su, and bring him to me.

183
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,320
Be careful.

184
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,090
Are you sure
she doesn't have to see a doctor?

185
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,030
I suggested it,
but she didn't want to go.

186
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,860
Her condition has worsened.

187
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,230
She doesn't even remember
that she was abducted.

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,640
Do Yun also said
she'd better get some rest for now.

189
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,240
Let's go inside, Mom.

190
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,950
- She fell asleep.
- Yes.

191
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,760
It must've been a tough day.

192
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,500
Have a cup of tea.

193
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,370
What a long day.

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,170
You've done well.

195
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,580
I'm so glad you found her.

196
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,410
Did you tell the police
that it was Hong Man Su?

197
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,180
Yes. I received testimony
from people in the area,

198
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,450
and I also found CCTV footage
of him walking with her.

199
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,890
Se Ri will insist
it wasn't her doing until the end.

200
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,990
She will.

201
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,700
She covered up my mom's eyes,
so she couldn't see her,

202
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,430
but I know it was Se Ri.

203
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,440
We must get Hong Man Su.

204
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,140
We have to get him...

205
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,170
and make him confess
that Se Ri made him do it.

206
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,990
You're home early.

207
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,790
Was it you?

208
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,360
What do you mean?

209
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,890
Did you get Mr. Hong
to abduct Choi Ja Young?

210
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,690
You're asking me that again?

211
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,460
What would I get from doing that?

212
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,700
So, Hong Man Su had a random idea
to abduct her at your aunt's place?

213
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,040
If you're going to act on your own,
get out of my home now.

214
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,010
Why do you care
if that woman gets abducted?

215
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,770
Have you forgotten?

216
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,210
She's Jae In's mom,
the one who stabbed you in the back.

217
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,510
She's your ex-mother-in-law
who used to think you were a joke.

218
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,180
Why do you care
if she disappears from this world?

219
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,750
I don't want to be misunderstood
for something I didn't do!

220
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,050
I hate getting treated
like you and I are the same!

221
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,760
Do you dread the idea
of getting hated by Jae In?

222
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,860
Why are you avoiding this?

223
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you not want her to hate you?
I'm asking you!

224
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,770
You're right.
I don't want her to hate me.

225
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,440
Happy now?

226
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,320
Bo Ram fell asleep.

227
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,890
Mi Sook...
I'm too used to calling her that.

228
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,920
What happened to Jae In's mother?

229
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,490
We found her.

230
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,660
I'm so glad. I was worried
in case you couldn't do that.

231
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,470
Well, Mom.

232
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,710
You should have this.

233
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,010
I get scared when you give me
something like this.

234
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,750
You gave me this when Do Hee died
to make sure I'm not shocked to death.

235
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,090
What is it? What's going on now?

236
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,260
Yun Hee. We found the culprit...

237
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,490
who killed your husband.

238
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,140
Her son killed my daughter,

239
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,270
and not only did Noh Sook Ja
kill my husband,

240
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,780
but she took the money
in exchange for his life...

241
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,310
to live high on the hog.

242
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,950
Isn't that so?

243
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,420
In the end, that's the story.

244
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,060
I won't let them live. I won't!

245
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,790
No, Mom!

246
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,030
Move aside. Go away!

247
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,330
I'm going to kill all of them!

248
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,140
Please calm down, Mom.

249
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,670
Calm down, Yun Hee.
This makes me angry and mad, too.

250
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,610
I understand how you feel,

251
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,980
but still, hold yourself back.

252
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,540
How can I hold myself back?

253
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,550
How is holding back
going to do anything? How?

254
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,850
Mom, that family won't change...

255
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,150
just because you run over
and say something to them.

256
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,120
I want to run over,
kill Hwang Gi Chan,

257
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,290
and end everything, too.

258
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,790
You can't do that.

259
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,030
I will do it!

260
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,500
Listen up to me, Yun Hee.

261
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,500
I also can't forgive them
for what they did...

262
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,730
to Do Hee and my brother-in-law.

263
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,340
I'm not telling you
to hold yourself back for no reason.

264
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,000
Of course, we must punish them!

265
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,810
He's right.
We can't go down to their level.

266
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,910
So, calm down and take a seat.
Let me explain.

267
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,190
Explain.

268
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,460
We can have Hwang Gi Chan tried
for what he did to Do Hee,

269
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,860
but in Dad's case,
the statute of limitations has expired.

270
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,660
We can't punish her that way.

271
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,030
What kind of awful law is that?

272
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,840
Why is there a statute of limitations
for killing someone?

273
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,610
This is so unfair for the dead!

274
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,370
That's why we thought of this.

275
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,840
She lived a good life with the money
she got in exchange for his life,

276
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,720
so shouldn't we take away
her entire fortune?

277
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,520
How are you going to do that
if it can't happen by the law?

278
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:26,390
Yun Hee,
we must stay rational from now on.

279
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,330
Don't let your emotions run wild.

280
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,660
That's the only way...

281
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,400
we can take those monsters down.

282
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,340
What do you think?
Do I seem irresistibly charming?

283
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,080
It's so absurd,
I can't even laugh at that.

284
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,080
Are you sure you can do this?

285
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,720
Why don't we think of...

286
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,850
I'm going after her
because I know it's possible.

287
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,890
I can do it, so don't worry about me
and go to work.

288
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,560
I don't know
why you're so confident,

289
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,160
but I couldn't sleep last night.

290
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,730
I never imagined my husband
had passed away like that.

291
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,200
How can they be like this?

292
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,200
Even animals wouldn't do that.

293
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,400
They'll be punished.

294
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,340
What goes around will come around.

295
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,780
It should happen.

296
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,740
They deserve to be cursed by fate,
so they shall be.

297
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,680
How can she brazenly...

298
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,520
treat me like a friend
after what she did to my husband?

299
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,390
Because she's a monster.

300
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,560
Yun Hee, just as Do Yun said,
let's show them what it's like...

301
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,890
to reap what they have sown.

302
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,240
Welcome to Sook Ja's house.

303
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,270
Are you going to a party?
You're dressed up.

304
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,450
This is my usual attire at home.

305
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,610
It's my homewear.

306
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,220
This is how I am at home.

307
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,090
Goodness. You look stunning.

308
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,160
Oh, my.

309
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,890
You're about to blind me.

310
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,510
So, have you really broken up
with Director Kang Mi Ran?

311
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,340
Yes, I realized how I truly felt...

312
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,880
after dating another woman.

313
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,980
I finally found out...

314
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,120
who my true love is.

315
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,790
Who is that true love?

316
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,060
You already know.

317
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,990
It has to be you.

318
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,770
Oh, my. He doesn't even
beat around the bush.

319
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,170
He's so manly.

320
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,540
Ms. Sook Ja, I keep... No.

321
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,280
Sook Ja, I keep thinking about you,
so I can't hold myself back anymore.

322
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,680
Will you accept my love for you?

323
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,850
Of course, I will.

324
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,250
I'm so happy to hear that.

325
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,490
Oh, my.

326
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,690
- One moment, Sook Ja.
- Sure.

327
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,330
Hello, sir.

328
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,200
So, there will be a highway
right next to Mount Hwagong?

329
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,170
My gosh. If I buy some land there,

330
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,810
it'll pay for my retirement
and for my offspring for generations.

331
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,210
Yes, I'll think about it.

332
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,520
What do you have to buy...

333
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,720
to let your offspring live
in comfort for generations?

334
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,160
My biggest interest right now
has been preparing for retirement.

335
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,190
I thought of what I wanted to do
to spend my latter days,

336
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,130
and I realized I wanted to build...

337
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,800
a kingdom of my own
just for me and the one I love.

338
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,630
A kingdom of your own...

339
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,700
just for you and the one you love?

340
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,910
Yes, so I've been looking
to buy some real estate,

341
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,140
and I hear
there's something promising.

342
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,480
Then, is the one you love...

343
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,550
You already know who.
It's you, Sook Ja.

344
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,920
Oh, my gosh.

345
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,900
Can you tell me more
about our kingdom?

346
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,530
Well, you know.

347
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,500
Oh, my.

348
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,320
I really didn't know.

349
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,860
I don't want to be misunderstood
for something I didn't do,

350
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,590
especially so if it has
something to do with Se Ri.

351
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,330
So?

352
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,030
So, what do you want?

353
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,630
Why are you making an excuse to me?

354
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,140
I know it was Se Ri.

355
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,080
My mom said
she clearly heard her voice.

356
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,850
But as always,

357
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,690
you'll trust Se Ri's denial.

358
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,090
I won't.

359
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,220
I know those are just words.

360
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,800
I hear faith is believing
the things that cannot be seen,

361
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,630
and I have zero faith in you.

362
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,670
Don't say another word
unless you'll make Se Ri...

363
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,770
kneel before me.

364
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,150
Gosh, I'm not scared
of something like this.

365
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,460
It'll take way too long
for me to be strong enough...

366
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,160
to use candles for my proposal.

367
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,800
Hey.

368
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,770
I have a question, Seung Woo.

369
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,340
I don't want to hear it,
but it's not an option, is it?

370
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,940
What's your dream proposal?

371
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,210
Whose dream? Mine?
Your proposal to me?

372
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,940
Yes, women can
ask men out first, too.

373
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,580
Who asks a question like this
to their crush?

374
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,380
Do you want me
to rent a ferry or something?

375
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,860
You know it's no longer taboo
to see a psychiatrist, right?

376
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,230
I do.

377
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,430
You should see one.

378
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,300
What?

379
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,500
Hey, I'm fine!

380
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,800
I have these feelings for you
in my sane mind!

381
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,380
She was the one.

382
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,680
She leaked Ms. Kang's design
from the contest...

383
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,320
and handed it over to me,
the manager of your competitor.

384
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,480
It was her, Kang Se Ri!

385
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,690
What is this nonsense?
I don't know who you are!

386
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,660
Did you pay for a stranger
to settle down in America...

387
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,430
and make him the CEO of an agency...

388
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,230
that almost took
the Koreatown apartment project?

389
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,430
You may leave.

390
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,500
And don't dream of fleeing again.

391
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,970
I won't.

392
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,140
DH Holdings became suspicious
and managed to change the agency,

393
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,280
but how did the accomplice
of the design leak...

394
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,380
suddenly become the CEO
of an agency affiliated with us...

395
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,620
in the first place?

396
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,920
Isn't it obvious?

397
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,520
I don't know what this is about.

398
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
I don't know that man, either!

399
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,930
I hear you abducted...

400
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,000
my sister-in-law, Jae In's mother.

401
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,800
Do you admit to that?

402
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,070
I didn't do it. Why do you
keep blaming me for everything?

403
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,700
My mom said
she clearly heard your voice.

404
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,770
I know your mom has dementia.

405
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,380
Stop framing me only on the words
of a woman who isn't in her right mind.

406
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,810
The police would've arrested me
if I were the culprit.

407
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,320
This is the evidence.

408
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,290
She said she bit her abductor.

409
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,760
This happened
while I was playing with Ji Ho.

410
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,930
Stop denying everything
and apologize.

411
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,730
Honey.

412
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,940
Leaking out the contest design
and abducting her mother...

413
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,940
were both your doing.

414
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,240
Apologize on your knees.

415
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,080
No, I can't.

416
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,650
I won't. You can never make me!

417
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,590
All right. There's no meaning
in your empty apology.

418
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,690
Let's take this to court.

419
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,160
The competitor is
also getting ready to file a suit,

420
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,530
so you should be prepared.

421
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,860
Let's go.

422
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,540
How can you demand
that I apologize to her?

423
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,110
How...

424
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,880
can you, of all people,
tell me to kneel before her?

425
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,250
Why do you think I did that
with that man, Jung Hyeon Su?

426
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,320
I tried to kick Jae In out
of this business for you.

427
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,950
Is it my fault for making him
the agency's CEO...

428
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,860
because I knew
he couldn't betray us?

429
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,560
If you wanted
to do something for me,

430
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,130
you should've knelt
before Jae In for my sake.

431
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,700
Honey.

432
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,330
Please keep your mouth shut
for my sake.

433
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,580
Hello.

434
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,150
Did I sound like a joke to you?

435
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,050
I told you not to come here.
Why won't you listen?

436
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,720
I wanted to apologize.

437
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,060
First, what happened to Ms. Kim
must've been heartbreaking.

438
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,600
I should've thought it through.

439
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,070
An apology was due first,

440
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,140
but I thought monetary compensation
would be enough to handle this.

441
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,110
I've been reflecting on my behavior.

442
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,750
I also apologize for coming here...

443
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,520
and telling you that
Jae In is a murderer's daughter.

444
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,320
It must've been shocking,

445
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,890
and it was very inconsiderate of me.

446
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,490
Goodness gracious.
So, you realized that?

447
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,060
And? Did you apologize to Jae In?

448
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,800
She's such a kind-hearted girl,
so she generously understood.

449
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,510
I'm sorry.
I'm not that kind-hearted,

450
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,070
so I don't need your apology.

451
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,510
I'm not sure if you know,

452
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,380
but Ms. Choi didn't do that
to Do Hee, so go.

453
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,580
Are we done here? Just go.

454
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,780
Yun Hee.

455
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,590
"Yun Hee?"

456
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,290
I remembered
how I used to call you that.

457
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,660
But you must've forgotten
what you did to Oh Seong.

458
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,500
If you did, how could you
call me by my name right now?

459
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,340
What did you do to him?

460
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,740
Fine, I get that
relationships can end,

461
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,540
and that
it can be one-sided at times.

462
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,780
I wouldn't be this riled up
if that was how it ended.

463
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,180
You made him lose his job
at an accountant's office...

464
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,880
and stopped him
from getting a job elsewhere.

465
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
Then, you married another guy
as soon as you two broke up.

466
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,860
You made him shudder
with a sense of betrayal...

467
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,260
and work out at sea for decades.
What now? "Yun Hee?"

468
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,300
Think of what you did to him!

469
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,070
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,370
I don't want your apology!

471
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,440
It won't bring back
Oh Seong's youth!

472
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,740
Yun Hee, you need to stop.

473
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,680
There's no need
to talk about the past.

474
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,250
Why did you come here?

475
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,420
You should've at least told me.
Go, now.

476
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,750
I'm so sorry.

477
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,020
I'll come by next time to say hello.

478
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,130
I told you not to come!

479
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,790
Hey, Yun Hee.

480
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,130
Haven't you any self-respect?

481
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,270
Why are you covering
for that evil girl?

482
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,400
She's not why you're mad right now.

483
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,340
She just came at the worst time.

484
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,580
I don't care.
I still don't want to see her.

485
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,980
Think of what she did to Jae In.

486
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,320
Can't you see
how cold-hearted she is?

487
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,850
You can't associate with her again.

488
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,660
Let's calm down, Yun Hee.

489
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,030
Relax. Yes. Relax.

490
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,440
Did you hear everything?

491
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,870
Don't be so offended.

492
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,580
She's more sensitive today
because of another family affair.

493
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,910
What she said wasn't wrong.

494
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,420
You must be hungry. Let's eat.

495
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,180
Come on.

496
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,970
She can just press the passcode.
Why is she ringing the bell?

497
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,670
Don't open the door for her.

498
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,800
I changed the passcode.

499
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,510
Don't let her in here anymore.

500
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,850
What did she do this time
to make him want to leave her?

501
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,620
Good grief. She's my worst enemy.

502
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,090
My ears hurt.
This sound is too loud!

503
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Stop ringing the bell!
It's way too noisy.

504
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,360
The chairman banned you from here,
so go away!

505
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,970
Don't open the door for her, Gi Man.

506
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,370
If Ji Ho tries to do that,
you have to stop him.

507
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,000
Okay.

508
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,570
I'll also tell Ji Ho
not to open the door.

509
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,280
Ji Ho.

510
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,680
YDB International?

511
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,720
Isn't it the new investment company
that's been investing aggressively,

512
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,690
in order to grow their business?

513
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,160
Yes, sir.

514
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,990
One of my acquaintances
works there as a secretary,

515
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,000
so I asked just in case,

516
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,470
and they wanted to go ahead
and invest in us.

517
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,070
YDB International
should be big enough...

518
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,010
to minimize damage
when I kick out DH Holdings.

519
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,210
Schedule a meeting to sign the contract
as soon as possible.

520
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,050
I'll do that, sir.

521
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,850
I also have the report you wanted...

522
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,920
regarding the businesses
DH Holdings has invested in.

523
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,800
- Is this true?
- Yes, sir.

524
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,170
I found evidence that
they had been leaking...

525
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,870
confidential information
and new technology from their investees.

526
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,750
(Director Kim Do Yun)

527
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,670
I request full cancellation
of our contract with DH Holdings.

528
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,520
(Queen's House)

529
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,550
YL Group will sign a contract
with a new investor very soon.

530
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,690
I won't be the one
who'll leave this business,

531
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,190
but DH Holdings.

532
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,860
That wicked apple won't fall
too far from the tree.

533
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,900
Like mother, like son.

534
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,430
That's right.

535
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,070
Ms. Kang Se Ri is an adulteress...

536
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,870
who stole my niece's life.

537
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,580
You got fired,
so don't show yourself at work.

538
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,140
At this moment,
I'm better off without you.

539
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,580
You're my biggest weakness!

540
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,320
Do you have any idea
what your son, Gi Chan, did?

541
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Do you know who he really is?

542
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

543
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,660
