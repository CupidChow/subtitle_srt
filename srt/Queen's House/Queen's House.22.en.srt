1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,240
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,180
My gosh.
What's taking everyone so long?

5
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,050
Come on out. We might run late.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,620
Did you get Eun Ho dressed?

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,750
Bring him with you.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,960
Yu Gyeong.

9
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,960
Please don't let Eun Ho
attend the wedding.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,130
He'll be shocked.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,000
Please do that for me.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,500
Well, Mother.

13
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,340
Why don't we let Eun Ho stay home?

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,070
He has to be there
at his father's wedding.

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,340
Why wouldn't he go?

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,840
That makes no sense.

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,640
If he ends up crying
or throwing a fit...

18
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,310
after seeing the wedding,

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,210
it wouldn't look good
on a great day like this.

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,720
Mom, how do I look?

21
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,820
Don't I look pretty?

22
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,160
You can stay home
and babysit Eun Ho.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,730
No, I want to go.

24
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,360
Do you know
how expensive this outfit is?

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,590
I'm going to show it off.

26
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,100
I'll cut off your allowance.

27
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,500
Why are you only harsh on me?

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,980
Hwang Gi Chan.

29
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,020
Kang Se Ri.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,020
May you two rest in peace.

31
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,960
Kang Jae In.

32
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,330
You're simply the worst.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,970
I guess you didn't like my present.

34
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,870
Hwang Gi Chan, you're a man
I once loved and was married to.

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,970
Kang Se Ri, you're a woman I deemed
as my best friend for a long time.

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,050
I put a lot of thought into this
for people like you two.

37
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,720
Because to me, you're both dead.

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,750
You and I are already over.

39
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,350
Doing this now
won't change anything.

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,360
Does it look like
I'm still not over you?

41
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,290
That's some ego you got.

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,100
Yes, so just leave.

43
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,400
This isn't a place for you.

44
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,770
Why would I leave?

45
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,270
I'm the one
who's dying to end it with you.

46
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,770
But even if I end it,
I can't end it like this.

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,740
I'm doing it my way.

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,180
What's your plan?

49
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,210
I'll file a suit
to invalidate the divorce.

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,020
And I'll take back
all my assets you took from me.

51
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,990
Kang Se Ri,

52
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,590
the adulteress and cheater.

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,660
You can have him
even after the divorce is invalidated.

54
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,990
I won't stop you.

55
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,300
You can live the rest of your life
as his woman on the side.

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,970
What? You signed
the divorce papers yourself.

57
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,030
How dare you speak
such nonsense now?

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,500
How can you be so shameless...

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,940
after cheating on your husband?

60
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,970
- This is so unfair!
- Mom.

61
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,240
- Goodness!
- You shouldn't collapse over this.

62
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,780
This is just the beginning.

63
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,680
Gosh...

64
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,420
Mother.

65
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,020
Please stay healthy
for a very long time.

66
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,140
- Goodness.
- Mom.

67
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,970
Honey, call 911.

68
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,440
- Call 911 now.
- I'm fine.

69
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,210
Jae In, you did your best.

70
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,460
You messed with me the wrong way.

71
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,960
Did you think I'd sit around
after this kind of humiliation?

72
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,760
Go ahead and give me your best.

73
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,560
As you wish.

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,670
Kang Jae In.

75
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,240
My son, Ji Ho, is Gi Chan's son.

76
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't you get it?

77
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,080
His woman on the side?
Did you call me a woman on the side?

78
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,550
Don't be ridiculous.

79
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,220
Gi Chan and I...

80
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,390
registered our marriage in America
a long time ago.

81
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,350
We're already married on paper.

82
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,590
You're unbelievably vulgar.

83
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,090
What about you?

84
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,460
Stop acting so holier-than-thou.

85
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,730
We're in Korea.

86
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,900
And in Korea,
you're his woman on the side.

87
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,640
Don't be ridiculous.

88
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,010
Even in Korea,

89
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,210
I'm now Hwang Gi Chan's wife.
It's me!

90
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,480
You look so hilarious right now.

91
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,980
How intriguing.

92
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,890
You can charge the wedding
for that drink.

93
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,930
Kang Jae In!

94
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
I won't let you get away with this.

95
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,780
Eun Ho!

96
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,990
Mommy!

97
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,760
Eun Ho...

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,260
I missed you, Mommy.

99
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,330
Me, too.

100
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,500
I also missed you so much, Eun Ho.

101
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,540
Let's never be separated anymore.

102
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,710
Okay.

103
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,280
Please stay here for a moment.

104
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
I'll pack up your things
and come out.

105
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,010
Eun Ho is fine. Why would Jae In...

106
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,520
Gi Chan, she's here.

107
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,890
Stop her? Me?

108
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,860
Let's go, Eun Ho.

109
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,560
No, you have to leave him.
You can't take him with you.

110
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,760
Move aside. Move!

111
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,360
Gi Chan is going to kill me.

112
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,270
He told me not to let you take him.

113
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,270
Come here, Eun Ho.

114
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,900
No! I want to go with Mommy!

115
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,040
Hey.

116
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,470
Let go of him! Let go!

117
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,970
- No, stop it!
- No!

118
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,940
- We just received a report.
- Yes, it's her.

119
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,280
Stop her from taking him.

120
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,980
You're under arrest without warrant
for kidnapping a child.

121
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,850
Let go of me. Let go!

122
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,480
- He's my son!
- Come with us.

123
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,080
- Eun Ho!
- Mommy!

124
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,390
- Mommy!
- Eun Ho!

125
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,290
Mommy!

126
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,290
Mommy!

127
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,460
Seung Woo.

128
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,130
How can you drag me there,
knowing it was Gi Chan's wedding?

129
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,500
I already explained it to you.

130
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,840
Sometimes, business is just business
for people in our position.

131
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,310
I was invited as a board member,
so how could I not go?

132
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,840
I thought I'd at least see Eun Ho.

133
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,580
I don't care what the reason is.
I don't get it.

134
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,110
You can't do this
if you thought of Jae In.

135
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,810
Se Ri said...

136
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,250
this was a wedding
without blessings.

137
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,390
She doesn't have any family,

138
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,050
so she asked if I could attend
as one of her guests.

139
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,420
She reminded me of myself and you...

140
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,690
in the past.

141
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,200
I felt bad when she said
her wedding wasn't blessed.

142
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,760
You should get some rest.

143
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,750
Are you going to remove everything?

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,120
These make Bo Ram miss her too much.

145
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,720
It's been quite a while
since the mourning period ended, too.

146
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,960
I thought it'd be better
if I cleaned these up.

147
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,230
Your uncle is settling down,
so he'll need a room, too.

148
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,100
Your room is too small
to share with him.

149
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,780
I requested a restraining order
against you with the court,

150
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,310
so do not lurk around Eun Ho.

151
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,880
Says who?

152
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,420
I'm his mother.

153
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,880
He's my son.

154
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,650
You gave him up when you handed over
his parental rights and custody.

155
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,920
When did I do that?

156
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,360
I didn't do it!

157
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,760
She's mentally unwell.

158
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,260
Let the court know
and have her hospitalized right away.

159
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,860
Where are you going, Gi Chan?

160
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,630
Let go of me!

161
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,600
Let me out of here!

162
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,670
I'm not crazy, Gi Chan!

163
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,770
Eun Ho is my son!

164
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,080
I won't let you have him!

165
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,980
He's my son.

166
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,350
Eun Ho...

167
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,220
What will Mommy do?

168
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,690
Eun Ho.

169
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,500
Eun Ho...

170
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,800
May I help you?

171
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,770
I brought
Ms. Kang's medical diagnosis.

172
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,580
(Myoungin University Medical Center)

173
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,950
(The new police of hope,
serving the people with our best.)

174
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,850
Are you all right?

175
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,590
Yes.

176
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,250
It seemed like
you were trying to get your son.

177
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,960
What happened now?

178
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,760
Today was...

179
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,590
Gi Chan's wedding.

180
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,600
Did he marry...

181
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,530
Ms. Kang Se Ri?

182
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,170
Do you know her?

183
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,570
I've run into her
back at the hospital and at work.

184
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,070
I thought you two were friends.

185
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,240
Yu Gyeong, she, and I...

186
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,410
went to high school together.

187
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,510
When did you divorce him?

188
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,690
I was divorced without realizing it.

189
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,090
He must've made me
look like a mental patient...

190
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,360
to do things like these.

191
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,200
Don't I look like a fool?

192
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,970
I want you to be more miserable.

193
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,400
I won't back down like this.

194
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,870
I'll request
an invalidation of divorce.

195
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,980
I'll do whatever it takes...

196
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,240
to raise Eun Ho myself.

197
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,850
I want you to fall into...

198
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,980
even deeper despair.

199
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I didn't get you
out of the hospital...

200
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,290
to save you.

201
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,420
I want to see you
feel much more pain...

202
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,160
and hopelessness.

203
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,660
I forgot to thank you.

204
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,160
I would've been dragged
back to the hospital...

205
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,270
if you didn't bring
that medical diagnosis.

206
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,070
Thank you so much.

207
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,580
You'll have to fight this fight alone
from now on, Ms. Kang.

208
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,180
I don't think I should
meddle with a problem...

209
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,610
between a married couple
as a stranger.

210
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,820
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,590
I keep becoming a nuisance to you.

212
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,020
You won't have to go back
to the mental hospital now.

213
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,720
So, please...

214
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,290
stop contacting me from now on.

215
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,890
I won't.

216
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,700
I shouldn't do that.

217
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,770
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

218
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,230
It's okay.

219
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,040
I can go alone.

220
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,700
I'm fine now.

221
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,910
All right.

222
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,110
I'll go, then.

223
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,750
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,780
Thank you for everything.

225
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,970
Grandma.

226
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,640
I want to go to Mommy.

227
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,640
Please take me to her.

228
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,280
Goodness, I can't let you do that.

229
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,580
My prince,
you have to listen to me...

230
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,280
to be a good boy.

231
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,190
I want to go to my mommy!

232
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,920
Mommy!

233
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,390
- Mommy!
- Goodness.

234
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,990
Hwang Eun Ho!

235
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,460
Daddy, please help Mommy.

236
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,100
Mommy came home,

237
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,440
but police officers
suddenly took her.

238
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,770
Stop crying, Eun Ho.

239
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,610
Do you want to go out
and eat something delicious?

240
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,180
You need to go home, lady!

241
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,510
Why do you live here?

242
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,650
Why do you sleep in my mommy's spot?

243
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,150
Go away, Ms. Kang.

244
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,290
I don't like you!

245
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,520
Hwang Eun Ho, I told you, didn't I?

246
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,560
She's your mother now.

247
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,390
Don't call her a lady
or Ms. Kang anymore.

248
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,530
She married me today,

249
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,230
so she became your mother.

250
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,070
Make sure you call her mommy.
Do you understand?

251
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,300
No!

252
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,510
She's not my mommy!

253
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,640
- Mommy!
- Goodness.

254
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
Mommy!

255
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,450
Goodness, you need to calm him down
instead of making him cry more.

256
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,420
My prince, stop crying. Okay?

257
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,390
Why are you standing around?
You need to console him.

258
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,360
There, there.

259
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,490
Eun Ho, you can call me Ms. Kang.

260
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,390
You can call me mommy
when you're ready.

261
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,830
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,440
- Mommy...
- Goodness, Eun Ho.

263
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,710
- Mommy...
- Hey, there.

264
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,080
- Don't cry.
- Mommy!

265
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,810
Goodness.

266
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,950
Jae In.

267
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,690
I'm already furious
about how you ruined my wedding,

268
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,760
but your son is here
treating me like dirt, too.

269
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:44,300
Jae In, I'll make sure
you cry bitterly.

270
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,830
Just wait.

271
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,700
You're late.

272
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,400
Where have you been?

273
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,510
The police station.

274
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,410
The police station?

275
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,410
Why?

276
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,880
I went to get Eun Ho...

277
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,380
and got arrested as a kidnapper.

278
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,450
Gi Chan had reported me.

279
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,590
He must've been furious
about what you did at the wedding.

280
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,590
You crossed the line today.

281
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,960
You found out through your mother...

282
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,760
that acting emotional will
only make things go out of hand.

283
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,630
I know you aren't in a state
to make a sound decision, but...

284
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,300
That's right.
I was out of my mind today.

285
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,340
I was locked up
in a mental institution,

286
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,710
got divorced in that while,
and lost Eun Ho, too.

287
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,250
And my closest friend was the woman
remarrying my husband.

288
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,810
How can I be in my right mind?

289
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,210
Jae In, what I mean is...

290
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,520
I got tested at a hospital,

291
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,350
and the result showed I was fine.

292
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,020
Stop telling me to get hospitalized.

293
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,190
I don't want to be
disappointed in you anymore.

294
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,290
You must've been disappointed
that I was at their wedding.

295
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,560
It was a board member's wedding,
so you probably had to go,

296
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,630
although it was for my ex-husband
who left me.

297
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,470
I attended,

298
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,470
but it was uncomfortable.

299
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,270
I hope you'll understand.

300
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,540
You should get some rest.

301
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,740
Jae In.

302
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,350
Don't take action like that
from now on.

303
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,850
Let Attorney Seo handle everything.

304
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,150
The same applies
to the divorce annulment suit.

305
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,590
It doesn't look great
for you to be on the facade.

306
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,390
He crossed the line first,

307
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,990
so I will put up a fight.

308
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,760
I'm not going to hide.

309
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,500
It's best never to do anything
that'll create gossip.

310
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,530
Do as I say.

311
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,270
This is my fight,

312
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,000
and I'm fighting this my way.

313
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,240
I'm going upstairs.

314
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,080
They hid her completely.

315
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,280
I can't find a single picture
no matter how hard I look.

316
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,210
Should I ask a private detective?

317
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,610
What are you looking for?

318
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,420
Choi Ja Young's daughter.

319
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,250
The wife of Director Hwang Gi Chan
at YL Group.

320
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,720
I wanted to see what she was like,
but I couldn't find it.

321
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,690
The company must be keeping her identity
completely confidential.

322
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,930
Why do you want to know
what she looks like?

323
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,560
I was just curious.

324
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,100
Don't you want to know?

325
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,070
Hey, if you want to take revenge,

326
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,600
you need to know
what her family looks like.

327
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,640
Do you want me to find out?

328
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,910
- I've seen her.
- What?

329
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,810
You have? What does she look like?

330
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
The daughter is
always like the mother,

331
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,740
so she must have
the worst personality.

332
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,280
She's very rude, isn't she?

333
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,750
I can already tell.

334
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,120
I'm not so sure yet.

335
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,550
I'm keeping an eye on her.

336
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,020
What will you do
after keeping an eye on her?

337
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,960
Even personal revenge can be illegal
if you cross the line, okay?

338
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,890
Yun Hee will collapse
if you end up in prison.

339
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,900
I'm saying you can make me do things
that'll cross the line,

340
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,430
and you can be,
you know, the brains.

341
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,130
Just be the planner. Okay?

342
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,600
Try to get her pictures, too.

343
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,940
Okay.

344
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,510
Why can't I find anything?

345
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,450
I've tracked his assets,

346
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:53,380
and he already siphoned off
most of them.

347
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,890
He abused
the adult guardianship system.

348
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,160
I need to file a lawsuit
and get everything back.

349
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,330
Apply for the restitution of assets.

350
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,730
This is my medical diagnosis.

351
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,200
You can turn it in as evidence.

352
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,730
You already signed the adult guardianship
application yourself,

353
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,400
so it won't be easy.

354
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,310
The lawsuit will take
a long time, too.

355
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,340
The same thing applies
to the divorce nullity suit.

356
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,610
But I still have to do it.
Please move quickly.

357
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,750
Yes.

358
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,150
What about the request
to lift the restraining order?

359
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,850
Unless the victim,

360
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,950
Eun Ho's father,
accepts the request,

361
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,720
I don't think it'll happen.

362
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,420
Everything won't be easy
and can't happen?

363
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,990
Why is the law like this?

364
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,290
It should be more concerned
about the weak.

365
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,660
They can't just be the judge
just by looking at the result.

366
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,530
I'll do my best.

367
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,700
And Ms. Choi is quite concerned.

368
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,900
She recently found out
through Mr. Seung Woo...

369
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,040
that you were hospitalized
at a psychiatric institution...

370
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,340
and became alarmed.

371
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,940
Seung Woo went to see her?

372
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,140
Apparently so.

373
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,950
You should visit her
sometime soon, too.

374
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,750
What do you mean?

375
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,820
She was released?

376
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,160
I told you that
she wasn't in her right mind.

377
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,860
You should've
gotten her hospitalized.

378
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,730
Her medical diagnosis?

379
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,900
Who brought that?

380
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,540
All right.

381
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,310
Summon Dr. Kim Do Yun
of the clinic right now.

382
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,550
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

383
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,250
Kim Do Yun, what's his problem?

384
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,590
He got her out of the hospital
and the police station.

385
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,700
He's seeing a patient right now,

386
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,330
so he'll come by when he's free.

387
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,510
Take the prescribed medicine,

388
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,480
- and come back next week.
- Okay.

389
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,350
You may leave.

390
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,990
I said I'd come by when I was free,
but you came here yourself.

391
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,460
Leave my company now.

392
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,830
You're fired.

393
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,630
You seem rather upset.

394
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,730
Please calm down
and tell me why I'm getting fired.

395
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,330
I'll accept it if it's reasonable,
but if it isn't,

396
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,300
then I'm not sure.
So, tell me the reason first.

397
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,110
What's going on
between you and Jae In?

398
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,910
Nothing at all.

399
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,610
I know
you got her out of the hospital.

400
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,940
And you were
at the police station yesterday, too.

401
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,050
Do you still say
there's nothing going on?

402
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,450
Is that the reason for my dismissal?

403
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,350
It's considered abuse of authority
to take a personal matter...

404
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,580
and get revenge
in an official setting.

405
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,190
Also, this company isn't yours.

406
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,690
Doesn't it belong
to the shareholders?

407
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,290
Stop playing with words...

408
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,890
and leave the company
while I'm still nice.

409
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,990
All right.

410
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,930
Then, I'll turn this private matter
into an official one, too.

411
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,630
I'm well-versed
in the Medical Service Act...

412
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,630
as a licensed practitioner.

413
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,500
Did you know the current law
prohibits anyone...

414
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
from hospitalization at a mental
institution without their consent?

415
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,670
In a nutshell,

416
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,410
even her own family cannot force her
to get hospitalized.

417
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,710
You can fire me if you want to.

418
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,650
I'll also inform the world about
the Medical Service Act violation.

419
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,620
I must disclose the reason...

420
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,960
behind my dismissal,
don't you think so?

421
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,990
Actually, I didn't get a chance
to bring up...

422
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,160
the violation of the Medical
Service Act to Ms. Kang,

423
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,000
but she'd find out soon enough.

424
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,930
What are you after?

425
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,770
What are your feelings for her?

426
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,370
If you sent your perfectly fine wife
to a mental institution,

427
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,570
your feelings must've been gone
for a long time.

428
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,880
You don't need to know
what my feelings are.

429
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,580
Right. Congratulations
on your wedding.

430
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,250
Ms. Kang told me.

431
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,250
The choice is yours.

432
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,090
Will you fire me?

433
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,690
What did I tell you?

434
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,630
I told you not to trust him.

435
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,230
I came because I heard
you were worried.

436
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,030
Did you just want to confirm
that you were right?

437
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,270
Pull yourself together
if you found out everything.

438
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,310
The chairman will be appointed
at the next shareholders' meeting.

439
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,680
Will you let Hwang Gi Chan
take the business from you?

440
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,180
Jae In, do not trust anyone.

441
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,150
Especially not Seung Woo.
Do you know what he came and said?

442
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
He said you had been hospitalized
at a mental institution...

443
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,920
and claimed that
the company belonged to him.

444
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,960
He told me to sit in here
and watch him.

445
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,730
This is why you never show kindness
to another human.

446
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,230
Mom, you need to stop.

447
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,370
Jae In.

448
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,540
YL Group is yours, period.

449
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,200
You have to have it.
Do you understand?

450
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,920
Did Jae In tell you
where she was going?

451
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,160
No.

452
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,820
Did she say anything to you?

453
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,390
No.

454
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,260
I'm back.

455
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,530
Hey, have you had dinner?

456
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,500
I don't have an appetite.

457
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,600
I have something to tell you.

458
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,000
Sure, go ahead.

459
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
I heard the new chairman
will be appointed...

460
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,470
at the upcoming
shareholders' meeting,

461
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,170
so I met with a few directors
who were close to my father...

462
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,080
and told them what I wanted.

463
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,780
I want to participate
as a candidate.

464
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,020
This business was
built up by the Kangs.

465
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,320
I can't let that man have it.

466
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,660
We must seize the management rights.

467
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,060
And I need your support
more than anyone, Aunt Mi Ran.

468
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,660
And yours, Seung Woo.

469
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
I'll do whatever you want to.

470
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,470
Let's say you have our support.

471
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,540
But you had already given up...

472
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,500
the shares you had
to Director Hwang.

473
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,910
I have the shares that Dad left me.

474
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,310
The attorney told me my priority is
paying off the inheritance tax.

475
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,280
I'm going to liquidate
whatever I can,

476
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,420
including this house.

477
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,290
- You want to sell this house?
- Yes.

478
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,850
I've already put it up
for urgent sale.

479
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,660
I need to secure
as many shares as I can.

480
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,820
It's a dangerous game,

481
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,490
and you aren't guaranteed to win.

482
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,830
I'm going to persuade the directors
and the shareholders with my best.

483
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,700
If you and Seung Woo
show me your support,

484
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,370
I know we can win.

485
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,400
Aunt Mi Ran, please help me.

486
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,340
Seung Woo, please.

487
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,410
Please show me your support...

488
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,780
for our late dad's sake.

489
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,480
We're siblings.
You don't even have to ask.

490
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,710
Of course, I'll help.

491
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,750
Jae In, I'm always on your side.

492
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,280
Aunt Mi Ran,
don't you feel the same way?

493
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,420
Of course.

494
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,320
Let me take time to think about it.

495
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,670
Hey, how's Jae In doing these days?

496
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,310
Jae In? Haven't you heard?

497
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,810
Is something going on?

498
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,180
It hadn't been long since
she got out of a mental hospital,

499
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,850
so she seemed to be out of her mind.

500
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,550
She made a huge scene
at Gi Chan's wedding, and...

501
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,120
What? A mental hospital?

502
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,590
And Mr. Hwang's wedding?

503
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,960
Can you elaborate?

504
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,630
You're good at English, singing,

505
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,230
and even dancing.

506
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,260
Oh, my.
You're a wonderful artist, too.

507
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,370
You drew such a masterpiece...

508
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:27,270
that the world-renowned artist,
Mona Lisa, would leave crying.

509
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,810
Grandma, Mona Lisa is
a tissue brand, not an artist.

510
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,080
"Mona Lisa" is a painting
that Leonardo da Vinci made.

511
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,120
Yes, that was what I meant.

512
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,190
You're such a smart boy.

513
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,590
You know just about everything.

514
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,060
Did you draw that with your feet?

515
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,100
We can't call that a drawing.
That's more like doodling.

516
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,570
You can't compare
to anything my prince does.

517
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,900
Ji Ho and Eun Ho,
let's have some snacks.

518
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,570
Have you forgotten already?

519
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,540
I told you many times
to start with Eun Ho's name.

520
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,950
My prince, Hwang Eun Ho,

521
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,150
will always be the eldest son.
Do not forget that.

522
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,450
Yes.

523
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,550
Eun Ho and Ji Ho,
let's eat snacks with Mommy.

524
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,590
Okay, Mommy.

525
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,290
Eun Ho, let's have some snacks.

526
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,060
You aren't my mommy.

527
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,740
Mother, Eun Ho is giving me
such a hard time.

528
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,380
I'm doing my best
to get along with him,

529
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,810
but he won't let me do that.

530
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,280
Hey, you must be slow.

531
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,780
You stole his mother's position.

532
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,750
Why would he be happy
to call you his mother?

533
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,760
Think of it as your karma
for stealing someone else's man...

534
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,360
and do your best to coax him.

535
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,090
I have to go to my business,
so wake me up in an hour.

536
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,870
Mommy, did you steal his mommy...

537
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,530
and someone else's man?

538
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,730
Who's the man?

539
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,800
Ji Ho.

540
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,740
I told you to do a better job
with your drawings.

541
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,640
Stop fooling around
and make it look nice.

542
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,470
Come. Let's have some snacks.

543
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,140
I don't like you, Mommy.
I don't want it, either.

544
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,390
You should've said you were here.

545
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,960
Can you give me a cup of water?

546
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,870
You got home early.

547
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,440
I didn't have any patients
in the afternoon.

548
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,210
You need to cook dinner,

549
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,310
but don't use ready-made products.

550
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,720
Right. About Dr. Kim Do Yun.

551
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,590
Is he dating Jae In?

552
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,360
Don't say anything like that,
not even as a joke.

553
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
It'll cause
an unnecessary misunderstanding.

554
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,230
That's odd.

555
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,460
I heard Mr. Kim was the one
who helped Jae In escape...

556
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,630
from the hospital.

557
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,770
I just talked to Gi Chan,

558
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,940
and he said Mr. Kim showed up
at the police station...

559
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,340
and got Jae In out from there, too.

560
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,440
Doesn't it sound like
those two are dating?

561
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,550
(YL Group Clinic, Doctor Kim Do Yun)

562
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,650
Come in.

563
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,280
What brings you here without a call?

564
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,290
Did you bring Jae In
out of the hospital?

565
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,390
Word got around that quickly?

566
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
You're right.

567
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,960
Why?

568
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,360
Why?

569
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,930
Well, I mean,

570
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,000
why did you pull out
an unwell girl from the hospital?

571
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,540
And she has nothing to do with you.

572
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,140
Why are you so interested in her?

573
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,440
She has something to do with me.

574
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,510
My younger sister died...

575
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,180
at her mother's hands.

576
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,520
So?

577
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,180
What are you going to do
now that she's out of the hospital?

578
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,390
Will you get your revenge?

579
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,960
I brought her out as a doctor...

580
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,190
because it didn't seem like
she needed confinement.

581
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,360
It didn't mean anything.

582
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,000
What about the police station?

583
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,360
Ms. Kang asked me for help.

584
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,030
Doesn't it feel uncomfortable
to see her...

585
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,030
when you think of your sister?

586
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,140
It does.

587
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,110
But Ms. Kang got tested
for her psychological state,

588
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,240
and she was fine.

589
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,080
She said the symptoms began...

590
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,710
after her mother-in-law gave her
a health supplement.

591
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,880
By any chance, have you seen it?

592
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,550
No, I haven't.

593
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,190
How would I know
what my mother-in-law gave her?

594
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,750
You two lived together,
so you could've seen it.

595
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,460
Do I have to know everything
if we live together?

596
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,430
For a long time, my mother-in-law
only cared about Jae In.

597
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,760
She treated her like her superior...

598
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,600
and discriminated against me...

599
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,600
because of her affluent family,
so I was just invisible.

600
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,240
It must've hurt a lot.

601
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,270
Please pretend like
you never heard that.

602
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,640
I must've snapped...

603
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,480
because of my suppressed feelings...

604
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,510
when it felt like
you took me the wrong way.

605
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,620
Why would I take you the wrong way?

606
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,220
I'm getting off work soon.
Do you want to wait?

607
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,490
Let's grab dinner.

608
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,760
I have to go home. Maybe next time.

609
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,690
Bye.

610
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,530
Please don't tell Ms. Kang...

611
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,970
about my sister.

612
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,600
Can you do that for me?

613
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,970
I don't want you
to get involved with her.

614
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,170
That'll be best for both of you.

615
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,040
All right. Thanks for your concern.

616
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,180
Bye.

617
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,560
Something doesn't seem clear,
as if I'm standing in a fog.

618
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,290
Something keeps bothering me.

619
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,130
Kang Jae In,
I need to know more about you.

620
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,740
Who got drunk in broad daylight...

621
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,140
and made this mess
in front of my business?

622
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,570
I'll check the CCTV footage
and catch whoever this was.

623
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,780
I'll find that punk's face...

624
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,550
- and smear this...
- My gosh.

625
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,480
- Are you all right?
- Goodness.

626
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,250
I thought everyone was cold
in this day and age...

627
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,160
and couldn't care less about anyone.

628
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,760
You're very kind.

629
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,600
I must protect the elderly,
children, and women at all times.

630
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,100
Oh, my. Women?

631
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,130
Protect?

632
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,870
The elderly can suffer badly
if they fall down.

633
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,340
What a relief.

634
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,840
Please excuse me.

635
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,380
I'm still a woman, too.

636
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,890
This is for you, Ms. Kang,
the seller.

637
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,190
This is for the legal representative
of the buyer, Mr. Hwang Ji Ho.

638
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,030
Now, we're all done.

639
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,300
I didn't know he'd sign the contract
as soon as he saw the place.

640
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,530
Have you received the down payment?

641
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,140
Yes.

642
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,940
- Then, please excuse us.
- Yes.

643
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,110
All right.

644
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,810
Let's go.

645
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,180
I won't see you off. Goodbye.

646
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,750
Who were they?

647
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,890
I sold the house.

648
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,090
So, do we have to move?
Where are we going?

649
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,960
I had to sell it urgently,
so I haven't found a place yet.

650
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,030
We have to move
by next week, though.

651
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,630
We might have to stay at a hotel...

652
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,540
until the shareholders' meeting
is over.

653
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,170
I considered buying this place,
but I was a bit too late.

654
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,740
You did?

655
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,780
After all, it was Gyu Cheol's place.

656
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,650
There were lots of memories here
for you and Seung Woo,

657
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,750
so I didn't think we should sell it.

658
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,750
Dad would understand.

659
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,390
Yes, I just arrived.

660
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,020
Bye.

661
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,230
How dare you come here? Get out.

662
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,630
Do I need your permission...

663
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,030
to walk into my place?

664
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,460
How is this your...

665
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,970
Yes, your guess is right.

666
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,070
Listen up, Jae In.

667
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,970
I bought this place. It's mine now.

668
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:38,650
(Queen's House)

669
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,290
I was too naive.

670
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,230
Did you forget
where your mom ended up...

671
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,760
after living her life
neck-deep in elitism?

672
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,330
Actually, just before
the chairman passed away,

673
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,600
he asked me to do something quietly.

674
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,770
My dad did that?

675
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,440
From now on,
this place is a castle...

676
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,940
for you and me.

677
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,270
Your kingdom starts here,

678
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,780
and it'll spread
all the way to YL Group.

679
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,210
I must fight this fight.

680
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,980
Right now, Jae In is
nothing but an image.

681
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,650
The candidates
for the next chairperson are...

682
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,680
Director Hwang Gi Chan
and Ms. Kang Jae In.
