1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,870
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,380
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,980
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,550
When did you find out?

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,960
He used to work
at Yu Gyeong's hospital, right?

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,690
She told me back then.

7
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,890
Then, why didn't you say anything?

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,960
That was long before
he joined the company.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,630
I didn't expect him
to work for this company.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,070
I found out much later.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,100
You should've told me
at that time, then!

12
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,610
Why did you do this?

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,270
What's your intention?

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,980
Please just calm down.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,910
I get too scared to talk...

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,810
when you get furious like this.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,950
I was going to tell you,

18
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,080
but I missed my chance.

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,260
A lot has happened
after Ms. Kim Do Hee died, right?

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,320
After all the incidents broke out,

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,760
I forgot to tell you.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,860
I mean it.

23
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,060
Do I have to fall
for your lie again?

24
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,860
You told me about sending
that picture to Choi Ja Young...

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,000
much later
when I demanded an answer.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,470
I did that
because I didn't want to lose you.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,670
This time, it's different.

28
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,940
Did you plan to tell me
only after something broke out...

29
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,370
and I got cornered into a dead end?

30
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,540
What else are you keeping from me?
Tell me everything now.

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,010
Nothing. I mean it.

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,320
And what would I get
from cornering you into a dead end?

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,450
Nothing is going to change
even if Kim Do Yun works there.

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,990
He's just a doctor
who can't do you any harm.

35
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,220
Nothing happened even after
he began to associate with Jae In.

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,390
What do you mean nothing happened?

37
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,930
He was the one who got her out
of the mental hospital.

38
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,930
Exactly. That was all he could do.

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,470
Do you think
a guy like that can threaten you?

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,340
Why do you think
so little of yourself?

41
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,110
Do you know how amazing you are?

42
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,240
You're the most wonderful...

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,610
and affluent person I know.

44
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,480
That was
why I forgot all about Kim Do Yun.

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,750
He's like dust to us,
like fine dust we can't even see.

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,460
I wouldn't have forgotten
to tell you...

47
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,920
if I knew that you were
highly concerned about him.

48
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,560
I'm sorry I forgot to tell you.

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,670
I really am not keeping anything
from you.

50
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,870
You're everything to me.

51
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,210
Let me promise you one thing.

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,580
I'll never let you
get cornered into a dead end alone.

53
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,250
If you die,

54
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,920
I'll die with you.

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,560
I'll protect you until the end.

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,730
This is your last chance.

57
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,600
Do not keep anything from me
from now on.

58
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,190
What's wrong with you, Yu Gyeong?

59
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,520
Why did you tell him
that I already knew?

60
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,090
Were you that jealous
I got to live as Kang Jae In now?

61
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,600
Was this jealousy?

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,500
What?

63
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,200
You always envied her, too.

64
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,530
You were jealous of her.

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,370
Did you think I wouldn't know?

66
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,070
You need to be more honest.

67
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,470
How honest are you?

68
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,780
I don't think
that's something you should say.

69
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,180
You're ridiculous.

70
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,280
You're just like me.

71
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,650
No, you're even worse.

72
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,280
You said
you were Jae In's closest friend.

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,990
How do you think she must've felt
when her best friend betrayed her?

74
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,520
Tell me.

75
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,820
You need to stop here.

76
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,990
I have enough problems
other than you.

77
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,660
It's the same with me.

78
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,060
I also have enough problems
other than you.

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,270
I said you need to stop!

80
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,700
You can clean up the rest.

81
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,740
Why should I?

82
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,250
Why do you suddenly want to move?

83
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,120
I'm not suddenly saying this.
I've mentioned it before. Remember?

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,020
This house is too old and tiny.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,460
We have no money to move.

86
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,660
You have me. Let me get the place.

87
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,030
I'm a very affluent man,

88
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,230
much bigger than
anything you can imagine.

89
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,740
Hey, do you want me
to show you my bank account?

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,610
I know. I already know that.

91
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,010
Let's get an apartment unit, a fully
furnished one in a new building.

92
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,940
How about 165m²? Is that too small?

93
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,850
Isn't 165m² too big?

94
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,050
We need your room,
Do Yun's room, and my room.

95
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,280
We also have a guest with us,

96
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,920
and Bo Ram will need her room
when she starts school next year.

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,950
We need at least four rooms.

98
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,860
Get a grip on yourself.

99
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,360
You worked hard to make the money,

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,290
so use it for yourself
instead of throwing it away.

101
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,290
Save it.

102
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,960
Gosh. You're like my parent.

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,170
Why would I save money
instead of using it for my parent?

104
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,670
I'm going to do as I like,
even if you don't like it.

105
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,200
I'll get the place. Okay?

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,310
Wait just a year.

107
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,210
I'll think about it at that time.

108
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,980
Please just do as I say.

109
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,880
I can still remember Do Hee
around this place. That's why.

110
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,050
It feels like
we'll leave her behind alone.

111
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,060
Right. Shouldn't we return
Do Hee's severance pay?

112
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,990
I'm concerned
about keeping that money.

113
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,390
I returned it.

114
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,500
When? I have her bank account.

115
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,930
I sent it back with my money.
You don't have to mind it.

116
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,300
I'm home.

117
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,870
Do Yun must be home.

118
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,200
- Don't mention the severance pay.
- I won't.

119
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,270
I'll go and get some rest.

120
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,780
Okay. Get some rest.

121
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,820
I'll say hello to them for you.

122
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
It must be hard
for you to face them.

123
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,800
- You're back.
- Yes.

124
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,200
Where's Jae In?
Did she not come with you?

125
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,070
She looked exhausted,
so I told her to get some rest.

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,100
She asked me to say hi to you two.

127
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,910
You said she worked part-time
at the clinic where you work.

128
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,210
Was it your referral?

129
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,240
I told her.

130
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,980
She went out every day,
so I thought Yun Hee should know.

131
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,550
Is she the receptionist
or something?

132
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,750
Yes.

133
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,720
It must be hard for her
to do the job as a beginner.

134
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,990
She wouldn't know what to do if
she used to be an interior designer.

135
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720
Tell your clinic
to be more understanding...

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,090
even if she makes mistakes.

137
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,690
I'll do that.

138
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,030
I'm tired,
so I need to get some rest.

139
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,830
Okay. Goodnight.

140
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,670
What is it?

141
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,200
He doesn't look well.

142
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,470
Find out what's going on.

143
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,410
Goodness. Why are you so worried?

144
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,610
- Don't worry, and go to sleep.
- Stop it.

145
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,450
Your mom got worried.

146
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,250
Did something happen outside?

147
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,360
No, I'm just tired.

148
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,130
Isn't Jae In also named Kang Jae In?

149
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,690
Why do you ask?

150
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,430
I went to YL Group today
and remembered...

151
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,300
that the late chairman's daughter
was named Kang Jae In.

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,930
You were at the office?

153
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,870
Well, I got curious,
so I met with Director Kang Mi Ran.

154
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,840
If what you said was true,

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,280
she lied and said someone else
was Kang Jae In, her niece.

156
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,110
So, I asked
because I wanted to check...

157
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,250
if she really was her niece.

158
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,550
She insisted that it was true,
but I already had a feeling.

159
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,450
She was lying. I know it.

160
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,090
Hey, anyway.
I almost got into trouble.

161
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
I ran into Kang Se Ri,

162
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,030
so I was afraid
she might recognize me.

163
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,000
Uncle Oh Seong,
stop coming to YL Group.

164
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,870
If they find out who you are,

165
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,600
our plan will fall through.

166
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,600
Okay. I'll be careful.

167
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,690
I said it wasn't me.

168
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,960
I denied it.

169
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,660
I told you again and again
that it wasn't me!

170
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,870
It's all your fault.

171
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,870
Die!

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,740
Die!

173
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,480
Choi Ja Young, you'll be tortured...

174
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,110
for the rest of your life.

175
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,970
No, it wasn't my fault.

176
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,470
I was deceived, too.

177
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,410
No, it wasn't my fault.

178
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,880
No. It wasn't me.

179
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,750
No...

180
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,070
(Ms. Kang Jae In, congratulations!
You passed our final screening...)

181
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,170
What is it?

182
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,640
I passed the final screening
for the contest.

183
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,980
Really? Congratulations.

184
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,710
I passed safely thus far...

185
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,980
because the evaluation
was done blindly.

186
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,650
The problem begins now.

187
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,680
Once they open up my application
for the next evaluation,

188
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
they'll find out who I am.

189
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,590
Then, the problem is
if they'll choose someone...

190
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,990
by evaluating objectively.

191
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,590
I'll make them choose me.

192
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,260
Hello?

193
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,470
No, I'll be at your office
in the afternoon.

194
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,700
It's my aunt.

195
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,170
Come in.

196
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,310
What brings you here this early?

197
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,880
I had something to say.

198
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,750
Will you give us some privacy?

199
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,420
Okay.

200
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,790
Wait.

201
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,760
Geum Ja, can you get
two cups of coffee for us?

202
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,160
Do you have something to say to her?

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,060
No.

204
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,270
I was going to call you,

205
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,410
but I thought
I should talk to you in person.

206
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,110
Gi Chan,

207
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,510
the chairman of YL Group,

208
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,380
found out who your sister was.

209
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,320
It was my mistake.

210
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,950
When I heard
Jae In's mom had come here,

211
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,620
I blurted it out without thinking.

212
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,450
He was going to find out someday.

213
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,860
You don't have to mind it.

214
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,660
Is Jae In still staying with you?

215
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,630
Come in.

216
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,300
Good morning, Dr. Kim.

217
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,870
Hey, why are you here, Yu Gyeong?

218
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,240
I stopped by on my way to work.

219
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,110
Do you feel unwell, Na Ra?

220
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,840
I was going to call him up, but...

221
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,750
Oops.

222
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,050
The chairman wanted to see you,
so I thought of calling you,

223
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,250
but I decided to come myself.

224
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,660
Let's have coffee next time.

225
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
I thought you had
something to say to me.

226
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,280
I found out
something amazing about you.

227
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,380
One of my employees
named Ms. Kim Do Hee...

228
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,910
passed away
in a hit-and-run accident.

229
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,120
Is she your younger sister?

230
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,620
Yes, I'm her older brother.

231
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,220
I know it's belated,

232
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,460
but I share my deepest condolences.

233
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,890
Thank you.

234
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,530
I heard the case is up
for reinvestigation.

235
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,430
Your family must be quite worried.

236
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,600
Did you call me here
to share your condolences?

237
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,700
That's not all.

238
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,040
Why did you volunteer
to get a job at YL Group,

239
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,880
the company of a family
that killed your sister?

240
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,650
There was no reason.

241
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,990
I'm not sure if you know,
but I blew the whistle...

242
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,690
when Ms. Choi Ja Young faked
her cancer diagnosis.

243
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,530
After that, I resigned immediately.

244
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,130
I needed a job,

245
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,860
so I applied when I saw
the vacancy here.

246
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,400
Even so,

247
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,540
YL Group is a place
related to your sister's death.

248
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,270
It probably wasn't easy
to take up a job here.

249
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,540
I'd be lying
if I said I didn't feel hesitant.

250
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,910
I thought a lot about it
before I started...

251
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,380
and even after I began to work here.

252
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,350
In that while, the chairman changed.

253
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,390
I thought the company was no longer
unrelated to Choi Ja Young's family,

254
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,890
so I decided to keep my job.

255
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,730
I heard you were a talented doctor.

256
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,870
Wouldn't it be more meaningful...

257
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,740
if you worked at a hospital
instead of wasting your life here?

258
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,640
Do you want me to find you a job?

259
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,710
No.

260
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,210
I'm happy with my current job.

261
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,850
Let me be frank with you.

262
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,380
The trial for her case isn't over,

263
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,120
so wouldn't it be awkward
if you ran into me?

264
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,620
Everything happened because
my mother-in-law misunderstood me,

265
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,890
so I felt uneasy about it, too.

266
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,160
You just called it
a misunderstanding.

267
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,160
There's no reason to feel uneasy
if the allegations aren't true.

268
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,000
Do you feel...

269
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,670
uncomfortable to have me here?

270
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,010
It's a misunderstanding.

271
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,080
I made the offer just in case
you felt uncomfortable here.

272
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,410
If you're happy here,
please feel free to stay.

273
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,950
All right.

274
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,720
I have to see a patient,
so please excuse me.

275
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,280
Why did Gi Chan want to see you?

276
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,180
He found out Do Hee was my sister,

277
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,880
so he probably wanted to check.

278
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,150
He must've found out
my mom was here.

279
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,090
Na Ra saw it happen.

280
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,490
It seemed like he wanted me gone,
but it'd be hard to kick me out.

281
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,520
He doesn't have a good reason.

282
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,230
If he's this sensitive about this,

283
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,860
it must mean
Ms. Kim found out something.

284
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,630
I have to get my hands on that file.

285
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,380
Are you looking for something?

286
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,910
My cell phone.

287
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,250
I thought I left it here.

288
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,100
Hello?

289
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,670
Hello?

290
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,200
Ms. Choi.

291
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,510
I didn't realize
I left it in my pocket.

292
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,610
I'm tired. I need to get some rest.

293
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,180
Don't wake me.

294
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,390
(YL Planning and Design)

295
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,770
Don't you think
you've been coming here too often?

296
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,340
Why are you here this time?

297
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,580
My aunt wanted to see me.

298
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,960
I found out while looking through
the applications of the people...

299
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,460
who passed the final screening.

300
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,230
What were you thinking?

301
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,330
I thought you'd try to stop me
if I wanted to return.

302
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,700
The contest was done blindly,
so I knew It'd be fair.

303
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,200
I wanted to show what I could do.

304
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,940
You want to return here?

305
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,740
I was on maternity leave,
so of course, I'd come back.

306
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,140
Find another job.

307
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,810
I barely managed
to stop the media...

308
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,450
from gossiping
about Chairman Hwang's private life.

309
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,890
The staff will begin to talk
if you return to the business...

310
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,250
because a few of them know
who you are.

311
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,220
Is that what you're worried about?

312
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,030
Then, you shouldn't have lied
from the start.

313
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,070
Why didn't you come in
if you were curious?

314
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,770
Why were you eavesdropping?

315
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,080
What are you doing, Ms. Kang?

316
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,850
Let's continue talking.

317
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,290
(Managing Director)

318
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,930
My gosh. I haven't had
a chance to relax like this...

319
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,030
in such a long time.

320
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,440
Wait, something is suspicious.

321
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,540
Mom worked my fingers to the bones
without even giving me a break.

322
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,680
Something smells fishy.

323
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,280
(Closed)

324
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,720
Goodness.

325
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,660
It'll go perfectly with this wine,

326
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,290
just like us.

327
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,870
It looks very pretty.

328
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,040
Thank you for the food.

329
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,370
What do you think about me?

330
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,840
What do you mean by that?

331
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,350
Time is scarce,
so I don't want to waste it.

332
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,850
There's no need
to beat around the bush.

333
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,690
I have the skin of someone
in their thirties,

334
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,490
I have land and a house,

335
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,460
and I'm pretty enough, too.

336
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,930
Well, ma'am.

337
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,330
Goodness.

338
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,440
You seem so distant
whenever you call me that.

339
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,240
Well, should I call you Ms. Noh?

340
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,470
No way.

341
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,310
Or I can address you by your name.
Ms. Sook Ja?

342
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,980
No.

343
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,050
You easily call your sister
only by her name.

344
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,890
That's because
she's my actual sister.

345
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,060
Let's just go with Ms. Sook Ja.

346
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,360
All right. You can start there
and begin to call me baby later.

347
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,030
And if you keep calling me baby,
you'll become my honey, too.

348
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,770
What? He doesn't look
much older than me!

349
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,600
Why are you asking him to call you
his baby and honey?

350
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,840
Mom, have you become senile?

351
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,340
- What?
- Hey.

352
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,310
I must teach a lesson to my son.
Please excuse me.

353
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,480
- Get back here.
- What? No.

354
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,380
- I don't want to.
- Get back here!

355
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,350
No!

356

(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

357
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,930
Do I have to teach you how to knock
just as I did to Na Ra?

358
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,900
I'm sorry.
I wasn't in my right mind.

359
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,630
You have to stop
Director Kang now, honey.

360
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,170
What about her?

361
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,340
She's seeing Jae In right now.

362
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,740
She turned in an application
for the blind contest...

363
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,140
and made it through
the final screening.

364
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,680
She must be trying to reinstate her
to the business with this chance.

365
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,910
You have to step in and stop her.

366
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,050
Are you going to just sit around?

367
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,790
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

368
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,090
What is this nonsense
about Jae In returning here?

369
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,360
Says who?

370
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,090
She passed the final screening,
so you met her separately.

371
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,600
I called her here to make her
give up before the final evaluation.

372
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,600
The blind contest is
under my control.

373
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,870
And even if she gets reinstated,

374
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,170
Ms. Kang Se Ri will be her boss.
What's the problem?

375
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,510
So, you're going to do that?

376
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,510
I haven't decided on anything yet.

377
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,110
The final evaluation
hasn't happened.

378
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,620
What's more important is that
you keep your dignity as a chairman.

379
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,650
You shouldn't have run over here
only on your wife's words.

380
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,890
I'll be careful.

381
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,130
You need to stay, Ms. Kang.

382
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,600
I'm not done with you.

383
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,000
How dare you run over
to tell on me to your husband?

384
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm your boss, Ms. Kang.

385
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,070
Make sure you separate
your private life from work.

386
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,540
Yes.

387
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,310
You may go.

388
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,320
Kang Jae In, Kang Mi Ran.

389
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,520
The Kangs are
all nothing but a huge nuisance.

390
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,690
Kim Do Yun.

391
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,430
I must also get rid of that man
before the ticking bomb goes off.

392
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,600
We suffered from substantial damage
because of the exposé.

393
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,900
I must save myself from this
and strengthen my position...

394
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,510
to slowly get rid
of all those nuisances.

395
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,280
Will he not pick up his phone?

396
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,050
Hello?

397
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,960
Hello, Patrick.

398
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,220
This is Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
of YL Group calling.

399
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,490
Yes, it's you,
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

400
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,560
To what do I owe this honor
of getting a call from you?

401
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,830
If I wanted to set up a meeting
with a busy man like you,

402
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,170
I should've called you
from the beginning.

403
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,910
I should've thought it through.

404
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,940
It does feel nice to know
that you spared...

405
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,040
your precious time for me.

406
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,850
I'd like to have a conversation
about the progressive future...

407
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,650
of YL Group and DH Holdings.

408
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,950
Will you give me a chance
to do that?

409
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,260
You've put in your precious time,

410
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,730
so I'll also
have to return the favor.

411
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,800
I'll work around your schedule
and meet you at a great place.

412
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,270
Today isn't usually a day
when you close for business, right?

413
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,640
Some crazy grandma...

414
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,340
made a mess out of my business
to profess their love,

415
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,780
so I decided to keep it closed.

416
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,880
She professed their love
at a pig's feet place?

417
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,550
Wait, did she offer pig's feet
instead of a flower bouquet?

418
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,120
That grandma sounds ridiculous.
How silly.

419
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,030
I'm home.

420
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,190
Mommy!

421
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,100
Where's Gi Chan?

422
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,460
He'll get changed
and come downstairs.

423
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,600
Eat up, Ji Ho.

424
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm all done.
I want to go see Daddy.

425
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,650
Please give Gi Chan and me
some food, Yu Gyeong.

426
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,850
I'm hungry.

427
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,520
He'd probably prefer it
if his wife cooked.

428
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,120
That's true.

429
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,590
Okay, I'll cook.

430
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,300
Mother, you're so amazing.

431
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,430
It couldn't have been easy
to raise three children alone.

432
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,540
It must've been stressful.

433
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,670
Of course. It'll take forever
for me to point out everything.

434
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,640
Anyway, Mother.

435
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,040
I can trust you, right?

436
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,010
That was random.

437
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,810
Of course, you should.

438
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,350
Who will you trust
if not your mother-in-law?

439
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,420
Actually, I get concerned
about Ji Ho whenever I go to work.

440
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,060
What if Gi Man kidnaps him?

441
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,830
What?

442
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,500
Goodness.

443
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,630
I heard you kidnapped Eun Ho.

444
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,900
I can't live in my right mind...

445
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,210
if anything like that happens.

446
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,180
Mother, you're an amazing woman.

447
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Your son was a kidnapper,
but you decided to let it go.

448
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,550
I need to leave.

449
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,190
Was it you? Did you tell her?

450
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,120
Is it fun for you to start
this feud in the family?

451
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,890
It wasn't me.

452
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,160
I didn't tell you.

453
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,100
Who told you this?

454
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,300
I'm sorry, Yu Gyeong.

455
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,040
You told me not to say it,
but I forgot.

456
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,940
People say there's always one person
who humiliates the entire family,

457
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,010
and you were that person.

458
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,550
You have the lightest mouth.

459
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,880
And you're the problem.

460
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,120
Why can't you keep
your wife under control?

461
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,220
Darn it. I lost my appetite.

462
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,020
Follow me.

463
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,690
Isn't Gi Man the one
who humiliated the family?

464
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,360
What are you trying to do?

465
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,600
I didn't tell you anything.

466
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,670
Does Jae In know...

467
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,840
Gi Man kidnapped Eun Ho?

468
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,170
I can tell her
if she still doesn't know.

469
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,350
Yu Gyeong, you won't benefit
from messing with me.

470
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,850
I hope you learn something
from this incident.

471
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,850
Gi Man must be waiting.
Why aren't you following him?

472
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,100
I really didn't tell her.

473
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,270
It'd only embarrass me,
so why would I tell her that?

474
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,640
Then, how did she find out?

475
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,910
Gi Chan could've told her.

476
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,740
Don't be ridiculous!

477
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,410
One thing he hates the most is...

478
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,310
letting an outsider find out
about one of our faults!

479
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,210
What about me?

480
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,450
What would I get from
yapping about your embarrassment?

481
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,980
I wouldn't know that.

482
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,390
So, did you have
something to get from it?

483
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,860
You should make a video to make
people pity you and give you money.

484
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,290
A famous family physician
who even appears on TV...

485
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,800
lives with an incompetent husband
who kidnapped his own nephew.

486
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,970
Gosh, that'll be worth some money.

487
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,000
Are you serious?

488
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,700
Why not?

489
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,300
If you're going to blab about it,
at least get some money doing it.

490
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,140
You keep treating me like a joke
because of my incompetence,

491
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,840
so you'll probably be happy
to make money by humiliating me.

492
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,310
I'm still talking to you.
How dare you leave?

493
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,950
You can't just blurt out
whatever that comes to your mind!

494
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,830
Gi Man and Yu Gyeong got
into a fight,

495
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,100
so things are awkward.

496
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,230
Go downstairs later.

497
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,470
I'll pick out the storybook
to read with Daddy.

498
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,530
Okay.

499
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,640
What is this?

500
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,610
The Grand Prize winner
of the blind contest is...

501
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,210
Kang Jae In.

502
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,980
What?

503
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,190
Why is she announcing the winner
this late in the night?

504
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,760
Does this ever happen?

505
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,990
She avoided talking about this
and said she hadn't decided,

506
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,290
but she betrayed you.

507
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,200
See? In the end, Director Kang is
one of the Kangs,

508
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,670
and she's on Jae In's side.

509
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,540
What now?

510
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,310
Must we put up with her every day
roaming about at work?

511
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,320
I'm not sure
if it'll go as I thought.

512
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,250
I always end up facing
the most expected things.

513
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,920
It went as I thought.

514
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,720
Did I not get it?

515
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,660
What do you take me for?

516
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,160
Bo Ram.

517
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,300
Ta-da!

518
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,640
Congratulations, Ms. Kang,
the Grand Prize winner.

519
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,200
All right!

520
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,540
Uncle Do Yun, the Grand Prize is
the best one, right?

521
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
Yes.

522
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,780
It means she was
the best one in the world.

523
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,180
Thank you for celebrating, Bo Ram.

524
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,080
Thank you, Dr. Kim.

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,470
You didn't even knock yesterday.

529
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,580
Your decision doesn't seem
very well-mannered, either.

530
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,280
How can you reinstate Jae In...

531
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,350
without talking to me first?

532
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,150
As I mentioned yesterday,

533
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,950
I was in charge
of the blind contest.

534
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,320
Do I have to talk to you
about hiring an employee...

535
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,660
who'll work for me?

536
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,630
At the very least,
you shouldn't have betrayed me.

537
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,630
You said
you hadn't decided on anything...

538
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,100
when we talked yesterday.

539
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,600
You ignored the schedule
and announced it before the date.

540
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,300
Chairman Hwang,
make your intention clear.

541
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,040
Are you doing this
because Jae In is involved?

542
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,740
Or will you continue
to try to control me...

543
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,410
whenever I hire someone?

544
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,680
Of all people, this is Jae In.

545
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,210
The business has
already taken a blow...

546
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,780
after that exposé and all.

547
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,450
You don't have to add to that.

548
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,520
Please reconsider.

549
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,890
I'm sorry,

550
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,060
but I can't take this back.

551
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,790
Ms. Kang!

552
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,830
My family...

553
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,500
and YL Group are
more important than anything to me.

554
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,600
I must stop any dispute
from breaking out at work.

555
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,070
YL Group is my dad's life's work,

556
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,640
so it's as precious to me
as you think it is.

557
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,810
I won't tell anyone
that I'm his ex-wife.

558
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,380
I won't bring any damage
to the business.

559
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,150
I promise.

560
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,090
I still can't have you.

561
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,220
I wanted to keep my promise to you,

562
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,260
but you left me no choice.

563
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,930
I'll tell Seung Woo
who his birth mother is.

564
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,670
The official announcement
has been made already.

565
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,440
It won't do any good
to our corporate image...

566
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,010
and your reputation...

567
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,910
if you reverse the decision
without a good reason.

568
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,850
So, you're using me as an excuse?

569
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,920
My deal with Jae In was...

570
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,320
her right to work for YL Group...

571
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,420
according to the result
of the contest, and that's all.

572
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,890
I don't care what happens to her
and how she ends up...

573
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,560
after she begins her job.

574
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,730
I won't do anything
to keep her around.

575
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,170
I believe I gave you
the kind of response you wanted.

576
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,280
What in the world is going on?

577
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,620
Will she shoot him down
with her words...

578
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,420
and talk him
into letting Jae In return to work?

579
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,890
Gi Chan is the chairman,
so what's the problem here?

580
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,330
(Managing Director)

581
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,430
I knew it.

582
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,170
Acting like a sly rat
suits you best.

583
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,080
Jae In, is this your way...

584
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,390
of declaring war?

585
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,690
Yes, bring it on, Se Ri.

586
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,830
I'm looking forward to this.

587
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,780
(Queen's House)

588
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,810
You won't last long...

589
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,750
as long as I'm here.

590
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,750
So, Geum Ja's seat is now open?

591
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,750
Yes, until I find another counselor.

592
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,790
Does that mean I can come here?

593
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,490
My gosh!

594
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,060
Mom, this can't happen,
not even over my dead body.

595
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,200
I can't have...

596
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,030
that young man, the gigolo
who's way too young for you,

597
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,030
as my stepfather. Okay?

598
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,510
Who are you?
