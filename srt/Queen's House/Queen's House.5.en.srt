00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,250
What do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:19,160
(Episode 5)

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,530
Get up, Mom.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,930
I did her wrong,
so I should beg for forgiveness.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,230
- I'm sorry, Jae In.
- Mom!

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,800
Gi Man, Yu Gyeong.
You two need to get up, too. Now.

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,440
Honey.

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,640
Do you think my family is a joke?

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,940
What are you trying to do...

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,110
by making my entire family
kneel before you?

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,880
Na Ra said Gi Man was the one
who kidnapped Eun Ho,

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,020
so I came to see if it was true.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,720
So? Are you proud
that you made them kneel?

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,220
I didn't make them do it.
Mother suddenly...

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,890
Stop it.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,330
Jae In didn't do anything wrong.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,130
Of course,
she'd lose it after hearing...

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,130
he kidnapped her precious son.

22
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,970
I would've been the same.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,940
It was as if she were betrayed...

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,440
by the ones she trusted the most.

25
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,710
Stop crying, Mom.

26
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,780
Have you treated my family like this
whenever I wasn't around?

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,150
Fine. Let's say Gi Man did it.

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,490
So what? Nothing happened.

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,260
Eun Ho is fine.

30
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,130
So why are you
taking things this far?

31
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,330
Are you serious right now?

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,170
I was very relieved
that Eun Ho was fine,

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,340
- but if Gi Man did that...
- Are you in your right mind?

34
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,110
How can you take
my older brother the wrong way?

35
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,310
Na Ra clearly said it.

36
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,610
She said it was Gi Man...

37
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,450
You already know
the culprits were caught.

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,350
The police called and said
they made a confession!

39
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,350
- But Na Ra...
- What does she know?

40
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,190
You know she always goes around
talking complete nonsense.

41
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,530
If you don't believe me,

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,660
we can go to the police station
and see for yourself.

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,160
So, no?

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,430
It wasn't Gi Man?

45
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,630
It wasn't him.

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,540
He wouldn't do that.

47
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,770
My goodness. We were the victims!

48
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,350
She must've thought
our family was such a joke.

49
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,250
How can she
look down on us like this?

50
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,090
My goodness. Oh...

51
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,420
- Mom.
- Mother.

52
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,820
Mother.

53
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,060
Mom, pull yourself together.

54
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,760
Gi Man, let's take her to her room.

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,230
Okay. Mom.

56
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,540
Jae In.

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,000
At the very least,
you should've checked with me first.

58
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,510
No, I...

59
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,820
Her pulse is regular.

60
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,290
But she's not waking up.

61
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,090
This isn't good. Let's call 911.

62
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,890
Let's keep an eye on her for now.

63
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,490
What if she really passes away?

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,440
Where am I?

65
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,370
It's your bedroom.

66
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,010
Mom, we'll leave you
and let you get some rest...

67
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,780
now that you regained consciousness.

68
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,620
Don't worry about anything,
and get a good rest.

69
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,490
Okay.

70
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,570
My goodness. My knees hurt.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,570
I just hurt my precious knees.

72
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,610
This is why life is easier
as you get older...

73
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,650
if you have a competent son.

74
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,480
Goodness.

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,020
Who cares if that girl is
from an affluent family?

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,460
She can't even say anything
in front of her husband.

77
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,960
Anyway, how did he patch this up?

78
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,070
How dare you want to go in here?

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,100
I want to give her some water.

80
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,870
Do you want her to collapse
with high blood pressure?

81
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,840
She collapsed
because she felt victimized.

82
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,440
Why would she want to see you?

83
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,080
We have to be somewhere else.

84
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,780
Come with me.

85
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,100
Did you really kidnap him?

86
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,770
No. Give me that.

87
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,180
Stop lying and tell me the truth.

88
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
Why have you changed so much?

89
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,930
Why do you keep hitting rock bottom?

90
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,090
How can you kidnap Eun Ho?

91
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,930
He's your nephew.
Why did you do this?

92
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,070
I didn't. I told you. It wasn't me.

93
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,240
I saw Mother, Gi Chan, and you...

94
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,340
exchange eyes back there.

95
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,640
You can deceive Jae In,
but you can't fool me.

96
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,440
I didn't do it!

97
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
Don't you believe your husband?

98
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,040
No, I don't!

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,180
You should've given me faith.

100
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,020
Why did you do that?
Was it money? Was it?

101
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,920
Yes, I did it because of money!

102
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,590
I asked everyone for money,
but no one would listen.

103
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,790
No one even treated me
like I was a decent human!

104
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,700
I would've succeeded
if it hadn't been for him.

105
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,900
How did that punk
find out about it and show up?

106
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,070
You knew everything
and made him do it, didn't you?

107
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,810
What's going on between you two?

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,340
What are you talking about? Who?

109
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,010
I saw everything at the hospital.

110
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,280
You two were having
so much fun with each other.

111
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,750
Tell me the truth.

112
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,290
You're getting worse and worse.
Have you become delusional?

113
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,190
I want a divorce
if you're going to be like this.

114
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,560
Why? Did that punk
tell you to get divorced?

115
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,100
I would've split up with you
long ago...

116
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,170
if it hadn't been for my dad.

117
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,900
I get so sick of you...

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,170
whenever you're like this.

119
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,510
Darn it.

120
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,150
We're done interrogating them,

122
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,750
so we'll hand them over
to the prosecution soon.

123
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,020
Yes, thank you.

124
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,460
Take them away.

125
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,700
See?

126
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,670
Do you still not believe it?

127
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,320
So, you want me to leave out
the actual client...

128
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,580
and make my boys
take the false blame?

129
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,920
They were accomplices,

130
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,820
so you couldn't say
they were falsely blamed.

131
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,390
What do you say?

132
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,360
All right.

133
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,900
I need you to sign an agreement
and have it notarized, too.

134
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,600
I believed Na Ra's words
and took them the wrong way.

136
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,260
I already told you
that the kidnappers were arrested.

137
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,730
I wasn't in my right mind.

138
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,370
All I wanted to do was
check and see if it was true.

139
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,440
I couldn't think of anything else.

140
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,670
So, you didn't check for facts...

141
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,480
and made my mom kneel?

142
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,340
I didn't tell her to do it.

143
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,780
That's a misunderstanding.

144
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,250
You probably didn't have to say it.

145
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,280
She must've felt pressured
into doing it.

146
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,160
I'll visit her
and ask for forgiveness.

147
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,190
Forget it.

148
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,460
You don't have to say it
if you don't mean it.

149
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't do it.

150
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,700
Honey.

151
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,830
Look at me.

152
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,600
I have never...

153
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,770
looked down
on your mother or family...

154
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,440
or held them in disdain.

155
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,180
I don't know about everything else,
but I want to make certain of this.

156
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,110
I really didn't make her do it.

157
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,680
I also went overboard.

158
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,020
I must've lost it
when I saw my mom on her knees.

159
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,990
So, are we okay now?

160
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,900
Should we go for a walk?

161
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,630
Let's take Eun Ho, too.

162
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,870
I have to talk to Father,

163
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,540
so get ready to go.

164
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,740
Okay.

165
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,290
I can't be there tonight.
I'm at home.

166
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,020
I'll call you tomorrow.

167
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,420
I love you.

168
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,730
Gi Chan,
this wasn't what you promised.

169
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,970
You said you'd do anything
as I asked today.

170
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,910
I'm done...

171
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,110
living in the shadows.

172
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,550
I can't put up with this anymore!

173
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,520
I'm Kang Jae In.

174
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,390
I'm not Kang Se Ri.

175
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm Kang Jae In.

176
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,570
Just wait.

177
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,540
I'll live as Kang Jae In.

178
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,180
Director Do did that?

179
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,880
Yes, sir.

180
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,510
Are you sure about this?

181
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,780
Someone from the client's company
came out to whistle-blow.

182
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,090
There was...

183
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,320
another contract signed
under different amounts.

184
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,130
This is a copy of the contract
from the whistle-blower.

(YL Group, signed by Do Min Jun)

186
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,840
What should I do?

187
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,280
Do not tell anyone,

188
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,350
and make sure this does not get out.

189
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,550
If the whistle-blower
exposes their company,

190
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,450
it'll come to light anyway.

191
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,320
Wouldn't it be better...

192
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,220
to make a decision
before that happens?

193
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,930
But he's
your older brother's father-in-law.

194
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,930
Are you sure?

195
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,130
I hesitated because of that,

196
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,300
but I decided that
work must remain work.

197
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,100
I'll talk to Yu Gyeong.

198
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,010
I'll figure out a way
to handle this.

199
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,410
Do not make a move
and meddle with this.

200
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,180
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,660
Daddy!

202
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,920
Hey.

203
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,760
Eun Ho.

204
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,030
Do you want to play soccer?

205
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,300
The loser buys ice cream.

206
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,500
Okay.

207
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,030
Let's go.

208
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,000
We're going for a walk.

209
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,440
- Bye.
- Okay.

210
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,170
Let's go.

211
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,340
Seung Woo, don't come home too late.
I get worried about you.

212
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,680
If you love me that much,
come home early.

213
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,550
Be careful out there.

214
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,520
Seung Woo will be late.

215
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
And the childless is sad.

216
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,850
Do you feel sad?

217
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,790
Both you and Jae In are
such loving moms to your children.

218
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,060
I got so jealous
and felt a little sad.

219
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,560
Stop talking nonsense.

220
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,000
It's not too late
to find someone to marry.

221
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,070
Are you crazy?

222
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
Once was enough.

223
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,570
I'm too old now.

224
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,610
I can't even have children anymore.

225
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,580
The children you raise are
also considered your children.

226
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,510
The men you can date at your age...

227
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,280
must have a history or two.

228
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,020
That means he could be with kids.

229
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,620
Don't say that.

230
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,420
It's not the same thing.

231
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,190
Mi Ran, pretend like
you never heard him.

232
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,730
Here.

233
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,730
All right. Hey. Good one.

234
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,700
Here we go! Shooting!

235
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,840
Great job. Once more.

236
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,110
Here. Kick it.

237
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,040
All right.

238
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,320
- Is it good, Eun Ho?
- Yes.

239
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,620
- You can have a bite.
- I can?

240
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,690
My gosh.

241
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,160
It's so delicious.

242
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,430
I want a bite, too. Here.

243
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,890
Thanks.

244
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,130
It's really good.

245
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,010
You're so nice. Hey.

246
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,490
What? Bo Ram.

247
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,460
When did you take this picture?

248
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,260
Today.
Eun Ho's mommy took it for us.

249
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,190
- Eun Ho's mommy?
- Yes.

250
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,630
We had a day of experiences
with mommies at the kindergarten.

251
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,430
The one where parents are invited?

252
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,670
Yes.

253
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,500
Why didn't you tell me?

254
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,670
You can't come
because you're busy with work.

255
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,540
I knew you'd feel sad if I told you,
so I didn't.

256
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,710
No matter how busy I am,

257
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,780
I can be there if you want me.

258
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,590
Can you skip work?

259
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,490
Of course.

260
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,820
You'll always be my priority.

261
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,530
You should've
at least asked Grandma.

262
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,360
Both Grandma and Uncle Do Yun would
be there for you if you asked.

263
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,030
Grandma will have to close
her chicken place,

264
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,500
and Uncle Do Yun
didn't have a day off this week.

265
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,670
- Do you know when his leaves are?
- Yes.

266
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
When he tells me
he doesn't have to go to work,

267
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,340
we play at home.

268
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,680
Don't you like the paintings?

269
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,680
Eun Ho's mommy painted those for us.

270
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,720
I'll be there
for the next parents' day.

271
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,690
I'll go there,
treat you and Eun Ho to delicious food,

272
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,090
draw something for you,
and take pictures, too.

273
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,530
- Really?
- Yes.

274
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,700
I'll tell Eun Ho all about it.

275
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,770
Come here.

276
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,240
Gosh, my girl.
You're such a good girl.

277
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,310
The person you have reached...

278
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,550
Seung Woo.

279
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,720
Kang Seung Woo! Wake up.

280
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,990
Open the door.

281
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,790
Mom.

282
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,830
Good morning.

283
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,030
Come outside.

284
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,640
Look at you.

285
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,170
Did you do this again?

286
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,080
I told you not to drink and drive.

287
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,940
No, I didn't drive.

288
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,410
I called a chauffeur service,

289
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,910
so I just got out
of the back door...

290
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,820
Did I?

291
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,390
Or didn't I?

292
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,090
But I didn't.

293
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,830
I blacked out.

294
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,630
What if you get into an accident?

295
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,260
I can't go on anymore
if my precious son gets hurt.

296
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,330
Forget you.

297
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,800
What if you hurt someone else?

298
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,440
Driving under the influence is
considered potential murder.

299
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,470
Haven't you gotten a grip
even after your previous conviction?

300
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,610
Dad beat me up
almost to death back then,

301
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,910
so I've been careful.

302
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,950
If you're going to be like this,
give up the car.

303
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,580
I thought I called
the chauffeur service.

304
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,690
See?

305
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,350
I called the service.

306
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,490
You can see that
I paid for their service. Look.

307
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,630
Then, who parked?

308
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,360
If you did, that's also considered
drinking under the influence.

309
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,930
My gosh.

310
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,700
Hello?

311
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,740
Hello, sir.

312
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,810
Did you park my car
before you left last night?

313
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,010
Yes, I parked your car,

314
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,210
but you moved to the driver's seat
and went to sleep.

315
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,010
Thank you.

316
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,680
Happy now?

317
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,250
Yes, I'm happy.

318
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,220
Don't be so harsh
on your only brother.

319
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,620
I'm the successor of YL Group.

320
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,590
You better be nice to me.

321
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,290
Get to work.

322
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,100
Dad thought
you went to the office first.

323
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,470
I have to get changed
and take a shower, too.

324
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,700
You're sleepy because you slept here
instead of in your big room.

325
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,600
You should go and get a quick nap.

326
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,240
You're the best, Mom.

327
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,640
Let me nap for just two hours.
Will you wake me up?

328
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,310
Sure.

329
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,610
I thought you finally came to your senses
and actually worked.

330
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,750
I don't know who your superior is,
but I feel bad for them.

331
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,620

336
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,350
Hey, Dad.
Why are you calling me so early?

337
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,750
I had a bad dream last night,
so I thought I'd check in.

338
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,320
Is everything okay?

339
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,620
Yes.

340
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,050
Did you catch a cold?

341
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,890
You don't sound too well.

342
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,230
It's still early,
so my voice hasn't warmed up yet.

343
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,960
Dad, make sure
you look after your health.

344
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,600
Don't skip your meals,
although you live alone.

345
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,200
Don't worry. I eat well.

346

I don't want to hear your excuses.

360
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,030
You've contributed greatly
to my business to this day,

361
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,760
so I decided
to let you go discreetly.

362
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,060
Step down quietly
and do not cause any trouble.

363
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,570
Yes, sir. I will do that.

364
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,980
You've also aged quite a bit,
Mr. Chairman.

365
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,820
As they say,
the skin is nearer than the shirt.

366
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,830
Thank you for everything.

367
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,100
Goodbye.

368
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,240
The skin is nearer than the shirt?

369
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,750
In the end,
we all prioritize our own.

370
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,020
(Personnel Appointment Announcement)

371
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,590
(Director Do Min Jun,
voluntary resignation)

372
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,410
It looked like you were behind this.

373
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,210
You prepared it quite thoroughly
in that short while.

374
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,480
What do you mean?

375
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,850
The chairman found out about it...

376
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,350
and suggested
that we let it go quietly.

377
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,550
If you continue to make
odd accusations,

378
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,620
I may suggest that
he track down your funds.

379
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,360
Everyone has a skeleton
in the closet.

380
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,800
I won't say anything to Yu Gyeong.

381
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,160
She'll be devastated.

382
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,440
Director Do,
thank you for all your hard work.

383
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,380
Director Do.

384
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,180
It's because of me, right?

385
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,080
It must've been the contract...

386
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,150
Ms. Kim.

387
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,550
They had already taken a measure.

388
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,960
Don't look into it any further,
and just turn a blind eye to it.

389
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,330
You may end up getting hurt.

390
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,130
I can't turn a blind eye to this.

391
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,030
The best move you can make is...

392
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,370
training Kang Seung Woo
to make him do his best.

393
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,540
As people say, haste makes waste.

394
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,880
You should prepare him
so that he can handle this himself later.

395
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,680
Wouldn't that be
a guaranteed success?

396
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,980
But you were framed.

397
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,290
People don't stay loyal
to their work in this age.

398
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,060
I want to stay true to my life
from now on.

399
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,230
You have a daughter, right?

400
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,460
I have one, too.

401
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,000
I was always busy working,
so I never got to look after her.

402
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,300
My wife had passed away early,

403
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,500
so I felt bad whenever I saw
how well my daughter raised herself.

404
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,410
I'll think about
what I can do for her...

405
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,610
while taking some time off.

406
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,950
Don't worry about me.

407
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,550
You should
continue your business as usual.

408
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,720
You must also consider
your daughter's future.

409
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,530
Isn't that so?

410
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,340
- Hello.
- Hey.

411
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,770
Quiet.

412
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,710
I wasn't late.

413
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,620
I was in the restroom.

414
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,600
Mr. Kang, read all these
within the week...

415
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,770
and turn in reports.

416
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,670
- All of these?
- You'll do actual work from now on.

417
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,440
These are the basics of finances,
so learn these by heart.

418
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,080
How are all these just basics?

419
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,150
Why did I come to work?

420
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,780
Hello?

421
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,350
Yes, hello.

422
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,020
Have you looked into what I asked?

423
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,460
What? In Korea?

424
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,190
By any chance,
do you know where the hotel is?

425
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,930
Yes, one moment.

426
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,830
Okay.

427
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:28,770
(EO Motel, Room 1902)

428
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,310
Okay, sure.

429
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,750
Are you going to the hospital again?

430
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,620
Yu Gyeong found out everything.

431
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,620
I should try to console her.

432
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,490
You're impossible.

433
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,460
Stay here.

434
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,190
I'll tell Na Ra to take it to her.

435
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,360
Jae In is on her way here.

436
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,170
Here.

437
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,170
I was craving some just now.

438
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,940
It's that hour of the day.

439
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,480
What's wrong? Are you okay?

440
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,180
Gosh, thanks.

441
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,910
It must be because I had it
on an empty stomach.

442
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,110
Goodness.

443
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,180
I'll get you something,
so eat first before you drink it.

444
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,220
I'm fine, really.

445
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,690
Hey, Yu Gyeong!

446
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,320
- Na Ra.
- Who's Na Ra?

447
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,790
Hello.

448
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,270
- My nose.
- I'm sorry.

449
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,840
Are you all right?

450
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,510
Na Ra, what brings you here?

451
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,080
Gi Man asked me
to bring you these snacks.

452
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,780
That's great.

453
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,420
Your husband is the best.

454
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,320
Eat something before you drink it.

455
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,530
Bye, then.

456
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,330
You two should talk.

457
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,560
- Okay.
- Bye.

458
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,070
Yu Gyeong, who's that?

459
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,570
He's a colleague.

460
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,840
So, he's a doctor? Is he married?

461
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,950
He's single.

462
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,950
What's his name? How old is he?

463
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,380
Which department is he with?
Is he dating anyone?

464
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,030
Gi Man, I'm sorry.

465
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,100
I misunderstood you
without looking into the facts.

466
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,000
Well, things like that could happen.

467
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,370
I realized that you had been...

468
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,510
looking down on my family all along
through this incident.

469
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,410
I had no idea,

470
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,120
so I always went around
showing you respect...

471
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,050
and boasting about you.

472
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,020
How can an elder of the family...

473
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,390
kneel before her daughter-in-law?

474
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,400
Mother, Gi Man.

475
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,110
I'm so sorry.

476
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,010
I'll be more careful
so that nothing like this happens again.

477
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,780
Mom.

478
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,020
Goodness, please get up.

479
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,660
I'm not so narrow-minded.

480
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,230
I already forgave you
deep inside my heart.

481
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,780
- Right. I heard you met my wife.
- Yes.

482
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,050
Why didn't you tell me?

483
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,990
You break your promises...

484
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,390
without a reason
and act like it didn't happen.

485
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,830
How can I act like that?

486
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,290
I kept getting concerned,

487
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,130
so I ran over here
as soon as I got off work.

488
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,700
I was in
an inevitable situation yesterday.

489
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,640
Please cut me some slack.

490
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,840
You're too sly.

491
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,440
And I keep getting
soft-hearted with you.

492
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,710
- Hey, one second.
- Sure.

493
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,120
Hello?

494
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,220
Yes, hello.

495
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,320
Can you start working next week?

496
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,030
Of course.

497
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,030
Does this mean I...

498
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,260
Yes, let's have a good run.

499
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,160
I'll see you at work next week.

500
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,770
Yes, thank you.

501
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,870
Who was that?

502
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,240
It's a secret.

503
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,870
Are you free tomorrow evening?

504
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,440
Tomorrow?

505
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,110
I have an important work thing.

506
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,580
Is that so?

507
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,880
You're staying in Korea
for a while, right?

508
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,450
Why don't we meet
next Tuesday with Ji Ho?

509
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,990
I'll say I have a business trip,
so let's go on that day.

510
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,260
Okay.

511
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,480
You're ready.

512
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,450
Bye.

(EO Motel, Room 1902)

514
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,680
What?

515
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,290
So, you apologized?

516
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,120
I must've been crazy.

517
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,830
I feel so bad for my mother-in-law,

518
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,990
Gi Man, and Yu Gyeong.

519
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,200
And I feel ashamed
to face Gi Chan, too.

520
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,170
You did overreact this time,

521
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,900
but the situation was that dire.
Just forget about it.

522
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,580
I got pictures
from Eun Ho's kindergarten.

523
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,480
- Do you want to see them?
- Sure.

524
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,050
- I'll get some tea.
- Okay.

Yes, all right.

I'm not sure.

534

Honey, you got home early.

535
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,650
I missed you.

536
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,920
- I'm back.
- Hey.

537
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,690
You should've told me
you'd be home early.

538
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,920
I didn't make dinner.

539
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,320
I can eat a little later.

540
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,630
Anyway, I have something for you.

541
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,570
It's a reconciliation present.

542
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,340
I'm sorry I got mad at you.

543
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,110
I should've considered
your situation a little more.

544
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,840
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,980
I feel even worse now.

546
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:28,280
I apologized
to Mother and Gi Man today.

547
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Was she really upset?

548
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,690
No, she understood.

549
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,930
I'm so glad I married you.

550
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,030
Thank you for the present.

551
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,140
Something came up at the hospital
for Yu Gyeong, so she couldn't come.

552
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,680
It would've been nice
for her to be here.

553
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,650
Let's find another day.

554
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,190
Honey, over here.

555
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,360
- My husband is here.
- He is?

556
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,280
(Queen's House)

557
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,820
It'd feel reassuring without me.

558
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,090
I also considered putting
both of you in charge.

559
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,090
I want to retire
within the next year.

560
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,530
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

561
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,340
Come out.

562
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,870
I wonder what you
and Jae In did in this bed.

563
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,240
What did you two do?

564
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,050
I never forgive anyone...

565
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,110
who makes my daughter miserable.
