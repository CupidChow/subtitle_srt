1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,310
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,310
You're under arrest
for attempted rape.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,520
How many times do I have to say
that nothing happened?

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,050
She put on a show!

7
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,420
If there are any discrepancies,
talk to us at the police station.

8
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:15,750
We'll find out everything
after investigating.

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,160
What's going on? What happened?

10
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,990
It must've been a trap.

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,830
Let's go.

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,430
No, I...

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,040
Hello?

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,650
What are you talking about?
How did that happen to Do Yun?

15
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,350
The police just came
and arrested him.

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,120
I'll find out which police station it is
and text you.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,800
I heard he was arrested
for attempted rape.

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,000
The woman fell in shock...

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,300
and was sent to a hospital.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,900
I'm sorry.
Your biggest help is gone.

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,370
It must be devastating.

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,870
Did you do this?

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,980
It's not too late to stop.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,880
I won't let this go
if you're behind this.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,710
Oh, my. How scary.

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,790
I'm sorry. It would've been great
if it had been me.

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,250
Bad news. It wasn't me.

28
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,830
And don't try to order me around.

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,460
Know your place
before you get smart with me.

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,470
You are...

31
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,100
just a rank-and-file employee
without money or connections.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,210
I am married to Hwang Gi Chan,
the chairman of YL Group.

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,540
Get it?

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,550
Ms. Kang.

35
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,910
Make a cup of coffee
and leave it on my desk.

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,950
Or should I call you Geum Ja?

37
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,290
You were a good actress.

38
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,290
You had me fooled.

39
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,210
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

40
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,540
(Diploma, Name: Kang Se Ri)

41
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,350
What are you doing over there?

42
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,260
Hey. I saw some dust,
so I wanted to wipe it off.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
Anyway, have you heard...

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,630
about Dr. Kim Do Yun?

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,700
He just got arrested by the police.

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,900
He tried to molest a female employee
who came to see him at the clinic.

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,270
Isn't it ridiculous?

48
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,510
Is that so?

49
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,640
Did you do this?

50
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,980
Was it really you?

51
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,020
My rule is
to always return whatever I get.

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,620
He must've realized...

53
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,290
nothing good would come
from messing with me.

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,060
You're so great, honey.

55
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,400
The same applies to you.

56
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,330
You cannot lie to me.

57
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,070
Anyway, why are you here?

58
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,210
It won't look good to our staff
if you keep visiting me here.

59
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,110
You're right.
I hadn't thought of that.

60
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,580
I wanted to tell you
about Kim Do Yun.

61
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,980
I'll return to my position,
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

62
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,670
Who did this?

63
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,510
Who's behind this?

64
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,750
Kang Jae In. It has to be you.

65
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,650
I know it's you.

66
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,690
She'll only deny it
even if I press her for an answer.

67
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,220
Should I check the CCTV footage?

68
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,660
No.

69
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,090
Then, my husband will find out, too.

70
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,900
That's exactly what Jae In wants,

71
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,030
so I can't fall for that.

72
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,310
Ms. Choi, I'm going to work.

73
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,310
Ms. Choi?

74
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,080
What day of the week is it?

75
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,220
It's Thursday.

76
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,220
Is something bothering you?

77
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,090
I have no idea what the date
or day of the week is.

78
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,730
I can't even tell
if the time is passing.

79
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,560
Everything came to a halt.

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,900
My existence disappeared
from this world.

81
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,870
So, what day is it again?

82
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,410
It may be
because you're always home.

83
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,180
Why don't you pick up
a part-time job?

84
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,990
No gallery will hire me,
so what can I do?

85
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,490
I'm currently working
at a small restaurant,

86
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,090
and it's not so bad.

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
Wouldn't it be good for you
to work and kill some time?

88
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,030
You should move your body...

89
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,670
Did you tell me
to work at a restaurant?

90
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,670
Don't you know who I am?

91
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,040
Are you trying to humiliate me?

92
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,640
I can't do that.

93
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,810
I was just offering...

94
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,440
because you seemed
to be stressed out...

95
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,410
about paying your living expenses.

96
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,650
Please don't take it the wrong way.

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,950
You don't have to give me
living expenses,

98
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,490
but if you want to offer some,
I'll only take enough for the food.

99
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,390
There's no pressure.

100
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,460
Then, please excuse me.

101
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,560
Wait.

102
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,530
I remembered the things
Jae In said to me, too.

103
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,170
Let me take a look at the place.

104
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,550
You should probably go home.

105
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,820
That was sudden.

106
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,590
What's the reason?

107
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,420
Well, it's...

108
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,190
Why didn't I think
of the pig's feet restaurant?

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,860
I must be getting older.

110
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,530
You're here.

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,930
Hello.

112
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,140
Why are you out there?
You should come in.

113
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,310
Come on in.

114
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,390
(We're closed today.)

115
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,400
You seem quite familiar.

116
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,430
I know I've seen you somewhere.

117
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,570
Wait, is she...

118
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,010
That's just crazy.

119
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,780
That woman
wouldn't work at a place like this,

120
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,050
and she's in prison anyway.

121
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,350
Why won't you keep going?

122
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,180
I thought you were someone else.

123
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,720
You looked similar
to my mortal enemy,

124
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,990
so I got you confused.

125
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,430
Did she just say the words
mortal enemy to my face?

126
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,330
Where are her manners?

127
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,230
I didn't ask for your name.

128
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,700
What's your name?

129
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,500
I can't give her my name.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,170
I'm not someone
who can work at a place like this.

131
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,710
She's my older cousin.

132
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,980
That was why you treated her
with such respect.

133
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,280
What's her name?

134
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,860
Mi Sook. Do Mi Sook.

135
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,460
She's my cousin.

136
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,090
If she's older than you,
it'll be hard for you...

137
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,070
to work this job at your age.
And you've never done this, right?

138
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,030
Can you do this?

139
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,310
I brought her today
to get the feel of the job.

140
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,670
Isn't that so, Mi Sook?

141
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,810
What are you waiting for?

142
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,650
Right. He said
he was my younger cousin.

143
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,250
Come on.

144
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,720
Yes, right.

145
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,600
Can she do this?

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,270
It's her first time,
so she doesn't know anything.

147
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,430
She'll do well
once she gets trained.

148
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,640
Then, go ahead and try.

149
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm just here to watch.

150
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,780
- I need water.
- Sure.

151
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,200
Have another great day,
Mr. Chairman.

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,700
Do you know what time it is?

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,100
Did you just get here?

154
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,840
My official date is
just around the corner,

155
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,540
and I don't have
enough time on my hands.

156
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,110
Please show me
your generous understanding, Mr. Chairman.

157
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,340
Anyway, Gi Chan.

158
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,980
Will you allow me
to date my boyfriend?

159
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,280
That was random.
Who's your boyfriend?

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
You know him, too.

161
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,090
It's the coolest guy in the world,
Dr. Do Yun.

162
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,890
Kim Do Yun?

163
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,560
Have you lost your mind?

164
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,230
Why would you want to date
a molester?

165
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,300
What are you talking about?
He's not like that.

166
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,730
He was just arrested in action...

167
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,800
after he laid his hands
on one of my female employees.

168
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,400
The entire company will find out
by tomorrow, and he'll be fired,

169
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,870
so forget about him.

170
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,510
If you don't,
I'll disown you from our family,

171
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,710
and you won't be allowed to use
a penny of my money. Got it?

172
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,610
Go ahead.

173
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,750
You aren't the only one
made of money.

174
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,010
Mom's rich, too.

175
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,880
And I'm not your daughter.
I'm Mom's daughter.

176
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,990
All I need is permission from her!
Darn it.

177
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,760
That little...

178
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,260
Dr. Kim!

179
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,800
He's been falsely accused!

180
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,530
(YL Planning and Design)

181
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,940
This is an additional request.
You can take it, Ms. Kang.

182
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,610
Director Kang,
I'm in charge of all requests...

183
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,110
from our VIP clients.

184
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,450
It overlaps with the project
you're currently working on.

185
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,980
Above all, winning one contest
could've been sheer luck.

186
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,790
You should prove your competence...

187
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,050
as a part of my team.

188
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,390
I'm looking forward to finding out
how creative and unique it'll be.

189
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,630
You will not do
a sloppy job on this.

190
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,400
Have your draft confirmed by me.

191
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,800
Sure. I'll do that.

192
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,770
(Mr. Hong)

193
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,180
(New message)

194
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,920
Director Kang, if you're done,

195
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,260
may I be excused?

196
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,420
I forgot that
I had to be at a meeting outside.

197
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,140
Oh, my.

198
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,910
Didn't you ignore my call?
You must've become a nervous wreck.

199
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,110
Please have a seat.

200
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,590
What did my husband show you?

201
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,890
Well, Chairman Hwang Gi Chan...

202
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,600
called me himself
and asked me to find this man.

203
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,470
So? Should I look for him?

204
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,740
He was still suspicious of me.

205
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,370
What do I do?

206
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,740
If he gave a job to a man like this,

207
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,370
he must be determined to find out.

208
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,940
I can't let Gi Chan find out.

209
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,380
I'll double the money
my husband offered.

210
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,250
So, you'll get three times
the original offer.

211
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,690
You'll take money from him anyway.

212
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,260
I should do that, right?

213
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,160
Three times doesn't sound too bad.

214
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,030
What can I do for you?

215
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,770
Well, you should pretend like
you're looking.

216
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,970
Tell him that you're still looking.

217
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,770
Okay.

218
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,340
I need you to do one more thing.

219
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,550
That's Kang Jae In's current address.

220
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,290
Come on in. Please come in.

221
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,760
Why would you do that
for a wife who left home?

222
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,090
Come on, Mom.

223
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,600
Are you having a stroke?

224
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,060
Why are you winking at me?

225
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,370
That's enough.

226
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,230
What if she leaves again?

227
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,170
"Gosh, my eldest daughter-in-law.
You're home."

228
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,540
Did you think I'd be like that?

229
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,280
Mom.

230
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,240
Welcome back.

231
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,950
Only a generous mother-in-law
would let this go, just like me.

232
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,480
Other families
would've kicked you out right away.

233
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,490
Consider yourself blessed.

234
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,790
Mom, we must always speak the truth.

235
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,320
I'm the one who's blessed.

236
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,460
Marrying you was
the biggest blessing of my life.

237
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,430
I'm sorry, Mother.

238
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,170
I'll get changed
and make dinner right away.

239
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,240
She's so robotic.

240
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,470
She's making such a big deal
out of making some food.

241
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,180
Good grief. I should stay patient.

242
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,510
This is why daughters-in-law have
all the power these days.

243
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,250
Mom, you need to shut your mouth.
Okay? All right?

244
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,080
How dare you tell me
to shut my mouth?

245
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,620
You need to shut your hole.

246
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,220
- What's good here?
- What would you like?

247
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,990
Here's your chicken.

248
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,190
Can we have more radish pickles?

249
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,160
Radish pickles? Sure.

250
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,900
Excuse me, auntie. I'd like a soda.

251
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,140
Me?

252
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,080
Yes, don't you work here?

253
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,440
She does.

254
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,110
Mi Sook, please grab that.

255
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,620
Can you see that
we're busy right now?

256
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,320
You can get one yourself.

257
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,090
Excuse me, auntie.
Can I have some wet tissue?

258
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,390
My goodness.

259
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,160
Isn't this good?

260
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,290
This one? I'll try it.

261
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,330
Have some more pickles.

262
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,730
You still seem young,
so you should get it yourself.

263
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,270
Why do you want to make
your elders work?

264
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,010
It's her first day at work,
so she's not used to her job yet.

266
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,710
I'd like to pay.

267
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,780
Mi Sook, can you take the counter?

268
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

269
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,720
Another order of noodles, please.

270
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,620
Yes, sure. It's on the house.

271
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,690
The total is 47 dollars.

272
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,970
Here.

273
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,930
What? You only owe me three dollars.

274
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,940
It's not even a big difference.

275
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,440
- It's fine.
- Are you serious?

276
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,010
Thanks a lot.

277
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,040
Hey, we got lucky.

278
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,650
Did she just give him
seven more dollars?

279
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,820
How's Mi Sook doing?

280
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,760
She's still clumsy, right?

281
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,360
She's never done this kind of work,
and it's her first day.

282
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,860
Yes, it's her first day.

283
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,040
She'll get better over time
after some training.

284
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,980
You're home.

285
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,650
I heard you called my uncle.

286
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,820
He quickly made his moves
and helped me get released.

287
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,060
So, were you cleared
of the false accusation?

288
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,590
I'll be questioned
without detention.

289
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,360
Something doesn't seem right.

290
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,860
Her attorney barged in right away
and filed the complaint...

291
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,530
as if everything was planned.

292
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,270
First, I need to find out
if she's actually employed there.

293
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,610
She is. I confirmed that.

294
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,440
You said
she came to the clinic first, right?

295
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,910
Yes, she said she suffered
from anxiety and depression...

296
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,380
because of workplace abuse
from her immediate superior.

297
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,280
That's crazy.

298
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,850
Her immediate superior was
on maternity leave.

299
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,950
Then, it must've been staged.

300
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,520
She was determined to do this
when she showed up.

301
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,460
Why would a stranger
do something like this?

302
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,560
Gi Chan may be behind this.

303
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,500
I'm sure that's the case.

304
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,900
I'll find out
at the meeting tomorrow.

305
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,100
Hey, Little Grandpa.

306
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,670
You're all here.

307
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,010
You haven't had dinner, right?

308
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,140
Let's eat.

309
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,580
I saw fresh tofu on my way home,
so I got some.

310
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,950
Let's have some tofu and kimchi.

311
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,720
Little Grandpa.

312
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,920
You can't leave again, okay?

313
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,090
I get sad
whenever Grandma looks sad.

314
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,730
Okay?

315
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,940
Then, I'll put it here.

316
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,270
Oh, no!

317
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,470
- Yes! I won!
- Gosh.

318
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,140
Uncle Gi Man lost.

319
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,440
Can you let me off this once?
Let's do it over.

320
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,710
Please let me off this once. Please?

321
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,480
Uncle Gi Man will talk to Santa.

322
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,950
I'll tell him you were a good kid,
so let me off this once.

323
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,120
No?

324
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,990
Let me put this one in again.

325
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,990
What is it? Do you need help?

326
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,290
Dinner's ready.

327
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,690
Ji Ho, wash your hands
and come with your grandma.

328
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,200
Let's get Grandma.

329
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,900
Put your slippers on. Let's go!

330
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,140
Mom, there's someone
I want you to meet.

331
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,010
That doctal?

332
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,480
Doctal?

333
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,880
The medical doctal.

334
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,610
You kept talking about him.

335
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,890
Mom, it's not doctal. It's doctor.

336
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,020
Doctor?

337
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,920
Whatever.

338
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,560
Why do you want me to meet him?

339
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,830
Wouldn't it be nice
to have a doctor as a son-in-law?

340
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,890
When you get older and fall ill,

341
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,260
your son-in-law, who's a doctor,
will take good care of you.

342
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,660
Isn't that the best?

343
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,030
So? What's he like?

344
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,370
Which hospital does he work at?

345
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,140
She'll make a huge scene
if I say she met him in the office.

346
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,710
So, I'll just let her meet him.

347
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,910
You should meet him and find out.

348
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,810
I know you'll like him.

349
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,620
Fine. Set up a date.

350
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,990
However, if I still don't like him,

351
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,620
you can't be with him.

352
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,820
Okay. But Mom,

353
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,490
don't tell Gi Chan about it.

354
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,030
Grandma, Auntie Yu Gyeong says
dinner is ready.

355
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,070
- All right. Let's go.
- Let's go.

356
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,640
All done.

357
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,170
What do you think, Bo Ram?

358
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,580
It's so pretty.

359
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,920
It looks pretty to me, too.

360
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,750
Is it because I'm getting older?
I want to make her hair look pretty,

361
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,320
but my hands won't work with me.

362
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,320
My friends are always jealous
of how pretty my hair looks.

363
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,590
Their mommies and grandmas...

364
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,190
can't do it like this.

365
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,330
Good for you, Bo Ram.

366
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,300
You have Ms. Kang here
to make your hair look so pretty.

367
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,340
I'm so happy that I have her here.

368
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,010
Ms. Kang, will you make
my hair look pretty every single day?

369
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,880
Of course,
I'll make it look pretty every day.

370
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,850
Okay.

371
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,880
Above all,
Bo Ram adores her like a mother,

372
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,220
and she doesn't seem
depressed anymore.

373
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,820
She shows such a big smile.
Aren't you grateful for her?

374
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,260
I also feel like
the emptiness of losing Do Hee is...

375
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,860
slowly healing,
thanks to her presence.

376
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,430
She needs a place to live,

377
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,530
and we need her.

378
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,400
Hey, you might run late.

379
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,800
You should get to work.

380
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,010
Yes, right.

381
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,980
Have a great day
at the kindergarten, Bo Ram.

382
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,640
And have fun with your friends, too.

383
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,910
Okay.

384
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,350
You want to believe only her claim
and use it to fire me?

385
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,190
Due to many recent events,

386
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,590
our rule is
to nip the problem in the bud...

387
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,630
if anything seems like
a potential threat to our business.

388
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,430
And you don't care
about innocent victims?

389
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,600
That's only your claim.

390
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,370
We don't know at this point
if you are an assailant or a victim.

391
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,630
That's what I mean.

392
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,170
At this point, nothing is certain,

393
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,540
yet you'll fire me?

394
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,210
Isn't that absurd?

395
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,710
Shouldn't the business
take the middle ground...

396
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,410
and see who's right or wrong?

397
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
Don't you know what it means
to nip something in the bud?

398
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,120
It doesn't matter what the truth is.

399
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,820
You've caused trouble,

400
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,350
so you must take responsibility
and leave.

401
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,190
Please let me talk
to the female employee.

402
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,060
I think that's the proper order.

403
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,990
Sadly, that can't happen.

404
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,300
She was greatly shocked
and couldn't live in Korea anymore.

405
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,130
I received a report that
she went back to her home abroad.

406
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,140
Was this your design...

407
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,170
to get rid of me?

408
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,180
So, this kind of dirty trick was...

409
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,050
the only way you could fire me?

410
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,880
Haven't you seen
the board on the intranet?

411
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,290
My female employees are
too frightened to go to the clinic.

412
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,920
We opened the clinic
as a part of our benefit,

413
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,390
but it's about to become infamous
as the hideout for a criminal.

414
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,830
Do you expect me
to sit and let this unfold?

415
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,170
I'm firing you right away,
so you must leave now.

416
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,570
Things won't go as you wish.

417
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,470
I'm not leaving like this.

418
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,770
My wish?

419
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,180
If you want to demand an answer,

420
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,580
bring hard proof of my involvement
instead of just your speculations.

421
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,180
And this isn't my wish.
All of YL wants you gone.

422
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,680
Do you understand?

423
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,520
What are you so afraid of?

424
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,490
I'll make sure I find the reason...

425
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,560
why I cannot stay in this company.

426
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,760
What's going on
between you and Kang Jae In?

427
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,140
You know she's the daughter
of the woman who killed your sister.

428
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,310
Why have you two become close
if you already know that?

429
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,480
You know the reason
better than I do.

430
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,050
So, you two will work together
to take me down?

431
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,990
Go ahead and try.

432
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,760
Only you'll end up wounded
each time you come at me,

433
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,500
just like this.

434
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,940
That's not her place?

435
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,440
This is a fake address.

436
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,250
I watched the place
over the last two nights,

437
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,210
but I haven't seen her here.

438
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,550
I understand.

439
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,560
The address
she turned in to HR was fake?

440
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,600
Mr. Kang.

441
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,840
Do you know
where Ms. Kang is staying now?

442
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,910
You must know as her brother.

443
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,510
Do you have poor eyesight?

444
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,480
If we looked close in your eyes,
you took it the wrong way.

445
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,490
I knew it was Gi Chan.

446
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

447
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,330
No, it's probably because of Do Hee.

448
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,570
She's been investigating
his corruption,

449
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,170
and it was also odd that they met
on the night of the accident.

450
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,170
I'm sure something is going on.

451
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,680
Please excuse me.

452
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,090
I've been away from the office
for too long.

453
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,420
Sure.

454
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,340
You must be surprised
that I called you out.

455
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,510
No, it's okay.

456
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,650
Please give me some more time...

457
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,250
I don't know anything
about who you really are.

458
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,320
I never knew that
you were the daughter of YL Group.

459
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,090
I don't even know
who your mother is.

460
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,590
I don't know anything.

461
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,430
I'll consider everything forgotten,
so take your time...

462
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,600
That wasn't what I meant.

463
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,340
You don't have to rush yourself.

464
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,110
You can leave once you find...

465
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,640
a decent place to stay.

466
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,780
Thank you.

467
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm not saying this
to have you thank me.

468
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,480
It may sound contradictory,

469
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,790
but I'm doing this
for Yun Hee and Bo Ram.

470
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,920
I know Yun Hee will collapse...

471
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,720
if she finds out who you are.

472
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,630
But I also know that
you've filled Do Hee's vacancy...

473
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,730
and helped comfort her, too.

474
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,730
That's why.

475
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,270
What I dread the most is...

476
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,980
seeing my sister cry miserably.

477
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,410
So, please don't hurt...

478
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,480
Yun Hee and Bo Ram.

479
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,520
I won't.

480
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,260
Let me ask you one thing.

481
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,270
I know you're YL's daughter.

482
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,370
So, why did Director Kang Mi Ran...

483
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,400
step in and tell the media...

484
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,500
that the woman named
Kang Se Ri was her niece?

485
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,210
It's kind of embarrassing,

486
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,410
but after many ups and downs,

487
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,550
we fell out
and became worse than strangers.

488
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,220
Her priority is YL Group.

489
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,390
She probably had to abandon me...

490
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,590
to protect the things she had.

491
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,630
Even so,
she even lied about her niece?

492
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,800
This is worse
than a feud between siblings.

493
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,570
The stock price went up...

494
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,040
after her interview.

495
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,980
Kang Mi Ran,
she's still as cold-hearted as ever.

496
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,720
Where's my coffee?

497
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,820
I got new coffee beans.

498
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,560
I hope you'll like it.

499
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,700
It's not so bad.

500
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,240
Ms. Choi, how was
your experience at work?

501
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,010
Don't you know already?

502
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,280
My entire body ached all night,
so I couldn't even sleep well.

503
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,880
People kept pouring into
that tiny little restaurant.

504
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,220
The owner is a great cook.

505
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,450
I also frequented before,

506
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,520
but then somehow
ended up working there.

507
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,630
And I don't like...

508
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,060
how strangers who aren't my family
keep calling me auntie.

509
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,830
Well, customers are
trying to be more friendly...

510
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,470
You can feel free
to keep working there.

511
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,700
That kind of physical labor is
only for those who have done it.

512
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,310
I can't do this.

513
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,110
Let the owner know, too.

514
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,250
Yes, I'll tell her.

515
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,420
Dr. Kim Do Yun
uploaded this on the intranet.

516
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,930
(A clarification of my position
regarding the termination notice)

517
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,030
All we have is
the victim's one-sided statement,

518
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,630
and the ruling hasn't been made.

519
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,970
So, he states it was unfair
to receive a termination notice.

520
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,140
He was arrested in action.

521
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,070
You can disregard this.

522
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,840
I want to do that, too.

523
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,310
But you had told him to quit
before this happened.

524
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,650
Is that true?

525
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,550
His relationship
with Jae In bothered me,

526
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,220
so I couldn't keep it in
and had blurted it out once.

527
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,820
Even then, he threatened me
by bringing up the company's image.

528
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,620
Things got complicated.

529
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,530
He was previously urged to resign
from his office by the chairman,

530
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,800
so he claimed he was
unfairly terminated once again.

531
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,430
He even reported this
to the Ministry of Labor.

532
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,000
He claims he's innocent,

533
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,300
so he'll call reporters, blow this up,
and clear his name.

534
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,840
The employees are torn,
but if this gets reported,

535
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,410
we'll suffer from a big loss
before our big investment.

536
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,810
It doesn't matter
what the reason is,

537
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,520
but calling him here personally
and saying that is out of line.

538
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,220
I can't have you as a chairman...

539
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,720
if you use it
only to abuse your power.

540
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,190
You better be careful.

541
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,820
I'll pay more attention.

542
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,600
It's better to put him on leave
until the suit comes to an end.

543
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,140
I'll meet with Dr. Kim Do Yun.

544
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,200
Goodbye.

545
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,120
So, I'll be put on leave
until the trial is over?

546
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,390
That's right.

547
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,560
And your position at the clinic...

548
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,890
will remain open
until the result comes out.

549
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,830
You can be reinstated right away
as soon as you're found innocent.

550
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,270
And of course, this case
should not be known to the media...

551
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,130
until the ruling is out.

552
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,670
What do you think?

553
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,310
I did my best to show you
the biggest consideration.

554
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,640
My false accusation
hasn't been cleared,

555
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,250
but this is much more reasonable
than a termination notice.

556
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,090
Is it all right for me to ask you
to sign a document...

557
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,520
to confide in each other?

558
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,470
(Written Confirmation)

559
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,900
(This confirmation is made
between YL Group and Kim Do Yun.)

560
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,310
Grandma, you should wash your hands.

561
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,450
You have to wash your hands clean...

562
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,220
when you come home
to make sure you don't get sick.

563
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,260
You have to do it like this...

564
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,220
and not miss a spot.

565
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,930
All right.

566
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,930
I'll wash my hands
after I look at these,

567
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,730
so you can go first.

568
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,860
Okay.

569
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,630
The electricity bill is pretty high.

570
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,970
The postman said this was for Do Yun,
so I did take it.

571
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,560
"Addressee, YL Group."

572
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,670
"Dr. Kim Do Yun,
a physician at the clinic center,"

573
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,370
"faces allegations of threatening,
sexually assaulting,"

574
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,270
"and physically attacking
Park Ji Su,"

575
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,340
"a female employee who visited
the clinic for counseling."

576
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,050
"A criminal complaint was filed,
as well as a civil suit..."

577
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,650
"seeking compensation
for emotional distress."

578
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,280
I'm back.

579
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,090
I'm back, too.

580
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,420
Where's Bo Ram?

581
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,890
What is this?

582
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,330
What?

583
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,930
Do you work for YL Group?

584
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,600
I'm asking you.

585
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,610
Do you work for YL Group?

586
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,560
(Queen's House)

587
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,760
How can you crumble...

588
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,530
after falling into one trap
that Jae In set up?

589
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,660
Did you have
this little faith in me?

590
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,800
He'll continue to act like this...

591
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,900
until Mr. Hong tells him
who the guy in the wedding photo is.

592
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,240
Mom, please stop.

593
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,740
What's wrong?

594
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,810
You need to quit.

595
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,080
You need to quit right away
if you don't want to see me die.

596
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,080
Go ahead and give it your best.

597
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,320
Hwang Gi Chan.

598
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,490
I'll pull you down
to the darkest place of the abyss,

599
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,790
so stop acting up
and just sit quietly.

600
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,590
