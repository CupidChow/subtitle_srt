1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,310
(Episode 31)

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,960
Do I look weird?

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,160
No.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,390
I wouldn't say it's weird.
You just seem strange.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,600
Then, it's a success.
No one should recognize me.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,170
Good morning, Prince Do Yun.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,800
I brought your morning coffee.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,540
Gosh, something smells.

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,740
Come on in.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,010
Is that coffee for me?

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,310
Yes, of course, Dr. Kim.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,250
It's always been my wish to share
a cup of morning coffee with you.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,980
Anyway, you have a guest here.

17
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,520
Yes, you should meet her.

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,020
Her name is Geum Ja, a counselor
who'll work with me starting today.

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,890
She'll work with you?

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,400
In this office?

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,900
Just you and her? Dang it.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,700
Hello.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,900
It's nice to meet you.

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,940
Wait, Jae In?

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,680
Do you know Geum Ja?

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,780
No, I've never met her.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,920
Did you call me Jae In?

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,350
She looks like
my ex-sister-in-law...

29
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,590
No, I must be mistaken.

30
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,460
She can't be Jae In,

31
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,500
but she looks like her.

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,700
Dr. Kim, don't you know the ex-wife
of Chairman Hwang, my brother?

33
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,070
Doesn't she look like her?

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,300
I don't know.

35
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,940
I don't see it.

36
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,170
Not at all.

37
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,810
- No, she does...
- Thanks for the coffee.

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,980
Well, one of them was for me.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,950
I have to see a patient soon.
Let's take a rain check.

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,180
Please hold this.

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,920
Now, the lady leaves first.

42
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,420
Then, please excuse me.

43
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,430
Are you sure about this?

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,260
I just turned the first corner.

45
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,070
I'll have to face this.

46
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,770
A blind contest?

47
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,270
I can't run Planning and Design
just with Ms. Kang Se Ri on the team.

48
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,640
We'll collaborate
with the existing design team,

49
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,780
but we can work much faster
if we had another team member.

50
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,650
We can just hire
someone with experience.

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,820
Do we have to open a blind contest?

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,490
I don't want to regret anything
after hiring someone.

53
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,460
I don't want to know
their education, age,

54
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,230
experience, or qualifications.
I just want someone talented.

55
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,560
If you think that's the best way,
then please go ahead.

56
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,660
I want to provide the opportunity
to the entire company,

57
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,930
so I'll upload the notice.

58
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,470
Gi Chan, do you know
who I just ran into?

59
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,170
If you saw her,
you'd also be so surprised...

60
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,410
and might even faint.

61
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,610
She was like my ex-sister-in-law...

62
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,670
Jae In is here?

63
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,210
No, it's not that.

64
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,840
She wasn't Jae In.

65
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,650
- She looked like her...
- Ms. Kang Na Ra.

66
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,210
We're at work,

67
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,780
and I'm in a meeting right now.

68
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,280
Keep the chit-chat at home.

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,890
No, this isn't just chit-chat...

70
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,790
Fine. I'll leave.

71
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,060
I'm sorry about that.

72
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,200
She hasn't had
much experience at work,

73
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,000
so she doesn't understand
professionalism yet.

74
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,570
If we're done discussing,
let's call it a day.

75
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,270
Then, let me discuss
something more private.

76
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,280
Seung Woo went
to the prosecution today.

77
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,850
They had to question him again
as a testifier.

78
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,250
Is that so?

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,180
Another interrogation...

80
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,850
won't change anything.

81
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:36,990
It's just a procedure,

82
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,220
so just tell him to state
everything he knows.

83
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,430
You already know who the culprit is.

84
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,030
You got here early.

85
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,270
What brings you here without a call?

86
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,170
Don't you know already?

87
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,170
Will you keep working here?

88
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,580
Come and sit down.
I have something to tell you.

89
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,550
I didn't want to make you worry
by telling you this.

90
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,060
But actually,
I lost a lot of money...

91
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,290
after making a bad investment.

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,230
Did Gi Man urge you to invest?

93
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,400
No, he doesn't know anything.

94
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,900
I did it on my own.

95
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,430
I got a bit greedy,
trying to get ready for my retirement.

96
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,170
Was that why you moved?

97
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,240
But my situation isn't too bad,
so don't worry about me.

98
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,980
I'll begin to get my pension
in a few years,

99
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,880
and I've taken up a job, too.

100
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,710
There's no problem
for me to live my life.

101
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,150
All right.

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,620
I understand your situation,
so please quit your job.

103
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,720
I'll be your provider.

104
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,360
How much do you need?

105
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
Hello?

106
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,460
I want some coffee.

107
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,800
What do I do?

108
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,270
By any chance,
do you enjoy drip coffee?

109
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,940
First, open up the cabinet
above the sink.

110
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,540
No, the one on the right.

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,190
Oh, my. Hello.

112
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,090
You must be here to see your father.

113
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,720
Don't you remember me?

114
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,230
You know, last time,

115
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,700
you once came
to eat fried chicken with him.

116
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,430
You two seemed to have
such a great dad-daughter relationship.

117
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,430
Yes.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,570
May I ask you for a favor?

119
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,410
Sure, what is it?

120
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,240
Please ask my dad to quit his job.

121
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,080
May I ask what the reason is?

122
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,950
I hope
you don't take it the wrong way,

123
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,820
but he isn't a man
who belongs to a place like this.

124
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,420
Is that your only reason?

125
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,560
Yes.

126
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,700
Then, I'll pretend like
I never heard you.

127
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,570
I would've cooperated
if you had a good reason.

128
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,070
Your dad has fun at work.

129
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,070
Well, ma'am.

130
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,310
I know.

131
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,610
It must feel awful as a daughter
to see him do this.

132
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,080
He obviously seemed like
he worked at a big corporation.

133
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,510
The young may not understand...

134
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,050
because you're still young.

135
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,520
I realized only after I've aged...

136
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,920
that it was a blessing to be able
to work even after retiring.

137
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,890
Why don't you respect
your father's decision?

138
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,190
I don't appreciate
what you just said.

139
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,290
You don't even know the whole story,

140
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,700
yet you're suggesting
that I'm making my dad unhappy.

141
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,270
No, that wasn't what I meant.

142
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,330
Hey, honey.

143
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,000
Hello.

144
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,340
I wouldn't have gone to the hospital
if I knew you were here.

145
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,840
I went there with your lunch,
but no one was there, so I returned.

146
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,240
Are you here to see me?

147
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,080
No, right.
You're here to see Father.

148
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,510
I'm late. I have to go.

149
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,250
Please excuse me.

150
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,290
Honey. Hello.

151
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,490
Take your lunch, honey!

152
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,760
I knew the two men were
oddly friendly with each other.

153
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,530
They were a father-in-law
and his son-in-law.

154
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,210
At times, she looks like her,
but at other times, she doesn't.

155
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,510
Maybe not.

156
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,910
But my mom said
I must always check everything,

157
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,050
so I'll check.

158
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,580
If she's Jae In,
I'll ask Gi Chan for a new bag.

159
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,450
What are you doing over there?

160
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,690
My gosh.

161
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,260
Where's Dr. Kim?

162
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,360
Why are you here alone?

163
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,830
It's lunch, so he must be out
doing something personal.

164
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,800
My gosh. I love your glasses.

165
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,400
Give me those. I want to try them.

166
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,630
The prescription is
probably different.

167
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,240
She looks even more like Jae In
without the glasses,

168
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,810
except for her thick lips.

169
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,020
My gosh.
You must have awful eyesight.

170
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,180
I almost ruined my sight
after a second with those on.

171
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,990
I can finally see better.

172
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,500
You need to stop spraying that.

173
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,060
No one puts on that much perfume.

174
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,940
I feel more confident
when I wear perfume.

175
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,970
You must be popular, Na Ra.

176
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,370
You're very pretty.

177
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,740
Well, I guess I'm pretty.

178
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,880
I know that.

179
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,950
I'm just like you.

180
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,020
Everyone only stares at me
whenever I go out,

181
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,220
so I get self-conscious
and put on more perfume.

182
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,720
Life can be tiring
when you're too popular.

183
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,290
Right?

184
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,830
My gosh. People can be delusional
in all kinds of ways.

185
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,030
Dr. Kim also said...

186
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,800
I was full of charm.

187
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,270
Dr. Kim? Dr. Kim Do Yun?

188
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,840
Hey, wait.

189
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,010
Since when have you known Dr. Kim?

190
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,180
No, how did you get a job here?

191
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,380
Was it Dr. Kim?

192
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,510
Wait, are you two dating?

193
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,580
How can you say
something that awful?

194
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,150
I have really high standards for men.

195
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,420
I feel bad for Dr. Kim,

196
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,790
but he's not my type.

197
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,630
What a liar.

198
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,860
He's such a great guy.

199
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,200
You have feelings for him, right?

200
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,340
How did you know?

201
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,970
Is it that obvious?

202
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,040
Do you want me to help you?

203
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,580
You always need a sidekick...

204
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,150
to fan the flames of love
to make your love more passionate.

205
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,020
You and Dr. Kim would make
such a cute couple.

206
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,620
Geum Ja, do you want some coffee?

207
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,990
It's on me. Are you up for it?

208
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,020
I am.

209
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,390
I see. You always had curly hair?

210
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,100
I'd get my hair straightened,

211
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,470
but it wouldn't even last a month
before it gets curly again.

212
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,340
I just gave up.

213
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,570
Let me see your hair.

214
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,940
It's so dry and stiff.

215
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,710
Jae In had such smooth hair,
thanks to her expensive shampoo.

216
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,380
Geum Ja, do you feel cold?

217
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,490
No.

218
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,490
Then, why are you wearing gloves?

219
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
These?

220
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,890
It's a secret.

221
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,630
I'll just share it with you.

222
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,340
Are you serious?

223
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,010
It's a secret.

224
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,140
It's past my lunchtime.
I have to go.

225
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,210
Me, too.

226
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,450
There's too much work
for the chairman's secretary.

227
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,250
Right. You have to tell me
what I asked you for. Okay?

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,120
It's his first official appearance
after becoming the chairman.

233
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
Assisting him is a part
of the management, so do your best.

234
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,720
Of course.

235
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,860
I can smell
a heavy scent of perfume.

236
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,930
Just pretend like
you didn't notice it.

237
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,700
Let's go.

(Blind Interior Design Contest:

239
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,180
Hello, Mr. Do?

240
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,910
I'm sorry, Ms. Jung.

241
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,650
Something came up at home.

242
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,920
Don't worry about me and go home.

243
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,420
Your daughter must be waiting.

244
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,090
I'll see you tomorrow.

245
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,120
Goodbye.

246
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,930
His phone was going off
all day long.

247
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,100
Goodness, I understand
how she feels as a daughter,

248
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,400
so I should just accept it.

249
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,400
But I'll probably need some help.

250
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,070
Hey, Yun Hee.

251
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,140
What brings you here?

252
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,010
Min Jun said it'd be exhausting
for you to work alone,

253
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,240
so he called me for help.

254
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,580
Min Jun?

255
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,080
Your part-timer, Min Jun.

256
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,510
He's on the older side,

257
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,280
so I didn't want to treat him
like a subordinate.

258
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,550
We decided
to be on a first-name basis.

259
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,190
Anyway, where do I begin?

260
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Well, you can take the phone call.

261
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,560
Okay.

262
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,530
Hello? You've reached
Bo Ram's Fried Chicken.

263
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,210
Look at this awful place.

264
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,380
How did I end up in this situation?

265
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,190
Did I keep you waiting?

266
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,520
Have you had dinner?

267
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,860
No one is here to prepare it for me.

268
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,490
How am I supposed to eat?

269
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,630
Mom.

270
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,700
I told you not to call Jae In,
but you did?

271
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,530
She was worried...

272
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,870
about where you were staying.

273
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,210
You could've just said
I was doing well.

274
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,170
Showing my awful situation
won't help in any way...

275
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,780
Mom, we need to talk.

276
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,740
Where is she staying?

277
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,150
Forget it.

278
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,910
I have nothing to say to you. Go.

279
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,720
I told you to let go of me.
What's with you?

280
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,760
I have nothing to say to you.
Go home.

281
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,630
Mom, pull yourself together.

282
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,830
What did you just say?

283
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,300
Pull myself together?

284
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,670
Yes.

285
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,070
Yes?

286
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,910
Why have you fallen this low?

287
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,210
How dare you tell your mother
to pull herself together?

288
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,150
Hasn't the reality set in?

289
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,020
This isn't your place, is it?

290
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,150
So what?

291
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,550
This is Director Do Min Jun's place.

292
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,950
He wanted to protect you
when you had nowhere to go...

293
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,120
and let you stay at his place.

294
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,390
Aren't you grateful for him?

295
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,560
How can you order him around
like he was your inferior?

296
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,630
Have you forgotten?

297
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,030
He had a great life to this day,
all thanks to us.

298
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,770
Think of the salary he received
while working for YL Group.

299
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,070
I'll pay him back as soon as I get back
on my feet, so don't mind this.

300
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,470
Mom, have you looked in a mirror?

301
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,170
Do you know how lowly...

302
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,580
and hideous you have become?

303
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,910
Jae In!

304
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,880
Apologize to Mr. Do.

305
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,780
That's what you call dignity.

306
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,180
You're such an evil brat.

307
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,420
Did you come here to tell me...

308
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,390
I was hideous...

309
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,820
and lowly?

310
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,030
The least you can do is
give me your consolation,

311
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,400
but you blurt out curses instead.

312
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,930
You couldn't say that to me
if you understood how I felt.

313
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,770
I only wanted to protect you,
the foolish girl,

314
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,140
because you were my daughter.

315
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,470
I bet...

316
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,240
everything I had for you.

317
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,810
All I was left with...

318
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,150
was this old body and empty hands.

319
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,520
And now,
my own family has abandoned me,

320
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,450
my child holds me in disdain,

321
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,560
and I live off another person.

322
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,090
I understand how you feel.

323
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,130
I despise your father to death...

324
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,160
and you, too.

325
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,860
You...

326
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,370
and your father ruined...

327
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,470
Ruined...

328
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,680
She fell asleep.

329
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,980
I was going to clean it up.
Did you get to it first?

330
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,790
There wasn't much to do.

331
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,720
Please let me apologize
on her behalf.

332
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,720
I'm sorry for everything.

333
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,730
All right.
You don't have to mind her too much.

334
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,230
She'll slowly adapt to her new life.

335
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,700
It'll be impossible
to find Attorney Seo, right?

336
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,470
It won't be easy.

337
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,440
He already fled overseas.

338
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,940
I have a feeling
Gi Chan is behind this.

339
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,510
Attorney Seo's scheme
against my mom made me suspicious,

340
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,480
and it seemed like
he only pretended...

341
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,180
to file the suit to invalidate
the divorce, but he didn't.

342
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,150
Yes.

343
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,890
Before we continue,
are you doing all right?

344
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,190
Yes.

345
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,930
Ms. Kim Do Hee's older brother...

346
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,530
didn't seem like a wicked man.

347
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,530
But I'm concerned...

348
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,500
that he lets you live at his place,
knowing who you are.

349
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,300
Are you sure about this?

350
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,810
Only Dr. Kim knows.
Not his other family.

351
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,740
We decided to keep it quiet
for a while.

352
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,310
What if they found out?

353
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,650
Why don't you stay here?

354
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,650
Ms. Choi would like that, too.

355
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,150
It'll be harder for her
to stay with me.

356
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,460
Mr. Do, I'm sorry to ask,

357
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,660
but please look after her
for a while.

358
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,530
I'll move her out right away
as soon as I find a place.

359
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,300
Okay.

360
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,900
I'll look after Ms. Choi,

361
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,440
so don't worry about her.

362
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,400
Thank you, Mr. Do.

363
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,640
I don't have anything to wear.

364
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,480
What are you doing
this late in the night?

365
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,290
I must look presentable
as the chairman's wife,

366
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,790
but I have nothing to wear.

367
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,920
Should I get you an outfit
when I go out to shop?

368
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,190
- Are we going somewhere?
- The luncheon.

369
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,930
Director Kang told me.

370
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
Can you tell me
about these meetings in advance?

371
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,900
I have to get prepared.

372
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,140
I can't keep pretending like
I know something when I don't.

373
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,940
I'm going to the luncheon alone.

374
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,240
I only took office recently,
so I want to be cautious.

375
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,810
Are you still trying to treat me
like I was a shadow?

376
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,710
How long will this go on? How long?

377
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,950
Be quiet. You'll wake our family.

378
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm your wife.

379
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,620
Why am I not allowed to go there?

380
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,920
I wanted to be careful
to keep people from gossiping.

381
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,060
Exactly.

382
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,660
What if you go there alone,
although you're married?

383
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,290
That'll become a hotter gossip.

384
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,600
You have to present me
as your wife to the world...

385
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,930
for me to be your real wife.

386
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,600
I don't want to hide anymore.

387
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,240
I get what you mean,

388
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,610
but hang in there
until the business is stable.

389
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,280
Jae In assisted me like a shadow.

390
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,110
She never came to official meetings
other than family gatherings.

391
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,220
I need to get some water.

392
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,120
What's he saying?

393
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,690
Is he telling me to live
just as Jae In did?

394
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,260
I have to go, Yun Hee.

395
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,660
I have to send a document.

396
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,830
You should go.

397
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,970
I'll wrap up quickly and leave, too.

398
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,700
- Okay. Bye, then.
- Bye.

399
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,910
Goodness. It's like war here.

400
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,510
Goodness. Excuse me.

401
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,880
I thought I saw your brother here.

402
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,320
Where is he?

403
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,220
He went home.

404
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,060
Why are you looking for him?

405
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,760
- Ms. Kitchen Place Owner.
- Kitchen?

406
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,960
I mean, cock-a-doodle-doo.

407
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,770
Those animals are called kitchens.

408
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,870
Kitchen.

409
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,370
Right. You mean chicken?

410
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,210
Darn it.

411
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,180
Yes, chicken.

412
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,050
I just said chicken.
Didn't you hear me?

413
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,480
You must be losing
your sense of hearing.

414
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,490
Anyway, let's grab a drink
as old friends from that poor town.

415
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,290
This is a bottle
of ten-year-old wild ginseng wine.

416
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,300
Why did Mother go over there?

417
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,770
Whatever.

418
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,570
There are no customers,
so I'll close early and go home!

419
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,110
Welcome.

420
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,180
I'd like pig's feet, please.

421
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,810
Seung Woo?

422
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,220
Yes, right.

423
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,650
I want pig's feet and soju.

424
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,390
Yes, sure. Okay.

425
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,230
Well, I guess it's awkward
for us to greet each other.

426
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,860
Okay.

427
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,100
Hey, Yu Gyeong. It's me.

428
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,740
Where are you?

429
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,210
Can you come here?

430
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,950
I heard this place made
good pig's feet, so I came here,

431
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,680
and I think it's your business.

432
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,220
You were certified
in all those licenses at once,

433
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,260
and now you began to study
for an MBA degree?

434
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,020
I applied to the program
just in case,

435
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,490
and I got lucky.

436
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,100
This just means
you're way too smart.

437
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,260
Anyway, I hope
you aren't straining yourself.

438
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,700
It's a domestic program,

439
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,770
so I can study while I work.
It's not so bad.

440
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,170
My gosh. You were the type of kid
who'd tell people...

441
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,510
that studying was so easy.

442
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,810
How's everything going
with your meetings?

443
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,280
I spent many of my years abroad,

444
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,050
so my connections are
as vast as the Pacific Ocean.

445
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,620
Everything is smooth sailing.

446
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,350
I'll open up
the Korean branch very soon, too.

447
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,590
Just put your faith in me.

448
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,020
I had no idea your business abroad
was that substantial.

449
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,530
I had to manage
the huge amount of money I made...

450
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:39,100
as I traveled between countries
as a navigator,

451
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,770
and I also wanted to let go
of my ancient inferiority complex,

452
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,370
so I began that business,
which ended up snowballing.

453
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,740
Don't even get me started.

454
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,250
I did just about everything
to make a living for my children.

455
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,850
There's nothing I haven't done.

456
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,580
I'm sick and tired of those days.

457
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,550
Tell me about it.

458
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,720
But as people say,
the living somehow lives on,

459
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,120
and I somehow did go on.

460
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,260
I still don't understand
how I held out that dark time.

461
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,260
What dark time?

462
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,860
The time when the old house
in the poor town was set on fire.

463
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,870
My husband passed away in vain...

464
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,440
because of that fire,

465
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,240
so we ended up out on the street
without a penny in our pocket.

466
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,310
And that winter was harsh.

467
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,980
My children began to tremble...

468
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,850
whenever the biting wind blew.

469
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,920
Goodness. My face was
covered in tears and snot,

470
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,420
and even those froze up
in that cold weather.

471
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,220
You must've been through a lot.

472
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,230
At times,

473
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,900
I'd sit and wonder
how that fire began.

474
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,640
How did it begin?

475
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,240
Do you want water?

476
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,040
No.

477
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,620
I'm fine now. I'm okay.

478
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,390
I shudder in fright...

479
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,430
whenever I hear something
about a fire.

480
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,860
Gosh, let's stop talking about
the old times.

481
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,070
Here, have another drink.

482
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,400
Cheers.

483
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,380
I must've had too much to drink.
I feel tipsy.

484
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,350
Come on. People grab a drink...

485
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,380
to feel that tipsiness.

486
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,120
My gosh.

487
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,060
I suddenly began to talk casually
while talking about our history.

488
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,860
I'm sorry, Ms. Kitchen Place...

489
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,430
No, Ms. Chicken Place Owner.

490
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,730
Stop it.

491
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,770
I remember you were
about 5 to 6 years older than me.

492
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,740
Darn it. Let's not even bring up...

493
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,740
or question our ages.

494
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,970
Let's just be friends.

495
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,780
Is the man who's running your business
your eldest son?

496
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,920
Darn it. She keeps hitting a sore spot.

497
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,150
Your daughter-in-law
seemed like a decent woman.

498
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,690
You must be pleased with them.

499
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,160
So? Did your children grow up well?

500
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,400
My eldest is a doctor,

501
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:31,270
and my daughter passed away
after her father in a car accident.

502
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,570
I'm sorry.

503
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,110
She was such a pretty girl...

504
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,140
with huge eyes and a sharp nose.

505
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,380
Is Na Ra doing well?

506
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,150
She's a secretary
at a big corporation.

507
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,920
It must be reassuring to know
all your children have settled down.

508
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,920
But I don't have a reliable
and handsomely tall brother like you.

509
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,040
I should've talked to my children
into getting married, too.

510
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,610
It would've been fun...

511
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,880
to work across the hall
from my in-laws.

512
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,810
Oh Seong.

513
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,320
Come here.

514
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,090
- Oh Seong...
- Right. You've never said hello,

515
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,630
although you worked
right across the hall from your in-law.

516
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,860
My gosh.

517
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,870
I want to grab a drink, too.

518
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,410
But my customer won't leave.

519
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,710
No. Hey, I'll be there.

520
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,110
I'll be there soon,
so pour my drink.

521
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,350
Pour my drink now. Bye.

522
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,180
Are you here to see me?

523
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,950
No.

524
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,020
Seung Woo called.

525
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,390
He didn't even say hi to me.

526
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,290
Hey, I have to go somewhere
in a hurry.

527
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,560
When he's done,
just leave everything,

528
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,060
lock the door, and go. Okay?

529
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,630
I'm sorry. I have to go.

530
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,200
Hey...

531
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,510
Hey, Yu Gyeong. You really came.

532
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,590
Will you pour me one, too?

533
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,430
I called you here to be a friend.

534
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,300
Are you going to make me
pour drinks for you?

535
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,640
What's going on?

536
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,810
You never drink alone
unless something stresses you out.

537
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,980
I went to the prosecution today.

538
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,450
They're reinvestigating...

539
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,720
Ms. Kim Do Hee's
hit-and-run accident.

540
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,120
They kept asking me
the same thing...

541
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,920
over and over again.

542
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,430
I went there because they said
it was a supplement investigation.

543
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:13,300
They kept asking
if I really didn't see my mom driving,

544
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,870
if she really hit her,

545
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,130
and why I got a new car.

546
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,600
And once again,

547
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,670
I had to tell them
about the things I did...

548
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,440
on the day of the accident,

549
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,150
starting with the morning
until the next day,

550
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,980
including where I was,
who I was with, and what I did.

551
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,750
But...

552
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,850
I kept getting confused
after repeating those a few times.

553
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,630
Perhaps...

554
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,300
I might have killed her.

555
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,060
No.

556
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,830
I believe you.

557
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,170
Don't get scared,
and just tell them what you know.

558
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,110
It wasn't you.

559
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,480
I resent that woman to death.

560
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,110
Why did she...

561
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,350
Why did she do this to me?

562
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,190
(Aunt)

563
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,230
My gosh.

564
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,030
Goodness.

565
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,300
I haven't had this much to drink in ages,
and it's killing me.

566
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,940
Toward the end,
I thought she said something...

567
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,040
about having fun with someone
and saying hi to somebody.

568
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,750
Whatever. My head hurts.

569
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,650
What if Geum Ja dies?

570
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,820
It's too early for this nonsense.
Who's dying?

571
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,890
Mom, I saw this woman at work,

572
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,030
and it was Jae In.

573
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,630
Who came where?

574
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,000
Darn it. Lead the way.

575
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,430
You have to hear me out
until the end.

576
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,800
I thought she was Jae In,

577
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,640
but she was just a lookalike.

578
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,140
Does she look that much like her?

579
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,570
If that was so,
I would've noticed her, too.

580
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,540
They only look a bit similar.

581
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,980
The way she talks and the things she likes
are completely different.

582
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,750
But what if
she really runs into Jae In?

583
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,850
One of the doppelgängers will die
if they meet each other.

584
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,950
Na Ra.

585
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,150
Stop talking nonsense,
and get ready for work.

586
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,820
Fine.

587
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,290
Make sure you call me
if Jae In shows up.

588
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,990
I'll teach her a lesson first...

589
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,400
before the doppel-whatever shows up.

590
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,910
Good morning.

591
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,810
Good morning.

592
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,310
Mr. Kang, wake up.

593
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,410
Just leave him.

594
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,580
We still have 15 minutes left.
You can wake him up later.

595
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,260
She's so caring about her nephew.

596
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,570
Na Ra, you're the secretary
to the chairman,

597
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,340
so you must get busy
whenever he's busy.

598
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,870
It seemed like...

599
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,840
Dr. Kim wanted
to grab a meal with you sometime.

600
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,440
I'm totally free.
I can even go today.

601
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,510
The chairman has to go out
for lunch on business.

602
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,080
I have to take this.

603
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,820
What is this smell?

604
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,460
- Change your perfume now.
- It's not mine.

605
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,590
Get Secretary Yoon ready.
I'm leaving for a meeting.

606
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,890
And I don't care what the reason is.
Change that perfume.

607
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,230
It's not mine!

608
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,800
Dang it.

609
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,100
I have to go, Na Ra.

610
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,110
Make sure you tell Dr. Kim...

611
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,340
that I'm totally free today!

612
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,890
They're holding
a blind design contest.

613
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,820
They want to offer this chance,
so I'm going to go for it.

614
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,360
I'm sure it'll go well for you.

615
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,160
How did it go with Hwang Na Ra?

616
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,400
Gi Chan has a meeting outside
at lunch today.

617
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,900
Can you do this for me?

618
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,670
Are you sure you can do this alone?

619
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,170
I must find the evidence
as soon as I can.

620
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,350
Hello?

621
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,950
My gosh, Dr. Kim.

622
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,120
I can. Yes, I can go.

623
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,720
Where are we meeting?

624
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,750
I'll be downstairs now. Okay.

625
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,510
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

626
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,950
(Wrong password. Please try again.)

627
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,760
(Wrong password. Please try again.)

628
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,360
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

629
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,790
(Queen's House)

630
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,190
How did Mother find out?

631
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,290
That?

632
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,720
I called your father,

633
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,820
and some woman picked up,
so I asked why a woman was at his...

634
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,860
He's seeing a woman?

635
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,260
You saw Mr. Do?

636
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,100
I don't know what he discussed
with Hwang Gi Chan,

637
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,400
but I was a bit concerned.

638
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,640
Are you sure you can trust him?

639
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,840
The CEO of DH Holdings,

640
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,470
Patrick Jung?

641
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,640
You must know who I am.

642
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,310
My name is Hwang Gi Chan,
YL Group's chairman.

643
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,980
Nice to meet you.
My name is Patrick.
