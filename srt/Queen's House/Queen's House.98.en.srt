1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,010
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,780
Drag all of this trash
out of my house.

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,380
And every last one
of their belongings too!

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,950
Gi Chan...

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
No, you can't.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,590
- Mom!
- Mom.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,990
- Mom.
- I'm not leaving. I won't go!

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,430
Where am I supposed to go?
This is my house.

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,660
You want me to call the cops
and have you dragged out of here?

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,800
Hello? Is this the police?

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,210
A woman is trespassing in my house.
Please come arrest her right away.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,410
If I press charges for trespassing,
what's the sentence?

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,250
Three years in prison?

16
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,480
The address is Changpyeong-dong...

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,790
Shut your mouth!

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,950
You...

19
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,560
Goodness. Oh, no.

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,830
I'm not leaving! I won't go!

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,930
I won't go!

22
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,270
I'm not leaving! I won't go!

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,170
Darn it! Darn you all!

24
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,050
Dad.

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,050
The house you left for me.

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,620
I've finally gotten it back.

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,060
I'll never...

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,260
I'll never let anyone
take it from me again.

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,410
This looks like trash.
What should I do with it?

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,450
What kind of stain is this?

31
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,320
It looks like blood.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,520
Was this hidden here?

33
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,170
Gi Chan.

34
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,470
Are we really living here now?

35
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,870
Yes.

36
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,010
They froze our accounts,
so I couldn't get any money out.

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,810
This was all I could afford
with the cash I had on me.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,210
I doubt even a quarter of our stuff
from Changpyeong-dong will fit.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
What are we going to do?

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,220
Since the place is too small,

41
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,220
we won't be able to use
most of our furniture or appliances.

42
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,860
We'll just have to buy
what we need secondhand.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,430
It'll be rough,
but just bear with it.

44
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,300
Okay.

45
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,730
Gi Chan,
we're not totally ruined, are we?

46
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,510
For now,
just go get us something to eat.

47
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,340
Okay.

48
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,750
My goodness...

49
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,790
Dear deities...

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,420
How could this have happened to us?

51
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,400
I worked so hard to make that money!

52
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,970
I worked myself to the bone,

53
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,070
scraping together every last penny!

54
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,370
Did you report that tramp Se Ri
to the cops?

55
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,240
What did I tell you?

56
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,950
Didn't I warn you
about the women you meet?

57
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,220
You brought home some
good-for-nothing tramp,

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
and now look at this mess!
Just look!

59
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,630
Hello? Detective?

60
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,630
Any updates?
Did you catch the con artists?

61
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,870
No.

62
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,470
There are no security cameras
in the office either.

63
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,010
The part-timer posing as the agent
and the buyer's representative.

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,940
It's obvious they were all
in on it together.

65
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,480
Isn't this a full-blown fraud ring?

66
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,320
I'll call you back.

67
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,520
If they were kicked out
of the house,

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,960
that means con artists took over.

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,760
Why didn't I think of that?

70
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,300
(Seller: Hwang Ji Ho,
Buyer: Kang Jae In)

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,900
What's this?

72
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,340
The buyer's name is Kang Jae In?

73
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,970
But when I checked the document,
it definitely said...

74
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,980
Everything looks fine.

75
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,250
I checked it all, too.

76
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,390
All right, then. I'll just stamp
the rest of the documents.

77
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,600
This ink pad is all dried up.

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,030
This one's too faint.
I'll get a new pad and re-stamp it.

79
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
There we go.

80
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,760
Here, take the sales contract.

81
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,000
And now, we can settle up.

82
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,580
Those jerks swapped the contracts
on me!

83
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,520
She's a horrible woman!

84
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,290
- Gi Man, grab her quickly!
- Get her!

85
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
- Get her. I got her!
- Hey, let me go!

86
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,630
I got her.

87
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,660
We caught her snooping around
and dragged her in here.

88
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,830
Ji Ho is in the master bedroom,
right?

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,130
Go and make sure he stays in there.

90
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,570
Okay.

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,340
Honey, I can explain everything.

92
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,080
This was all Kang Jae In's doing.

93
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,880
I sold the house for your sake
to a wealthy Chinese person,

94
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,420
but it turns out
that Chinese person was Jae In.

95
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,420
The check she gave me was fake!

96
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,360
That tramp totally messed with me!
She scammed me!

97
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,160
You sold our house without
even talking to me?

98
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,430
And you expect me to believe
you did it for me?

99
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,900
You were just going to run off
with the money, weren't you?

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,430
That's not true, honey.

101
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,740
It's really not.

102
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,070
Please, just believe me.
I'm not hiding anything anymore.

103
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,240
You know that.

104
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,380
Nothing?

105
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,550
Are you telling me there's
not one thing you're hiding from me?

106
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,750
Nothing. I swear!

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Ji Ho.

108
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,690
Do I have to be the one to say
whose son Ji Ho really is?

109
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,060
You make me sick.
I'm so fed up and disgusted by you.

110
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,700
How could you lie
that he was my son?

111
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,130
If you hadn't told me he was mine...

112
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,640
If I hadn't, you would've left me!

113
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,840
You'd have never left Kang Jae In.

114
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,170
Is that what this is about?

115
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,310
That's right.

116
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,120
You ruined my life.

117
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,750
You've completely shattered it.
Do you get that?

118
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,420
It was because I loved you.

119
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,390
Because I love you!

120
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,560
I had to do whatever it took
to make you mine.

121
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,060
Neither of us knew Kang Jae In
would play us like this.

122
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,030
We were happy before this happened.

123
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,800
Don't be ridiculous.

124
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,040
A house built on sand
is doomed to fall.

125
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,080
Ji Ho thinks you're his father.

126
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,280
I thought he was your son too.

127
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,080
I honestly had no idea
until Teo showed up.

128
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,280
While I was living alone
in the States,

129
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,890
I was so tired of counting the days
waiting for you to come.

130
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,290
I was lonely.

131
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,190
So, I just...

132
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,960
It was a mistake. It really was.

133
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm not hiding anything anymore.

134
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,640
I couldn't tell you because
I was terrified you'd leave me.

135
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,640
I sold the house for you,
for our family.

136
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,740
I only sold it because they offered
more than the asking price.

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,280
It was a trap set by Kang Jae In!

138
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,390
Get out.

139
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,220
Honey, you have to believe me.

140
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,390
Didn't you hear me? I said get out.

141
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,290
Get out.

142
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,130
Honey!

143
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,280
Honey. Please believe me.

144
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,350
Gi Chan!

145
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,650
Please open the door, honey.

146
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,560
You thieving tramp!
You witch, come here!

147
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,830
You rotten tramp!

148
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,660
You...

149
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,170
seduced my son and wormed your way
into being the chairman's wife.

150
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,740
You caused all kinds of scandals,

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,140
and on top of getting him fired,
you even sold the house?

152
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,540
Mother, it's a misunderstanding.

153
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,210
I was scammed too!

154
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,110
We're the ones who got conned.
By you, you con artist!

155
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,050
Ever since you came into our family,
nothing has gone right.

156
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,250
Gi Chan, help me!

157
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,090
- You witch!
- Na Ra!

158
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,260
Na Ra, please help me!

159
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,330
You witch...

160
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,030
Just die!

161
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,160
You witch.

162
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,540
Why don't you stay here for a while?

163
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,080
I don't want to intrude when
you spend time with your family.

164
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,810
I'd just get in the way.

165
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,580
Not at all.

166
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
When you think of this house, Teo,

167
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,790
I don't want you to remember the bad
times with Hwang Gi Chan's family.

168
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,060
I want this place to be nothing...

169
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,930
but warm and happy memories.

170
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,960
After all, this is the house
my dad built for me.

171
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,070
They say it's rude to keep
turning down a kind offer in Korea.

172
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,100
Is that right?

173
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,540
That's right.
I'd be hurt if you said no.

174
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,710
Okay. Thank you for letting me stay.

175
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,880
Aunt Mi Ran, are you going
to keep staying at Do Yun's?

176
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,250
I moved in to win over
Oh Seong's sister.

177
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,620
But like Seung Woo said,

178
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,060
now that I've tried living
in a full house,

179
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,990
it feels so warm and full of life.
I like it.

180
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,030
See? I told you.
I was worried, so that's a relief.

181
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,900
So I was thinking we could
keep living like this for now,

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,010
and then as soon as
Oh Seong's new house is finished,

183
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,280
we could all move in together
with his family.

184
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,110
Seung Woo.

185
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,250
Move back in with us.

186
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,060
Can I really?

187
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,790
Of course.

188
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,060
This is your home too, you know.

189
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,790
Right, Mom?

190
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,960
Yes. We're family, after all.

191
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,630
Unless you'd rather not.

192
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,570
No, I want to!

193
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,240
I'll pack my bags and be right over.
Don't even try to stop me.

194
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,340
Oh, right. Teo has decided
to stay here too.

195
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
You're okay with that, right?

196
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,250
Teo? Of course, that's okay.
He's such a nice guy.

197
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,050
I heard Teo helped bring down
Hwang Gi Chan's family, right?

198
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,320
That's right.
I wanted to repay him, so I offered.

199
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,200
I wish your father were here
to see this.

200
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,130
I can still picture him so clearly,
coming out of his study.

201
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,590
I told you, it's awkward having
a stranger make us breakfast.

202
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,160
She's not a stranger.
I told you that.

203
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,860
She's your sister-in-law now.

204
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,230
She's trying to weasel her way in,
but she can forget about it.

205
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,940
You call this breakfast?

206
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,240
I just put out something simple,
what I usually have in the morning.

207
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,850
On an empty stomach?
Lemon water will upset our stomachs.

208
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,950
I've been drinking it for a while,
and it's always been fine for me.

209
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,590
It can actually be good for people
with healthy digestion.

210
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,100
How is Bo Ram supposed
to get through kindergarten on this?

211
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,900
Bo Ram, I'll fry you an egg.
Just wait a minute.

212
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,500
- Okay.
- She's never raised a child.

213
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,970
How would she know? Goodness.

214
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,450
Hey, I like a simple breakfast.
Come on, let's just eat.

215
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,720
Bo Ram, you should finish up, too.

216
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,420
This is good.

217
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,160
I told Ji Ho and Gi Man
to stay and draw together.

218
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,600
How can we have a strategy meeting
when we have no strategy?

219
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,570
You'd rather just keep living
in this dump?

220
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,740
Except for that time I had to drag
you kids to live in a shantytown,

221
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,840
I have never lived in a hovel
like this.

222
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,080
There's not even a bed,
and they used such cheap flooring.

223
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,780
It might as well be bare concrete.
My entire body aches.

224
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,190
Come on, Gi Chan said he was lucky
to even find this place.

225
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,990
Those paintings in the gallery...

226
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,060
Are you sure they're worthless now?

227
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:19,100
Since we can't sell them right now,
we have to assume so.

228
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,470
Then, let's just sell the gallery.

229
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,070
It's on prime real estate,
so it'll be worth a pretty penny.

230
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,410
What are you waiting for?
So many of us are crammed in here.

231
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,240
Are we just going to keep living
all crammed in like this?

232
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,210
The gallery is our last resort.

233
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,150
We can't do it right now.

234
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
But...

235
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,720
Then you sell your house.

236
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,660
You have a home in the US, right?

237
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,630
If you'll mooch after ruining us,
you'd better do something.

238
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,900
My aunt is living in my house
in the US.

239
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,640
I'll ask my aunt to list it
with a real estate agent.

240
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,010
What are you talking about?

241
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,610
But I never sold it.

242
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,480
My aunt did?

243
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,250
What is it? What's wrong now?

244
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,890
It looks like my aunt
had gambling debts.

245
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,430
She even sold my house
and then disappeared.

246
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,830
What?

247
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,000
This is so frustrating.

248
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,900
See? The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

249
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,070
There's a reason they say you should
vet the family, not just the person.

250
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,510
Just drop it!
I'll handle this myself.

(YL Planning and Design Team)

252

You can glare all you want.
I'm not scared.

253
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:43,910
Spit it out.

254
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,980
I hear you scammed us
out of our house.

255
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,950
That's a crime.

256
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Why don't you worry about your son,
who will rot in prison for life?

257
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,260
I'll sell you the gallery.

258
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,530
Your mother can be the director
again for all I care.

259
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,200
I was about to sell it
to someone else,

260
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,870
but I came to you first.

261
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,370
I'll sell it for less, so buy it.

262
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,970
And you don't have to thank me.

263
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,980
I'm sure it's because
I'm the only one...

264
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,480
who'd buy such a troubled gallery.

265
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,380
But what a shame.

266
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,650
I don't think I'll have to buy it
from you.

267
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,920
Because by now, the news articles
will have been plastered everywhere.

What?

278
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,030
For what? I haven't done anything!
I'll be proven innocent!

279
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,360
After you became the director,
you signed things blindly, right?

280
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,700
Don't tell me...

281
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,640
They were meant to frame you
for all kinds of tax evasion.

282
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,170
And you were so excited,

283
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,040
you signed everything
without a second thought.

284
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,540
You conniving fox!

285
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,250
That's why you made me the director!

286
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,220
Are you just figuring that out now?

287
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,920
Real quick on the uptake.

288
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,960
You...

289
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:38,030
Jae In came to thank you
for her mom,

290
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,760
but you told her not to bother.

291
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,070
So instead, she bought many things
from our store.

292
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,840
She wanted to give them to you
as a gift.

293
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,900
This one's for you, Dad.

294
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,040
She really shouldn't have.

295
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,850
Lie down and try it.
It soothes sore and knotted muscles.

296
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,260
It's so nice and warm.

297
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,570
The heat will help
with your blood circulation, too.

298
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,910
I said to forget about it,
but I guess I should thank her now.

299
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,320
Who are you planning to take down
this time to see me?

300
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,060
I found this in Ji Ho's room.

301
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,100
I think they're Kang Se Ri's pants,

302
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,630
and there's some kind of stain
on them.

303
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,430
I think it might be blood.

304
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,070
You can be the judge of that,

305
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,340
but the fact that they were hidden
under the bed...

306
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,280
My mother...

307
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,080
said that when your brother...

308
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,550
had his accident,

309
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,890
she saw Kang Se Ri on the stairs.

310
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,930
She has dementia,
so she could be mistaken,

311
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,330
but that doesn't make it
any less credible.

312
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,800
And about Kang Se Ri...

313
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,900
When your brother was injured,

314
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,700
I caught her trying to take him off
his respirator.

315
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,440
Isn't that strange?

316
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,310
Don't ask Kang Se Ri about it.

317
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,110
Get a DNA test done on it.

318
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,750
That's the right first step.

319
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,160
I thought
you found my family despicable.

320
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,490
Why the sudden concern for me?

321
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,960
After putting me through torment,

322
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,760
are you offering me a single drop
of water and calling it mercy?

323
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,030
Don't think for a second
this is for you.

324
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,100
If Kang Se Ri is guilty of more,

325
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,640
I want her to get
the maximum sentence.

326
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,910
I'm leaving.

327
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,440
I begged you,
and I pleaded with you to just wait.

328
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,380
Didn't you hear what I said?

329
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,340
I told you I'd handle it.

330
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,580
You and Kang Jae In
have completely ruined my life.

331
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,950
You need to take responsibility
for everything!

332
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,490
You've got some nerve.
You lived as someone else.

333
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,420
Kang Se Ri, if your life is a mess,

334
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,260
don't blame me or Kang Jae In.

335
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,660
You have only yourself to blame.

336
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,360
- I said, blame yourself.
- You don't understand.

337
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,830
It was all for Ji Ho.

338
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,170
I just wanted to give our Ji Ho
a happy life.

339
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,280
If you want Ji Ho that badly,
I'll bring him to you.

340
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,150
I know it's late,
but the three of us can start over.

341
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,620
I'll do better. Okay?

342
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,090
Kang Se Ri,

343
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,920
are you out of your mind?

344
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,020
I couldn't believe it,
but you've really lost it.

345
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,090
Teo, can't you please
try to understand?

346
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,260
I'm not saying what I did was right.

347
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,730
Stop it.

348
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,830
You're giving me the creeps,
so stop.

349
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,940
I have no feelings left for you,

350
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,570
and I'm not getting back with you,
so don't even dream about it.

351
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm going to raise Ji Ho.

352
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,640
I'm preparing a paternity suit,

353
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,710
and I've already told Hwang Gi Chan,
just so you know.

354
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,790
Why are you so surprised?

355
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,960
I thought you were at work.
You startled me.

356
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,430
Where have you been?

357
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,160
I just came back
for something I forgot.

358
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
(If something happens to me,
Se Ri is behind it.)

359
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,180
I drew a really cool picture.
Do you want to see it?

360
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,550
It's an angel. Isn't it pretty?

361
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,450
Yes.

362
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,620
Do you want to see another?
It's so good, you'll be shocked.

363
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,990
Ta-da!

364
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Pretty good, right?

365
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,470
Gi Man.

366
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,670
When you fell down the stairs,

367
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,710
did someone push you?

368
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,740
What?

369
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,750
Was someone with you?

370
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,510
Do you remember who?

371
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,960
Your family's a mess,
and you're over here smiling?

372
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,500
Gosh, what?

373
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,200
It was Assistant Manager Kang...

374
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,500
who texted first
to ask if I was okay.

375
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,370
You really like that
Kang Seung Woo guy that much?

376
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,010
Of course I do. What's not to like?
I totally like him.

377
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
Hold on a second.

378
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,880
If I make him my son-in-law,

379
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,450
that's a bigger prize than bringing
that vixen Kang Jae In home.

380
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,290
Should I put my mind to it
and get those two together?

381
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,060
(YL Group)

382
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,030
- Come on, hurry up.
- Mom, are you crazy?

383
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,170
Why are you here? Get out! Hurry!

384
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,240
You said you liked Kang Seung Woo,
didn't you?

385
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,210
I think he's pretty decent myself.

386
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,040
We should've looked for a match
for you closer to home.

387
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,140
All that wasted effort.

388
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,620
His mother is YL Group's director,
and his father is DH Holdings' CEO.

389
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,220
He's the biggest catch there is.

390
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,220
Oh, Na Ra.

391
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,260
Goodness, Na Ra kept going on and on
about how much she missed you.

392
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,500
As her mother, I felt so bad for her
that I just had to bring her.

393
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,000
I don't like you anymore.

394
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,840
What are you talking about?
You said you did!

395
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,180
You were all smiles
just from his text message.

396
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,810
No, I don't! I said I don't!
I stopped liking him!

397
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,850
It hurts my pride
being the only one with feelings,

398
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,550
and my heart pounds
even when you just worry about me.

399
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,750
So I'm pretty sure it's terrible
for my health.

400
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,360
So I'm going to stop liking you now.

401
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,320
- Mom, let's go.
- Hey!

402
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,290
- Come on, let's go!
- But...

403
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,030
It sounds like she still likes me.

404
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,910
You get back in there right now.
Go tell him you're crazy about him.

405
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,470
No! I can't! I'm not doing it!

406
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,110
Why should I have to do that?

407
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,850
You said you liked him,
so I'm setting the stage for you!

408
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,780
You should at least try to properly
seduce him.

409
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,220
Not YL Group, but DH Holdings
will all be his one day, won't it?

410
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,030
If all else fails,
sleep with him and make him yours.

411
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,860
I didn't fall for him
because of his background.

412
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,960
Don't treat my love life
like a business deal.

413
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,970
Love? Don't make me laugh.

414
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,540
You saw me lose
six million over a man,

415
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,370
and you still dare talk about love?

416
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,770
- Just make Kang Seung Woo yours!
- No!

417
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,040
If you won't, pay back everything
I've spent raising you!

418
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,680
All that money for surgery and spas
to help you marry rich! Pay it back!

419
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,890
Fine. Take your pound of flesh
for all I care.

420
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,090
Why, you...

421
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,160
Gosh, why can't any of my children
ever do what I want?

422
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Gosh.

423
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,560
I can't live like this.

424
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,400
I'm Kang Jae In.

425
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,530
How am I meant to live
in this tiny, godforsaken place?

426
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,270
I have to get out of here,
no matter what.

427
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,270
I have to find a way.

428
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,410
She must think I'm a gold digger
just like her.

429
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,080
Hey, Na Ra. Look at this.
See this hole in my head?

430
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,720
Gi Chan pulled out a whole bunch
of my hair last time.

431
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,350
You have to tell him off for me.

432
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,920
Gi Man, that's ridiculous.

433
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,560
Why on earth would Gi Chan
want to pull out your hair?

434
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,730
Where's Kang Se Ri?

435
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,840
Honey, I'm right here.

436
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,070
Was it you who pushed my brother
down the stairs?

437
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,610
Honey!

438
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,750
What's all this commotion?

439
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,150
Gi Chan, you're going to kill her!
Stop it!

440
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,990
What did that wicked witch do now
to cause all this chaos?

441
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,690
It's about Gi Man. Kang Se Ri is
the one who did this to him.

442
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,960
What are you talking about?

443
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,200
Gi Man. Who did you say pushed you
down the stairs?

444
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,870
That witch gave me a hard shove,
like this.

445
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
He's lying.

446
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,250
He's not in his right mind.
How can you believe his lies?

447
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,480
Mother, it's not true.

448
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,980
Why would I ever push him?

449
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,850
- I have no reason to.
- Shut your mouth!

450
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,290
It was because he was
the first one to find out.

451
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,220
He knew about Ji Ho.

452
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,160
What about Ji Ho?

453
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,930
You're the one who hid the pants
under the bed in Ji Ho's room!

454
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:21,100
I had the blood on the pants tested.
It matched my brother's DNA.

455
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,840
I just got the test results.

456
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,910
Are you still going to deny it now?

457
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,050
- Oh my gosh!
- I can't believe it...

458
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,620
You witch! You deserve to die,
you witch!

459
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:41,930
You witch! You deserve to die!
You witch!

460
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,900
This witch is ruining our family!
She's tearing our family apart!

461
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,530
- You murderous witch!
- No! I swear, it wasn't me!

462
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,300
Honey, you have to help me!

463
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,440
Mother, that's enough.

464
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,410
She's not even worth hitting.
Just call the police.

465
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Honey!

466
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,210
Hwang Na Ra.

467
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,420
- Yes?
- Call the police.

468
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,980
Report her for attempted murder.

469
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,990
Use the pants
and documents as evidence.

470
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,790
Get that witch! Catch the murderer!
Get her! Catch her!

471
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,990
Get her!

472
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,430
Mom.

473
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,870
Mom, are you okay?

474
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,540
You fell?

475
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,680
- Goodness...
- You were right, Mom.

476
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,980
I'm the one who ruined this family.

477
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,090
Gi Man, I'm sorry.

478
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
I'm so sorry.

479
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,230
Gi Chan, don't be like this.

480
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,060
So what if you ruined things?
Just build them back up.

481
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,000
So why are you sitting there
feeling sorry for yourself?

482
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,800
You're the pillar of this family.

483
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,670
And a pillar can't be allowed
to crumble.

484
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,470
So pull yourself together
and get back on your feet!

485
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
I will rest for a bit.

486
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,900
I'll stop by again sometime.

487
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,230
I just came to say hi since
I heard you transferred hospitals.

488
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,940
An emergency surgery just came up.
Let's grab a drink some other time.

489
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,300
- Yes.
- Go on.

490
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,900
Did something happen
during your lunch meeting?

491
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,770
Was it that obvious?

492
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,900
What happened?

493
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:45,610
It's about Hwang Gi Chan.

494
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,250
He has terminal stomach cancer.

495
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,920
Looks like he has a year at most.

496
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,560
Are you okay, Do Yun?

497
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,360
You're not worried about
Hwang Gi Chan.

498
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,370
You're worried about me?

499
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,240
He hasn't paid the price
for what he did to Do Hee,

500
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,640
not properly, anyway.

501
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,710
I know how much
you've held back for that day...

502
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
better than anyone.

503
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,820
That's all I need.

504
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,690
Just knowing that you understand,
Jae In.

505
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,860
With that, I can endure it.

506
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,800
I can tolerate it.

507
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,300
And I can breathe.

508
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,010
Are you bored
now that you got rid of me?

509
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,180
You called me out here.
Why the silent treatment?

510
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,020
- Just say something...
- I heard you were dying.

511
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,690
Who gave you permission to die?

512
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,670
(Queen's House)

513
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,210
It's me, Mr. Hong.

514
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:04,580
You know if I talk to prosecutors,
you'll end up in here too.

515
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,050
I just found this
at Hwang Gi Chan's place.

516
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,250
If we want to see what's inside,
