00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,210
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,810
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,050
- Jae In!
- My gosh!

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,520
Jae In!

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,020
Call an ambulance now.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,420
And get that punk!

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,620
Jae In.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,530
Open your eyes, Jae In.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,630
Look at me, Jae In.

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,200
Ms. Kang Jae In!

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,640
Gi Chan...

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,050
Yes, I'm right here.

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,050
Are you all right, honey?

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,620
Jae In.

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,960
Why can't you do your job right?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,470
You should've sent an expert!

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,370
He stabbed someone who wasn't
a target and complicated things.

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,440
You still owe us money.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,210
Otherwise, he'll turn himself in.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,910
Gi Chan and Kim Do Yun are
dying to find the culprit,

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,920
so turning himself in
won't reduce his sentence.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,620
Tell him to stop talking nonsense...

24
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,590
and lie low as if he's dead.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,330
I get it. I'll give you the money!

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,160
But if he gets caught,

27
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,760
tell him to state that...

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,600
he always hated the rich
and did this on impulse.

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,170
I have nothing to do
with this incident.

30
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,040
Got it?

31
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,010
Why is everyone so stupid?

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,820
Why is everything going haywire?

33
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,630
I'm fine now, honey.

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,430
I can go home.

35
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,500
You can't.

36
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,030
Don't even think of setting foot
outside this room tonight.

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,170
But the doctor said I was fine.

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,110
He didn't get
any of my vital organs,

39
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,280
and it was just a scratch,
nothing serious.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,410
But still, no.

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,980
You need to get a good rest,
so you aren't going to work, either.

42
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,150
Are you okay, Jae In?

43
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,790
Thankfully, I am.

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,400
Honey, you said you had
an important meeting today.

45
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,060
You need to go. Okay?

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,800
Se Ri's here with me.
You can leave me and go.

47
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,210
I'd feel even worse
if you stayed here.

48
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,640
You need to do your job...

49
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,780
and stop my aunt.

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Okay. Then, I'll come
as soon as I'm done.

51
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,890
Okay.

52
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,600
Please call me right away
if anything happens.

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,300
Sure.

54
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,240
Don't you think
he trusts you a little too much?

55
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,240
How can he worry about you
while I'm around?

56
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,420
He did, didn't he?
This was exactly what you wanted.

57
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,080
Wasn't it?

58
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,020
You must be heartbroken.

59
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,460
You should've been stabbed instead.
What a shame.

60
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,560
She knows I staged this.

61
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,760
How did she figure it out?

62
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,750
Se Ri.

63
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,490
I wonder if you kept your head down
and stayed out of trouble today.

64
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,930
Shout out, "Die, Hwang Gi Chan,"
in the lobby tomorrow...

65
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,430
and charge at him,
then, I'll jump in.

66
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,560
You can stab me lightly
at that time.

67
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,870
Se Ri.

68
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,170
What will I do with you?

69
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,520
It looks like you're wondering
how I found out.

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,980
What are you talking about?

71
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,520
I don't know anything.

72
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,790
Stop trying to rack your brain.

73
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,600
The sound of you
racking your brain is way too loud.

74
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,870
It wasn't me.

75
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,730
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,140
I really don't know anything.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,940
Don't be scared, Se Ri.

78
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,410
I don't plan
to share it with Gi Chan.

79
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,840
Well, not now, anyway.

80
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,110
If you want to continue
to stick around him,

81
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,980
do as I say from now on.

82
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,920
You're nothing but Kang Jae In B
without him.

83
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,130
Fine, let's say I was behind it
just as you suggested.

84
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,830
You don't have any evidence.

85
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,760
How am I supposed to believe you?

86
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,100
You're standing here...

87
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,470
instead of the police station
because I didn't tell anyone.

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,470
Seeing your face is
making my stomach hurt.

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,610
Please leave.

90
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,450
I'll check on Jae In's condition
and be at work right away.

91
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,150
We still have time
until the meeting, so take your time.

92
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,490
See you soon.

93
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,560
Anyway, Mi Ran.

94
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,930
Kang Seung Woo is your son?

95
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,200
I don't know what the reason is,

96
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,940
but this keeps bothering me.

97
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,990
I came after seeing Hwang Gi Chan
and Kang Se Ri leave.

98
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,990
Are you all right?

99
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,890
Yes, was this a big surprise?

100
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,760
Of course, it was.
How can I not be surprised?

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,200
It was just a scratch.

102
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,030
I found out Se Ri was
planning to stage this,

103
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,270
so I beat her to it.

104
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,470
You may have known, but what if
you were stabbed in the wrong place?

105
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,510
I thought you might get hurt
before my eyes again.

106
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,910
I never want to lose you again.

107
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,450
I was ready for this much trouble
when I got into this.

108
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,320
You can't call it revenge
if you have to hurt yourself.

109
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,750
You could've died.

110
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,950
I don't care.

111
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,760
Jae In.

112
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,090
Why do you think everything happened
to my dad and Eun Ho?

113
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,630
It's all my fault.

114
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,100
I have to risk my life.

115
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,830
All I have on my mind right now is
getting this revenge.

116
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,670
I may end up dead,
but Gi Chan and Se Ri's turn...

117
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,380
will come before mine,

118
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,650
so don't worry.

119
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,680
I won't die.

120
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,110
What is it?

121
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,410
We could've talked in the office.
Why did you call me out? I was busy.

122
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,180
If you wanted to ask me out on a date,
let's do it later.

123
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,620
We should be working now.

124
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,880
It's about Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

125
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,090
Is he really your son?

126
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,990
Well,

127
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,260
he must be.
That's why he said he was your son.

128
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,900
I might be overthinking this,

129
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,130
but you know...

130
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,170
I won't hold a prejudice
against you for having a son, right?

131
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,540
So, what I'm trying to say is this.

132
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,670
I was wondering
if you intentionally kept it from me.

133
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,610
Was that the case?

134
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,120
Who's...

135
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,620
Kang Seung Woo's father?

136
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,230
Could it be me?

137
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,130
I knew it was ridiculous
as soon as I said it.

138
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,470
He isn't my son,

139
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,680
is he?

140
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,330
So, I lived my life...

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,770
completely oblivious to the fact
that I had a son because of you?

142
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,010
Were you going to keep this silent
for the rest of your life?

143
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,380
How...

144
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,650
How can you do this? How?

145
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,550
If he were my son, if he were mine,

146
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,960
you had to tell me.

147
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,900
- I tried to.
- When?

148
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,830
You should've told me
before we began to date again. No.

149
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,200
You should've told me
before he was born.

150
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,340
How can you give birth to my son
without my knowledge?

151
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,180
And you didn't even
raise him yourself.

152
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,180
How can you leave him
with that family?

153
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,780
How do you call yourself his mom?

154
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,360
Let me explain.

155
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,430
I'll tell you everything.

156
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,140
We can't work things out.

157
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,640
There's no reason
to keep hanging onto this...

158
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,710
if we know how it'll end.

159
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,280
This time, I'll end it.

160
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,320
You give me the creeps...

161
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,190
and make me appalled.

162
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,280
Hello, Mr. Jung.

163
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,050
Why won't you say anything
after you two have met?

164
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm dying to know,
so won't you tell me?

165
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
Can I ask you just one thing?

166
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,790
What do you think about my aunt?

167
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,170
I'll tell you later.

168
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,600
Did something bad happen?

169
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,080
Does he not like her?

170
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,480
No, that's impossible.

171
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,050
Mommy!

172
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,050
Why are you crying, Seon Ho?

173
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,620
That guy stole my juice.

174
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,860
That was mine,
but he took it and drank it.

175
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,630
Hey, why did you steal
my son's juice?

176
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,800
I didn't steal it from him.

177
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,170
He left it here,

178
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,310
so I picked it up.

179
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,480
Is that your excuse?

180
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,620
What's wrong with you?

181
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,860
Don't cry. I'll get you a new one.

182
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,260
He put his mouth on it,
so it's already gross.

183
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,460
Let's go.

184
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,000
Good grief!
You shouldn't be doing this at your age.

185
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,000
Why did you steal a kid's juice?

186
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,800
Because you won't get one for me.

187
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,670
I want some more of this.

188
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,410
Mommy, buy me some more.

189
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,940
Buy me more.
I want more of this, Mommy.

190
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,310
- I want more!
- Don't be such an embarrassment.

191
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,150
Shut your mouth.

192
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,480
Come to the room with me.

193
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,350
No, I'm not going!

194
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,790
Buy me this, Mommy!

195
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,890
- What's with you?
- I'm not going!

196
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,190
Get up, Gi Man. Come on!

197
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,000
- Buy me this!
- Get up!

198
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,770
There's yet another scandal
that involves the chairman.

199
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,470
How does YL Group
plan to handle this?

200
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,610
We can't show more patience
at this point.

201
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,910
We'll put together
a fact-finding committee...

202
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,880
to uncover the truth
with the audit team.

203
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,610
If Chairman Hwang must
take responsibility for anything,

204
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,320
he will be held responsible.

205
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,720
I didn't think you'd take things
this far, Director Kang.

206
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,030
You were the one who referred me...

207
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,930
to Louis B.

208
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
All I did was...

209
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,370
move the project forward
as she told me.

210
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,570
She had already designated...

211
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,440
the construction company
and the person in charge at Louis B.

212
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,710
Did you say...

213
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,010
I raised the price excessively
to take kickbacks?

214
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,220
It wasn't me.

215
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,520
He wanted to reach out to Louis B,

216
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,020
so all I did was
set up a meeting through the CEO.

217
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,690
I don't know the constructor
or the person in charge at Louis B.

218
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,290
I gave you a chance, yet you insist
on this, so you leave me no choice.

219
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,830
Come in, everyone.

220
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,970
The CEO of the construction company
and the person in charge at Louis B.

221
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,010
Who had a secret deal with you two?

222
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,680
I don't even know you.

223
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,620
I did not make
any kind of deal with them.

224
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,860
You wanted to cut the price
as soon as we began working.

225
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,430
You told us to switch out...

226
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,030
lower-priced materials
that look similar to high-end materials.

227
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,070
All I did was follow her orders.

228
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,540
She cut down on Louis B products
set up inside the house...

229
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,970
and wanted to replace them...

230
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,610
with lower quality products
that aren't even out in the market.

231
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,880
She wanted to take the surplus
from the interior design funds...

232
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,210
and take kickbacks
by raising the parcel price!

233
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,550
I think we should reconsider
who's responsible...

234
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,720
and who to hold responsible
for this matter.

235
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,040
(Investment and Development Team)

236
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,050
Don't you think Hwang Gi Chan is
trying to put this on Director Kang?

237
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,550
I don't know.

238
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,990
Our investigation didn't show
Director Kang's involvement.

239
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,320
She's extremely cautious
of causing harm to the company.

240
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,090
Would she have agreed to do this?

241
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,230
You know her better, Uncle Oh Seong.

242
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,870
I think someone innocent
got caught in the trap...

243
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,440
meant for Hwang Gi Chan.

244
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,070
Are you sure
you can let this happen to her?

245
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,980
If she did something wrong,
she should be held responsible.

246
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,550
That should be
our official stance, but...

247
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,880
You don't have to mind me.

248
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,820
We're here to do business.

249
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,150
Just think of this as work.

250
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,770
Are you all right?

251
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,210
Did the word get around already?

252
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,310
The secretaries of the board members
who were at the meeting...

253
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,340
began to spread the word
through the messenger,

254
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,810
and someone else uploaded it
on the intranet bulletin.

255
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,520
Do you...

256
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,290
also not trust me?

257
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,960
There was something I realized
after what happened to Jae In.

258
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,630
That our family is
always the last resort.

259
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,760
That we should stay
next to each other until the end.

260
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,300
I won't let others' judgment
sway my view...

261
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,270
and point my finger at you.

262
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,340
If you say it wasn't you,
then it wasn't.

263
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,740
I'll only trust you until the end.

264
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,580
So, stay strong.

265
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,550
No.

266
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,190
Jae In. No.

267
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,120
Jae In.

268
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,790
Ms. Choi.

269
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,260
Where's Jae In?

270
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,700
Jae In.

271
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,400
She's doing well.
Please don't worry.

272
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,840
You should take your medicine.
I brought some water.

273
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,170
I'm the sinner.

274
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,310
If...

275
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,980
If I hadn't killed that woman,
Kim Do Hee,

276
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,250
no one would've been miserable.

277
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,690
Yes, all right. Do you feel okay?

278
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,760
Okay. Wait for me.

279
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,470
I'll be there right after work.

280
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,600
What brings you here without a call?

281
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,400
I called you many times, but you didn't
call me back, so I came here.

282
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
I was in a series of meetings.

283
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,110
Is something going on?

284
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,050
- Mother.
- What is this?

285
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,620
You didn't pick up your phone,
so she called me instead.

286
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,390
Did you talk to him?

287
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,250
I was about to.

288
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,920
Your brother doesn't seem well.

289
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,060
He talks like a kid,

290
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,630
and his memories come and go.

291
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,000
He's not the same guy
who'd always bluff.

292
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,470
He keeps fighting little kids
and stealing food from them.

293
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,970
Today, he fell on the floor
and threw a tantrum...

294
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,240
to demand I buy him snacks.

295
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,440
The doctor said he could show
atypical behavior temporarily,

296
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,410
but it still didn't feel right.

297
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,550
I'll call the hospital
to get him examined.

298
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,420
Shouldn't he get it done now?

299
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,090
She's worried.

300
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,220
I'll make it happen.

301
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,960
Mother, I'll go
to the hospital with you.

302
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,790
He'd be under examination
by the time we're there.

303
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,230
Why would you go?

304
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,100
It's better to have someone there...

305
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,430
when you find out the result.

306
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,830
I also have to hear it firsthand
to explain it to Gi Chan.

307
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,030
No, thanks.

308
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,500
If I go with anyone,
I'll go with Gi Chan.

309
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,140
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,910
I have to see Jae In after work.

311
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,850
Aren't you worried
about your brother?

312
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,380
Why do you have to meet that girl
you see every day at home?

313
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,120
Today, she was stabbed in my place.

314
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,990
She got hospitalized.

315
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,320
What? Who did that?

316
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,630
Who tried to stab you?

317
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,030
I'll tell you later.

318
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,730
You can update her...

319
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,400
and go to the hospital with her.

320
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,370
All right. I'll escort her.

321
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,470
Oh, my.

322
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,340
He'll need to go through
some more examinations,

323
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,840
but it looks like
his intelligence fell...

324
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,410
to that of a 7 or an 8-year-old
after the accident.

325
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,750
It's an acquired mental disability
due to traumatic brain damage.

326
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,480
What?

327
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,220
He became intellectually disabled
after rolling down the stairs?

328
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,690
This doesn't happen often,

329
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,360
but he must've been unlucky.

330
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,730
Goodness gracious.

331
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,130
I always thought
he was a bit on the slower side,

332
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,770
but how can this happen?

333
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,570
My goodness. No.

334
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,110
Can he get better?

335
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,550
I just asked if he can get better!

336
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,790
I'm not sure.
It's hard to give you a clear answer...

337
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,890
and tell you if he can get better.

338
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,100
Don't worry, Mother.

339
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,330
I know Gi Man will get better.

340
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,180
Goodness.

341
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,450
Gi Man.

342
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,490
I'm here.

343
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,530
I'm scared, Mommy.

344
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,600
Tell that lady to leave.

345
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,870
Look at me, Gi Man.

346
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,110
When you fell down the stairs,

347
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,680
did you really
lose your footing alone?

348
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,650
Or did someone push you from behind?

349
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,150
I mean those loan sharks.

350
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
Did they do this to you?

351
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,760
I don't know, Mommy. I'm scared.

352
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,730
That lady looks scary.

353
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,600
He doesn't remember anything
about the accident...

354
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,570
or who I am.

355
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,970
It's me, Gi Man.

356
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,740
I'm your brother's wife.

357
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,520
I can't let that girl live in peace.

358
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,630
Get over here, you evil brat.

359
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,830
Take responsibility for my son!

360
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,430
Let go of me!

361
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,640
What do you think you're doing?

362
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,410
I'm going to hurt your head
just as Gi Man hurt his.

363
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,410
It's all your fault!

364
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,210
You never treated him like
a decent husband in your marriage,

365
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,350
and you ended up
making him look like this!

366
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,780
What are you talking about?

367
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:03,790
Gi Man now has the intelligence
of a seven-year-old.

368
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,890
Whose fault do you think this is?

369
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,820
You said he got into an accident,

370
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,430
so it must be because of that.

371
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,630
Why are you taking this out on me?
I'm unrelated.

372
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,630
Why do you think this happened?

373
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,900
He probably fell
on his way to meet you...

374
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,500
or while he was pursued
by those loan sharks...

375
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,970
because he needed money
to get on your good side!

376
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,970
Don't be ridiculous.

377
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,740
Leave. I have nothing more to say.

378
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,380
I can't do that.

379
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,350
I'm going to pull out
all your hair...

380
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,580
and make you just like Gi Man.

381
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,690
Have you lost your mind, woman?

382
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,430
What did you say?

383
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,830
Who do you think you are to step in?

384
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,000
Get lost!

385
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,400
Don't treat someone I like
as if she's dirt.

386
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,970
I won't put up with it.

387
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,100
So what? What are you going to do?

388
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,570
Yu Gyeong, report her
to the police for assault.

389
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,110
I'll be your witness.

390
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,280
I can't believe you two.
I get it now.

391
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,010
You two are together.

392
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,680
Good grief. My gosh.

393
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,420
That girl and her brother...

394
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,430
have ruined my family.

395
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,900
Don't you dare
set foot in my house again!

396
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,370
I heard people shouting.
Is something going on?

397
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,210
It must be the sound of my stress.

398
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,810
Yes, right. How's your son?

399
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,710
Did he wake up?

400
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,080
He did, but...

401
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,850
What am I going to do, Yun Hee?

402
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,120
My eldest son is...

403
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,630
sucking on some children's juice...

404
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,930
and throwing tantrums on the floor.

405
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,530
My gosh.

406
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,630
Goodness.
Your son must be in awful condition.

407
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,340
You should come in.

408
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,170
Come, have some tea,
and calm yourself down first.

409
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,980
Aunt Mi Ran.

410
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,220
I should've come by sooner.
I'm sorry for coming late.

411
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,050
Things were hectic at work.

412
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,190
It's all right.

413
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,630
Jae In,
something happened at work today.

414
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,570
Actually, I was wrongfully framed.

415
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,470
I'm not sure if you've heard,

416
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,770
but the project with Louis B...

417
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,570
isn't on me.

418
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,480
It was Hwang Gi Chan.
You know that best.

419
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,610
What are you talking about,
Aunt Mi Ran?

420
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,180
What do I know?

421
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,190
You probably don't remember,

422
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,760
but Gi Chan isn't an upright man.

423
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,760
It looks like
he's trying to kick me out.

424
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,430
Please help me out, Jae In.

425
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,070
You seem
to get along with him these days,

426
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,400
so he'll listen to you.

427
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,070
Tell him that it's not too late...

428
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,510
to rectify the mistake he made.

429
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,840
Forget my reputation.

430
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,510
YL Group can't lose its good image.

431
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,580
Aunt Mi Ran.

432
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,950
I don't know what's going on,
but I'll have to decline.

433
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,260
He wouldn't do that.

434
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,190
I can't believe what you said.

435
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,390
You have to, Jae In.

436
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,130
You must believe me
for YL Group's sake.

437
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,830
I don't care what anyone says. No.

438
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,500
I don't care what you say
as a family.

439
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,870
I trust my husband, Aunt Mi Ran.

440
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,250
Honey.

441
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,180
Hey.

442
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,420
You're here.

443
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,790
Thank you for coming, Aunt Mi Ran.

444
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,560
I'm going to get discharged now,

445
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,260
so please excuse us.

446
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,530
Let's go, honey.

447
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,910
What went around came around.

448
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,520
Hey, I just came home.

449
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,490
It's okay, honey.

450
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,330
Something came up urgently,
so you had no choice.

451
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,730
Good luck with your meeting.

452
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,530
What do you think you're doing?

453
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,670
Get out of my home now. Get lost!

454
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,300
No, I'm not leaving.

455
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,710
I'm not leaving
until my sister leaves.

456
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,180
How dare you
try to live under my roof...

457
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,050
after fooling around with the woman
who made my son stupid?

458
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,950
What are you talking about?

459
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,780
- Jae In.
- It's your haughty friend,

460
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,250
Gi Man's ex-wife.

461
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,190
She's now an item with your brother!

462
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,020
Watch what you say.

463
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,830
No, Jae In.

464
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,530
Don't listen to what she says.

465
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,170
Mother, I made you
the director of a gallery,

466
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,800
so just sit around quietly.

467
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,140
- You...
- You don't get to talk like that.

468
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,740
Don't treat my brother
with contempt.

469
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,680
Do you understand?

470
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,080
You're...

471
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,450
Did you see that, Seung Woo?

472
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,320
She has her memories!

473
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,960
No one believes you.

474
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,290
Seung Woo,
my memories aren't back yet.

475
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,930
You believe me, right?

476
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,030
What? Yes.

477
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,770
You heard him.

478
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,740
Don't put up a meaningless fight,
and sit around quietly.

479
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,070
You can go and tell everyone,
but no one will believe you.

480
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,270
Ms. Noh Sook Ja.

481
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,710
Even your own son,
Hwang Gi Chan, doesn't believe you.

482
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,580
Let's go, Seung Woo.

483
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,790
I don't want you to stay here.

484
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,450
What? This is...

485
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,930
I'm staying in this house
because I must do something.

486
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,760
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

487
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,870
You should move out.

488
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,770
How can I not worry?
That place is full of villains.

489
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,700
I said I'd protect you,

490
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
and I meant it.

491
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,910
I know.

492
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,580
When things are
too much for me to handle...

493
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,410
and I need your help,
I'll reach out to you.

494
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,910
Does that sound okay?

495
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,160
I'm here to see the chairman.

496
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,630
Hello, Secretary Yoon. Come on in.

497
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,340
Hello, ma'am.

498
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,310
Hello. He's in the study.
You should go.

499
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,410
Yes, ma'am.

500
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,920
"Ma'am?"

501
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,460
I need to talk to you,
Secretary Yoon.

502
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,710
What is it?

503
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,010
Don't you know who I am?

504
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,510
You know I'm Gi Chan's actual wife.

505
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,810
I do.

506
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,320
Then, what's with your attitude?

507
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,820
You treat Jae In with respect
and call her ma'am,

508
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,350
but how did you treat me?

509
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,990
What do you think will happen
if I tell the chairman...

510
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,960
about your attitude?

511
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,630
You'd be fired right away.

512
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,370
What is this? Did you just laugh?

513
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,940
"Director Do Min Jun is innocent!"

514
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,710
"Look into H and K Company."

515
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,240
You sent an anonymous letter
to Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol.

516
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,210
Does Chairman Hwang know?

517
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,250
I'm staying silent...

518
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,620
because I work for him now.

519
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,920
You should be grateful.

520
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
If you have nothing more to say,
please excuse me.

521
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,110
Ji Ho, do you want to ride a bicycle
with Mommy and Daddy...

522
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,610
when Daddy gets off work?

523
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,410
Really?

524
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,550
Yes, do you want to go?

525
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,980
Yes!

526
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,290
This won't come off, Mommy.
Please help me.

527
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,290
Let me help you. Here.

528
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,760
Get over here, Hwang Ji Ho.

529
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,200
What's wrong with you?

530
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,400
Why did you shout at my Ji Ho?

531
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,070
Your Ji Ho?

532
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,470
Did you call him your Ji Ho?

533
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,940
I did. What's wrong?

534
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,040
He's my son.

535
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,980
He's my son whom I had with Gi Chan!

536
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,090
(Queen's House)

537
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,460
Honey, what now?

538
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,770
I told you she might insist
that Ji Ho is her son.

539
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,870
How does it feel to be betrayed
by someone closest to you?

540
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,570
I got a taste of how you must've felt
when you were...

541
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,240
once wrongfully framed.

542
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,680
It hurts about 100 times,
no, 1,000 times more...

543
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,180
to be betrayed by your family.

544
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,250
It looks like Gi Chan knows
about my mom's condition.

545
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,060
Kang Se Ri also seemed to know
about her medical condition.

546
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,620
Who are you?

547
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,360
It's me, Mom. Jae In.

548
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,600
Yes, it's you, Jae In.

549
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
