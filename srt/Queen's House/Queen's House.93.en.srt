00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,570
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,270
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,980
(Episode 93)

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,320
I thought I turned off my laptop,
so why am I getting a chat notice?

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,300
Is there a rule that only designers
get to use the expensive ones?

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,800
I have to run a lot of programs too.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,570
Don't tell me, Kang Jae In...

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Found it!

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,320
H and K Company's duplicate contract.

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,430
(Overseas Factory
Establishment Contract)

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,930
(Overseas Factory
Establishment Contract)

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,640
(Overseas Factory
Establishment Contract)

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,580
- No!
- Let go! I said, let go!

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,360
Do you think this makes
what you two did just go away?

16
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,060
I saw it with my own two eyes.

17
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,430
The H and K Company's duplicate contract.

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,700
You don't have any proof,
so stop spouting nonsense!

19
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,400
Your words are meaningless!

20
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,210
I guess you have to be
this shameless...

21
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,840
to commit a crime and be proud.

22
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,510
Thank you.

23
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,410
You've really snapped me back
to my senses.

24
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,320
Kang Jae In, don't mess with me.

25
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,820
You saw for yourself.

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,420
You can't beat me.

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,150
Just you wait.

28
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,020
In the end, the one who'll get
shattered to pieces...

29
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,760
won't be me, but you.

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,010
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

31
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,980
Don't you dare say "love."

32
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,050
I gave you my everything.

33
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,520
I loved you unconditionally.

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,460
And who was it that brutally stomped
all over that love?

35
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,630
It was you!

36
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,200
Tell me.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
To me, the woman who loved you...

38
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,370
To my family...

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,040
To my dad...

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,800
To our Eun Ho...

41
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,370
Just what did you do?

42
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,710
Until the day you die,

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,610
you don't have the right
to say that word.

44
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,490
What is it?

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,830
Stop acting like
you have no cares in the world.

46
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,760
Do you have any idea
what I just did?

47
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,630
I just saved your neck.

48
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,070
Jae In almost had you cornered,
and I'm the one who stopped her!

49
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,410
- Okay, explain.
- Jae In found the double contract.

50
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,180
Where?

51
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,640
She went through my email
on my laptop and found it.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Are you out of your mind?

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,850
How could you be so careless
with it?

54
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,690
I'd just gotten a new laptop,
so I didn't have a chance to secure it.

55
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,060
This wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't fired me.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,860
Hwang Gi Chan,
are you even listening to me?

57
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,000
I said I just saved your neck.

58
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,100
- So what?
- Take back that talk of a divorce.

59
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,640
You would've been finished today
if it weren't for me. Got it?

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,300
Don't you ever get sick of this?

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,810
Every day, we yell and fight.

62
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,010
Did we get married just
to live like this?

63
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,680
Then let's stop fighting.

64
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,710
All you have to do
is have a change of heart.

65
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,050
Delete everything saved
in your email.

66
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,690
You have to, for both our sakes.

67
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,360
I'll handle the rest,
so stay out of it.

68
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,460
You can leave now.

69
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,990
I'm about to leave for the day, too.

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,660
We're married.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,400
You're treating me like an employee,
but I'm your wife.

72
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,170
I will never, ever divorce you.

73
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,510
(Designer Kang Jae In)

74
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,050
Jae In, are you okay?

75
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,950
Why are you here?
I told you not to come.

76
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,420
I couldn't even get the evidence.

77
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,120
I came because I wanted to see you.

78
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,690
Are you sure you're not hurt?

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,530
I guess I should have printed it out
instead of emailing it.

80
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,030
I was in such a rush to get it sent.

81
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,470
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
What for?

83
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,310
Your sister.

84
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,950
I was desperate to find the evidence
Do Hee was investigating,

85
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,580
but I ended up being
of no help at all.

86
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,920
Don't say that.

87
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,920
Finding the truth is important,
but your safety is more important.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,530
Never act on your own again.

89
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,130
Okay?

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,340
I can't let Jae In dig any deeper
into H and K Company.

91
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,980
I have to figure something out
so I don't disappoint.

92
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,210
Heading out for the day?

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,280
Do you have a moment?

94
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,060
Mr. Lee and DH Holdings...

95
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,890
You two seem to be closer
than I thought.

96
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,160
I mean,
sharing an office is no small thing.

97
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,070
You seem to have something
on your mind.

98
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,070
So let's not waste time.
Just say what you mean.

99
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,670
To be honest,
my relationship with DH Holdings...

100
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,570
isn't exactly good.

101
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,880
We were actually about to end
our business relationship.

102
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,010
We're maintaining the status quo
for now.

103
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,880
It's embarrassing to admit it,
but that is how things are.

104
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,050
So you think I might team up...

105
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,790
with DH Holdings and put you
at a disadvantage.

106
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,490
I suppose you might think that.

107
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm not so sure.

108
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,200
If that's what you think,
I'm a little disappointed.

109
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,970
I'm a professional.

110
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,970
I don't let personal feelings
get in the way of my work.

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,410
I was about to discuss the art
with you.

112
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,880
A couple of my VIP customers...

113
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,420
are quite interested
in one of your pieces.

114
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,320
Does that mean a sale is possible?

115
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,190
Isn't that what I'm here for?

116
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,130
Okay, I will be in touch soon.

117
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,110
They said they'd buy it
no matter the cost.

118
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:21,280
I'm counting on you.
I'll make sure you're paid well.

119
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,020
There's a right owner
for each piece.

120
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,150
Just give it some time.

121
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,890
Gi Chan, play with me. I'm bored.

122
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,160
Are you playing "Guess the Animal?"

123
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,230
Get out.

124
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,960
Come on, let's play.

125
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,070
I said, get out! Just get out!

126
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,980
I must have built up a tolerance
to my medication...

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,720
because it doesn't seem
to be working anymore.

128
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,190
I see you've been eating poorly.

129
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,860
Any other symptoms
besides stomach cramps?

130
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,560
Stomach cramps, maybe...

131
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,700
The stomach pains have gotten
a lot worse lately.

132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,000
I have indigestion and feel bloated.

133
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,170
I'm sure it's stress,
but I feel so drained.

134
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,040
Please prescribe something stronger.

135
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,940
Have you eaten anything today,
by any chance?

136
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,380
No.

137
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,950
In that case, why don't we run
some detailed tests?

138
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,860
Can't you just give me
a prescription?

139
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,220
I'd rather not go
through the hassle.

140
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,990
The medicine will only be effective
if it's for the right symptoms.

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,060
You're already here,
so you might as well.

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,240
Are you going to skip work
and just lie there moping all day?

143
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,880
I'm not going.

144
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,950
If you skip work, at least eat.
Come on!

145
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,420
I don't want to.

146
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,980
You brat. You'll starve to death
if you don't eat.

147
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,090
Is this a funeral?

148
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:45,160
Even mourners eat at a funeral home!
Why won't you eat?

149
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,890
This is all your fault, Mom.
How do you expect me to eat?

150
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,630
You told me that man died in a fire.

151
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,900
And you took the insurance money
and ran, didn't you?

152
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,300
I had no idea you'd done that.
Seriously, I had no clue.

153
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,540
And if you knew?
What difference would it have made?

154
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,240
It's already over and done with.

155
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,310
When I think about
how they bled us dry,

156
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,310
that didn't cover
what they really owe us.

157
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,120
We should properly apologize
to them, Mom.

158
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,820
What they took was
for pain and suffering.

159
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,690
They couldn't press charges legally.
So return the insurance cash...

160
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,160
Shut your mouth!

161
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,700
See?
This happens when you don't eat.

162
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,400
You're talking nonsense
from weakness.

163
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,740
Return what? Are you kidding?

164
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,270
Talking to you, I just realized
I can't just be sitting here.

165
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,780
I'm going to get back the money
they took from me.

166
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,780
Oh, Mom!

167
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,460
Did I hear what I think I heard?
What did you just say?

168
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,360
I said give me my money! My money!

169
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,790
I may have helped myself
to your husband's insurance money,

170
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,960
but does that give you the right
to take six million dollars from me?

171
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,100
Your husband's insurance payout
was less than that.

172
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,840
I used that as start-up money, fine.

173
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,940
But the rest of the six million
is my own money that I earned.

174
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,040
Even after you take your cut,
you should at least give me half.

175
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,910
I can't believe you're so evil.

176
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,580
What? What did you say?

177
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,720
I didn't want to sink to your level,
so I was going to let it go.

178
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,220
But listen here, Noh Sook Ja.

179
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,890
You couldn't even pay the rent
that I cut in half.

180
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,560
You were mooching off of me!

181
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,100
If you stole that much money then,
we must factor in inflation, right?

182
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,930
By that calculation,
you'd be out on the street now.

183
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,000
Fine, then a quarter of it.

184
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,440
Don't you know investment managers
get paid a commission?

185
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,340
Cut the nonsense and get out now.

186
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,610
Your son is desperately trying to
kill those news stories.

187
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,050
What if I give another interview?

188
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,420
Should I tell them
an arsonist's shameless family...

189
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,720
is demanding money from the victims?

190
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,030
Darn it. This is why cash is king.

191
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,960
To think she was once so quiet...

192
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,800
is now daring to run her mouth off
at me.

193
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,070
You're one to talk about "daring."

194
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,170
That's not for you to say,
after daring to go after my brother.

195
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,940
You're the one who belongs
in a mental hospital, Noh Sook Ja.

196
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,210
That's it. I've had enough of you.

197
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,640
Had enough of what?

198
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,880
Get out! Get lost!

199
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,450
Darn it.

200
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,450
- Goodness...
- Get out!

201
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,750
My gosh! My bag!

202
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,760
Gosh.

203
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,760
Darn that ignorant brute.
She's all brawn and no brains!

204
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Darn it.

205
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,100
I want to see my princess.

206
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,640
But my princess says she doesn't
want to.

207
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,570
But I still want to see her.

208
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,950
You little brat!
Give that to me right now!

209
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,450
Must I smash this to keep you away?

210
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,150
Give me that knife!

211
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,220
- No!
- Give it to me.

212
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,920
I won't give it to you, Mom.
You're a wicked witch.

213
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,460
I'm not giving it to a villain!

214
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,390
Get back here!

215
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,470
Noh Sook Ja is a horrible woman.
Why did she come here again?

216
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,040
It looks like she came by to spout
more of her nonsense.

217
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,400
Mr. Do, you're going to
give yourself a heart attack.

218
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,710
Let me get you an iced coffee.
Please, come in.

219
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,140
(YL Planning and Design Team)

220
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,880
You've been through a lot lately,
haven't you?

221
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,520
It's been quite the spectacle.

222
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,020
This is a year I'll never forget.

223
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,090
My birth secret,
finding out who my parents are...

224
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,400
Like you said,
it's gotten easier with time.

225
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,130
But seeing our mom sick
has been tough.

226
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,810
I'm still getting used to it.
Don't worry.

227
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,510
I'll get through this,
just like everything else.

228
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,550
I never knew my little brother
was such a strong man.

229
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,030
Kang Jae In.

230
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,600
And here I thought
you'd gotten smarter,

231
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,800
but you're still the same idiot.

232
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,940
Did you really think I'd just leave
the emails on this laptop?

233
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,740
Jae In, what's on the laptop?
What were you looking for?

234
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,380
Here, take it.
Check it all you want.

235
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,150
Instead of trying to steal it
like the thieving tramp you are.

236
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,590
Who are you calling a tramp?
Look who's talking.

237
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,220
Seung Woo. Just ignore her.

238
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,030
You really don't want to cross me.

239
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,790
What now? Is that a threat?

240
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,730
It is.

241
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,600
Hwang Ji Ho.

242
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,070
Just as I suspected.

243
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,710
Does Hwang Gi Chan know
that he isn't his biological son?

244
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,380
Don't be ridiculous!
Do you think he'd believe you?

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,120
Who knows?
Maybe he will, maybe he won't.

246
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,790
- Want to find out?
- We're at work.

247
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,220
Let's just drop it.

248
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,990
Fine. Let's stop.

249
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,870
CEO Catherine,
I'll find that double contract,

250
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,030
so you'd better watch your back.

251
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,280
Aren't you supposed to be working?

252
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,480
Stop slacking off
and do your job properly.

253
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,520
You heard her, right?
So just do your job properly.

254
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,870
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

255
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,300
This quarter's operating profit
will likely be in the red.

256
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,940
We have a lot of new projects,
don't we?

257
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,380
It's too early to discuss
their performance.

258
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,150
We can aim for more operating profit
in the fourth quarter.

259
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,690
However, the bank loans you received
to fund new business ventures...

260
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,120
are in urgent need of repayment.

261
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,860
Can't we just request an extension
from the bank?

262
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,130
Well...

263
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,230
The bank denied the request.

264
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,430
Due to rumors both inside and out,

265
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,670
the banking community's view
of your creditworthiness...

266
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,970
is not exactly favorable.

267
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,640
What about
Director Kang Mi Ran's faction?

268
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,510
She's been covertly meeting
with the board of directors.

269
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,120
Primarily, the neutral members
of the board.

270
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,090
However, if your personal
and company debts are not resolved,

271
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,260
even our allies on the board will
likely be forced to side with them.

272
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,040
Have some tea.

273
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,540
I wanted to talk to you
somewhere more private.

274
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,640
Maybe we could step out
for a bit now?

275
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,850
What I did to you was wrong,

276
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,720
and I want to apologize again.
I'm so sorry.

277
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,190
You may not know this,

278
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,790
but before I moved in
with Gi Chan here in Korea,

279
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,760
I struggled to raise Ji Ho
all by myself in the States.

280
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,630
That's why when it comes to Ji Ho,
I guess I get a bit oversensitive.

281
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,110
As you can probably tell,

282
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,010
it's not like I'm treated
like a queen in this house,

283
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,940
or that I'm living
in the lap of luxury.

284
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,550
My position in this house
is precarious.

285
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,280
But if they also find out
Ji Ho's secret...

286
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,990
Please, just give me
a little more time.

287
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,520
I'll talk to Gi Chan.
I'll try to persuade him.

288
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,930
I've heard just about enough.

289
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,100
How can you be so shameless?

290
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,000
Then and now,

291
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,840
Kang Se Ri,

292
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,370
it's always been all about you.

293
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,740
It's disgusting,

294
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,180
so don't you dare pretend
you're worried about Ji Ho.

295
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,410
Teo, please. I'm begging you.

296
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,950
I swear, this is going to kill me.

297
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Then go ahead and die.

298
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,550
Gi Chan! Hey, Gi Chan!

299
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,120
Can you look at my drawing?

300
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,330
Not now, Gi Man.

301
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,740
Honey, you're home early.

302
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,400
What about dinner?

303
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,810
I'm not hungry.

304
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,570
Don't come in.
I'm going to get some rest.

305
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,390
I want to be alone.

306
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,900
I drew this. It's good, right?

307
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,660
I have another one.

308
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I drew it!

309
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,440
And another one.

310
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,910
"Stay strong, Dad."

311
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,810
That's strange.

312
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,620
But Dad passed away.

313
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,720
I'll go ask Mom.

314
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,600
(Hwang Eun Ho)

315
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,730
Looks like some of Eun Ho's stuff
was still lying around.

316
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,980
(Stay strong, Dad!
I love you, Mom and Dad!)

317
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,580
Stay strong, Dad.

318
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,810
I love you, Mom and Dad.

319
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,180
Love, Eun Ho.

320
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,360
I guess Eun Ho could tell
you've been struggling lately.

321
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,860
He's grown into such
a thoughtful boy, hasn't he?

322
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,500
I'm rooting for you, too.

323
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,530
Stay strong, honey.

324
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,070
You always have me and Eun Ho
with you.

325
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,570
Don't forget that.

326
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,270
I love you.

327
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,010
(Stay strong, Dad!)

328
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,290
Fire!

329
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,090
It wasn't me.

330
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
It wasn't me!

331
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,100
It must be that woman
from the chicken shop today.

332
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,040
I bet that's why I'm so rattled.

333
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,810
Why on earth would her husband
be in my dream?

334
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,310
I'd almost completely forgotten
what he looked like.

335
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,220
The fire was just blazing.

336
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,260
I can't sleep like this.
I need a drink.

337
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,170
Darn it.

338
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,780
What did I do that was so wrong?
What?

339
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,310
If they were in my shoes,

340
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,180
do you think
they wouldn't have done the same?

341
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,380
I lost my husband
and was saddled with three kids,

342
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,790
what choice did I have?
We had to eat.

343
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,390
What am I supposed to do
if my mind is just sharp that way?

344
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,460
She should've looked after
her own husband.

345
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:22,380
(Stay strong, Dad!
I love you, Mom and Dad!)

346
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,850
Honey.

347
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Jae In...

348
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,910
You're still up?

349
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,880
Have you been drinking?

350
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,920
I had a terrible nightmare,
so I had a little drink.

351
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,720
Unbelievable.

352
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,820
The chicken place woman's husband
appears in my dream and keeps me up.

353
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,290
My six million dollars.

354
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,660
A bunch of rotten scoundrels.

355
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,070
How can they be so shameless
after gobbling up someone else's money?

356
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,070
They'll get what's coming to them.

357
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
That's enough.

358
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,340
How are we any different from them?

359
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,710
We're different.

360
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,050
Of course, we're different.

361
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,480
It was just some insurance money.

362
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,780
How could that ever compare
to my six million dollars?

363
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,190
Were you ever happy...

364
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,460
with the money you earned that way?

365
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,990
What's there to be unhappy about?

366
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,660
If they'd gotten
the insurance money,

367
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,130
they'd have just wasted it by now.

368
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,070
I have a good eye
and a nose for investing.

369
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,470
That's how it grew this much.

370
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,840
Is that a crime?

371
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,610
I feel miserable right now.

372
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,740
I fought tooth and nail
to take over YL Group,

373
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,150
and I have everything I ever wanted.

374
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,680
I thought money was everything
in life.

375
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,020
Just like you said,
I thought it was happiness.

376
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
But I was wrong.

377
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,090
I'm not happy at all.

378
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,060
- I feel so empty.
- Don't give me that nonsense.

379
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,070
You only think such useless things
because you're swimming in money.

380
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,800
Try having no money for a change.

381
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,070
Every single day is torment.

382
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,070
I feel empty.

383
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,940
I don't see any reason
to go on living like this!

384
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,950
The only reason you feel unhappy now
is because you got swindled,

385
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,750
and you're just stressed
because you're a little tight on cash.

386
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,020
Gi Chan.
Once money starts rolling in again,

387
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,720
your misery will end,
and you'll be happy again.

388
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,330
Mother, please! Enough about money!

389
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,760
Can you please just stop talking
about money?

390
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,300
Have you heard a single word
I've said?

391
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,340
I'm telling you I'm struggling
and that I'm miserable,

392
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,310
so you should be comforting me.
How can all you talk about be money?

393
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,380
Listen to him.
Gosh, you're impossible.

394
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,180
What did I just say?

395
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,780
I told you money solves everything.
Money!

396
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,850
Money is the be-all and end-all.

397
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,220
How is it that for you,
everything boils down to money?

398
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,660
Happiness, love,
success, relationships...

399
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,390
It's all about money!

400
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,930
It's that twisted way of thinking
that ruined me, Mother.

401
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,600
That's why I lost Jae In!

402
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,870
- Shut up!
- I was busy scrambling for more...

403
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,010
and I ended up losing everyone
I held dear.

404
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,510
This is all your fault.

405
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,410
If it weren't for you,

406
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,440
I wouldn't be this miserable!

407
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,220
Darn it. Get your story straight.

408
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,150
Who lost his head over some girl
and ruined this family?

409
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,460
It was you!

410
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,090
If you'd believed me when I said
she was faking her amnesia,

411
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,530
you wouldn't have been
made a fool of.

412
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,300
If money means nothing to you,

413
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,170
then pay me back for raising you.

414
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,840
I was cheated out
of six million dollars,

415
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,540
so you can give me my money back!

416
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,740
You lunatic.

417
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,860
(YL group)

418
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,070
So, this is the price range
you're asking for per piece.

419
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,640
I'll keep this in mind
when I negotiate the deal.

420
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,210
We discussed this last time.

421
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,150
What's the status on meeting
with the artist?

422
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,050
Shouldn't I be discussing that
with Director Noh Sook Ja?

423
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,750
My mother has a lot
on her plate right now.

424
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,420
Regarding the paintings,
you can see me or talk to her.

425
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,690
That's why she's here with us today.

426
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
You just focus on YL Group.

427
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,930
I'll handle the discussions
about the paintings with Teo.

428
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,270
Alright, that works for me.

429
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,670
Right, there's a favor
I'd like to ask.

430
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,140
Since you're the chairman
of YL Group,

431
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,640
it should be easy for you
to find someone in Korea, right?

432
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,310
Of course. I'd be happy to help.

433
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,650
Who are you looking for?

434
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,820
Actually, I have a younger sister...

435
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,190
whom I was separated from
a long time ago.

436
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,990
I heard that she was now in Korea.

437
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,930
What's your sister's name?

438
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
Catherine.

439
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,360
Catherine?

440
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,970
What a coincidence.

441
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,610
I know someone with the same name.

442
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,380
Catherine.

443
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,010
Really?

444
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,250
It's possible she's my sister.

445
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,550
Would it be possible for me
to meet her?

446
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,590
I don't think she's your sister.

447
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,420
Catherine is her American name.

448
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,630
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

449
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,660
Oh, so you're Catherine.

450
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,260
That's your American name?

451
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,400
I'll see what I can do
about finding your sister.

452
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,300
No, that's alright.

453
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,170
She's my sister,
so I should be the one to find her.

454
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,880
Well, it seems we're done here.
I'll be on my way.

455
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,950
Oh, would you like to have dinner
with us later?

456
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,020
We're staying in the same house,
but we've barely seen each other.

457
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,420
I feel bad that I haven't been
a better host.

458
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,520
I have plans.

459
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,560
The people from DH Holdings
invited me to a company dinner.

460
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,460
They want me to experience
a real Korean company dinner.

461
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,600
I hear Korean chicken barbecue
is famous.

462
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Please, don't mind me.

463
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,300
You two have a wonderful evening.

464
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:06,920
Oh, sit back down.
You're our guest, so don't help.

465
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,420
Enjoy the food.

466
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,820
- Let me know if you need more.
- Okay.

467
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,060
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

468
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Thanks, Mom!

469
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,660
- Enjoy.
- I will.

470
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
I'm here.

471
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,030
Hey, you're here. Come on in.

472
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,030
Hello.

473
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,870
Hey, glad you could make it.
Have a seat.

474
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,500
Please, don't be so formal.

475
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,970
All right, then. Sit down.

476
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,180
Gosh! Let's dig in.
I'm really looking forward to this.

477
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,220
- Please, help yourself.
- Right.

478
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,480
- Eat up.
- Okay.

479
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,550
Yes.

480
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,420
- Here, go ahead and have some.
- Thank you.

481
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,130
I have plans.

482
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,330
The people from DH Holdings
invited me to a company dinner.

483
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,950
Are you okay?
Is it too spicy for you?

484
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,520
That's when you have a drink.

485
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,660
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

486
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,330
- It's delicious, isn't it?
- It's so good.

487
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,430
You had Jae In right by your side,

488
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,600
the most precious person
in the world,

489
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,600
and you're the one
who threw it all away.

490
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,410
So don't come around now
acting like you're somebody.

491
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,340
It's pathetic.

492
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,110
You catch on quick.

493
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,750
Jae In is a very charming woman.

494
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,720
Of course, I'm interested.

495
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,850
I'm interested in her.

496
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,300
I know, right?

497
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,270
Come here. We need to talk.

498
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,870
I have nothing to say to you.

499
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,310
I thought your project
with Designer L was finished,

500
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,380
so we have nothing else
to talk about.

501
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,690
Let's save work-related matters
for tomorrow.

502
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
That's enough.

503
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,880
(Queen's House)

504
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,920
I said I wouldn't get involved
if you two met, and I won't.

505
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,820
But at least have some class.

506
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,690
Are you proud of cheating?

507
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,020
If you're going to see her,
do it in secret.

508
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,230
What do you think of Jae In?

509
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,700
You two just look so good together.

510
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,760
He says we look great together.

511
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,430
You'll have to excuse him.
He's crazy about his older sister.

512
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,200
Well, I'm a fool for you too,
you know.

513
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,570
I guess I was jealous.

514
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,280
I heard from Assistant Manager
Kang Seung Woo.

515
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,680
About your dinner plans with Teo.

516
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,480
It's not like I have
any right to object,

517
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,120
but I liked you first.

518
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,790
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
