and backgrounds...)

00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,410
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,550
(Episode 41)

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,750
You found it
in your mommy's handbag?

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,850
Yes.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,020
Do you know which handbag it was?

8
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,320
I do.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,570
It was this one.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,550
Yes, it was the bag she had
on the day of the accident.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,380
Why was Gi Chan's cuff link...

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,690
found in Ms. Do Hee's bag?

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,360
Hey, we shouldn't go in and out
while Yun Hee is in a foul mood.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,730
Let's call it a day early. Okay?

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,900
May I come in?

16
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,340
What is it?

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,940
It's this.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,410
So, he was missing a cuff link...

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,980
when he came home
on the night of the accident,

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,980
and it was found
in Do Hee's handbag?

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,250
Yes.

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,020
We don't know for sure
if this was the same cuff link.

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,280
I had it custom-made,
so I know it's the right one.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,250
There's only one pair of those,

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,990
and his initials are on it, too.

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,530
I remember asking him
because one of them was missing.

27
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,730
He made up an excuse
and said he lost it.

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,430
I left the other one in the case,

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,170
but Se Ri must've thrown it out
when she married him.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,070
She must have.

31
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,570
This is just a speculation,
but I didn't see her...

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,240
picking up a dropped cuff link
in the CCTV footage.

33
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,450
If she found it at work,

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,010
she would've
returned it to him then.

35
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,620
Yes, Do Hee was a type
who would've returned it right away.

36
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,420
Gi Chan might have been there
when the accident broke out.

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,860
It broke out while my mom was
driving to that hotel.

38
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,900
Come to think of it now,
Gi Chan tried his best...

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
to prove that my mom was the culprit
instead of Seung Woo.

40
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,530
Where are you going?

41
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,100
You won't get any answer
even if you press him now.

42
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,450
What are you all doing here,
leaving me out of this?

43
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,120
I had to ask your uncle something.

44
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,720
You said
you wanted some snacks, right?

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,450
Let's go.
Let me whip up something delicious.

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

47
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,820
Bye.

48
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,330
But you know,

49
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,900
this is hard to understand.

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900
This is also just a speculation.

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,310
If Do Hee had picked up...

52
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,310
the cuff link
at the time of the accident,

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,280
it could have meant that
Hwang Gi Chan was the culprit...

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,310
and not Ms. Kang's mother.

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,480
That's what I don't get.

56
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,620
Maybe Ms. Kang is lying...

57
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,750
in an attempt
to vindicate her mom...

58
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,220
from the murder charges.

59
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,290
What if she's trying
to put the blame on Hwang Gi Chan?

60
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,230
The dash cam footage...

61
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,260
clearly showed
her younger brother's car.

62
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,430
What does this mean?

63
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,900
He watched the accident unfold
and then went up and saw her?

64
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,240
Anyway, that was the car
that caused the accident,

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,310
so it had to be
either Ms. Kang's mother or brother.

66
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,610
That's an unchanging fact.

67
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,280
No, there may be another truth.

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,420
The dash cam footage
that came home seems suspicious.

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,850
It only showed the moment
when Do Hee got into the accident.

70
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,260
There may be more important footage
before and after that.

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,260
You said it didn't show
the sender's address, right?

72
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,030
No, doesn't it seem suspicious
that it only showed the accident?

73
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,530
I don't know.

74
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,500
They might have wanted to remain anonymous
in case of retaliation.

75
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,640
I need to find out
what really happened that night.

76
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,370
I'm sure that punk,
Hwang Gi Chan, surely knows.

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,280
Uncle Oh Seong, I have to return
to that company as soon as possible.

78
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,310
I'm going to work.

79
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,620
Are you going somewhere?

80
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,490
You don't have to know. Bye.

81
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,890
Hey, wait. I forgot to mention this.

82
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,060
You know
who Dr. Kim Do Yun is, right?

83
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,400
The doctor at your company's clinic.

84
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,100
Yes, what about him?

85
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,570
Na Ra is head over heels in love
with that doctor.

86
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,640
She's making a scene
and saying it has to be him.

87
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,570
So, I was thinking
of making him her spouse...

88
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,210
What are you talking about?

89
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,910
He's a sexual molester.

90
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,280
You're considering him
as Na Ra's spouse?

91
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,420
And you already know
his history with Jae In!

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,220
Well, I heard
nothing happened between them.

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,720
Anyway, did you just say
he's a sexual molester?

94
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,890
That doctor is a sex offender?

95
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:49,960
Yes.

96
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,500
He was caught in the act
while doing something disgusting at work.

97
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,200
I'm going to work, Mom.

98
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,340
Good grief.

99
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,610
That hurts! Why did you slap me?

100
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,210
How can you want to be
with a sex offender of all men?

101
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,380
What are you talking about? Who's...

102
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,850
Are you talking about Dr. Do Yun?

103
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,980
Don't even bring up his name...

104
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,150
or think of seeing him.

105
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,190
You can't do this
even over my dead body,

106
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,090
no, even over my dissipating spirit.

107
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,960
He's not someone who would do that.

108
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,390
You have the wrong information.

109
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,530
The chairman just told me...

110
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,800
he did that at work.

111
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,370
Did you see him do it? No, right?

112
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,670
Why do you keep slandering him?

113
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,900
I don't care if you believe it or not.
He's a sex offender.

114
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,440
And just focus on doing your job
when you're at work.

115
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,770
I'll quit, then!

116
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,310
I don't care what you two say.
I'm on Dr. Kim's side.

117
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,580
Get a grip on yourself!

118
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,450
I'm leaving.

119
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,220
Goodness.

120
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,920
What about work?

121
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,820
I'm not going to work
until he gives his permission.

122
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,160
Jeez, that immature girl.

123
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,730
And why are these awful people
getting involved in our lives?

124
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,770
Something doesn't feel right.
It must be this house...

125
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,600
or our bad luck.
I know something is going on.

126
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,410
I need to go right now.
I can't just sit here.

127
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,890
Bo Ram went to the kindergarten.

128
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,160
Do Yun went out
to do something, too.

129
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,460
But of course,
he didn't go to YL Group.

130
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,800
Yun Hee.

131
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,600
Yun Hee.

132
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,710
I couldn't tell you this until now,
thinking you'd be too heartbroken.

133
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,210
But Do Hee must've found...

134
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,410
her superior's corruption
before she died.

135
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,110
Her boss, whom she spoke to
about the matter, got fired,

136
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,880
so she must've had
a tough time all alone since then.

137
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,780
Anyway, that's that.

138
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,090
That and the speculation of her affair...

139
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,260
all revolved around
a man named Hwang Gi Chan.

140
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,530
You've seen him on the news, right?

141
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,730
He's the chairman of YL now.

142
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,700
Do Hee had met him
right before the accident.

143
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,600
- Why?
- That's what Do Yun is...

144
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,070
trying to find out.

145
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,240
He wants to know why they met outside
instead of the office...

146
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,010
and why she had to die.

147
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,810
We have to find out the truth
to let Do Hee rest in peace.

148
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,780
I would've done the same
even if I were Do Yun.

149
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,620
I'll also join YL Group soon...

150
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,590
with Do Yun by my side.

151
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,030
And it's not because
I'm still hung up on my past.

152
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,460
That may just be my story,

153
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,030
but we should right the wrong
when it comes to Do Hee's matter.

154
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,200
So, don't worry about Do Yun.

155
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,170
I'll protect him from now on,

156
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,570
so he won't get hurt again.

157
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,310
He's not going to give up
even if you keep opposing this.

158
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,310
I tried, and it didn't work.

159
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,680
She was his only sister.
How can he give up?

160
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,960
Exposing the truth is
the only way for you and Do Yun...

161
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,030
to let go of Do Hee In peace.

162
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,100
I understand how you feel,

163
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,330
but do think about that. Okay?

164
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,900
I'm going to work.

165
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,550
All right.
I'll see you at the hospital later.

166
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,290
Don't be late. Bye.

167
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,630
You didn't go to work?

168
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,230
Whatever. Stop talking to me.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,110
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

170
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,510
I told you to refrain
from coming to my office.

171
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,280
Honey, I found out
who sent that edited photo of me...

172
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,520
in a wedding gown.

173
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,420
- Who was it?
- You can hear it from her.

174
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,160
Why won't you come in? Come on in.

175
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,590
Gi Chan.

176
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,730
It was me.

177
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,300
I shouldn't have done that.

178
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm sorry.
I must've been out of my mind.

179
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,770
I didn't know
you'd do something like that.

180
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,970
He was really suspicious of me.

181
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,350
I apologize, Gi Chan. I'm sorry.

182
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,050
I was behind everything.

183
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,780
She has never taken a photo like that
with another man...

184
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,550
or been married before.

185
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,720
I'm her aunt, so I would know.

186
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Why did you send me that photo?

187
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,300
You'd have to get something
by coming between us.

188
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,170
I heard you used to be a prosecutor.
I can see how sharp you are.

189
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,900
Well, the thing is,

190
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,270
it's all because of money.

191
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,280
Actually, some reporter told me...

192
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,810
that Se Ri was married to you.

193
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,680
- A reporter?
- Yes.

194
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,480
That reporter...

195
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,750
gave me some money and asked me...

196
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,260
to secretly leave
that edited photo with you.

197
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,530
I'm sorry, Se Ri.

198
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,660
I was blinded by money.

199
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,070
I was just too greedy.

200
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,100
Did you say it was a reporter?

201
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,070
Did you get a business card?

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,040
What? A business card?

203
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,240
No.

204
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,910
There's no way it was a reporter.

205
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,580
Why would a reporter do that?

206
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,480
Aunt Myeong Hee,
do you remember that person's face?

207
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,650
Yes, I'll recognize him
when I see him.

208
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,420
He was a young man.

209
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,760
Do you have a photo of Kim Do Yun...

210
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,590
you took before?

211
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,090
Yes, I do.

212
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,630
Aunt, do you recognize him?

213
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,300
Aunt Myeong Hee.

214
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,770
Right. Yes, it was him.

215
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,280
I clearly remember him.

216
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,280
So, this is how he gets revenge?

217
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,920
Did I do a good job?

218
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
I should've gone into acting.

219
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,830
It was fun and exciting.

220
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,230
Did you bring your passport?

221
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,160
Of course, I have it here.

222
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,770
This is the address
to the home in the US. Stay there.

223
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,230
Thank you.

224
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,800
And you'll send me
living expenses, right?

225
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,540
I'll send it every month,

226
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,070
so don't do anything stupid
and live quietly.

227
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,640
Fine.

228
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,910
My life is on a highway,
thanks to my successful niece.

229
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,080
I won't have to worry
about my retirement anymore.

230
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,820
Anyway, who do you think
that reporter really was?

231
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,090
Maybe Ji Seong Jun,
the guy in the photo,

232
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,860
- tried to get his...
- Aunt Myeong Hee!

233
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,290
Stop talking nonsense, and go now!

234
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,530
What? Jeez, girl.

235
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,000
- Dinner?
- Yes.

236
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,940
- Why don't we eat out?
- That sounds wonderful.

237
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,340
Or I can make something...

238
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,180
No, I'm not a good cook.

239
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,340
Let's eat out.

240
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,150
Okay.

241
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,690
Ms. Kang Jae In.

242
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,420
Did you turn in a copy
of your resident registration to the HR?

243
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,560
Yes.

244
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,230
Do you really live at the address...

245
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,960
written on that file?

246
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,530
Why are you asking?

247
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,800
We need your actual address...

248
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,570
so we can send you mail at home.

249
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,510
Why would the company need
to send me anything by mail?

250
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,080
You need to answer...

251
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,250
instead of talking back
when your superior asks a question.

252
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,310
I have no reason to tell you
anything about my private life,

253
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,680
including where I live.

254
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,360
Mother.

255
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,630
What are you doing?

256
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,860
It's because you're spreading
evil energy all around.

257
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,540
Oh, dear deities.
Please drive out this evil spirit.

258
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,340
Please drive her out of here.

259
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,740
Oh, dear deities.

260
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:29,550
What do you think you're doing?
Get out of here!

261
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,620
What's going on?

262
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,620
Oh, goodness. My heart.

263
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,220
How dare you scream at me?

264
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,590
I'm the mother
of YL's chairman, Hwang Gi Chan!

265
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,390
Are you allowed to do this
if you're the chairman's mother?

266
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,360
How dare you harass my sister?

267
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,500
You all need to stop.

268
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,830
Ms. Kang Se Ri,
escort your mother-in-law back home.

269
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,840
Mother, please calm down,
and let's go. Come on.

270
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
Begone, evil spirits.

271
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,380
I thought you had a meeting.

272
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,950
You should go.

273
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,990
Yes.

274
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,830
Why does this happen every time?

275
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,700
Did you get a job here
to make a scene like this?

276
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,060
It wasn't my fault.

277
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,170
Then, whose fault is this?

278
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,770
This wouldn't have happened
if you weren't here.

279
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,080
Many of the terms must've been tough
for a Korean company to accept,

280
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,580
but I'm glad and happy
that we can work together.

281
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,850
It wasn't easy
to convince the board,

282
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,020
but they had high anticipation
and deep trust...

283
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,160
in the synergy effect
our contract with DH Holdings would bring,

284
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,060
so we reached
a wonderful conclusion.

285
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,300
I'd love to meet
the director of the Korean branch...

286
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,030
and share our insights
as soon as possible.

287
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,670
I plan
to set up a meeting very soon.

288
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,640
I'll set up your office perfectly
to match all your needs.

289
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,270
I'll see you soon.

290
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,210
Goodbye.

291
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,660
Mom, what suddenly brings you here
without a call?

292
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,830
Be quiet. My son. That word. Ex...

293
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,370
Yes, ex-quiz.

294
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,710
I wanted to escort her home,

295
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,510
but she insisted on visiting you.

296
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,010
How can I go against her?

297
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,250
Goodness. Begone. Go away.

298
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,560
Why are you here?
We said we'd meet at the hospital.

299
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,090
Right.

300
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,300
My stomach! It hurts so much!

301
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,100
I need to go now. Gosh, my stomach.

302
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,670
Honey!

303
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,440
Do you feel sick?

304
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,680
You were in the bathroom
for over 30 minutes.

305
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,580
We're going to be late. Let's go.

306
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,110
Wait, honey. I need to take a call.

307
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,520
Yes, Mr. Hong.
Goodness, an investment?

308
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,420
You want to invest
such a huge amount?

309
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,230
Yes, let's talk in person.

310
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,600
Honey, I don't think I can go today.

311
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,230
This guy who wants to invest
needs to see my plan.

312
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,370
What about the hospital appointment?

313
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
We can always make
another appointment,

314
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,810
but the fate of my business is
in this meeting.

315
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,780
You're on leave,
so I need to get back on my feet soon.

316
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,310
I have to go now. I'm sorry.

317
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,300
Do Hee.

318
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,800
Do Hee.

319
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,840
My beautiful daughter.

320
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,880
Do Hee.

321
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,140
Excuse me. Where is the office
of the chairman of YL Group?

322
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,210
Why do you need to go
to the chairman's office?

323
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,250
- Bring my daughter back.
- What do you think you're doing?

324
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,360
Bring my daughter back!

325
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,060
Bring my daughter back!

326
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,660
I said bring my daughter back!

327
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,990
You jerk!

328
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,600
Bring my daughter back!

329
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,700
You cursed jerk.

330
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,740
- You cursed jerk!
- Are you okay?

331
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,010
What did Do Hee ever do to you?

332
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,610
What did she do wrong
for you to kill her?

333
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,880
Why did you kill her?

334
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,560
Bring my daughter back!

335
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,630
Bring her back!

336
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,790
You got the wrong person.

337
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,470
Do Hee!

338
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,870
Do Hee...

339
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,410
Do Hee...

340
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,390
Have some. It's water.

341
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,860
I don't want any.

342
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,090
I'd rather drink water from sewage.

343
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,370
Have you calmed down?

344
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,500
First of all, let me apologize.

345
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,910
May your daughter rest in peace...

346
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,410
How dare you
bid her to rest in peace?

347
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,710
Don't you know who killed her?

348
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
I hope...

349
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,090
doing this helped you feel
at least a little better.

350
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,260
Doing something like this
can't make me feel better...

351
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,360
after the death of my child.

352
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,230
You probably don't have a kid.

353
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,030
If you did, you couldn't say that.

354
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,740
Your family broke Oh Seong's heart
and made him leave Korea...

355
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,970
and killed my daughter, too.

356
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,610
I don't care how prominent
the YL Group family is.

357
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,040
How can you people
destroy my family like this?

358
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,780
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,310
I believe in fate.

360
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,520
And I believe in karma, too.

361
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,050
You can't do this as a decent human.

362
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,290
All of you will be
punished by fate. I know it.

363
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,370
This is the money Oh Seong brought.
Let me return it to you.

364
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,510
It was Ms. Kim's severance pay,
so please accept it.

365
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,040
I'd be crazy to take this.

366
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,050
I don't want
your family's filthy money.

367
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,040
Thank you for your help back there.

368
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,990
Ms. Kang, what are you doing?

369
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,390
Show me the sample.

370
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,720
Right. Yes.

371
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,140
Where did she go?

372
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,470
(7 missed calls from Jae In)

373
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,650
Hello? I'm sorry.
My phone was on silent mode.

374
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,320
My mom?

375
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,950
Yes, okay.

376
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,060
Have a seat.

377
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,380
- Mom.
- Do it.

378
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,110
If that's what you can do for Do Hee,
you have to do it.

379
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,410
Do it.

380
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,290
Expose everything
so that her death is avenged.

381
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,220
Punish everyone
who needs to be punished.

382
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,360
You should do that
for Bo Ram's sake.

383
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,860
So, do it.

384
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,870
Okay. I'll make it happen.

385
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,600
(Managing Director)

386
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,750
Let's go home.

387
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,750
I made a reservation
at a nice restaurant.

388
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,380
Maybe next time.

389
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,650
You wanted to eat dinner.

390
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,550
I'm feeling kind of down.

391
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,720
Is it because of what happened
with Ms. Kim's mother this afternoon?

392
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,330
It wasn't your fault.

393
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
I know it's heartbreaking,
but you still need to eat dinner.

394
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,600
Aunt Mi Ran.

395
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,870
Do you know who my birth mother is?

396
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,080
Why do you
suddenly want to know that?

397
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,880
I just wanted to know.

398
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,950
Do you know?

399
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,460
I don't know, either.

400
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,290
But I'll look into it
if you want to find out.

401
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes, please look into it.

402
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,930
All right. Give me some time.

403
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,670
If you don't want dinner,
I'll leave first.

404
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,380
Mom, it has to be Dr. Kim
and nobody else...

405
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,890
What is this?

406
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,320
Is it water?

407
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,930
I asked a Catholic priest I know
for some Holy Water.

408
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,590
Water is just water.

409
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,530
Anyway, what's all this?

410
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,400
I stuffed my pillow
with red beans...

411
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,970
to fend off all evil spirits,
but it made my hair smell all day.

412
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,470
It smells like red bean porridge.

413
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm home.

414
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,850
What are you doing?

415
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,610
What's this?

416
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,450
Mom, have you become supernatural
without telling us?

417
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,650
- Good grief.
- Wait, what is this?

418
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,420
Hey, stop spraying that on me!

419
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,760
Jeez.

420
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,730
Mom, just stick with one faith.

421
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,600
So? What about the investment?
Will he do it?

422
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Yes, of course.

423
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:03,340
I'll make sure you live
the rest of your life in peace.

424
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,580
If you want to let me live in peace,

425
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,040
make sure you show up
at the next hospital appointment.

426
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,910
It's a famous OB-GYN clinic
with an infertility specialist,

427
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,480
and it's hard to schedule
an appointment.

428
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,420
Tell me when you can make it,
and I'll reschedule.

429
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,220
Would that work for you?

430
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,990
Yes, okay.

431
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,500
You should get some new tea.

432
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,330
The fragrance disappears in a few days
if you get a cheap one.

433
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,370
It still bothers me that
Ms. Noh runs the place across the hall.

434
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,440
They've become estranged
after their children divorced,

435
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,940
but they never got along anyway.

436
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,350
Director Do?
I'm talking to you about tea.

437
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,250
You need to get a new one.

438
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,150
Yes, okay.

439
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,260
Ms. Choi, I think...

440
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,290
you should reconsider...

441
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,630
working at that chicken place.

442
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,960
Why?

443
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,570
Did the owner tell me to quit?

444
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,230
She said that to me, Choi Ja Young?

445
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,070
It's not even a gallery.

446
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,940
That small little restaurant
doesn't even need me?

447
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,680
No, she didn't say
anything like that.

448
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,520
Actually, the pig's feet place
across the hall is...

449
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,250
owned by Gi Man and Ms. Noh.

450
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,160
That means she'll come by often.

451
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,190
Yes.

452
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,530
I hadn't thought of that before.

453
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,630
It must make you feel awkward,

454
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,070
so you should quit.

455
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,200
Why should I?

456
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,500
This isn't my first time
dealing with that crazy woman.

457
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,170
I don't plan to quit
because of that woman,

458
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,910
so don't mind it.

459
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,990
What are you doing, Ms. Kang?

460
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,790
Are you studying numbers?

461
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,760
Well, I forgot this password.

462
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,630
I can't remember it.

463
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,100
That happened to my teacher
at the kindergarten.

464
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,240
But she said she found it
when she inserted...

465
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,210
a tiny little key chain.

466
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,940
A tiny little key chain?

467
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,310
Bo Ram, did it look like this?

468
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,620
That's it!

469
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,690
Can you find the password now?

470
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,000
Yes, thank you.

471
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,100
I think I did, thanks to your help.

00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,410
What?

475
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,180
Kang Jae In will show herself
and do an interview to claim...

476
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,390
she's the real daughter of YL Group?

477
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,590
When?

478
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,890
Let me hang up for now.

479
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,640
I didn't want to come to work
because I wanted to.

480
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,370
I came because Mom said
she'd stop giving me pocket money.

481
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,940
It's me. Is Kang Jae In at work?

482
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,650
She took the day off?

483
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,180
All right.

484
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,690
You know that
the internal computer network...

485
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,460
and computers are
all up for a regular checkup, right?

486
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,860
Please remain in your office...

487
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,660
You handle it.

488
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,300
Dr. Kim!

489
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,500
You're near the office?

490
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,700
I can be there. I can totally come.

491
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,110
Yes, I know that place.
I'll be there now.

for making a move on my behalf.

Goodbye.

507
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,890
There was a malicious virus
or something in the server,

508
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:18,020
so they reinstalled the OS
and whatever.

509
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,820

so it's nothing to worry about.

You should have
some hot tea as you work.

Do you still
carry your laptop around?

513
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,820
You can probably leave it
in your office now. It's inconvenient.

514

This gives me peace of mind.

if I left important files there.

Thanks for the tea.

so go to sleep first.

DH Holdings and YL Group are
as good as one now.

make YL Group global.
