1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,780
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,980
(Episode 90)

5
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,630
What do you think you're doing?

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,900
A kidnapping? What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,710
I don't even know
why I'm doing this.

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,880
How can you not know?

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,610
I don't know! I just don't!

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,680
I think I can't live without you.

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,290
I can't stand seeing you
with some other guy!

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,160
I guess I'm still in love with you.

13
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,900
"Love?"

14
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,100
How dare you even say that word?

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,610
Have you forgotten...

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,810
what you did to me?

17
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,610
How can you...

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,010
say something like that
so shamelessly?

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,880
Jae In.

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,230
Don't say my name like that.
It makes me sick.

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,960
- Let's talk...
- Don't you dare say "love."

22
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,100
I gave you my everything.

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,740
I loved you unconditionally.

24
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,880
And who was it that brutally stomped
all over that love?

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
It was you!

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,250
Tell me.

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,880
To me, the woman who loved you...

28
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,420
To my family...

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,950
To my dad...

30
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,020
To our Eun Ho...

31
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,830
Just what did you do?

32
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,170
Until the day you die,

33
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,440
you don't have the right
to say the word.

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,840
Bo Ram, did you have a nice evening
walk with your uncle?

35
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,140
Yes.

36
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,380
But where we went is a secret.

37
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,690
Did you take her somewhere nice?

38
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,620
She's grinning from ear to ear.

39
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,790
Just the park.

40
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,690
I see...

41
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,360
She seems happy just being
with her uncle.

42
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,200
You must be tired.
Thanks for taking her.

43
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,270
Go on in and get some rest.

44
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,540
Okay. You get some rest too, Mom.

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,590
Hello? Jae In?

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,290
- Yes.
- Where are you?

47
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,590
Are you okay?

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,360
I just got home.

49
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,770
How's Bo Ram?
I'm worried she was scared.

50
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,440
I talked her through it,
so she's fine.

51
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,270
That's a relief.

52
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,870
Jae In, are you really okay?

53
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,480
Don't worry. Nothing happened.

54
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,520
Okay, get some rest then.
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
Okay.

56
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,350
See you tomorrow.

57
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,510
I think I can't live without you.

58
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,010
I can't stand seeing you
with some other guy!

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,380
I guess...

60
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,320
I'm still in love with you.

61
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,540
What were you doing
that made you so late?

62
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,950
It's none of your business.

63
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,050
Where have you been with Jae In?

64
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,880
I called Driver Kim to confirm.

65
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,190
He said you drove off
with Kang Jae In yourself.

66
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,190
So what were you two doing?

67
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,860
Are you a stalker?

68
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,560
I don't have to report to you,
so knock it off.

69
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,330
What do you mean you don't have to?

70
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,300
We're married. Or did you forget?

71
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,790
Mom, I'm home.

72
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,960
Who are you?

73
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,800
Mom, it's me.

74
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,640
Seung Woo. Your son.

75
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,970
Are you Seung Woo?

76
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,410
I am.

77
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,320
Oh, right. My son, Seung Woo.

78
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,390
You should dress a little neater.

79
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,790
Your father won't be happy
if he sees you.

80
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,460
Okay.

81
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,360
What's all this?

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,160
I know you love fruit.

83
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,930
I went and bought some
at the market.

84
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,840
You're always so thoughtful,
Seung Woo.

85
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,510
Jae In could learn a thing or two
from you.

86
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Mom.

87
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,550
I'm running late.
I have to get to work.

88
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,150
To where?

89
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Did you get a job?

90
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,620
I did.

91
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,250
When I get paid this month,

92
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,050
I'll buy you a new outfit.

93
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,060
Just hearing you say that
makes me happy.

94
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,670
Did you have a nice visit
with your mother?

95
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Yes.

96
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,150
You'll be late for work. Go on.

97
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,820
How have you been?

98
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,750
Great.

99
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,290
Hurry up and go.

100
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,260
I'll head out then.

101
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,570
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

102
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,840
What do you think you're doing?

103
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,780
Don't you dare lay a hand
on Jae In again.

104
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,390
Dragging her off like that
against her will is a crime.

105
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,620
And who do you think you are?

106
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,730
This is between Jae In and me.

107
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,090
- Stay out of it.
- Because...

108
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,330
I have feelings for her.

109
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,970
Don't you think that gives me
the right to interfere?

110
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,570
I can't stand by and watch you
mistreat the woman I love.

111
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,710
Especially from you,
a man Jae In despises.

112
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,480
That gives me all the more reason
to stop you!

113
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,280
Stay away...

114
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,220
from Jae In.

115
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
"The right?"

116
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,070
That crazy jerk.

117
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,080
Tae Ho?

118
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,410
The more I look at him,
the more I'm sure I've seen him before.

119
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,450
Where could I have seen him?

120
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,750
Right, that's it. The painting.

121
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,620
He's the guy who came to the gallery
looking for Choi Ja Young.

122
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,230
So what's he doing in my house?

123
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Where are you going?

124
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,840
Me? I was just going to go play
in the garden.

125
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,040
I told you that you're not allowed.

126
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,710
I told you that if you went
to the mall again,

127
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,040
I was going to tie you up.

128
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,880
Mom, you're a genius.

129
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,880
How did you know?
I didn't even say anything.

130
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,380
This is so frustrating.

131
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,790
Why, of all things,
did he have to hurt his head...

132
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,890
just to drive me this crazy?

133
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,130
I've carefully reviewed the contract
from DH Holdings.

134
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,590
Oh, you have?

135
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,930
So, have you made your decision?

136
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,770
I'll sign the contract as soon as
my project with Tae Ho is complete.

137
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,840
That's a wise decision.

138
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,710
But won't you need an office
to work with Tae Ho?

139
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,340
After the YL Group project ends,
I plan on looking for a studio.

140
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,710
Tae Ho is already looking into it.

141
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,620
Why go to all that trouble?
You can just work here, right?

142
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,850
Yes.
You'll be one of our designers soon.

143
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,990
So, of course, you can.

144
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,790
Would that be all right?

145
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
By all means.

146
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,260
I would love to see you every day.

147
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Yes.

148
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,400
- Excuse me.
- Come on in.

149
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm here to see you, Jae In.

150
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,770
Someone at Planning and Design told me
that I could find you here.

151
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,010
Actually, I was about to call you.
We were just discussing an office.

152
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,510
Mr. Jung kindly suggested
we share an office.

153
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,420
What do you think?

154
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,280
It's fine with me.

155
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,220
If you're comfortable, let's do that.

156
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,190
Shall we step out for some coffee?

157
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
Sure.

158
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,460
We'll be on our way, then.

159
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,100
Se Ri, say hello.

160
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,170
This is Lee Tae Ho, an art dealer.

161
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,670
I know.

162
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,910
Gi Chan and I have met him before.

163
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,350
What were you doing coming out
of that office?

164
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,880
I was here to meet with Designer L.

165
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,890
She accepted my project proposal,
so we're going to work together...

166
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,220
with Designer L.

167
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,860
So you'll be working here
from now on?

168
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,160
Shall we go?

169
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,170
As if home wasn't enough,
now he's here to suffocate me here?

170
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,510
I hope the gallery becomes a space
that conveys deep historical truths,

171
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,250
while also captivating the audience.

172
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,490
I'll keep that in mind and tell you
once I have a concrete concept.

173
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,050
Sounds good.

174
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,330
Oh, are you really okay
with sharing the office at DH Holdings?

175
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,590
If it's inconvenient,
we can look for another place.

176
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,730
Coming from my Lady Luck,
of course, it's fine.

177
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,270
Please don't call me that.
It's really embarrassing.

178
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,070
Why not?

179
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,410
You look like one to me.

180
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,620
May I ask a personal question?

181
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,330
Sure.

182
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,300
It's about Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

183
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,170
I heard he was your ex-husband.

184
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,070
I'm curious about his family.

185
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,580
I also heard that
the new Director of JY Gallery...

186
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,150
is Chairman Hwang's mother.

187
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,690
Search for "Exposé World"
on the online video platform.

188
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,560
That will tell you everything
you need to know about him...

189
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,860
as well as Kang Se Ri.

190
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,120
Hello.

191
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,360
What brings you here again?

192
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,400
I was meeting with Designer L.

193
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,500
I believe we're done here.

194
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,530
I'll see you around.

195
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,840
Okay.

196
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,540
Designer L.

197
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,180
Can we talk if your meeting is over?

198
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,420
Say what you need to say.

199
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,390
Did you get home safe last night?

200
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,260
Is that why you wanted to see me?
To ask that?

201
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,030
Didn't Kim Do Yun say anything?

202
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,940
What did you do to Do Yun?

203
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,410
Did you threaten him or something?

204
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,870
He's the one who threatened me...

205
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,580
and assaulted me.

206
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,010
He grabbed me by the collar...

207
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,080
and threatened me to stay away
from you.

208
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,390
Good. He said
what I've been wanting to say.

209
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,160
Who does he mean to you?

210
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,290
What's going on between you two?

211
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,100
Are you really going to date him
or something?

212
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,500
What if I am?

213
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,300
Kang Jae In.

214
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,710
Don't lie. Just tell me the truth.

215
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,610
Are you dating him?

216
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,980
I asked if you're dating.

217
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,050
Answer me.

218
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,850
I have no obligation to tell you.

219
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,120
You can think whatever you want.

220
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,080
I heard you had dinner
at CEO Jung's house yesterday.

221
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,220
How was it?

222
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,690
Honestly, I was a little intimidated
when he suddenly invited me over.

223
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,830
But it was nice
to have a lively meal...

224
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,060
with everyone after so long.

225
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,030
Back when my father was alive,

226
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,140
he always made sure the whole family
ate together.

227
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,510
But back then, I just thought,
"Dad is so old-school."

228
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,710
That's all I used to think.

229
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,680
But I was wrong.

230
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,750
Looking back on it now,

231
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,220
even with our busy lives,

232
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,520
at least we could face each other
at the dinner table

233
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,090
and talk about our day.

234
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,500
I realize now
how precious that time was.

235
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,530
It was, wasn't it?

236
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,340
It makes me think of your father.

237
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,080
Seung Woo.

238
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,510
The other day, when we stopped
by Director Do's house,

239
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,880
we talked about something
while you were asleep.

240
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,190
Did you overhear all of it?

241
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,590
Yes.

242
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,660
Oh, you did.

243
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,560
Well, let's skip the backstory then.

244
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,870
About your biological father...

245
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,910
You were worried he might be married
and have a family.

246
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,640
And I remember you said
you were on the fence about it.

247
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,450
He is...

248
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,910
still not married.

249
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,720
You've been in touch with him?

250
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Seung Woo, if you're okay with it,

251
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,230
I was thinking of arranging
for you two to meet.

252
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,600
Okay.

253
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,470
But not right away.

254
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,440
It's not that I don't want
to meet him.

255
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,410
It's just an awkward situation.

256
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,450
Okay, we'll take it slow.

257
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,930
This is nice.

258
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,740
What? We have to toast! Cheers!

259
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,270
Ji Ho loves toasting too.

260
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,510
We always do a little toast,
even with water or juice.

261
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,080
Oh, really?

262
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,780
I couldn't help
but notice at dinner...

263
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,120
that you took such good care
of Ji Ho.

264
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,560
Is it just because he's your son?

265
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,330
I've always felt a little guilty
when it comes to Ji Ho,

266
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,230
so I try to give him
extra attention,

267
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,360
even with the little things.

268
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,330
Sorry for what?

269
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,900
Well, from the moment Ji Ho
was conceived to when he grew up,

270
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,070
I had to travel back and forth
between Korea and the U.S.

271
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,240
So I spent a lot of time
away from him.

272
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,450
But he grew up so healthy and well.
I'm so proud of him for that.

273
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,150
So you were living
between the U.S. and Korea.

274
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,690
I had business matters that
I had already established in Korea,

275
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,860
and there were a number
of other things going on.

276
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,900
Besides, we actually hadn't planned
on having children.

277
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
In fact, just a year before
we had Ji Ho,

278
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,440
we'd even talked about how we were
better off without kids.

279
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,090
Take it from me, Mr. Lee.
If you marry, you should have kids.

280
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,390
How should I put it?

281
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,060
It gives you a reason to keep going,
you know?

282
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,230
Is that so?

283
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,980
Should I get you some honey tea?

284
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,110
Get out.

285
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,070
Are you crazy?

286
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,880
What if someone sees you?
What are you doing in Ji Ho's room?

287
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,850
And this is okay?
The two of us, alone like this?

288
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,250
- Lee Tae Ho.
- You met your husband after me?

289
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,550
That's right.

290
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,820
Unbelievable.

291
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,960
Every word that comes out
of your mouth is a lie.

292
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,090
It's true.

293
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,590
Just a year
before Ji Ho was conceived,

294
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,060
you said it was better without kids.

295
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,800
That's what your husband told me.

296
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,940
- Well, that's...
- A year before conceiving Ji Ho?

297
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,140
That was before
you and I had even met.

298
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,510
That just means
you were two-timing me.

299
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,480
- Tae Ho, wait...
- I'm done listening to your lies.

300
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,750
Before I tell Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
and this entire family everything,

301
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,750
send Ji Ho to me.

302
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Tae Ho.

303
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,940
(YL Group)

304
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Let's talk.

305
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,960
Just tell me what you've decided.

306
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
So, am I taking Ji Ho?

307
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,670
You want to be a dad now?

308
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,970
Since when have you been a father
to him?

309
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,870
You're the one who didn't let me
be a father!

310
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,240
That's because I didn't know
you were his father!

311
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,780
Fine.
I was seeing both you and Gi Chan.

312
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,980
Gi Chan was usually away in Korea,
and I was lonely.

313
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,720
You were there for me,
and you helped me get through it.

314
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,020
I swear I didn't know
Ji Ho was your son.

315
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,090
I just assumed he was Gi Chan's son.

316
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,830
That's why I left you.

317
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,030
I'm so sorry for deceiving you,

318
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,270
but I truly believed
Ji Ho was Gi Chan's son.

319
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,100
I don't want to hear your excuses.

320
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,840
All I want is my son.

321
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,880
What is wrong with you?

322
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,450
Don't you care
about his happiness at all?

323
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,580
Would you make him miserable
out of your own selfishness?

324
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Really?

325
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,490
If you really care about Ji Ho,
then stop this.

326
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,060
Everything I'm doing is
for Ji Ho's sake.

327
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,790
Tae Ho, please. I'm begging you.

328
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,500
Or are you just using Ji Ho
to get what you want?

329
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,470
If you're the one who really wants
what's best for Ji Ho,

330
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,870
then you'll send him to me.

331
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,710
I can't give you much time.

332
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,370
Make up your mind quickly.

333
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,120
You keep showing up at home and work
just to torment me!

334
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,190
Go back to the U.S. right now!

335
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,970
Aren't you going to ask?

336
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,310
It's a private matter.

337
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,780
I told you I was staying
with an acquaintance, remember?

338
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,820
Well, I'm at Chairman Hwang's house.

339
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,820
I guess he is in a real hurry.

340
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,090
Maybe he's in a position
where he has to sell the painting quickly.

341
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,060
I made one offhand comment
about wanting to see a Korean home,

342
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,730
and he immediately offered
to let me stay at his place.

343
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,300
And that's how it happened.

344
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,770
Didn't you and Kang Se Ri
use to date?

345
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,070
That was a very long time ago,

346
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,770
and Chairman Hwang doesn't know.

347
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,140
You won't tell him, will you?

348
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,550
It's not my place to get involved.

349
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,080
But I have to admit
I'm not sure what to make of this.

350
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,250
Me too.

351
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,490
I've been pretty confused
myself lately.

352
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,200
Oh, thank you for your help
with the toy.

353
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,400
Ji Ho is Chairman Hwang's...

354
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,340
He's Se Ri's son,

355
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,870
and thanks to you,
I think I got him something...

356
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,040
he really loves.

357
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,910
He absolutely loved it.

358
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,120
Yes, Oh Seong.

359
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,290
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.

360
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,370
What's money when it comes
to our love?

361
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,740
For me, love comes first.

362
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,640
And first is money, second is money,
and third is money.

363
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,180
If a man is rich,
he's a walking wallet.

364
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,420
For me, love is first, love second,
and love third.

365
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,420
By any chance,
could I borrow your house tonight?

366
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,030
- My house?
- Yes.

367
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,160
I've recently made
a rather large donation,

368
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,430
and a newspaper wants
to interview me about it.

369
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,100
I mean, I'm the CEO
of a global investment firm,

370
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,170
but I haven't had a chance to secure
a proper home here in Korea yet.

371
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,910
They'll be taking pictures
during the interview,

372
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,010
and your place looks so impressive.

373
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,250
Please? It would be a huge help.

374
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,920
Of course, you can.

375
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,020
Anything for you, Oh Seong.

376
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,320
Come on over.

377
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,560
My home is your home.

378
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,230
You're more than welcome.

379
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,960
Great. I'll see you later.

380
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,030
Should I use this as an excuse
for him to move in with me?

381
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,010
No, marriage
has to come first, though.

382
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,810
Don't tell me...

383
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,680
Is he lying so he can propose?

384
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,420
Gosh, I should be fully prepared,
just in case, right?

385
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,290
Should I run to the salon?

386
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,920
So, what'd she say?

387
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,630
She's all,
"You're more than welcome!"

388
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,890
And that seals the deal.

389
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,860
It took everything I had
to keep from breaking out in hives.

390
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,230
You really went through it.

391
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,900
Are you ready for this?

392
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,270
Of course. I'm going
to hit them where it really hurts.

393
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,180
And you squared things away
with Yun Hee?

394
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,980
Yes, we agreed to meet there later.

395
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,650
I'm going to see Jae In now.

396
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,720
I was just thinking I missed Bo Ram,
so this is perfect.

397
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,520
Don't worry about Bo Ram.

398
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,290
I'll take great care of her.

399
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,290
Thank you.

400
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,030
Don't be silly.
It's the least I can do.

401
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,900
We'll make dinner, eat,
and play together,

402
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,070
so don't worry about a thing
and just go nail it.

403
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,140
You're stopping by the salon
on your way, right?

404
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,510
Yes, the kids told me
to dress to kill.

405
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,280
Finally,
the day of reckoning is here.

406
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
I guess it is.

407
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,590
I'm dying to see the looks
on their faces.

408
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,190
Make sure they get
what's coming to them.

409
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,930
I'll be rooting for you.

410
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,500
Thanks.

411
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,960
Oh, I'll make sure they get
what they deserve.

412
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,650
- I'm here.
- Welcome.

413
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,820
Oh my, Oh Seong.

414
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,290
You look so dashing today.

415
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,890
Goodness.

416
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Wait...

417
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,200
These people...

418
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,200
Wait, what are they all doing here?

419
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,500
Did I forget to mention?

420
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,810
I made the donation
in my sister's name.

421
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,410
Thanks for letting us use your home.

422
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,750
You've got a nice place here.

423
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,250
Way beyond your means.

424
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Thank you.

425
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,920
What is all this?
You didn't say a word to me.

426
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,320
No, I just...

427
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,050
I thought it was just going to be
Oh Seong.

428
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,930
All right, let's get the big check
and take a proper photo.

429
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,290
Yes, let's do that.

430
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,130
Go ahead and give it to them.

431
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,430
Right.

432
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,230
(Fire Orphan Scholarships,
6 Million Dollars)

433
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Here you go.

434
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,800
Okay, a round of applause!

435
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,250
No way, she donated all that?
Wait, how many zeros is that?

436
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,980
Okay, let's see...
A thousand, a million...

437
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,520
Six million?

438
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,250
What? Six million?

439
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,960
It really is.

440
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,860
Wait a second. Six million...

441
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,030
Hold on. That's the exact amount
I lost in that real estate fraud.

442
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,640
Leave it to the money-crazed bitch
to be quick on the uptake.

443
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,580
What was that?
"A money-crazed what?"

444
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,650
Are you just that dense?

445
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,450
Can't you read the room?

446
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:45,850
You see it and still don't get it?

447
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,180
Darn it.

448
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,950
What do you mean, I don't know?

449
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,060
The six million you blew
on that land deal...

450
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,690
This is it! You con artist!

451
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,560
What? Oh, my goodness!

452
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Oh, no.

453
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,160
(Queen's House)

454
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,290
Why did you have
to fall down the stairs?

455
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,590
Look at this mess.

456
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,360
Mom, I didn't trip down the stairs.

457
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,360
- I was pushed.
- That again?

458
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,900
But it's true!

459
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,300
Right? You pushed me.

460
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,510
Actually, I only just found out
I had a son.

461
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,310
A son?

462
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,240
You mean you have a son?

463
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,650
If I were to have regrets,

464
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
I would regret them.

465
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,690
I, too,

466
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,060
deserve to love you.

467
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,160
