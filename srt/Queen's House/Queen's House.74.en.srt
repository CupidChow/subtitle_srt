1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,940
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,480
Who's here at this hour?

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,450
Se Ri, I prepared a surprise
just for you...

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,490
to celebrate your discharge.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,560
Do you want a hint?

8
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,430
He was very close to you
a long time ago,

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,800
and he called home a few days ago.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,730
He asked for you,
so I invited him here today.

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,340
Who is it?

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,070
I don't know. We only had
a brief conversation over the phone.

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,970
You can ask him when he gets here.

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,710
Excuse me.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,530
Hello.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm Ji Seong Jun,
Se Ri's ex-husband.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,210
Oh, my. Se Ri.
Have you been married before?

18
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,860
Mr. Do, about the wedding photo
you found at Se Ri's aunt's place.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,460
Are you yet to find
the man in that photo?

20
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,000
I've been looking everywhere.

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,330
We must find him.

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,470
She claimed it was Photoshopped,

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,240
so nothing will seem convincing
unless the man himself shows up.

24
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,780
I know that, too.

25
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,380
I will find him.

26
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,520
Ex-husband?

27
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,150
Whose ex-husband is he?

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,890
Didn't you hear him?

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,930
He said he was Se Ri's ex-husband.

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,260
Who's my ex-husband?

31
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,660
Are you in your right mind, Jae In?

32
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,500
My husband isn't this man!

33
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,940
Why are you yelling at her,
Ms. Kang?

34
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,440
Do you know me?

35
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,210
I don't know who you are.
What is this nonsense?

36
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,250
You weren't my husband.

37
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,550
You sent that
Photoshopped picture, didn't you?

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,120
I know you sent that to get money!

39
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,760
Get out of here now. Get out!

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,160
You're still the same.

41
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,390
Wait, this is too complicated.

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,300
So, you've been married before?

43
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,900
- My gosh.
- Mom.

44
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,040
- Mother!
- I'm home.

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,070
Na Ra, take her to her room.

46
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,240
Okay, Gi Chan. Mom, come.

47
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,050
My name is Hwang Gi Chan.

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,020
I'm Ji Seong Jun.

49
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,530
This isn't even Ms. Kang's place.

50
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,700
I don't think
you two should quarrel here.

51
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,270
You should talk later.

52
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,070
I must've made a mistake, honey.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,270
He said you two were close,

54
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,710
so I invited him
without asking more.

55
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,480
I should've asked
for more information.

56
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,510
I'm sorry, Se Ri.

57
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,550
No, I'm sorry.

58
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,950
I should've told you the truth.

59
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,950
Please excuse my discourtesy.

60
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,220
This isn't your place,

61
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,360
so I'll go.

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,360
Stay there, Ms. Kang.

63
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,370
You said you didn't know him.

64
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,640
Se Ri.

65
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,940
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,190
She seems furious.
What am I going to do?

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,420
Don't mind her.

68
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,760
I have to do something,

69
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,390
so I'll eat dinner later.

70
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,100
Gi Chan and Se Ri,
this isn't the end of the surprise.

71
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,840
From this moment on,

72
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,040
nothing in your life will go
the way you expect it to.

73
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,090
Did Gi Chan want to meet him?

74
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,060
I saw Mr. Ji Seong Jun
going to the chairman's office.

75
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,940
Are you the man...

76
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,940
in Ms. Kang Se Ri's wedding photo?

77
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,450
So, you saw it.

78
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,190
This is a photo we took
at our wedding.

79
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,500
Honey, no. Don't believe him.

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,030
This was Photoshopped.

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,300
I've never been married to him.

82
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,840
You already did your research
and found out!

83
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,570
Jae In is behind everything!

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,310
Was that why you turned me
into a dead man?

85
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,480
Do you know who I am?

86
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,910
I don't know you!

87
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,350
Do I have to prove myself
by sharing where your moles are?

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,820
You're crazy.

89
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,230
Please excuse me
if you have no other questions.

90
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,700
Let me leave you with this.

91
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,730
You should be careful of her.

92
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,640
She's not afraid to do anything
when there's something she wants.

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,740
Shut your mouth!

94
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,020
Honey.

95
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,960
Shut that mouth.

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,260
Those wedding photos were all real.

97
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,430
Who are you?

98
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,000
How much of this is real,
and how much is a lie?

99
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,900
Honey, I'm so sorry for what I did.

100
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,170
This was long before I met you.

101
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,680
Our relationship
only lasted briefly.

102
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,880
I never loved him.

103
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,450
You're the only one for me.
I mean it.

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,550
Do you expect me to believe you?

105
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,920
Where do you get
that kind of confidence?

106
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,890
You dated me
while you lived with Jae In,

107
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
and I never raised a question
about that.

108
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,330
What?

109
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,230
I put up with it
for such a long time.

110
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,200
And in that while,
Ji Ho grew up without a dad.

111
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,510
Don't you feel bad for us?

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,080
I wasn't even two-timing you
like you did to me.

113
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,580
Can't you understand
that I have some history?

114
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,720
I'm not saying what I did was right.

115
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,620
But this was long before I met you.

116
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,320
So, do you expect me to forget this
just because it was in the past?

117
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,520
You should've told me before.

118
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,490
You should've given me a choice!

119
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,130
I was afraid you'd leave me.

120
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,630
I didn't want
to be abandoned by you.

121
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,940
Stop shedding
those fake tears and leave.

122
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,840
Yes, it's my fault that
I failed to make you trust me...

123
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,770
as a woman and a wife.

124
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,210
But I'm still in love with you,

125
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,140
and my feelings are still the same.

126
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,950
Honey, I got enough money
from H and K's slush fund...

127
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,320
to bribe the Chinese investor.

128
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,250
I'll do whatever it takes
to get them to invest.

129
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,160
Please give me a chance.

130
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,860
Make sure you schedule a meeting
with the investment company.

131
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,400
You may leave.

132
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,520
Hong Man Su, that cursed punk.

133
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,230
You must've wanted
to forget this past.

134
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,060
Thank you for your help.

135
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,800
Don't mention it.

136
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,130
It was nice to get my revenge
against Se Ri in this way.

137
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,140
She left me without telling me why.

138
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,040
Come to think of it now,

139
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,910
she didn't rush to marry me
out of love.

140
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,050
It must've been my background.

141
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,050
She mistook me and thought
I was made of money.

142
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,390
But I was way too short
of her expectations,

143
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,260
so she probably got disappointed
and left.

144
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,060
(Se Ri)

145
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,170
We could've talked in the office.

146
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,580
What do you have to say to me
all the way out here?

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,340
Shoot.

148
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,010
You called Ji Seong Jun there
on purpose, didn't you?

149
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,720
Yes.

150
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,850
How much information does she have?

151
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,290
You aren't hesitating
to answer my question.

152
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,930
It looks like
we're finally on the same page.

153
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,630
You were the YouTuber, right?

154
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,630
I don't know.

155
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,970
Do you have proof?

156
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,640
Wait, that thief
who robbed my aunt's place...

157
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,480
What took you so long?

158
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,510
How slow.

159
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,480
Then, you can't deny
that you were the YouTuber.

160
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,550
The photos and diploma that
the YouTuber exposed were...

161
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,760
all from my aunt's place.

162
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,320
This means you stole them!

163
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,930
Do I have to clarify...

164
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,530
your wrong guesses
and tell you everything?

165
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,830
If you want to know,
make a move and find out.

166
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,940
Do you really want
to take this all the way?

167
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,240
You can't win against me.

168
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,010
Wake up, Se Ri.

169
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,180
This time, I won.

170
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,780
I won't let you
keep doing this to me.

171
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,620
I'll tell Gi Chan...

172
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,490
that your memories are still intact!

173
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,420
You already did.

174
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,030
But did he believe you?

175
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,700
I'll torture you
in the worst way possible,

176
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,640
and this isn't even the beginning.

177
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,840
You better not mess with me.

178
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,280
I already told many people
all about you.

179
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,880
If I disappear or get hurt,

180
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,420
you'll face even worse things.

181
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,320
If you wish to live
for at least another day,

182
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,690
you should be careful.

183
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,160
Get it, Se Ri?

184
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,060
You've changed a lot.

185
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,000
That's not going to work,
so don't bother.

186
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,210
And don't even try to tell Gi Chan
that I have my memories.

187
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,470
Isn't it unfair?

188
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,710
He should suffer
as much as you did...

189
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,350
to make this fair.

190
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,480
Who knows?

191
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,690
It may make
your love even more passionate.

192
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,170
Stop this funny business.

193
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,010
Don't be deluded into thinking
only you know how to make recordings.

194
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,610
You better be careful.

195
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,110
Goodbye.

196
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,860
- I'm back.
- I'm glad you're here.

197
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,000
Can we talk?

198
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,970
I can't live with this kind of anger
and feeling this wronged.

199
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,780
Kick out that girl, Se Ri.

200
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,550
No, you can kick out both of them.

201
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,320
I commend her for getting the idea
to make me the gallery director,

202
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,250
but she already lost her baby,

203
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,950
so it'd be better
if you got to live in peace.

204
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,090
You can always find a new wife.
You're the chairman of YL Group.

205
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,730
Women would line up to be with you.

206
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,160
I can't do that now.

207
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,900
Why not?

208
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,800
She's Ji Ho's mom.

209
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,630
And she plays a role
in my company in America.

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,170
What about Jae In?

211
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,240
The same goes for her.

212
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,970
What's going on?

213
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,940
Have you fallen for her again?

214
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,280
No, there's a reason.

215
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,520
I have to go.

216
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,220
What?

217
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,330
(This folder is empty.)

218
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,200
They aren't here.

219
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,610
The files are all gone.

220
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,960
What are you doing over there?

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,470
Hey, Jae In. I'm leaving.

222
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,270
You can use my laptop.

223
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,370
Wait, were you going to use
Gi Chan's laptop?

224
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,270
You don't have
any designing programs, do you?

225
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,810
What?

226
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,850
No, I don't.

227
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,380
Right? I thought so.

228
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,050
I have the programs on mine,
so use that one.

229
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,490
Come with me. I'll give it to you.

230
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,390
Okay. Thanks.

231
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,270
Yes, thank you.

232
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,110
You should eat dinner.

233
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,980
Be careful, Jae In.

234
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,850
And let me know
whenever you need help.

235
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,520
I have to go out for dinner.

236
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,590
Bye.

237
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,770
- I'm home.
- You're back.

238
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,540
- What about your uncle?
- He's meeting someone for dinner.

239
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,740
Is he seeing someone?

240
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,650
I don't know. Why do you ask?

241
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,920
He's been paying more attention
to the way he dresses...

242
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,650
and coming home late,
so I had a feeling.

243
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,260
Maybe he's dating someone...

244
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,730
at work.

245
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,930
I wouldn't know. Should I find out?

246
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,770
No, don't.

247
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,700
Don't tell him that I asked.

248
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,870
I don't want him
to feel conscious of me...

249
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,610
and stop him from dating someone.

250
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,580
You should get changed.
Let's eat dinner.

251
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,950
Okay.

252
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,860
- Hello.
- Come on in.

253
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,960
I didn't expect to meet you
at such a fancy restaurant.

254
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,260
One moment.

255
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,630
What are you waiting for?

256
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,040
Have a seat.

257
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,890
I wanted
to treat you two to dinner...

258
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,390
and let you meet each other.

259
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,530
You didn't need to do that.

260
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,900
I already know she's your aunt.

261
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,670
She's not my aunt.

262
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,300
Seung Woo.

263
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,870
She gave birth to me.

264
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,550
It seemed like
you two were close in the past,

265
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,120
so I thought it'd be nice...

266
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,560
if you two became good friends
before you got older.

267
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,960
That's why I did this.

268
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,330
Was this too much?

269
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,540
I'm sorry.
I didn't know about this, either.

270
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,600
He asked me out for dinner.

271
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,440
It's okay.

272
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,640
So, you had a son.

273
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,920
It must be shocking.

274
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,430
I honestly didn't like
Mr. Jung's first impression,

275
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,000
so at first,
I never thought of doing this.

276
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,600
But after a few encounters with him,

277
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,100
I realized he had
an uncanny way of growing on you.

278
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,970
I was grateful for his advice, too.

279
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,570
Seung Woo.

280
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,010
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

281
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,020
Chairman Hwang got men
to go out and look for me...

282
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,290
because I didn't tell him
that your ex-husband was alive.

283
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,630
What now?

284
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,230
My life is in danger because of you!

285
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,070
Don't show up near your office
and keep a low profile for a while.

286
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,070
I'll call you when things die down.

287
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,910
He's just angry right now.

288
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,740
Don't you know that
he believes everything I say?

289
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,640
Give it time.

290
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,450
Jae In is the problem.

291
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,030
You're back.

292
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,130
Yes. Hey.

293
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,060
I sent you an e-mail
with the files...

294
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,700
I put together for the reporters.

295
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,970
Kang Seung Woo is her son?

296
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,940
Did she have him with Goo Jin Sang?

297
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,350
No, that's impossible.

298
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,750
Uncle Oh Seong, are you listening?

299
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,290
What? I'm sorry.

300
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,560
Hey, did you know...

301
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,330
who Kang Seung Woo was?

302
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,400
He's Jae In's younger brother
from another mother.

303
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,730
Why do you suddenly ask?

304
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,510
No, never mind.

305
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,110
Where were we?

306
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,510
Hello?

307
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,180
I was going to stop by
at the hospital later...

308
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,690
What did you say?

309
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,890
He regained his consciousness?
Really?

310
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,920
Goodness.

311
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,760
Yes, I'll run over there now.

312
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,500
Goodness, all deities.

313
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,870
Thank you very much. Goodness.

314
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,300
Gi Man woke up?

315
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,540
Yes, apparently so. The hospital.

316
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,510
We have to go to the hospital first.

317
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,340
Wait, I need my bag.

318
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,180
You should come with us, Se Ri.

319
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,420
No, it's all right.

320
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,150
You should go as a family.

321
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,960
Gi Chan, congratulations
on your brother waking up.

322
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,530
I'll get to work first.

323
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,210
Gi Man. My son.

324
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,540
It's me, Mom.

325
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,680
Do you recognize me?

326
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,720
It's okay.
Just lie there and stop moving.

327
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,030
I'm just glad you woke up.

328
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,600
How did you end up
rolling down the stairs?

329
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,830
You should've been careful.

330
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,670
How did you lose your footing?

331
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,110
Gi Man.

332
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,680
I'm glad you woke up.

333
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,920
I'm busy with a customer.

334
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,260
I'll reach out later.

335
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,160
I called her,
but she's texting me instead.

336
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,440
Is your crush not working out?

337
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,300
It's the same for me.

338
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,810
Does it show?

339
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,740
You seemed anxious.

340
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,280
I thought you were slow,
but you weren't that slow.

341
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,820
Don't be anxious,
and think in the long term.

342
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,090
You don't know if she'll accept you
in a year or two.

343
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,090
You need to give time
to let it sit with her.

344
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,430
You're capable
of saying these things?

345
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,000
Gosh. What do you take me for?

346
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,000
I fall in love easily,

347
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,270
but when I'm in love,
I always give it my all.

348
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,410
You won't find anyone else...

349
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,910
who can give you advice
for your crush's crush.

350
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,110
So? Don't you think that's charming?

351
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,880
I'm also giving you time
to let my feelings sit with you.

352
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,450
You know that, right?

353
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,000
If that's all, let's call it a day.

354
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,670
One moment.
There's something important.

355
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,480
This is a file on Designer L.

356
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,150
I knew you'd notice right away.

357
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,850
These are Designer L's background
and portfolio.

358
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,690
Everyone in the industry knows
who Designer L is these days.

359
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,530
You're right. This is
the hottest designer globally...

360
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,100
in the world of interior design.

361
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,670
According to rumors,

362
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,440
Taeseung Group is now
in contact to recruit the designer.

363
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,910
Wait, Taeseung Group?
That's one of our competitors.

364
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,410
I've looked into it, too.

365
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,950
Many other domestic companies,
other than Taeseung,

366
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,580
are also trying to recruit
the designer,

367
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,650
as well as our global competitors.

368
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,090
I believe YL Group also needs
a new kind of talent...

369
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,390
who'll bring change and innovation.

370
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,860
What do you think, Mr. Chairman?

371
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,530
Why don't we go ahead
and give it a try, too?

372
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,230
Then, why don't you take the job?

373
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,940
Me?

374
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,570
You're already aware that
our faith in you has dwindled...

375
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,040
quite a lot, right?

376
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,110
Covering up your scandals...

377
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,150
doesn't bring back the authority
you lost as the chairman.

378
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,920
So, you're asking me...

379
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,520
to recruit Designer L?

380
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,160
We'll be able to trust
and follow a chairman...

381
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,860
who contributes greatly
to the business.

382
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,560
Let me know if you can't do it.
I'll do it myself.

383
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,330
No, I'll do it.

384
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,270
I'll recruit Designer L.

385
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,340
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

386
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,410
Director Kang Mi Ran is...

387
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,580
trying to make me fail
and push me out of my position.

388
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,020
I don't care what you do,
but find out where Designer L is.

389
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,890
I must find...

390
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,190
and successfully recruit
that designer to YL Group.

391
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,020
Yes, sir.

392
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,990
But Mr. Chairman.

393
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,800
You should see this first.

394
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,600
There are a few articles.

395
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,270
(The Truth Behind
YL Group's Luxury Apartment...)

396
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,670
(That Causes Disharmony?)

397
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,470
"The Truth Behind
YL Group's Luxury Apartment..."

398
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,870
"That Causes Disharmony?"

399
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,310
It claims that
the residential complex...

400
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,650
made in collaboration with Louis B
was an attempt by you,

401
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,910
the constructor,
and the person in charge at Louis B...

402
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,380
to take kickbacks
by inflating the prices.

403
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,020
Contact the constructor
and Louis B immediately.

404
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,290
Tell them I want to meet today,
as soon as possible.

405
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,720
Yes, sir.

406
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,060
These blew up so quickly...

407
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,700
as soon as we sent the file
to the reporters.

408
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,900
I get that he collaborated
with a luxury brand like Louis B,

409
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,740
but he shouldn't have
inflated the numbers this much.

410
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,470
He claimed to have used
high-end luxury materials,

411
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,640
but Louis B only took part
in the smallest aspect of the design.

412
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,750
He only used the brand
to inflate the prices.

413
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,380
People are showing
a huge reaction to this.

414
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,720
YL Group will have to
make a decision, right?

415
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,020
They won't be able
to condone this anymore.

416
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,790
Yes, I'll meet you
at the usual place. Goodbye.

417
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,860
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

418
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,770
Honey, is everything okay?

419
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,570
I have to leave now.

420
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,840
I saw the articles and got worried.

421
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,610
And the staff are
all gossiping in the lounge.

422
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,110
So what?

423
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,780
Are you here to rub it in my face?

424
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,280
It's not easy to make
a rational decision...

425
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,750
when you face danger.

426
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,750
I wanted to give you some advice.

427
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,460
You don't have to be the one
to take responsibility for this.

428
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,330
I don't need your advice.
You may leave.

429
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,100
Why did you get so much food?

430
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,330
It's not much.
I just got some fruit and groceries.

431
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,440
Have you been well, Mom?

432
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,570
Yes. Where are you coming from?

433
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,180
I was at work.

434
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,150
You seemed to be concerned,
so let me tell you this.

435
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,980
Gi Man woke up.

436
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,550
Really?

437
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,860
Why did he roll down the stairs?

438
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,190
I don't know. I don't know anything.

439
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,160
- I don't know anything.
- Mom.

440
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,330
What's wrong, Mom?

441
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
She went out alone a few days ago,

442
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,640
and something
must've put her in shock.

443
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,340
Mom.

444
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,610
Mom? Don't be scared.

445
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,850
You're safe here.

446
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,750
I heard you had a tough day.

447
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,350
How did you know?

448
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,450
My aunt told me.

449
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,220
It must've been disappointing.

450
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,930
I also got mad and snapped at her.

451
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,130
At your aunt?

452
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,860
Yes.

453
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,000
I told her it didn't have
to be Designer L...

454
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,830
because our designers were good.

455
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,900
If she wanted to recruit Designer L,
she should've told you beforehand...

456
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,540
because, after all,
you're the chairman.

457
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,540
I mean, we aren't strangers.
She's my aunt.

458
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,550
I lost my cool and had a go at her,
saying she was too harsh.

459
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,690
Stay strong, honey.

460
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,660
You'll be able to find Designer L.

461
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,660
I have faith in you.

462
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,520
Jae In may end up
taking my position again.

463
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,690
No, this life is mine.

464
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,330
It's me.

465
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,230
Don't you need money
to keep a low profile?

466
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,230
I need some men.

467
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,310
There's a job to do.

468
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,480
Jae In.

469
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,620
You left first,
but you got here just now.

470
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,390
There was a lot of traffic.
It was rush hour.

471
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,240
Die, Hwang Gi Chan!

472
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,920
Jae In!

473
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,970
(Queen's House)

474
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,610
Call an ambulance now.

475
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,970
And get that punk!

476
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:45,980
Jae In.

477
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,480
Your brother doesn't seem well.

478
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,120
Let go of me!

479
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,020
What do you think you're doing?

480
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,790
I'm going to hurt your head
just as Gi Man hurt his.

481
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,920
Don't you know who I am?

482
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,090
What do you think will happen
if I tell the chairman...

483
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,990
about your attitude?

484
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,030
So, what I'm trying to ask is this.

485
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,730
Who's Kang Seung Woo's father?

486
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,870
