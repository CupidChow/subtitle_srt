1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,890
Is this the police?

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,460
I found a man
filming others illegally.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,760
Darn it.

7
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,530
What do I do?

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,670
I know he'll send those pictures
to Jae In's mom.

9
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,550
Ms. Kim.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,660
Do you have any idea
how much this is?

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,120
What I wanted from you...

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,830
was not some trash like this,
but my honor.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,700
Money is more important
than honor or pride...

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,900
for those who are in need.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,900
Ms. Kim, can you live without money?

16
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,440
You can live on this money
for the rest of your life.

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,610
Not all money is the same.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,340
I understand that
my mother-in-law offended you...

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,580
and that you want her to apologize.

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,280
Let me apologize on her behalf.

21
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,120
Let's say this is...

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,890
a token of my apology.

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,560
I'll bring you a new check.

24
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,120
What I want isn't money.

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,790
It's Ms. Choi's heartfelt apology.

26
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,770
You won't get anything
from breaking up my marriage.

27
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,700
This is the kind of money
you'll never make in your life.

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,470
It's sitting in this envelope.

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,610
I gave you a day's time.

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,310
If you can't do this yourself,

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,240
I'll speak with the chairman...

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,780
about the issue at work
and other problems.

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,490
You need to seize the opportunity
when you face one.

34
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,350
Stop acting like an idiot.

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
She won't just rat you out
to the chairman.

36
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,320
She'll include me, too.

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,560
This is also my business.

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,000
It's true. He and I dated.

39
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,970
I admitted to it
and said I'd break up with him.

40
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,540
Yet you're here blackmailing him
by using his private life.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,910
It means there's something you want.

42
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,910
Do you think the money offered
by the chairman is any cleaner?

43
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,510
Clean money?

44
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,980
There's no such thing.

45
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,250
I didn't care
about your private lives.

46
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,820
You two were the ones
who brought this upon yourselves.

47
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,050
Do you think the chairman will believe
everything you say?

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,420
His wife, Ms. Choi,

49
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,590
already thinks
you're the adulteress.

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,340
I'm simply returning
what was meant for you.

51
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,710
Have you lost your mind?

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,310
He may not believe me,

53
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,580
but would that be the case
even after he sees...

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,280
the evidence I have?

55
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,520
Mr. Hwang, Ms. Catherine.

56
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,660
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

57
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,200
Ms. Kim!

58
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,610
All right. Let's see.

59
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,120
Everything is ready.

60
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,520
What do you think, Bo Ram?

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,990
Gosh. You're the best, Grandma!

62
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,560
Your mommy must be running late
because of the rain.

63
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,930
Should we call her?

64
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,370
I want to call her.

65
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,430
Okay.

66
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,410
The person you have reached...

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,790
Why did you rub her the wrong way?

68
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
We had to do whatever we could
to stop her from talking!

69
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,390
Do you expect me to grovel
before a girl like that?

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Because a girl like that is
holding our lives in her hands!

71
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,500
Why did you suddenly butt in
only to make her more riled up?

72
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,400
Do you think
I did this just to save my life?

73
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,440
I found the man who watched you
at the cafe last time...

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
taking pictures of you again
just now.

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,780
Your mother-in-law wouldn't stop
just because you threatened her.

76
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,310
I wanted to let you know...

77
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,480
that you still had her tail on you
as soon as possible.

78
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,550
I'm on your side.

79
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,320
If you still find me
untrustworthy and annoying,

80
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,490
then I'll go.

81
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,020
I was too sensitive.

82
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,360
I should visit Ms. Kim at her place.

83
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,400
That's her, right?

84
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,410
I'll go and stop her.

85
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,140
Wait.

86
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,960
Mother?

87
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,230
It's her, right? You saw her.

88
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,830
She just tried to kill Ms. Kim.

89
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,940
She must've rushed over
after that man sent her more pictures.

90
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,940
You could've been
in her position right now!

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
I must seize an opportunity
when I see one.

92
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,800
Gi Chan.

93
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,350
No. Director Hwang.

94
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,820
Please spare my life.

95
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,160
Please let me...

96
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,460
Please let me live.

97
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,030
Pull yourself together.

98
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,560
Will you ruin everything like this?

99
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,230
Mommy?

100
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,270
Hello?

101
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,110
(Mom)

102
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,170
Hello?

103
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,480
Mommy?

104
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,680
Mommy?

105
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,710
Mommy. Mommy?

106
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,620
Mommy won't say anything, Grandma.

107
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,550
Is there a disruption
in the service?

108
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,520
You should hang up and try again.

109
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,460
She won't pick up, Grandma.

110
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,970
Why won't she pick up?

111
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,830
What did she say?

112
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,270
She said she was on her way home.

113
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,770
Then, she'll be here soon.

114
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,410
My princess, why don't you
write her a card before she comes?

115
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,480
Okay.

116
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,790
(Happy birthday, Mommy.)

117
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,110
Do you think she died?

118
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,710
She must've died.

119
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,280
What if she didn't?

120
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,520
What if she didn't die?

121
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,520
I need to go back and check.

122
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,960
No, it's too dangerous.

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,390
What if someone sees you
when you go back?

124
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,860
What if she's alive?

125
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,930
She saw me.

126
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,100
Even if she is alive,
she can't do anything immediately.

127
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,530
We have one final move to play.

128
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,210
Yes, I just walked out
after surgery.

129
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,470
What about Do Hee?

130
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,510
(Emergency Medical Center)

131
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,640
She's not home yet?

132
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,080
I'll be there soon.

133
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,580
(Emergency Medical Center)

134
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,330
- Charge to 100 joules.
- Charged to 100 joules.

135
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,330
Change hands with me!

136
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,390
- It's ready.
- I got her.

137
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,230
Move aside! Two, shock.

138
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,100
- Give me 150 joules.
- Charged to 150 joules.

139
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,100
- Charged.
- Move aside. I got her.

140
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,670
Move back. 1, 2, shock.

141
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,850
You need to stop, Dr. Kim.

142
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,120
You have to stop, Do Yun!

143
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,190
Let go of me.

144
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,320
- You have to stop, Do Yun!
- Get your hands off me!

145
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,690
Move aside.

146
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,220
Give me 200 joules.

147
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,600
What are you doing?

148
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,070
Didn't you hear me?

149
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,800
Why are you just standing around?

150
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,070
Give me 200 joules.

151
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,650
You have to stop. Stop it, Do Yun!

152
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,450
The patient has died.

153
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,960
Do Hee.

154
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,430
It's time to go
to your birthday party.

155
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,410
Do Hee.

156
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,550
Can you hear me?

157
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,090
Bo Ram is waiting for you.

158
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,500
She should've left him
as soon as I warned her.

159
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,370
How could she show...

160
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,040
such a happy smile?

161
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,410
She dared
to trample on another family...

162
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,840
and made
my daughter's life miserable,

163
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,110
yet she smiled
without a hint of guilt.

164
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,610
She didn't feel any remorse.

165
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,520
She deserved to die.

166
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,820
I just punished her.

167
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,650
That was all.

168
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,180
I'm back.

169
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,350
Is something going on?

170
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,590
- What do you mean?
- You look very pale.

171
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,700
Nothing bad happened to you, did it?

172
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,900
Nothing's going on.

173
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,570
Goodness, honey.
When did you get home?

174
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,540
Ja Young. When did you get home?

175
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,740
You weren't in your room.

176
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,980
I went out to the garden
to get some air.

177
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,550
Why?

178
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,550
I took Gyu Cheol's call.

179
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,950
He said he'd be quite late.

180
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,520
I think it's the same
with Seung Woo.

181
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,920
Honey, did you stand in the rain?

182
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,120
You should go upstairs and wash up.

183
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,720
Please excuse me.

184
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,960
Aunt Mi Ran,
let me go upstairs briefly.

185
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,670
I wanted to grab some tea
with Jae In.

186
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,830
Why don't you join us?

187
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,300
No, I'm tired.
I should go and get some rest.

188
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,560
(My precious son)

189
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,850
It was definitely Seung Woo's car,

190
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,050
but I didn't see him there.

191
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,650
How does your stomach feel?

192
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,290
Honey.

193
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,260
Hey, what's up?

194
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,430
What's on your mind?
I just asked you a question.

195
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,630
How's your stomach?

196
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,430
Right. It feels the same.

197
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,370
Anyway, did Seung Woo
take his car today?

198
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,240
I don't know. I think he did.

199
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,510
Why?

200
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,310
No, it's nothing.

201
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,910
I should wash up and call it a day.

202
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,110
I don't have my car with me,
so I need to go out early tomorrow.

203
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,680
Why not?
Did you get into an accident?

204
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,190
No, that's not it.

205
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,360
The engine was acting weird,
so I left it at a repair shop.

206
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,830
What? You're missing
one of your cuff links.

207
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,530
Did you drop it somewhere?

208
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,130
I was out on a meeting,
and it was already gone...

209
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,270
by the time I got into the car.

210
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,900
I'll take that.

211
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,570
I'll throw it in the laundry basket
on my way to the shower.

212
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,110
Sure.

213
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,690
Did it happen then?

214
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,160
(Mom)

215
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,530
Pull yourself together, Gi Chan.

216
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,470
Nothing changed.

217
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,640
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

218
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,680
Why won't they both pick up?
They're making me worried.

219
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,220
It's been a while already.

220
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,160
Bo Ram.

221
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,190
Bo Ram, you should
go to your room and sleep.

222
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,960
Grandma, where's Mommy?

223
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,600
She's not here yet.

224
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,230
I'll wake you when she gets home,

225
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,470
so go to your room
and sleep comfortably.

226
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,670
Grandma, you have to wake me up.

227
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,040
I will.

228
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,350
Can you put yourself to sleep?

229
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,910
Yes.

230
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,490
Everything got cold.

231
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,400
(My son)

232
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,170
Hey, Do Yun.

233
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,740
Why didn't you pick up?

234
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,840
Where are you?

235
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,640
Do Hee isn't here yet, either.

236
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,610
What?

237
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,650
She waited until now,
and she just went to her room to sleep.

238
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,850
Leave her at our neighbors?

239
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,550
Why?

240
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,220
All right. I'll be there.

241
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,030
Do Yun.

242
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,340
How did you get hurt?

243
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,210
How? How are you hurt?

244
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,570
I'm fine.

245
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,740
You made my heart drop.

246
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,150
Goodness.
My heart dropped for no reason.

247
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,420
Here. You should have this.

248
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,920
What is it?

249
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,960
Anyway, why are we at the hospital?

250
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,590
Have this first.
Then, I'll tell you.

251
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,030
It's so bitter.

252
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,070
Mom.

253
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,350
Do Hee...

254
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,550
Yes, Do Hee.

255
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,550
Did you get in touch with her?

256
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,420
She just wouldn't pick up.
What did she say?

257
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,650
What?

258
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,020
Well...

259
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
Please don't be alarmed.

260
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,370
Do Hee...

261
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,400
went to be with Dad.

262
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,510
I thought you should see her
one last time.

263
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,250
Hey, Do Yun.

264
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,520
What are you talking about?

265
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,720
She went to be with your dad?

266
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,620
Say it so that I can understand.

267
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,620
Your dad is
on the other side. How...

268
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,800
Do Yun, no.

269
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,970
It can't be true, Do Yun.

270
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,700
Goodness.

271
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,670
Where's Do Hee?

272
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,780
Where is she right now?

273
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,080
Where is she?

274
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,860
Do Hee...

275
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,060
I'm here.

276
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,970
Open your eyes.

277
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,940
Do Hee.

278
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Do Hee. Get up, now.

279
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,010
Come on. Your mom's here.

280
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,550
No.

281
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,250
No!

282
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,990
No...

283
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,300
No, Do Hee.

284
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,030
Do Hee...

285
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,830
Goodness, my girl.

286
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,330
No...

287
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,500
Do Hee...

288
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,210
Goodness, no.

289
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,110
No, what happened to you?

290
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,880
My Do Hee!

291
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,050
Do Hee!

292
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,650
No, Do Hee...

293
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,730
Mom!

294
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,530
Mom.

295
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,620
I don't think
she would've been badly hurt.

296
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,550
Did she see me?

297
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,350
She was probably blinded
by the headlights.

298
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,370
Mom.

299
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,310
Why are you standing there?

300
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,740
You should've come home.

301
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,510
Why did you sleep in the car?

302
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,410
I came out to check, just in case.

303
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,780
You're right.
I fell asleep in the car again.

304
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,520
Didn't I meet you
in front of the door yesterday?

305
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,290
If I had seen you,
I would've taken you inside.

306
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,230
Would I have left you out here?

307
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,900
I must've dreamt it.

308
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,070
I dreamed about Dad, too.

309
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,900
- Your dad?
- Yes.

310
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,070
He complimented me
and showed me his support.

311
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,840
I felt so great,
even though it was a dream.

312
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,210
So I was like, "Dad, I love you!"

313
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,210
Can you believe that?

314
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,780
You need to quit drinking.

315
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,850
You can't even hold your alcohol.
Why do you keep drinking?

316
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,650
A friend from New York visited,
so we grabbed a drink.

317
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,850
I must've gotten drunk
because I chugged too many too fast.

318
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,560
Wait.

319
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,190
Gosh, Mom. I have to go to work.

320
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,260
I'm leaving.

321
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,320
(Photo Event with YL Group,
"One dazzling day for you.")

322
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,360
Will she deliver it herself?

323
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,700
I took reservations ahead of time,

324
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,830
and there were many more
than we expected.

325
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,330
I'm afraid it will take a while.

326
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,340
Or, should it be
first come, first served...

327
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,570
We should get to everyone.

328
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,280
Time is everything for these people.

329
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,040
If they came out to do this,
we should let them do it.

330
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,350
You're good to go.

331
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,750
You look wonderful.

332
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,250
Thanks.

333
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,320
Thank you.

334
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,270
Jae In. It's me, Dad.

335
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,570
Hey, what brings you here?

336
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,240
I came for my regular checkup,
so I stopped by on my way out.

337
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,370
What did the doctor say?

338
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,910
It's always the same.

339
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,110
I was told to take care of myself.

340
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:40,220
Since I'm here already,
I should take one, too.

341
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,150
- Do you want to do it, too?
- Yes.

342
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,100
- Great work.
- Thank you, sir.

343
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,430
I'll leave, then.

344
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,740
You should keep going.

345
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,770
Hey, let's take
the elevator downstairs together.

346
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,370
I have to do something, too.

347
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,210
All right.

348
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,980
Where's the surgery department?

349
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,490
Can I just barge in without calling?

350
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,070
- Seung Woo.
- Yes?

351
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,570
What brings you here at this hour?

352
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,010
Jae In, can you punch me?

353
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,310
That was random.

354
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,020
Like this?

355
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,450
So, this isn't a dream.

356
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,690
Darn it.

357
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,920
My superior at work,

358
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,660
Ms. Kim Do Hee, passed away.

359
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,460
How does this make any sense?

360
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,560
Ms. Kim Do Hee is...

361
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,900
I thought I was still hung over...

362
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,770
and dreaming on my way here.

363
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,670
But I wasn't.

364
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,940
It wasn't a dream.

365
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,780
It must've been shocking.

366
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,780
I was interested in work...

367
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,320
for the first time,

368
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,550
thanks to her.

369
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,260
She must've been
a respectable person.

370
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,490
One moment.

371
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,390
Hello?

372
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,400
The food isn't here yet?

373
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,070
No, I called the number you gave me
many times already,

374
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,230
but she didn't pick up.

375
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,700
The patients and their families are
all here already.

376
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,870
They must be quite hungry.
What should we do?

377
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,670
Let's find something else
we can serve as soon as possible.

378
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,540
I'll be there now.

379
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,580
Seung Woo,
I would love to go with you,

380
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,980
but something came up.

381
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,290
It may be hard, but make sure
you say your goodbye...

382
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,590
and leave no regrets behind. Okay?

383
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,890
I'm sure she'll be happy to see you.

384
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,030
"I dedicated my whole life
to making pig's feet."

385
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,070
The copy sounds wonderful,

386
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,000
and the colors look excellent.

387
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,410
Mom, please. This is just wrong.

388
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,370
Do you have to do this
to my delicate hands?

389
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,980
Don't tell me to live my life
touching pig's feet!

390
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,980
Stop complaining
and just tell me yes or no.

391
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,080
The moment you blurt out no,

392
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,550
you'll pack up your things
and leave my house.

393
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,350
- I pay for the living expenses.
- You don't.

394
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,590
It's your wife.

395
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,820
Do you think I'm happy to take money
from my daughter-in-law...

396
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,090
while my son is
sitting around like a bum?

397
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,260
Stop nagging.

398
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,860
Gi Man, give her an answer.
Is it yes or no?

399
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,040
Yes.

400
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,470
- Dang it.
- Gosh.

401
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,110
Why was the item suddenly suspended?

402
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,750
What's going on?

403
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,780
(Ilcheon Chemicals)

404
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,420
(Notice of Delisting
and Grace Period Trading)

405
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,050
"Notice of delisting
and grace period trading?"

406
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,630
Director Jung.

407
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,600
I'm calling about Ilcheon Chemicals,
the item we invested in.

408
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,800
Did you see the notice?

409
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,870
I watched the YouTuber
you told me about...

410
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,440
and invested in
whatever he recommended.

411
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,740
The news?

412
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,480
Breaking news.

413
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,280
L, a financial YouTuber...

414
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,210
with hundreds of thousands
of subscribers,

415
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,110
has been arrested
for illegal trading.

416
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,620
L is a so-called finfluencer
who recommends stock items...

417
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,220
through his videos.

418
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,390
He allegedly purchased shares first
and then promoted them to investors.

419
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,020
- This can't be true.
- Once the stock prices rose,

420
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,290
he reportedly sold them for profit,

421
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,790
making millions of dollars
through the scheme.

422
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,130
No!

423
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,740
The house is still quiet.

424
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,380
Is everyone not back yet?

425
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,980
Seung Woo just came home
and went to shower.

426
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,220
Eun Ho must've been tired
after his field trip.

427
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,350
He's already asleep.

428
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,290
Gyu Cheol and Jae In are
both running late.

429
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,890
Is Seung Woo all right?

430
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,230
What is it?

431
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,400
I heard one of the staff members
in Seung Woo's team...

432
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,530
passed away yesterday
in a hit-and-run accident.

433
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,840
She was...

434
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,040
Seung Woo's direct superior.

435
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,140
He was close to her,

436
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,810
so it must've been quite shocking.

437
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,110
I only hit her lightly.

438
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,080
Did she really die?

439
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,450
Anyway, you should
try to comfort him.

440
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,990
It rained a lot on that day.

441
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,490
Nothing can lead back to me.

442
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,460
I didn't leave anything
that could be used as evidence.

443
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,700
Ja Young.

444
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,770
All right. I'll talk to him.

445
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,780
I heard the news.

446
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,850
Your superior
got into a car accident, right?

447
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,390
Mom, you have to live
for a very long time.

448
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,960
Okay?

449
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,500
It's a present
to make you feel better.

450
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,840
Is it a new car?

451
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,270
But my current one is fine.

452
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,370
I'll sell your old one,
so just use this.

453
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,280
The new one is much safer.

454
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,140
You have a rough way of driving,

455
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,050
and you keep sleeping in the car,

456
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,350
so I got a bit anxious.

457
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,550
Thank you.

458
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,460
The smell of you always makes me
feel much better.

459
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,330
Did the event end well?

460
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,070
Yes.

461
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,340
People loved it so much...

462
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,100
that it ended two hours later
than scheduled.

463
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,340
Anyway, why were you
on the second floor?

464
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,970
Is Eun Ho up?

465
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,510
No, I had to check in on Seung Woo.

466
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,310
You must've heard.

467
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,280
He seemed quite shocked.

468
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,580
I should've been there, too.

469
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,920
Why should you go?

470
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,890
She worked directly for Gi Chan,
so I should've gone there.

471
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,990
Don't.

472
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,630
You aren't just the wife
of an ordinary executive.

473
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,430
The staff will start talking
about everything you do,

474
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,970
checking to see
which funerals you attend or don't.

475
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,270
It'll end up causing
misunderstandings and rumors.

476
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,270
Then, I'll ask Secretary Yoon
to deliver some condolence money.

477
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,210
You don't look well.

478
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,220
Do you want to take a bath?
I'll have it drawn.

479
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,090
Just thinking about it
melts my exhaustion away.

480
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,820
Thanks, Mom.

481
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,790
I...

482
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,960
only care about one thing in life.

483
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,160
It's for my only daughter, you,

484
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,330
to be happy.

485
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,730
Do you understand what I mean?

486
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,740
Of course.

487
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,120
Uncle Do Yun, where's my mommy?

488
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,980
We couldn't have the birthday party.

489
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,720
I couldn't give her
the present, either.

490
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,890
Why are you crying?

491
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,490
And where's Grandma?

492
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,970
Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

493
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,840
Yes? I'm Kang Seung Woo.

494
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,540
You're under arrest...

495
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,970
for a fatal hit-and-run accident,
subject to aggravated punishment,

496
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,610
resulting in Kim Do Hee's death.

497
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,640
Take him away.

498
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,190
(Queen's House)

499
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,730
Bring Do Hee back!

500
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,230
- Do Hee...
- A mistake?

501
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,000
- How is that a mistake?
- You're under arrest...

502
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,030
for a fatal hit-and-run accident...

503
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,170
- resulting in Kim Do Hee's death.
- This was murder.

504
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,440
Your son didn't make a mistake.

505
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,910
He murdered her!

506
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,210
You've never lost
or been robbed of anything in life,

507
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,080
but you'll experience it very soon.

508
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,410
Taken into custody?

509
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,420
Everything worked out nicely.

510
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,150
I finally
got my revenge on you like this.
