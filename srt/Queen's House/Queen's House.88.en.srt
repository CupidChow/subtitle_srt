1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,770
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,940
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,450
I'm the one who killed her.

5
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,280
I killed Kim Do Hee!

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,790
What... What are you doing?

7
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,350
Stop it.

8
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,560
Son, you're okay, aren't you?

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,160
You're okay, right?

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,830
Seung Woo, don't worry.

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,670
Mom will take care of everything.

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,870
Just trust Mom.

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,340
Detective, it wasn't my son.

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,540
He could never do something
like that.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,450
It was me.

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,010
I did it.

17
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,020
Ma'am, I think
there's a misunderstanding.

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,350
But I'm telling you it's true!

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,550
It was me.

20
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,950
I killed her.

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,960
Arrest me.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,590
Take me in.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,430
You're not taking my Seung Woo!

24
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,930
It wasn't my son.

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,660
I did it.

26
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,770
Believe me and arrest me.

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,940
Cuff me. What are you waiting for?

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,810
- It was me.
- Please, just stop!

29
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,570
Why do you keep doing this?

30
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,710
Everyone's watching.

31
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,810
Seung Woo.

32
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,320
Don't you worry about a thing.

33
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,450
Let them stare.

34
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,150
Mom will protect our Seung Woo.

35
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,190
My son. I promise.

36
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,590
What are you all waiting for?

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,860
I told you to take me in!

38
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,830
I killed her. Arrest me!

39
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,000
Arrest me. I did it!

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,240
I killed her!
I'm the one who killed her!

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,550
You should get some rest.

42
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,090
- Help her lie down.
- Okay.

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,260
Here.

44
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,470
Seung Woo, don't go.

45
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,900
Don't you go anywhere.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,610
Don't worry. I'm here with you.

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
Just get some deep sleep.

48
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,520
Mister...

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,390
My mom...

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,890
My mom's been acting strange.

51
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,730
Your sister will be here soon.

52
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
How's Mom?

53
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,150
She fell asleep.

54
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,150
Jae In,
something's strange about Mom.

55
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,850
I don't know how to explain it,
but...

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,150
she's just really...

57
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,060
- I mean...
- Seung Woo, let me explain.

58
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,760
I think it's time you knew.

59
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,070
So, you're saying...

60
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,440
what happened to Dad
and Kim Do Hee...

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,170
was all that guy
Hwang Gi Chan's doing?

62
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,910
So then,

63
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,450
what Mom said about Kim Do Hee...

64
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,950
Mom didn't do it.

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,460
There's a recording.

66
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,330
I can play it for you if you want,

67
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,790
but I'd rather you didn't.

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,300
It'll haunt you for a long time.

69
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,730
She's right, Seung Woo.

70
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,900
I agree with Jae In.

71
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,840
It will only hurt you more
to hear it.

72
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,840
So then...

73
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,810
is that why Mom has dementia?

74
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,050
We don't know the exact cause,

75
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,150
but the stress must have been
a huge part of it.

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,620
It's a lot to take in, isn't it?

77
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,520
I should have told you sooner.

78
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,820
It's my fault.

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,530
Because of me,

80
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,630
she must've been
under so much stress.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,340
Imagine how hard it must have been
for 27 years.

82
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,210
No.

83
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,670
That's not true, Seung Woo.

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,040
She's right. It's not your fault.

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,020
The way your mother acted
at the police station today...

86
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,420
is how she truly feels about you.

87
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,490
Remember what I told you?

88
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,820
I've been by your mother's side
for a long time,

89
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,160
and she cares for you so much,
Seung Woo.

90
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,430
Of course,

91
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,600
I'm sure there were times
she resented you,

92
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,770
but deep down, she loved you.

93
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,470
It's all my fault.

94
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,980
I'm just going to go check on her.

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,660
Mom.

96
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,390
Mom.

97
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,830
Mom.

98
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,200
Why didn't you tell me?

99
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,110
Why?

100
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,440
I only found out recently myself.

101
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,710
Mom wanted to keep it a secret.

102
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,320
Especially from you.

103
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,950
She was afraid
we would be too shocked,

104
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,850
and that it would be too hard on us.

105
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,390
Mom was worried about us, too.

106
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,190
You get it, right?

107
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,100
I'm sorry, Jae In.

108
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,440
Seung Woo.

109
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,530
Ja Young.

110
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,430
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Seung Woo.

112
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
Ja Young, are you all right?

113
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,350
I must have had a nightmare.

114
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,290
Where's Jae In?

115
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,820
She's outside.

116
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,060
Seung Woo is out there, too.

117
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,830
Don't say anything
about my condition to Seung Woo.

118
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,030
You know what I mean, right?

119
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,970
Yes, I understand.

120
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,340
Why are you holding my hand?

121
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,610
Because there's so much
I have to apologize for.

122
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,580
Especially about Seung Woo.

123
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,980
Ja Young...

124
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,990
Can't we please make up?

125
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,930
Now that Gyu Chul is gone,

126
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,900
you're the only family...

127
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,030
I have left.

128
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,670
I...

129
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,870
I'm so, so sorry.

130
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,950
I apologized to Jae In, too.

131
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,920
And what did she say?

132
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,520
She forgave me.

133
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,790
As for me, it'll depend
on your actions from now on.

134
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,760
I'm not Jae In.

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
I know.

136
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,440
I'll do better.

137
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,940
Come on, sit down.

138
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,750
If this is about that woman,
I'm not changing my mind.

139
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,380
Yun Hee.

140
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,560
I want you to forget the past,
meet someone new, and start over.

141
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,990
I can't just let go of the past.

142
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,460
My relationship with Mi Ran...

143
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,630
isn't something that
can just end with the two of us.

144
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,470
What do you mean by that?

145
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,740
Yun Hee.
Listen to me, and don't freak out.

146
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,410
I have...

147
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,410
a child.

148
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,440
A child?

149
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,750
Don't tell me you were
actually talking about yourself...

150
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,620
when you told me about that friend
whose girlfriend was pregnant.

151
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,520
Are you saying that woman,
Kang Mi Ran, is pregnant?

152
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,060
No,

153
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,330
that was just a misunderstanding.

154
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,130
I have a grown son.

155
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,430
And it's someone you know, Yun Hee.

156
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,640
It's Kang Seung Woo.

157
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,810
What are you talking about?

158
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,810
So...

159
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,020
Even though he was raised
as Jae In's brother,

160
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,750
he's actually Kang Mi Ran's son?

161
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,420
And Seung Woo only found out about
his birth mother recently, too?

162
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,090
Yes.

163
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,630
He was raised to believe he was
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol's son.

164
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,200
I only found out recently, too.

165
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,000
We'd decided to get back together,

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,400
but then we broke up
after I learned the truth.

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,240
But we're back where we started.
My heart won't listen, Yun Hee.

168
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,280
What a pity.

169
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,950
After hearing all this,
I despise that woman even more.

170
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,820
- Yun Hee.
- For almost 30 years,

171
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,690
she had Choi Ja Young raise him.

172
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,030
Her brother's family
raised Seung Woo in her place,

173
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,600
so how could she be so cruel
to her niece, Jae In?

174
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,070
That's because Jae In's mother
let Seung Woo take the blame.

175
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
And I think
Mi Ran resented her for that.

176
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,140
Whatever the excuse,

177
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,140
she laid low all this time,

178
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,480
and when her brother died,
she showed her true colors.

179
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,250
She waltzed in,
playing the concerned mother,

180
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,650
to use Seung Woo as a pawn
to take over YL Group.

181
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,220
That's the only way I see it.

182
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,050
Ask anyone on the street.

183
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,890
It's not just me. Anyone would come
to the same conclusion.

184
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,990
Of course, she was in the wrong.

185
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,490
I'm not saying Mi Ran is blameless.

186
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,630
But she misunderstood some things
because she didn't know everything.

187
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,600
Even if it wasn't true,

188
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,570
family should have your back.

189
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,810
But she's doing her best to clean up
all the mess she's made.

190
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,110
Stuff like that won't happen again.
So please...

191
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,210
What are you, her spokesperson?
Her lawyer?

192
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,910
I've heard enough.

193
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,620
Let me make myself perfectly clear.

194
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,120
Kang Mi Ran was a zero in my book,
but now she's in the negatives.

195
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,910
Hey! Hwang Gi Chan!

196
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,190
Our father was so good to you!

197
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,090
How could you kill my father?

198
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,530
You murderer! You're an animal!

199
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,900
Seung Woo, stop!
Don't! Please, just stop!

200
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,170
Are you insane?

201
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,570
How dare you get violent?

202
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,710
Who are you to yell at me?
You're the baby of the family.

203
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,910
Where's security?
Get them in here, now!

204
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,350
Shut your mouth, you murderer.

205
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,060
Do you really think the recording
our father left is gone for good?

206
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,260
Just because I gave you the master,
right?

207
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,200
Go ahead. Report Seung Woo.

208
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,270
I just need to make
our father's last words public.

209
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,530
Go on. Try me.

210
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,410
Seung Woo, let's go.

211
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,900
Have you calmed down?

212
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,400
When I saw him,

213
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,770
I just saw red.

214
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,740
I lunged at him before
I even knew what I was doing.

215
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,410
I just wanted to kill him.

216
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,050
If it weren't for him,

217
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,120
Mom wouldn't have ended up this way.

218
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,620
I feel so bad for Mom.

219
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,590
Jae In, what are we going to do
about Mom?

220
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,460
I'm going crazy
just thinking about her.

221
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,030
All the awful words I said to her...
I resented her, I cursed her.

222
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,600
Don't be so hard on yourself.

223
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,210
You didn't know
what she went through.

224
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,980
Anyone would've done the same.

225
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,240
I was the same way.

226
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,550
Even though I was living with her,

227
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,020
I had no idea she had Alzheimer's.

228
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,050
If anyone's a bad child, it's me.

229
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,790
But at least we know now.

230
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,530
From now on,
let's put Mom's mind at ease.

231
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,430
Okay?

232
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,130
With Mom,

233
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,140
it's probably best not to let on,
right?

234
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,880
Having to show us that
she's sick and weak...

235
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,910
will be devastating for her.

236
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,720
Got it.

237
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
I will.

238
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,690
Shouldn't we tell Mom, though?

239
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,060
About Kim Do Hee's car accident...

240
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,290
It wasn't Mom's fault.

241
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,630
We will.

242
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,500
I'll tell her everything
on one of her more lucid days.

243
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,840
Seung Woo.

244
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,770
You need to think rationally
from now on.

245
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,750
We must show no weakness
to Hwang Gi Chan or Kang Se Ri.

246
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,680
If they see an opening,
they're the kind who'll exploit it.

247
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,820
I understand.

248
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,820
I'll try.

249
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,500
Mr. Hwang Gi Man.

250
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,400
Can we talk for a minute?

251
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,320
Why did you give me soapy water
to drink?

252
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,450
It's floral tea, not soapy water.

253
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,620
That's why it smells like flowers.

254
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,020
Flowers suit a princess,
so you should drink it.

255
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,400
Want to know what I like?

256
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,570
I like chocolate milk,
all kinds of ice cream,

257
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,400
and for snacks,
I like anything chocolate.

258
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,940
What about you, Princess?

259
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,940
Do you like choco milk, Princess?

260
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,010
My mom always drinks coffee milk
after going to the bathhouse.

261
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,110
Do you drink coffee-flavored milk,
Princess?

262
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,680
Hwang Gi Man,

263
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,780
listen to me carefully.

264
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,350
I need you to focus.

265
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,420
Okay.

266
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,620
You may not remember,
but we were once married.

267
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,960
We saw each other's best and worst,
and we have already split up.

268
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,330
We broke up? Why?

269
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,770
What's the point
of dredging up the past?

270
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,010
What's certain is we're divorced.

271
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,050
A divorce is...

272
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,250
when a couple who loved each other
fall out of love.

273
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,320
But I like you, Princess.

274
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,360
I love you.

275
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,590
Well, I don't.
I can't return your feelings.

276
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Understand?

277
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,460
But I don't.

278
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,770
I don't get it.

279
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,140
So stop standing around
in front of my store.

280
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,640
It's wrong to do something
the person you like hates, right?

281
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,250
I think at least the man you are now
can understand that.

282
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,420
Doing something
the person I like hates...

283
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,190
is a bad thing.

284
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,470
What's this? Why am I getting this
from the Prosecutor's Office?

285
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,770
(Summons)

286
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,380
(Case summary, required documents)

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,840
(Notice of rights)

288
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,550
(Seoul district prosecutors' office)

289
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,530
I heard Asst. Manager Kang Seung Woo
hit you.

290
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,160
You must've done something, right?

291
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,570
Get out.

292
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,700
Come on.
He wouldn't hit you for no reason.

293
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,900
I said to get out!

294
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,970
This is the office.
Don't cross the line.

295
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,180
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

296
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,780
Honey, we're in huge trouble.
I was summoned by the prosecutors.

297
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,190
What happened to your face?
Did you get into a fight?

298
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,790
It's nothing.
Just say what you came to say.

299
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,730
Look at this.

300
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,300
You got one too?

301
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,130
What are we going to do now?

302
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,500
Don't worry about it.

303
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,580
How can I not worry?
What if there's more than a witness?

304
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,680
They're summoning both of us
for questioning.

305
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,810
Isn't that strange?

306
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,980
There's a recording of the accident.

307
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,920
Your voice is on it.

308
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,320
- How is that possible?
- A cell phone.

309
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,160
Your voice was recorded on the phone
of the person she was talking to.

310
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,400
Then what are we supposed to do?

311
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,430
Isn't this a setup?

312
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,300
The recording alone...

313
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,870
can't prove we killed
Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee.

314
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,140
From what I remember,

315
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,880
we never said
anything about killing her.

316
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,750
But still,
they know we were at the scene.

317
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,350
No. We just have to deny it.

318
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,490
In court, they need hard evidence.

319
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,690
The audio file won't be enough.

320
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,060
So, I guess we'll just deny it,
like you said.

321
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,060
Exactly. So, act like you
don't know anything...

322
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,400
as you've been doing,

323
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,530
Don't do anything rash.

324
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,300
Okay. I'm counting on you.

325
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,500
Let's take a look.

326
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,290
So it's clear Jae In's mother's car
didn't hit her.

327
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:28,170
Yes. I think the car startled her,
and Do Hee fell on her own.

328
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,670
From the driver
Choi Ja Young's perspective,

329
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,100
since Kim Do Hee collapsed
right in front of her,

330
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,270
she would have naturally assumed
she caused the accident.

331
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,440
Yes.

332
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,210
It happened so fast,

333
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,810
and it was pouring rain.

334
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,020
Apparently,
this video file was edited too.

335
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,150
Why they would bother to send
an edited video of the accident...

336
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,490
is crystal clear now.

337
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,160
We need to submit this footage
to prosecutors as evidence now.

338
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,230
Yes, and that will definitely clear
your mother's name, Jae In,

339
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,370
and the reinvestigation will kick
into high gear.

340
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,470
Jae In. Now, for Ja Young...

341
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,610
I think it's time
you told your mother the truth.

342
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,330
Mom.

343
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,900
You didn't hit Kim Do Hee
with your car.

344
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,700
Really?

345
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,540
It wasn't me?

346
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,370
Really?

347
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,210
I didn't do it?

348
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,240
It was a close call,

349
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,810
but you didn't do it, Mom.

350
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,650
The forensic video expert confirmed
it wasn't you.

351
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,360
Ja Young,
you've been through so much.

352
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,200
Now you can put it all behind you.

353
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,330
I guess secrets never stay buried.

354
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,340
This is another reminder of that.

355
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,480
What a relief.

356
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,880
Such a relief.

357
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,820
I'm so relieved it wasn't me.

358
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,080
So...

359
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,920
you're saying that Jae In's mother
didn't cause Do Hee's death,

360
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,230
and the video proves it for certain?

361
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,560
Yes.

362
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,130
We fell for the trap set
by Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

363
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,800
They're worse than I ever thought.

364
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,700
If we didn't have that evidence,

365
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,440
we would have framed
an innocent person for murder.

366
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,180
Imagine how frustrated
Do Hee must have been watching us.

367
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,780
Mother, are you all right?

368
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,950
Like Oh Seong said,
we almost became the villains in this.

369
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,660
We almost let an innocent person rot
in prison for the rest of her life.

370
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,030
Does Jae In's mother know yet?

371
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,900
Yes. Jae In said she was going
to tell her today.

372
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:52,700
She must have felt so wronged.

373
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,370
At least we know the truth now.
Yun Hee, don't be too upset.

374
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,310
Do Yun, you know we can't
just let this slide, right?

375
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,320
To ensure this never happens again,
you must tell the world the truth.

376
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,890
Of course.
I'll make sure everyone knows.

377
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,360
We absolutely have to.
We must make an example of them.

378
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,360
Yes. We must.

379
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,460
We absolutely will.

380
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,800
As new evidence comes to light
in the YL Group's Kim Do Hee case,

381
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,340
the case has taken a surprise turn.

382
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:30,970
Thanks to new evidence,

383
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,910
YL Group's late Chairman Kang's wife,
Choi Ja Young,

384
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,280
has been exonerated.

385
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,520
The prosecution will review
the past investigation...

386
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,250
and new evidence...

387
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,950
to ensure
no questions are left unanswered.

388
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,420
They have also stated that they will
conduct a thorough reinvestigation.

389
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,660
Hey, Gi Chan,
what's going on with all this?

390
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,330
Are we really just going
to let this happen?

391
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,270
It's just news that she's innocent.

392
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,240
What does that have to do with me?

393
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,710
They'll catch some other culprit,
I guess.

394
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,580
Don't worry about it.
I'm heading to work.

395
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,450
He's right, Mother.
No one knows about it,

396
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,880
except for us.

397
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,490
I'm heading out, too.

398
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,390
Why that...

399
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,300
I just don't understand
life sometimes.

400
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,110
This is just too cruel
a twist of fate.

401
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,580
Is this about
what you heard about Kang Seung Woo?

402
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,710
Yes.

403
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,780
It's shocking that
he has a grown son,

404
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,880
and he wasn't raised by just anyone.

405
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,220
To think he was raised...

406
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,220
in YL Group's family
as Jae In's brother.

407
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,530
Kang Seung Woo still doesn't know
about Oh Seong.

408
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,730
I heard he also...

409
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,630
recently found out Director Kang Mi Ran
was his biological mother,

410
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,030
a woman he thought was his aunt.

411
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,640
Yes, I heard all that.

412
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,500
I heard, but...

413
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,680
no matter what anyone says,
I can't stand that Kang Mi Ran.

414
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,210
Oh Seong was a complete wreck
after she abandoned him.

415
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,220
It's in the past, and your uncle,
the one who went through it all,

416
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,820
says he's okay.

417
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,320
I tell myself to forget it, but...

418
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,390
I think about Mi Sook...
You know, Jae In's mother.

419
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,690
I get furious all over again
when I think of her.

420
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,960
She's a victim in all this, too.

421
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,000
All because of Kang Mi Ran
and her high-and-mighty family.

422
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,510
She lived so long without the truth.
Her resentment must have festered.

423
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,510
They completely toyed with her life.

424
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,350
Every time I see her
losing her mind,

425
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,050
I can't help but feel wronged
and furious on her behalf.

00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,390
It's me. We need to talk.

00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,720
What do you want?

432
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,590
If this isn't about work,
there is no need to meet privately.

433
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,260
Why are you so on edge?

434
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,990
I'm not.

435
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,330
Seriously, what is this?

436
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,390
Why did you ask to see me?

437
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,260
I was in the area to meet someone,
so I thought I could see you.

438
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,730
Is there a problem with that?

439
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Are you kidding me?

440
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm only going to ask you
this one last time.

441
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,040
The baby you were carrying...

442
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,280
Is the baby really dead?

443
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,650
I already told you the baby died.

444
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,880
What would I get out of
lying to you?

445
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,290
Let me make this perfectly clear.

446
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,950
That baby...

447
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
is dead.

448
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,900
All right.

449
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,870
Fine. That's it.
That's all I wanted to ask.

450
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,210
Don't you dare say anything
to Gi Chan.

451
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:59,140
What we had is ancient history.

452
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,580
At least have that much decency.

453
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,020
Like you said,
it was already over between us,

454
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,020
and there's no child
connecting us anymore,

455
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,120
so what nonsense is there
for me to say?

456
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,790
Yes, hello?

457
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,560
Oh, yes. I've just arrived.

458
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Excuse me.

459
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,620
Are you Designer L?

460
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,250
Yes, that's me.

461
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
Hello.

462
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,560
Kang Jae In?

463
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,230
Do I know you?

464
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,530
Your style has gotten so glamorous
that I almost didn't recognize you.

465
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,470
But it is you.

466
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,270
Gosh, I'm sorry.

467
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,510
I'm having trouble placing you.

468
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,490
Success is the fortune of those
who never give up.

469
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,220
Best of luck.

470
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,390
That's what my father
always used to say.

00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,560

472
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,330
It's been eight years, hasn't it?

473
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,900
Gosh, it's so good to see you.

474
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,910
I'm Lee Tae Oh.

475
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,510
As in, Lee Tae Oh, the art dealer?

476
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,650
That's me.

477
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,620
To think that Designer L
is Kang Jae In...

478
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,950
I never would have imagined.

479
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,990
I could say the same.

480
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,630
Lee Tae Oh,

481
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,230
I've been looking for you.

482
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,400
I've been looking for you too,
Kang Jae In.

483
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,710
Everyone, say hello.

484
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,310
This is Lee Tae Oh, the art dealer.

485
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,510
This is our CEO, Jung Oh Seong,
and Director Kim Do Yun.

486
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,450
It's a pleasure to meet you.

487
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,050
Lee Tae Oh?

488
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,750
Wait, then... Do you know
Andy Rogers, by any chance?

489
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,260
He's a major super-collector.

490
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,890
Of course.

491
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,890
He's a longtime patron
and a special VIP of mine.

492
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,300
Are you Patrick, by any chance?
Rogers insisted we meet tomorrow.

493
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,270
Yes, that's me.

494
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,640
Fancy meeting you here.
It's a pleasure.

495
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,640
So you two already knew each other?

496
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,040
We met long ago in the States,

497
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,540
but I didn't know
he was a top art dealer.

498
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,580
It's all thanks to Jae In.

499
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,720
To me, she's my "destiny?"

500
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,680
How do you say that in Korean?

501
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,150
Fate.

502
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,990
That's right. Fate.

503
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,420
She is like fate to me.

504
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,400
Come on, have a seat.

505
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,400
Jae In mentioned you had a reason
for looking for me.

506
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,740
We wanted to ask you something
about your younger sister.

507
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,980
We heard her name is Catherine.

508
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
That's correct.

509
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,890
We heard she went missing
a long time ago.

510
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,790
Yes... How did you know that?

511
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,130
Do you know my sister, Catherine?

512
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:44,730
By any chance,
is this person's name...

513
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,040
Catherine?

514
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,060

515
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,130
- Ms. Kang!
- Bo Ram!

516
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Have you been waiting long?

517
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,800
No, I just came down.

518
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
I'm so sorry.

519
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:56,770
For everything I said
and did to Do Hee.

520
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,040
I know I can't take
any of it back...

521
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,110
or any way to undo it.

522
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,210
For as long as you're my mom,

523
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:09,220
Ms. Choi Ja Young will still be
a mother of mine.

524
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,420
But I wanted to call you this today.

525
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,460
Thank you,

526
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,390
Mom.

527
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,030
Hwang Ji Ho.

528
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,360
How long were you
going to hide my son from me?
