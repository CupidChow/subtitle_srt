00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,050
(Episode 47)

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,420
We need to talk.

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,020
Please give us some privacy.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,560
What do you want to say?

8
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,830
Why did you hide that
Director Kim Do Yun was your nephew?

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,600
I never hid it.

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,510
I just didn't have a reason
to let you know ahead of time.

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,280
Why did you two join YL Group
as investors?

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,880
You want your revenge
on Ms. Kim Do Hee.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,050
You're trying to take YL Group over.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,950
I didn't make the offer.
YL Group begged me to invest.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
And all investments come with terms.

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,360
If you don't do your job right,
of course, we'll take over.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,460
Jung Oh Seong!

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,960
I'm not going to sit around
and let a corporate raider...

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,760
do the wicked things he does.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,570
Listen, Director Kang Mi Ran.

21
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,440
I don't plan to take it over
with dirty tricks.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,200
If a company fails
to perform well...

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,410
and falls due to lax management
and scandals of the owner's family,

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,810
it won't have to be me,
because anyone will come and take it.

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,920
YL Group used to be managed
within the family, too.

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,480
It's the same for me.

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,720
I wanted Director Kim Do Yun
because he was a talented man.

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,560
If that's a problem with you,

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,060
it's not too late
to turn down the investment.

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,390
I'll leave quietly.

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,530
Give me a straight answer.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,030
Are you doing this
as Ms. Kim's revenge or not?

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,470
Take it however you like.

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,800
I don't want to give you
an easy explanation.

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,970
I'm not going to sit around
if revenge is what you seek.

36
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,280
I'll never show mercy,
even if it's you.

37
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,850
YL Group is mine.

38
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,750
I look forward to finding out
who'll have the last laugh.

39
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,220
You've become rather immature.

40
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,520
"It's mine?"

41
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,100
I'm going to present our designer
to the chairman right now.

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,370
Follow us if you want to.

43
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,930
That is, if you want to know
what we'll talk about.

44
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,450
She's your designer?

45
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,380
I thought
she'd be a great help for us.

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,950
I'm against this.

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,550
She worked for YL Group
until recently,

48
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,620
and there was a negative scandal,
although it had been resolved.

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,460
If you are
talking about the design leak,

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,360
I believe her name has been cleared.

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,200
We offered her a reinstatement,
but she turned it down.

52
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,370
It seems like she has
an ulterior motive...

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,970
to join the workplace once again
with the investor.

54
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,610
Are you saying
we have the ulterior motive?

55
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,210
Or are you talking about Ms. Kang?

56
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,410
As for us,
we already had an agreement.

57
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,750
So, does Ms. Kang have a reason to hold
an ulterior motive against YL?

58
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,760
Come to think of it, her name is
the same as Team Leader Kang Se Ri.

59
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,420
Team Leader Kang Se Ri's
real name is Kang Jae In, right?

60
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,760
She's the daughter
of the late Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol,

61
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,660
your father-in-law.

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,300
You must know her well.
She's your niece.

63
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,140
We're against this...

64
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,210
because she only joined us recently
by winning the in-house contest,

65
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,580
so it's impossible to evaluate
her competency.

66
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,110
I'm trying to give you a chance.
Good grief.

67
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,620
She didn't just join you recently.

68
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,390
Did you two really think
I was completely in the dark?

69
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,660
Don't you know...

70
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,230
I must gather all information
available and analyze everything...

71
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,430
before making an investment?

72
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,200
Isn't she the daughter
of the late Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol,

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,630
Director Kang Mi Ran's niece,

74
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,630
and Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's
ex-wife?

75
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,140
And she was the youngest leader
of the design team YL has seen.

76
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,910
Is there a discrepancy
in everything I said?

77
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,080
Tell me, Ms. Kang. Am I wrong?

78
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,480
No.

79
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,020
Everything you said was true.

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,290
She was the youngest leader
of the design team,

81
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,020
and she proved herself again
through the last contest.

82
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,590
You can't use her competency
as an excuse.

83
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,260
Isn't that so, Director Kang?

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,200
Family affairs should be resolved
within the family,

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,630
so I won't say anything else.

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,600
But if you cannot accept her
as my designer,

87
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,110
we should call the investment off.

88
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,310
I'll pull out all my investment.

89
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,710
Over something as petty as this?

90
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,080
How is this petty?

91
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,780
I already began to lose my trust
as soon as you claimed...

92
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,920
Ms. Kang Se Ri was
actually Ms. Kang Jae In.

93
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,390
What do you say?

94
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,930
You two can decide.
I don't care how this goes.

95
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,270
You can do as you like, Mr. Jung.

96
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,010
What are you and Kim Do Yun
of DH Holdings scheming?

97
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,780
What do you mean by that?

98
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,050
You two live in the same house.

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,090
Have you been digging into my background?

100
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,490
You're the worst, Aunt Mi Ran.

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,630
No, you're the worst.

102
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,800
Were you and Kim Do Yun
in that kind of relationship...

103
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,460
long before you were locked up
in the mental institution?

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,330
I didn't know everything
Chairman Hwang said would be true.

105
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
You should be ashamed of yourself.

106
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,770
You just crossed the line.

107
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,470
I won't condone
this kind of humiliation anymore.

108
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,510
So? Are you trying to pick a fight?

109
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,680
Did you think I wouldn't know...

110
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,580
you're trying to take YL over
by using a man...

111
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,180
to back you up?

112
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,090
YL Group was my dad's,
not Hwang Gi Chan's.

113
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,520
I just want to take back
what's rightfully mine.

114
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,190
What's the problem there?

115
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,100
So, did you hit on those two men...

116
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,900
who are related to Kim Do Hee,

117
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,870
trying to claim that...

118
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,070
Kang Seung Woo killed Ms. Kim,
not your mom?

119
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,700
The case is under reinvestigation,
so that's always possible.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,170
What are you talking about?

121
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,670
You're trying to save your mom...

122
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,510
and frame Seung Woo as the murderer.

123
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,250
You must think this company will
become yours once Seung Woo is gone,

124
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,010
but not even in your dreams.

125
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,520
I'll protect him...

126
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,490
even if I must risk my life.

127
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,960
You're so low, Aunt Mi Ran.

128
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,130
Seung Woo is my younger brother,

129
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,160
and I know better than anyone
that he's innocent.

130
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:37,030
So please,
you need to open your eyes.

131
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,940
My late dad is watching us
from the other side.

132
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,540
(Planning and Design Team)

133
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,680
You turned down
your chance to be reinstated.

134
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,050
Did you regret it?

135
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,590
If you're here to ask
for another chance, wake up.

136
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,290
I'm going to stop you.

137
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,460
Nice to meet you,
Team Leader Kang Se Ri.

138
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,960
I am the exclusive designer
for YL Group,

139
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
from DH Holdings'
Investment and Development Team.

140
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,500
My name is Kang Jae In.

141
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,040
We'll meet each other often
from now on,

142
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,240
so watch what you say.

143
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,220
Jae In.

144
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,820
Are you really working for them?

145
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,090
- Yes.
- Why?

146
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,100
Why did it have to be DH Holdings?

147
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,530
Do you know how suspicious they are?

148
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,700
The CEO of that company...

149
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,570
cursed Aunt Mi Ran and said
YL Group will go down.

150
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,810
Why do you think
a man like that invested here?

151
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,340
Isn't it obvious?

152
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,280
What is this?

153
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,510
Do you not care?

154
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,780
- Jae In.
- Seung Woo.

155
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,020
Jae In.

156
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,060
Are you trying
to start a fight against YL Group...

157
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,320
because you despise me?

158
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,960
- No.
- Then, what?

159
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,460
It's because...

160
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,230
I can't forgive Hwang Gi Chan.

161
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,400
Aunt Mi Ran and I voted
for Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

162
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,600
so of course, you'd hate us, too.

163
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,870
I won't deny that.

164
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,610
I wouldn't say hate, though.
But I blamed you two.

165
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,540
You both played a part
in handing YL Group over to him.

166
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,210
Your priority was...

167
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,320
also YL Group.

168
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,280
It wasn't me.

169
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,650
I already told you
that you were my dear brother.

170
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,390
Then, don't work for them.

171
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,890
Return to us.

172
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,230
I'll ask to have you reinstated.

173
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,500
I'm sorry, Seung Woo.

174
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,480
Did you get some sleep?

175
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,390
Yes.

176
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,550
Why didn't you say anything?

177
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,960
Why did you live that life
like a fool?

178
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

179
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,230
I'm not trying to make you say that.

180
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,840
You're my only family.

181
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,640
You're my life and my everything.

182
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,910
You should've told me everything.

183
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,210
If things were tough,
you should've said so.

184
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,480
- If you had...
- After Mom passed away,

185
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,490
you lived your entire life for me.

186
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,790
I wanted to show you
how happy I was.

187
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,660
I remember...

188
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,130
how happily you smiled
on the day of my wedding.

189
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,070
I was so happy to see
such a big smile on you.

190
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,540
It felt like
I finally became a good daughter,

191
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,710
so I wanted to show you
a happy marriage as a good daughter.

192
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,980
That was
why I put up with everything,

193
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,320
even when things were
hard and painful,

194
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,550
even when they looked down on me.

195
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,230
I didn't want to be
another burden to you.

196
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,830
I had no idea
my daughter had been living...

197
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,700
such a tough and painful life.

198
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,540
I'm your dad,
yet I still had no idea.

199
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm sorry, Yu Gyeong.

200
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:46,320
I don't deserve to be a dad.

201
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,590
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,030
Divorce isn't a big deal, anyway.

203
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,300
I'm always on your side.

204
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,810
You don't have to worry about me...

205
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,380
or anything else.

206
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,840
Make the decision only for yourself.

207
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,580
That's the way to be
a real good daughter, Yu Gyeong.

208
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,550
Okay.

209
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,870
May I come in for a moment,
Ms. Choi?

210
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,340
She's not here.

211
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,540
She left early, saying there was
an important event...

212
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,640
at the shopping arcade.

213
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,150
(Celebrating the appointment
of President Jung Yun Hee)

214
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,250
Darn it.

215
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,230
(Yeongun Arcade Co-op President
Jung Yun Hee)

216
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,360
It was already embarrassing
to see all those banners,

217
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,630
but the co-op came
and gave me those,

218
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,570
saying I'd need a card.

219
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,100
I like how they handle things
very quickly.

220
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,440
Should I call you
President Jung from now on?

221
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,810
Goodness, don't do that.

222
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,880
I'm only the president
when I work at the co-op.

223
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,950
My real job is
the CEO of this chicken place.

224
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,410
You can just call me
as you have before.

225
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,420
Anyway, congratulations.

226
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,850
I didn't think I'd get the job.

227
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,390
What did people see in me
to vote for me?

228
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,590
I knew you would make it.

229
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,430
The other candidate was so lousy.

230
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,660
She claimed she'd vote for you,

231
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,270
but she made all those excuses
and never resigned as a candidate.

232
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,770
I'm sure she had a reason.

233
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,570
I wouldn't have minded
even if Ms. Noh got it.

234
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,540
I have a good judgment of people,

235
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,410
and you're much better
than that woman.

236
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,210
It's all thanks to you, Mi Sook...

237
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,420
No, it's all thanks to you,
my sister.

238
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,920
Can I consider you as my big sister?

239
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,520
If you want to.

240
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,730
Here.

241
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,530
What is this?

242
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,630
Congratulations on your appointment.

243
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,200
I got you a lipstick.

244
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,400
Goodness, you don't have to do this.

245
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,740
I never put on makeup anyway.
You can keep it.

246
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,540
You need to look as graceful
as the position you hold.

247
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,710
You're the president,
so start dressing up a little.

248
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,680
Here. My arm hurts.

249
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,620
Thanks, Mi Sook.

250
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,860
Congratulations, Ms. Jung.

251
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:48,300
Goodness,
you didn't have to get this.

252
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,970
Thank you.

253
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,300
But it calls for a celebration.

254
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,070
The future of this shopping arcade
is very bright.

255
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,910
Gosh, I feel so embarrassed...

256
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,880
to have you two celebrate like this.

257
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,080
Mi Sook, you said
you had a great taste.

258
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,550
Where should I put this?

259
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,320
In this restaurant, it should go...

260
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,890
That might be the place.

261
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,290
This area?

262
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,030
Remove that thing
and put that there.

263
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,960
No, a bit more to the right.

264
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,430
Yes, remove that.

265
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,500
Okay.

266
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,140
They must've become quite close.
What do I do?

267
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,110
Things will become chaotic
if they find out about each other.

268
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,610
Okay.

269
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,550
The wrapping is so pretty.

270
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,250
- It's...
- I put a lot of thought into it.

271
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,290
If it hadn't been that woman,
that ex-in-law of mine,

272
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,960
I would've gone over
to share my false congratulations.

273
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,330
Darn it.
I used so much money in secret,

274
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,230
but that wrong woman
became the president.

275
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,600
Attorney, I'm not divorcing her.

276
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,140
So, just focus on making my wife...

277
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,910
give up on the divorce suit.

278
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,140
Yes, I don't care
even if it takes years.

279
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,150
Just stop her from leaving me. Bye.

280
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,020
So, why did you play along
when she wanted a kid,

281
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,590
only to blow this up like this?

282
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,090
If you think about it,
it's all your fault.

283
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,060
When I said I'd tell my wife...

284
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,690
about the initial test result,

285
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,130
you told me not to tell her...

286
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,860
because you thought
she'd hold it against me.

287
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,100
And why am I the only one
who was born like this, anyway?

288
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,470
Jeez.

289
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,000
Gi Chan and I were
both born from you,

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,640
but how is it that
he can keep two families...

291
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,840
while I'm the only one like this?
Darn it!

292
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,880
Hey! Both your father
and I had no problems.

293
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,310
That was why we had three kids.

294
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,220
Why are you blaming me
for your infertility?

295
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,190
The line is busy right now.
Please leave a message...

296
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,320
after the tone.

297
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,390
The line is still busy.

298
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,160
Did those weird people come
to pick a fight?

299
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,670
I should leave a text message.

300
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,000
(Yu Gyeong: Hey, it's me.
Call me when you see this.)

301
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,850
You could've just asked like a man
if you wanted my number.

302
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,920
I get it, so give me that.

303
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,250
What are you doing?

304
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,690
I thought it was odd you didn't call
even after I gave you the dates.

305
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
It was because
you didn't have my number!

306
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,760
Are we good now?

307
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,970
I'm way too soft-hearted.

308
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,540
I'd turn her down
if she directly said...

309
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,940
she had feelings for me.

310
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,480
But it's not even that,
so it'd look weird if I did that.

311
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,850
This is driving me crazy.

312
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,390
How far is she taking this
inside her head?

313
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,950
Yes, Attorney.

314
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,460
I understand what you mean.

315
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,090
My husband
doesn't want to divorce me,

316
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,460
so I didn't expect this
to end overnight.

317
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,230
A statement from a third party?

318
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,840
Someone who knows a lot
about my husband and me?

319
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,810
I'll prepare that if I can.

320
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,480
Bye.

321
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,280
I can't ask my dad to do it.

322
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,720
Jae In is the only one.

323
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,890
Even I can see
how shameless that would be.

324
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,230
My brother-in-law,
are you and Do Hee doing well?

325
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,430
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,470
But don't worry
about Yun Hee and Do Yun.

327
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,940
This time, I'll keep them safe.

328
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,080
Little Grandpa, what about me?

329
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,510
Oh, gosh. I'll also keep...

330
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,310
Bo Ram safe, too.

331
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,190
Let's eat.

332
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,620
- All right.
- Cheers.

333
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,060
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

334
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:43,530
Congratulations on becoming
the co-op president, Yun Hee.

335
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,400
- Congratulations.
- Mom.

336
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,630
It's so cool to call you
President Jung Yun Hee.

337
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,470
You're the best, Grandma!

338
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,510
Stop flattering me.
I'm embarrassed to death.

339
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,440
Why are you embarrassed?
You should be proud!

340
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,010
The president of a co-op
isn't a job for everyone.

341
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,140
You got it because it was you!

342
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,910
It's so amazing.

343
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,910
If your husband had been alive,

344
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,150
he would've carried you on his back
and run around the neighborhood.

345
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,450
Stop it.

346
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,560
He would've done that, actually.

347
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,260
He would've been so happy.

348
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,760
Of course, I know him.

349
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,030
He would've put on
this ridiculous dance, too.

350
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,540
Is it because Ms. Noh is
now across the hall from me?

351
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,310
I casually think of our days
in that poor neighborhood.

352
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,410
I always regret leaving that man...

353
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,440
who couldn't move around
alone at home.

354
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,580
That wouldn't have happened
if I had stayed with him that day.

355
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,420
I left the fire on low heat
to make some herbal tonic.

356
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,490
Why did that stove
have to fall over?

357
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,160
Mom, it wasn't your fault.

358
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,560
He's right. Who would've thought
the house would catch on fire?

359
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,060
Grandma, don't be sad.

360
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,060
You're making me sad, too.

361
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,400
I was acting too silly
on this good day, wasn't I?

362
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,440
Yes.

363
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,250
Right. I heard Min Jun
and Ms. Noh are in-laws.

364
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,950
Yes, did I forget to tell you?

365
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,190
He's her eldest son's father-in-law,
the one who's in the kitchen.

366
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,030
I didn't know,
so I made such a big mistake.

367
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,700
I set them up on a blind date.

368
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,470
What?

369
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,810
Unbelievable!

370
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,180
Do you need any other help?

371
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,880
No.

372
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,350
I'm happy to hear Ms. Jung laugh.

373
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,490
The woman who owns the restaurant
across the hall was an old neighbor,

374
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,960
so those days
must keep returning to her.

375
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,420
They seemed
to have become closer lately.

376
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,490
You must also remember those days
if you saw her.

377
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,160
I haven't run into her yet.

378
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,900
Right, and about Director Do.

379
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,300
Mr. Do?

380
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,770
Yes, I found out he was a part-timer
at my mom's place.

381
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,040
He is?

382
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,210
I knew he had a part-time job,
but I didn't know it was this place.

383
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,240
Then, does he know...

384
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,580
Ms. Jung is Ms. Do Hee's mother?

385
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,120
Yes, he found out recently.

386
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,320
That's crazy.

387
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,660
What's wrong?

388
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,030
Things were hectic,
so I had completely forgotten.

389
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,660
I once ran into Ms. Jung
in front of the fried chicken place.

390
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,830
Isn't the restaurant across the hall
a pig's feet place?

391
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,240
You're right.

392
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,340
The woman my mom mentioned is
the owner of that restaurant.

393
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,710
That restaurant is owned
by Hwang Gi Chan's mother.

394
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,110
It seems like Ms. Jung has no idea.

395
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,960
I can already see
how Ms. Noh would've responded.

396
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
I wanted to do something good,
but I felt really bad instead.

397
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,740
You should find a man
for that woman.

398
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,100
Me?

399
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,240
You need to save me, please.

400
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,140
If you see anyone good at the co-op,
set him up with her.

401
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,110
What's going on between you and her?

402
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,020
Well, the way she looks at me...

403
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,720
I mean, I'm that sexy.

404
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,120
Don't say that in front of a kid.

405
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,490
Oh, my. I'm sorry, Bo Ram.

406
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,230
Little Grandpa,
you can tell me to cover my ears...

407
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,730
when you want to say a word
that children shouldn't hear.

408
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,830
Like this? Okay.

409
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,740
I'm learning so much from you.

410
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,570
Be nice to Ms. Noh.

411
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,680
She's good to you
because she has no siblings.

412
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,780
She doesn't mean anything else.

413
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,210
No, she does.

414
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,350
Anyway, I got it.

415
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,820
They must've grown quite close.
What do we do?

416
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,820
We don't know anything for sure,
so let's give it time.

417
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,260
You should eat up.

418
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,800
Thanks for helping me cook
for the memorial service.

419
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,970
Don't mention it. Thanks.

420
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,970
Is she going to sleep here again?

421
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,080
It's so uncomfortable.

422
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,350
Would you like to grab a cup of tea?

423
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,390
I have to go to bed soon,
so no, I'm fine.

424
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,060
Are you not going back home?

425
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,800
Can you continue to stay here?

426
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,660
Yes.

427
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,330
- I'll get some rest.
- Okay.

428
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,280
Yu Gyeong is
getting ready for a divorce.

429
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,240
I see.

430
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,750
Then, will she
continue to stay here?

431
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,180
Of course, she should.

432
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,490
Ms. Choi, about your part-time job.

433
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,130
Why don't you quit?

434
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:22,230
Why? I was starting to have fun.

435
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,370
If it's because of that ignorant woman,
you don't have to worry.

436
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,940
I've already run into her
many times.

437
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,310
I don't care if she's around
as long as she doesn't bother me.

438
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,880
She came back?

439
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,320
She used Kim Do Yun as a connection
and came with the investors.

440
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,360
Darn it.
So, they were having an affair.

441
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,090
Do you still think
they aren't together?

442
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,930
Why can't you see this?

443
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,390
I don't care anymore.

444
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,200
You don't?

445
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,970
No, I fell in love too easily,
so I failed to notice a few things.

446
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,570
I took another look
and realized he wasn't my type.

447
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,900
He looks too young,

448
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,740
he's not even chill,

449
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,040
and he has the worst taste in women.

450
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,140
Anyway, I don't like
anything about him.

451
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,380
So, you're banned
from mentioning him now.

452
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,110
I'm banned?

453
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,550
Yes, don't mention him.

454
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,250
What's this
about falling over easily?

455
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,250
What? When did I say that?

456
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,660
Well, I think she said
she fell in love easily.

457
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,160
It means she falls for men quickly.

458
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,690
What are these
ridiculous expressions?

459
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,430
It's so hard to understand.

460
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,730
This will
only make Gi Chan's life hard.

461
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,600
Why do they keep reappearing
like cockroaches?

462
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,370
Wait, is she still not over him?

463
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,610
That's impossible.

464
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,680
How is that impossible?

465
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,780
You never know what's going on
between a man and a woman,

466
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,580
except for the two involved.

467
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,820
I'm a little hungry.
Get me something to eat.

468
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,890
How about some frozen pizza?

469
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,790
Good grief. We're only eating
instant food without Yu Gyeong.

470
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,830
She made all our food day and night,

471
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,760
even as she worked at the hospital.

472
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,930
You need to learn from her.

473
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,530
Mother, if I learned to do that,
I'd only end up like Yu Gyeong.

474
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,470
I don't want to live that life.

475
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,910
If you don't want pizza,
please excuse me.

476
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,240
Goodnight.

477
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,180
That little...

478
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,980
She's holding her head so high
with Gi Chan right behind her.

479
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,360
Are you going to let this happen?

480
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,560
What will you do about Jae In?

481
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,630
Are you still not over her?

482
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,860
Give it time.

483
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,740
It's not just Jae In.
I must get rid of Kim Do Yun first.

484
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,970
Then, Jae In will lose her connection,

485
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,640
and Patrick won't insist on
working with her.

486
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,050
There's no reason to keep working
with a designer Kim Do Yun brought.

487
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,350
Do you have a plan?

488
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,750
I need to go after his weakest spot.

489
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,960
Let's go to work.

490
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,830
You can go first.
I'll get myself there.

491
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,280
(Genotyping Report)

492
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,890
(Genotyping Report)

493
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,540
(Kang Mi Ran and Kang Seung Woo are
99.9999% related by blood.)

494
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,120
You're going to get sick,
so slow down.

495
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,660
You'll have a thriving business
if you open up a pancake place.

496
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,090
You should start one
instead of that fried chicken place.

497
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,560
Was this for a special occasion?

498
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,900
I know. Did you celebrate...

499
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,930
your appointment as the president?

500
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,940
Gosh, it's not even
that big of a deal.

501
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,410
Yesterday was the day
my late husband passed away.

502
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,010
I'm going to get groceries.
Do you need anything?

503
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,950
Enjoy, then. Goodbye.

504
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,100
Darn it. It was him of all people?

505
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,800
I'll get cursed and die early
if I continue to eat this.

506
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,810
Gosh, I'm hungry.

507
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,180
Hey.

508
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,780
Hey, don't eat that.
Spit it out. You'll get sick.

509
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,550
I told you to spit it out.
What are you doing?

510
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,420
If I get sick,
my wife will come and treat me.

511
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,660
Good grief.
He's giving me such a headache.

512
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,900
Darn it. Why are all my kids idiots
except for Gi Chan?

513
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,900
I don't want to see you here,
so leave.

514
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,080
Father, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

515
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:35,480
I really loved Yu Gyeong.

516
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,680
Did you hit her out of love?

517
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,780
Did you...

518
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,150
turn a blind eye when she was
abused by your family out of love?

519
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,490
No, I did my best, too.

520
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,530
You blamed my daughter
for your infertility.

521
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,790
How is that love?

522
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,660
Well, I felt like
I wasn't much of a man, so...

523
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,500
What a fool.

524
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,770
I don't want to see you here,
so leave.

525
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,470
I'm so sorry.

526
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,840
I'll do everything as you say
from now on, Father.

527
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,940
Please stop her from divorcing me.

528
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,740
You're the only one
who can change her mind.

529
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,150
Please help me.

530
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,110
I should've made her leave you...

531
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,950
when I found out
you kidnapped Eun Ho.

532
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,550
Don't come
anywhere near my daughter.

533
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,520
How did you find out about Eun Ho?

534
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,590
Your brother told me.

535
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,460
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

536
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,570
We got the interior design job...

537
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,000
for the apartment reconstruction project
in Saseon-dong, Cheonbuk-gu.

538
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,170
I'm aware.

539
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,970
I saw the interview with the head
of the reconstruction union,

540
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,640
and he said DH Holdings' investment
played a big role in their decision.

541
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,010
I'm not trying to take credit.

542
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,710
It's a fact that the expectations
for YL Group have gone up,

543
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,250
thanks to the investment
DH Holdings made.

544
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,250
That's why I set up this meeting
for us to cooperate.

545
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,260
We'll schedule a meeting
to give a presentation...

546
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,790
to the reconstruction union soon.

547
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,730
I thought Ms. Kang Se Ri
and Ms. Kang Jae In should...

548
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,600
work together
and prepare the presentation.

549
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,130
Designers each have
their own character...

550
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,670
and philosophy.

551
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,440
There's no need to make this hard
and suppress their uniqueness.

552
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,910
Is DH Holdings trying to say...

553
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,540
you'll present only your designer?

554
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,610
We wouldn't do that.

555
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,180
I thought Designer Kang Jae In
with DH Holdings...

556
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,880
and Team Leader Kang Se Ri
of YL Group...

557
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,690
should each bring their design
and have a competition.

558
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,420
That's a good idea.

559
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,860
We can evaluate the designs
with the reconstruction union.

560
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,860
What do you say, Designer Kang?

561
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,500
I think you are
more than capable of doing this.

562
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,300
Is it weird for me to show
such confidence?

563
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,040
No.

564
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,440
I want to meet
your expectations, Director Kim.

565
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,350
Let's do that, then. So...

566
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,420
No, one more thing.

567
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,750
I'd like to offer another term.

568
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,320
The designer
who loses this competition...

569
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,260
must leave YL Group...

570
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,030
for good, forever.

571
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,900
What do you say,
Team Leader Kang Se Ri?

572
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,430
That's what I want.

573
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,900
I feel very confident about winning.

574
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,840
There isn't a big difference
between confidence and conceit.

575
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:12,860
(Queen's House)

576
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,900
They're like gangsters.

577
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,370
Reporter Kim,
what's important isn't the truth.

578
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,710
It's how big you can blow this up.

579
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,470
Come to think of it now,
you two look alike.

580
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,610
Of course, we do.
I'm my father's son.

581
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,910
Are you here to insist
that I'm not even his son?

582
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,420
Wipe yourself off
and put some ointment on it.

583
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,590
Do you want me to get one for you?

584
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,790
Why are you
suddenly acting like this?

585
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,920
You always gave me
the death stare whenever you saw me.

586
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,290
What if...

587
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,230
I'm still not over you?
