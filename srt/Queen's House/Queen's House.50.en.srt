and backgrounds...)

and unrelated to reality.)

(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,080
We'll conduct an interim check
for the designs,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,280
so let's take a look.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,550
I got
Ms. Kang Se Ri's design last night.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,560
I have mine.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,330
(Saseon-dong Reconstruction
Interior Design)

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,530
What is this?

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,140
This is crazy.

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,380
How can the designs be
exactly the same?

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,220
This is plagiarism.

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,650
Designer Kang Jae In
copied my design!

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,060
I heard you were doing
an interim check for the contest,

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,230
so I thought I'd drop by.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,300
What's going on?

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,570
These designs look almost identical.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,210
Can anyone explain what's going on?

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,150
Designer Kang Jae In
stole my design.

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,290
She didn't steal the design.

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,990
I know it because I watched
her work from the start.

22
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,090
It's been that design all along.
How can you say it's been copied?

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,700
Designer Kang Jae In
should be the one to explain.

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,700
Tell us.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,540
I believe it's Ms Kang Se Ri
who copied my design.

26
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,270
That's complete nonsense!

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,570
Why would I do that?

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,210
Director Kim Do Yun is right.

29
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,810
On what grounds are you accusing
Ms. Kang Se Ri of plagiarism?

30
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,150
Otherwise, no one is going
to believe what you're saying.

31
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,150
I saw Kang Se Ri
working on it myself,

32
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,850
right at home.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,820
I'm the witness.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,420
Did you really see it?

35
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,230
I did. With my own eyes.

36
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,400
There's something I want you to do
to re-establish the trust...

37
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,270
you almost tore apart.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,900
Designer Kang Jae In is working
on the redevelopment design.

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,640
Hand that design over to me.

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,580
Can you do it?

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,950
I'll give it a shot.

42
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,080
I got your email.

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,750
Thank you for your help,
Director Do.

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,460
Are you working?

45
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,430
This is the design
Kang Jae In is working on.

46
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,360
Make it yours completely.

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,470
I told you I could beat Kang Jae In.

48
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,270
Don't you trust me?

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,670
It's not about trust.

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,510
There's no point wasting energy
on something like this.

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,340
Kang Jae In was
the youngest design team leader.

52
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,850
She even won a design competition.
She's proven herself.

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,650
Let's be real about it.

54
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,550
What matters is that we've already seen
through her next move.

55
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,220
You'd be a fool to go straight
at her without using this.

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,620
I'm not forcing you.

57
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,060
The choice is yours.

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,100
Now, let's all calm down.

59
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,940
Ms. Kang Se Ri sent her design...

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,770
yesterday, and I checked it.

61
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,710
I got Designer Kang Jae In's
design just now.

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,780
Like I just said,

63
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,410
how could Ms. Kang Se Ri send me...

64
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,550
the design
before Designer Kang Jae In did...

65
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,320
when it wasn't even hers?

66
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,750
I just remembered.

67
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,890
Recently, Designer Kang Jae In...

68
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,890
went through my desk
while I was out,

69
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,430
saying she needed
to grab a shared file.

70
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,530
I had my design book
in my desk drawer.

71
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,660
I'm pretty sure
she saw it then.

72
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,370
I came to get the redevelopment request
for Saseon-dong.

73
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:52,070
It should be on Ms. Kang's desk.
I have to go out for a meeting.

74
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,610
(Export Contract)

75

(Team Leader Kang Se Ri)

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,650
There's a witness.

77
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,520
Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo
saw it that day.

78
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,390
I'm not sure
if she looked at the design,

79
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,200
but I did see her open the drawer.

80
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,430
Are you still going to
deny it to the end?

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,900
All right, all right.
Let's all calm down.

82
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,210
This is just an interim check, okay?

83
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,740
Which one of these
belongs to Designer Kang Jae In?

84
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,980
This one?

85
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,250
Stop with the plagiarism nonsense.
Do it right.

86
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,190
You're entering this contest...

87
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,960
as the Head of Investment
and Development at DH Holdings.

88
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,500
Make sure you're judged
fair and square on your skills.

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,900
I will let this one slide.

90
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,600
We still have to compete.

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,940
I will make sure of that.

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,440
No need for any more
interim checks I guess.

93
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,910
That's it for today's meeting.

94
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,480
Keep up the good work.

95
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,560
I handed over the design materials,

96
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,100
so they'll never suspect you.

97
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,040
It's a throwaway design anyway,

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,240
so don't worry about it.

99
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,040
Bye, then.

100
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,540
You gave them the design on purpose?

101
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,980
I did.

102
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,120
Hwang Gi Chan asked Mr. Do
to steal my design.

103
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,050
You gave them the design on purpose?

104
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,750
That's right.

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,860
That's a relief,
but won't it be tough...

106
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,860
to finish a new design on time?

107
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,100
I started brainstorming right
after I heard from Director Do.

108
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,970
No matter what Hwang Gi Chan
and Kang Se Ri try,

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,230
they can't copy
what's inside my head.

110
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,540
It's going to be fun
on the day of the competition.

111
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,750
I came by to see my son's face,
but he's not in his office.

112
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,620
I thought I'd ask my daughter-in-law
for a credit card to shop,

113
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,050
and she's not in her office either.

114
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,260
What's with all these
back-to-back meetings?

115
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,890
It's like they never end!

116
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,300
There's not a single thing to eat.
Absolutely nothing.

117
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,230
This place and I just don't vibe.

118
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,270
We're like oil and water.

119
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,700
- Goodness!
- My gosh!

120
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,240
My goodness gracious.

121
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,310
Falling for the same person twice...

122
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,650
must be fate, right?

123
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,850
Was it "des..."

124
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,190
Dest… destick?

125
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,890
Death. It's death.

126
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,490
You could die in an instant.

127
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,290
You keep bumping into things
and falling over.

128
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,560
That's an accident
waiting to happen.

129
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,630
Right.

130
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,570
I've got urgent business.
I'll get going now.

131
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,670
Wait.

132
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,440
Clothes really do make the man.

133
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,280
He looks even more amazing.

134
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,380
A man is all about
the face and body.

135
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,320
That's everything.

136
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,090
But why did he show up here?

137
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,760
By the way,
is Gi Chan's meeting over or what?

138
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,830
Should I go to the office?

139
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,440
(DH Holdings)

140
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,210
What?

141
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,780
Look who it is!

142
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,880
You flirted with Kim Do Yun
to sneak your way back in.

143
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,980
How dare you show your face here?

144
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,520
If you have any shame,
get out of the chairman's company!

145
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,560
I didn't sneak in
by seducing anyone.

146
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,130
I was scouted fair and square
as a designer of DH Holdings.

147
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,090
If anyone should leave,
it's you, lady.

148
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,830
What did you just say?

149
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,030
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

150
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,600
You touching me
makes my skin crawl.

151
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,170
What did you just say?

152
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,170
I'm disgusting? Me?

153
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,080
Hey!

154
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,810
You little witch, get over here!

155
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,190
Oh Seong, why are you sitting there?

156
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,050
Oh.

157
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,590
Watch your mouth.

158
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,090
He's the CEO of DH Holdings
who is investing in YL Group.

159
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,900
The CEO?

160
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,130
If he's the CEO
of an investment firm,

161
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,670
that means they're the ones
putting money into...

162
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,870
Gi Chan's company, YL Group.

163
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,880
Meaning they've got more money
than his company...

164
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,780
That's why he's investing?

165
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,980
What brings you here?
Is there a problem?

166
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,520
He's young. Great.
He's hot. Super great.

167
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,320
He's rich too?
It doesn't get any better than that!

168
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,930
How did I get so lucky?

169
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,600
If you're here to fight,
just do it already. I'm busy.

170
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,770
I'd better get out of here
before that fox starts...

171
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,800
running her mouth to Oh Seong.

172
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,510
The building is so big,

173
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,340
I got lost on the way.

174
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,040
Well, then.

175
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,320
I'll be seeing you.

176
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,720
Right.

177
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,190
Why are you looking at me like that?

178
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,230
She's just the lady
across the street. That's all.

179
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,400
I hope that's all she will ever be,

180
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,100
so don't ask.
You don't want to know.

181
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,010
Good afternoon.

182
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,480
Do I look good to you?

183
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,120
I am a complete mess
thanks to you-know-who.

184
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,950
I am sorry.

185
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,020
Look at him running away.

186
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,790
Where does she keep going,
always leaving her seat empty?

187
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,830
I only took this side gig
to mess with that clueless woman.

188
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,000
But this is boring.

189
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,870
Hello?

190
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,710
What do you want?
Why are you even calling me?

191
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,410
If you're hoping for
settlement money, forget it.

192
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm not giving you a single cent.

193
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,150
What nonsense is this?

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,990
Settlement money?
What are you talking about?

195
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,860
You're not the only victim here.

196
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,790
I'm a victim too.

197
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,530
I am the one who's been
sacrificed for YL Group.

198
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,870
I was forced to break up
with the man I loved because of Dad,

199
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,600
and I had to marry someone
I didn't even want.

200
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,840
And even now,
I can't even call myself a mother...

201
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,240
to my own child.

202
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,480
I could only stand by and watch,
and I felt cursed.

203
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,850
Don't blame my brother, either.

204
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,050
If you had given birth to a son,
none of this would've happened.

205
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,750
Worried that the family line
would be discontinued,

206
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,820
Dad forced him to divorce you,

207
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,460
so he took in
Seung Woo to protect you.

208
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,590
You shouldn't resent him.

209
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,900
You should thank him instead.
Do you understand?

210
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,960
Wait.

211
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,630
From now on, using my son
as leverage won't work on me.

212
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,100
I'm done...

213
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,800
living like a shadow.

214
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,740
Don't mess with my son.

215
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,610
That's my warning.

216
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,910
Hello? Mi Ran!

217
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,920
Her son?

218
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,820
Mi Ran had a son?

219
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,990
Who's her son?

220
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,160
Why can't I remember anything?

221
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,900
Why do you think
I asked to see you?

222
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,670
Isn't it obvious?

223
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,570
You're just scared
I'll go to the cops...

224
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,980
and report you for assault.

225
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,150
I almost reported you for assault,

226
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,710
but I held back
because you had done...

227
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,850
some good to my family.

228
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,850
Is that all you've got to say?

229
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,960
Talk to Yu Gyeong for me.

230
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,030
Tell her getting a divorce from me
isn't the answer.

231
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,800
You've seen us
since we first started dating.

232
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
After all the years
we've spent together,

233
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,200
how can we just become strangers?

234
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,070
Besides, I was
so good to you, wasn't I?

235
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,910
You're my little brother's wife,
and yet I treated you with respect.

236
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,540
You reap what you sow, right?

237
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,280
Help me out here, okay?

238
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,520
"You reap what you sow."

239
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,990
Let me ask you something.

240
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,260
What kind of revenge should I get
against the so-called uncle...

241
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,500
who kidnapped his own nephew?

242
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,630
What kind of an uncle
would kidnap his own...

243
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,310
Jae In.

244
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,480
Just shut it.
Don't you dare call my name.

245
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,370
I was the one who blamed others
for my misfortune.

246
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,610
The one
who made my life miserable...

247
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,010
was me.

248
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,820
You're all ready to go?

249
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,930
I was a bit annoyed
when you ignored my messages.

250
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,100
But you didn't forget
about our date today.

251
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,060
Let's go. I'm starving.

252
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,270
Hello?

253
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,010
Yu Gyeong, have you been drinking?

254
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,010
I will head there now.

255
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,020
What?

256
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,120
Did he just run away
because he's too shy to hold my hand?

257
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,220
How adorable!

258
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,700
Yu Gyeong.

259
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,770
You're here.

260
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,570
Sit.

261
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,280
Right. Okay.

262
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,120
Didn't you drink too much?

263
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,490
Aren't you eating anything?

264
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,890
You'll wreck your stomach.

265
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,160
Can we get some fruit here?
Hurry up, please.

266
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,070
Seung Woo.

267
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,440
You know,

268
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,170
I really wanted to be happy.

269
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,340
I tried so hard...

270
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,610
to find happiness.

271
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,580
I tried, and tried again.

272
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,690
I thought I'd eventually get happy.

273
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,990
Maybe I was asking for too much.

274
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,830
An ordinary daughter,

275
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,570
wife,

276
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,870
mother,

277
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,740
friend.

278
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,340
That's what everyone becomes.

279
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,380
I guess just being ordinary...

280
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,020
was too much to ask for.

281
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,550
Yu Gyeong...

282
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,820
I don't know
what I have done so wrong.

283
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,190
I just wanted to live a happy life.

284
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,170
No matter how hard I try,

285
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,470
it just never works.
What was I supposed to do?

286
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,880
It's too much for me.

287
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm exhausted.

288
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,340
Where did I put my phone?

289
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,100
(Genotyping Report)

290
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,630
(Kang Mi Ran and Kang Seung Woo are
99.99% related by blood.)

291
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,810
How could I have forgotten
such an important thing?

292
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,010
What's wrong with me these days?

293
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,820
Wait.

294
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,080
Is this the right way...

295
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,920
to the shop?

296
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,100
Why is Mi Ran's wallet here?

297
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,630
The co-op president?

298
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,770
You got the job?

299
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,740
Stop teasing me.

300
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,480
You're feigning ignorance
on purpose, right?

301
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,210
Ms. Mi Sook...

302
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,980
No, we're going casual now.

303
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,380
You made me the president, Mi Sook.

304
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,920
Mi Sook?

305
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,350
Who's Mi Sook?

306
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,090
Mi Sook.

307
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,720
It's your name.

308
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,210
Uncle Do Yun, Ms. Kang!

309
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,210
Yes?

310
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,150
What's prettier?

311
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,980
Right, tomorrow is
the pajama party, right?

312
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,980
Yes. We're going to dance
and have a fashion show too,

313
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,320
so I need to look the prettiest.

314
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,220
Bo Ram, you look
pretty in everything.

315
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,560
Uncle, no matter how pretty we are,

316
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,530
we always want to look even better.

317
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,130
Say what?

318
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,060
I say this one.

319
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,400
The color is going to
pop more in pictures.

320
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,640
I will pick this then.

321
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,670
You're going to look so pretty.

322
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,780
Do Yun, can I talk to you?

323
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,280
Sure.

324
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,290
Bo Ram, why don't you go try it on?

325
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,790
You'd better practice your walk
for the fashion show.

326
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,160
Okay.

327
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,760
- Do you want to go put it on?
- Yes.

328
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,260
Is there something on your mind?

329
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,300
I heard you were seeing someone.

330
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,400
No, I am not seeing anyone.

331
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,140
Why are you asking that?

332
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,840
You're my son,
so naturally, I got curious.

333
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,510
The other day, Oh Seong said...

334
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,940
you might have broken up
with your girlfriend.

335
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,610
No one in their right mind
would break up with my son.

336
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,410
It's been bothering me.

337
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,380
You really don't have a girlfriend?

338
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,720
Uncle Oh Seong is mistaken.

339
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,990
I don't have one.

340
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,120
You deserve to find
someone really good.

341
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,730
I hear people go to dating agencies
to meet people and to get married.

342
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,430
I don't want to go that far
to meet someone.

343
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,370
I prefer things to happen
organically.

344
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,740
Right. You have to find a good girl.

345
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,740
Hey, I want you to date
someone who has never been married.

346
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,070
What?

347
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,480
Someone who is single
and has never been married. A miss.

348
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,490
Hello.

349
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,260
Hey. What happened?

350
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,390
Hold on.

351
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,970
She's had quite a lot to drink.

352
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,300
I wasn't comfortable
just putting her in a taxi.

353
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,370
Right. Thank you.

354
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,840
Thanks for bringing her.

355
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,040
No worries.

356
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,220
She could really use
some extra support right now.

357
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,220
She's really struggling.

358
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,090
Do you want to stay
for a cup of tea?

359
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,230
Isn't she here?

360
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,060
Ms. Choi?

361
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,030
She's gone to bed early.

362
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,400
I think I'd better get going.

363
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,570
It'd be awkward if she saw me.

364
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,640
I just hope you will think...

365
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,440
that she's going through
a tough time emotionally.

366
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,910
As someone who's been
around her for a long time,

367
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,720
I know that she loved you
just as much as she loved Jae In.

368
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,250
We've all been fooled.

369
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,320
She pretended to love me.

370
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,230
She said she never loved me.

371
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,830
Her words may be harsh,

372
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,670
but to her, you were like her own.

373
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,340
I know it's tough,
but I hope you will try to understand.

374
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,240
Jae In worries about you a ton.
You know that, right?

375
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,240
I'll get going.

376
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,380
Please don't see me off.

377
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,310
I can't be bothered,
so no hair treatment for me today.

378
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,740
How refreshing!

379
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,390
Look how silky my hair is!

380
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,220
Goodness.

381
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,460
Come and eat.

382
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,660
What did you do with your hair?

383
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,800
Look.

384
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,300
I only shampooed,
but look at all this volume!

385
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,640
You should try it too.

386
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,370
Hurry up and come eat.

387
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,210
Coming.

388
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,880
Where's Gi Man?

389
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,920
He was completely drunk last night.

390
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,660
As if she's the only girl
in the world!

391
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,490
Why is he so crazy about her?

392
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,390
Have you gone to see her?

393
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,900
I went to her place,
but she wasn't home.

394
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,370
She didn't answer my call.

395
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,030
What a piece of work.

396
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,540
She is dead set on
getting that divorce.

397
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,340
I should never have
let them get married.

398
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,540
Gosh, it's giving me a migraine.

399
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,380
By the way,

400
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,320
that guy at your company, you know,

401
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,090
the head of the investment firm?
What's he like?

402
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,450
It's a foreign investment firm,

403
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,760
and the CEO is known
for being really difficult.

404
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,460
He's known for not investing
in just any company.

405
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,960
Gi Chan won him over.

406
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,400
Isn't he amazing?

407
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,700
Sounds like an amazing company.

408
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,770
They must have tons of money.

409
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,500
Of course.

410
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,670
Companies are practically
begging for their investment.

411
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,670
It was my husband
who made it through to them.

412
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,180
Mother, isn't he amazing?

413
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,880
He's an amazing guy indeed.

414
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,180
Of all people, Kang Jae In
had to get involved...

415
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,680
and make this a headache.

416
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,950
How do you know about this, Mother?

417
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,290
What?

418
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,220
If he finds out that I've fallen
for the investment firm CEO,

419
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,790
he will definitely flip out.

420
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,560
I went to see the chairman,

421
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,330
and I ran into that wench,
Kang Jae In.

422
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,770
She said she got "scarfed"
or something like that...

423
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,270
by that company,
so I thought I'd ask you.

424
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,010
Mom, "scarf" is something
you wear around your neck.

425
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
It's "scout." Got it?

426
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,050
Oh, please.
You know a tiny bit more than I do.

427
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,350
Scout is what I meant.

428
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,290
You don't need to worry about that.

429
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,690
I will take care of it. Don't worry.

430
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,460
All right.

431
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,160
Eat up.
This'll help with your hangover.

432
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,200
I'm really sorry.
I went overboard drinking last night.

433
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,170
Do you remember?

434
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,440
Seung Woo brought you home.

435
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,380
I do. Faintly.

436
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,980
Is something wrong again?

437
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,250
Did Gi Man cause trouble again?

438
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,120
No, it's not that.

439
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,390
No, I was upset about bottling
everything up all this time.

440
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,060
I thought I'd just have one drink,
and it got out of hand.

441
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,900
Yu Gyeong,
do you still resent Jae In?

442
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,370
I'm too small-hearted to let it go.

443
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,470
I don't know when it started,

444
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,370
but I started resenting Jae In.

445
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,270
That's why I wanted to beat her.

446
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,480
You had better grades,

447
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,180
and you got into a better college.

448
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,610
You proved yourself
as a capable doctor.

449
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,490
When they realize Jae In is
the heiress of YL Group,

450
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,590
everyone starts acting differently.

451
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,130
I couldn't stand watching you
lower yourself in front of them.

452
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,360
I thought if I could beat Jae In,

453
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,800
you could finally hold
your head up high.

454
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,870
So I pushed myself like crazy,

455
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,100
working harder than ever
at everything.

456
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,510
Even when I came in first,
I could never catch up to Jae In.

457
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,010
I thought it would be different
if she became family.

458
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
But even after
she became part of the family,

459
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,450
everything remained the same.

460
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,220
I don't resent her now.

461
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,590
I guess I was too insecure
and desperate for approval.

462
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,030
When I saw how Jae In
dealt with him...

463
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,490
over Eun Ho's kidnapping,

464
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,830
I realized just how
misguided I'd been.

465
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,270
Yu Gyeong, you are uniquely you.

466
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,870
Don't compare yourself to others.

467
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,640
To me, you are the greatest
and the prettiest girl in the world.

468
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,750
At least to me, you are.

469
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,580
I don't resent Jae In anymore, Dad.

470
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,850
I won't resent myself either.

471
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,890
It must've been tough on you.

472
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,290
Thanks, Dad.

473
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,470
I keep forgetting things.

474
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,770
I have a hard time
remembering where I put things.

475
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,940
It looks like simple memory lapses,

476
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,440
but I feel like we should
do some tests just to be sure.

477
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,080
I will say three words.

478
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,880
When I ask later,
give me the words in the same order.

479
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,490
Airplane, pencil, and pine tree.

480
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,090
Airplane, pencil, and pine tree.

481
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,190
What year is it now?

482
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,660
This year?

483
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,660
It's 2024.

484
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,630
No, it's 2025.

485
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,840
What season is it now?

486
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,100
Winter.

487
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,240
No, it's spring.

488
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,040
I'm feeling a bit cold
because I dressed lightly.

489
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,080
What were the three words
I said to you earlier?

490
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,350
They were...

491
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,390
Airplane...

492
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,800
Hello?

493
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,370
What?

494
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,540
Hello?

495
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,910
Say it again.

496
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,950
Is Hwang Gi Man
Noh Sook Ja's eldest?

497
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,180
He is. But who are you?

498
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,180
Hwang Gi Man is with me.

499
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,150
If you want to save him,

500
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,760
prepare one million dollars in cash.

501
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,390
As if...

502
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,630
Who wouldn't know
this is a phishing scam?

503
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,630
Get it together, you punks.

504
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,030
You should work hard
to earn your money.

505
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,470
How dare you try to scam me?

506
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,540
Do you know who I am?
I am Noh Sook Ja.

507
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,410
How dare they try to scam me?

508
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,080
What?

509
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,980
They still haven't come
to their senses.

510
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,290
- Hello?
- Mother!

511
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,560
It's me, Gi Man!

512
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,790
Mom.

513
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,430
Mother, save your eldest.

514
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,800
These guys are...

515
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,440
going to kill me if you don't pay.

516
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,610
Save me, Mother!

517
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,250
Gi Man, where are you now?

518
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,780
Prepare one million dollars
in three hours.

519
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,690
I will call back.

520
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,620
Hello? Gi Man!

521
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,960
Hello?

522
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,430
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

523
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,730
Yes?

524
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,000
Mother, calm down
and speak slowly.

525
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,910
What do I do?

526
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,310
Oh, my son.

527
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,880
Finally, you're here.

528
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,950
I told you to hurry home.
What took you so long?

529
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,090
Did you get another call from them?

530
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,860
Are you sure it's Gi Man?

531
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:55,330
It was Gi Man. It was his voice.

532
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,200
Mom, they use AI voice cloning
to clone people's voices and faces.

533
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,400
I gave birth to him,
so I know my baby's voice.

534
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,070
It was Gi Man.

535
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,340
With a terrified voice,
he said, "Mother!"

536
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,040
It was Gi Man.

537
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,570
His phone is turned off.
What do I do?

538
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,450
Goodness, I got something.

539
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,980
Let me see.

540
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,050
Mother, save me!

541
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,520
Gi Chan!

542
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,130
Save me!

543
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,790
Mother!

544
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,900
Gi Chan!

545
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,240
(Queen's House)

546
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,910
Do you want to have dinner with me?

547
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,580
I have an appointment.

548
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,310
There's something
I need to tell you.

549
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,120
Is it about my biological mom?

550
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,290
Yes.

551
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,990
Wasn't the Eun Ho
hit-and-run case...

552
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,690
closed after the culprit died?

553
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,660
Hong Man Su was behind it,

554
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,430
using that offender
to do his bidding.

555
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,930
Who on earth gave that order?

556
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,500
I am Hwang Gi Man,
the elder brother of Hwang Gi Chan,

557
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,270
YL Group's chairman.

558
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,610
He may have been dipping
into the company's funds.

559
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,410
Are you out of your mind?

560
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,980
The Saseon-dong Reconstruction...
