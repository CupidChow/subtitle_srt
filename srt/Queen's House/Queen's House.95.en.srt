1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,640
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,340
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,040
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,850
You have terminal stomach cancer.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,990
What do you mean?

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,960
Terminal stomach cancer?

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,630
Doctor, you can't be serious.

8
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,440
If it's terminal, how am I walking?

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,550
Are you sure you ran
the tests correctly?

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,520
You could've mixed up my results
with someone else's.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,120
If you'd like,
we can run the tests again, but...

12
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,430
If you look here,

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,560
the cancer has already spread
widely to your abdominal lining.

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,470
Why me?

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,410
Does a little stomachache
automatically mean it's cancer?

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,280
I just decided to start living.

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,910
But what?

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,820
You're telling me it's cancer?

19
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,090
No, that can't be right.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,100
Are you even a real specialist?

21
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,800
Did you even diagnose me correctly?

22
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,100
The cancer has already spread
widely throughout your body,

23
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,500
so we've missed the window
for surgery or chemotherapy.

24
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,940
How much time do I have left?

25
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,150
Right now,
I'd say a year at the most.

26
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,120
But depending on the spread,
it could be six months or three.

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,050
I can't say for sure.

28
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,570
The person you called
is unreachable.

29
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,700
Connecting to voicemail...

30
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,380
Why are you waiting around again?
Don't you have work to do?

31
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,350
Did he really not say anything
about when he'd be back?

32
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,950
No, he didn't.

33
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,860
We'll call you if we hear anything.
Call us if you catch him.

34
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,860
I'll talk to you again.

35
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,330
Attorney Seo Jin Ho returned
to the country and was caught,

36
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,730
but then he got away.

37
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,770
He returned?

38
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,900
I guess he never thought
he'd get caught.

39
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,180
He probably didn't expect
the Interpol Red Notice.

40
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,950
He emigrated
with his family a while ago.

41
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,210
He probably got complacent
and decided to enter the country.

42
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,580
They say he ran off
without even grabbing his luggage,

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,960
so Wang Sik thinks he'll be caught
soon since he's a wanted man.

44
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,690
If Attorney Seo confesses
the fraud against Jae In's mom...

45
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,260
was Hwang Gi Chan's doing,

46
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,460
it'll boost the motion to dismiss
Chairman Hwang...

47
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,730
at the general meeting.

48
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,430
We have to catch him.

49
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,400
Once Wang Sik is on a case,
he never lets go for anyone.

50
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,740
So let's just wait and see.
I've got to run.

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,720
Hwang Gi Chan.
His removal motion is sure to pass,

52
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
so don't worry.

53
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,030
What's this?

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,930
I saw these,
and they were beautiful.

55
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,800
They reminded me of you,
so I bought them.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,110
I hope they make you happy
all day while you work.

57
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,140
Thank you.

58
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,320
What's going on with you two?

59
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,020
Are you two already at that stage?

60
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,020
Adults move way faster
than I thought these days.

61
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,560
Kang Seung Woo. Stop messing around.

62
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,060
I'm not messing around.

63
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,630
So, how was your date
with my sister?

64
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,300
Excellent! It was a lot of fun.

65
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,210
It wasn't just me having fun, right?

66
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,640
Yes, I had a good time, too.

67
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,960
Do you mean it?

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,130
Do I look like I'm kidding?

69
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,170
Let me try again,
seriously, this time.

70
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,640
Mi Ran, let's get married.

71
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,640
It's been such a long
and winding road...

72
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,740
to get to this point.

73
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,040
We were so young back then.

74
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,750
We're not getting any younger,
and we don't have forever.

75
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,450
Don't you think it's a waste
to let time slip away like this?

76
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,920
I know convincing your sister
is going to take time,

77
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,060
and we need to give her that time.

78
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,560
We're too old to let our families
dictate our lives,

79
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,900
but it can't hurt to show them how
sincere their future son-in-law is.

80
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,270
Just give me some time.

81
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,910
Sure.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,710
I'm not pressuring you.
Take all the time you need to think.

83
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,920
Here, drink this, and let's pretend
this didn't happen.

84
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,860
Okay, I will.

85
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,530
You're back at work and starting
to seem like a real grown-up.

86
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,200
I've always been a grown-up.

87
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,240
I say that because I'd skip work
for personal reasons all the time,

88
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,770
and I've learned that being an adult
means facing problems responsibly.

89
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,140
Not that I'm proud of it,
but you're not the only one.

90
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,250
That's all I'm trying to say.

91
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,480
Thanks for the very "adult" advice.

92
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,960
Thank you.

93
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,770
How is it?
Did I get the water right?

94
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,700
It's good.

95
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,840
I got hooked on this in Korea.

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,180
It was hard to get the water right,

97
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,210
but I guess I got the hang of it
since I drink it so often.

98
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,520
Should I know anything
about Jae In and you?

99
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,830
I figured I should double-check
to ensure fair play.

100
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:41,570
If she's seeing someone,
I don't want to overstep my bounds.

101
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,000
If she were to start seeing someone,

102
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,040
Jae In would be the one
to draw the line first...

103
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,610
to keep you from crossing any lines.

104
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,320
That answer just raises
more questions,

105
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,950
but I won't press the issue.

106
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,860
Gathering intel on a competitor
doesn't do me any good either.

107
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,610
It was you, wasn't it?

108
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,140
You told Gi Chan to turn himself in?

109
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,810
And you're the one who pressured him
to get a divorce.

110
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,820
Instead of coming after me,
wouldn't it be faster to ask him?

111
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,720
Why are you so desperate
to have what's mine?

112
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,390
You said you weren't interested!

113
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,130
You promised not to,
so why do you keep doing this?

114
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,630
How pathetic.

115
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,830
Do you really think what you have
is actually yours?

116
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,700
If not mine, then whose is it?

117
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,700
I'm warning you.

118
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,010
Both Hwang Gi Chan and YL Group
are mine.

119
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,280
So don't you dare touch them.

120
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,480
I will never get a divorce.
Ji Ho is my son.

121
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,980
I'll never let you take him from me.

122
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,220
Trash belongs in the trash can.

123
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,790
Why'd it take me so long to realize
such a simple concept?

124
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,030
I was a fool to fall for
your whole friendship act.

125
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,800
Did you even tell Gi Chan that
he's not Ji Ho's biological father?

126
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,010
What nonsense are you spouting?
He is Gi Chan's son!

127
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,380
Right, keep insisting.
That's so you, Kang Se Ri.

128
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,280
That'll make your fall from grace
all the more spectacular.

129
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,750
Why do you think I got you
out of that mental hospital?

130
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,490
I'll be sure to show you
what torment really is soon.

131
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,600
You think that's going to scare me?

132
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,730
You must have forgotten.

133
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,170
I was the one who sent you
to the abyss.

134
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,560
Why are you here again today?

135
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,930
I didn't come to see you, Princess.

136
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:22,730
I came to clean.

137
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,400
The dust is bad for you.
You'll get sick, Princess.

138
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,270
Come, sit here.

139
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,070
But I really did come to clean.

140
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,780
I'm not a bad person like my mom.

141
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,310
I won't do anything you don't like.

142
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,250
I just came to see you, Princess.
That's the truth.

143
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,020
Then how about this?
Let's meet when you're a grown-up.

144
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,760
Let's meet when you're an adult,
Hwang Gi Man.

145
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,000
Can I see you if I grow up,
Princess?

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,130
Can I see you every single day
whenever I miss you?

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,870
Yes, that's right.

148
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,370
Then I'll be a grown-up.
I want to be a grown-up.

149
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,240
A grown-up has to be patient,
even if they miss someone.

150
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,450
You can't skip hospital or therapy,
and you must work hard on treatment.

151
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,250
You also have to study hard again
and be a smarter brother to Ji Ho.

152
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,620
But I hate the hospital,
and I hate getting treatment.

153
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,530
I hate studying, too.

154
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,160
Growing up is doing things you hate
and knowing how to be patient.

155
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,330
Becoming a grown-up...

156
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,970
also means you can't always do
whatever you want.

157
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,540
If I don't grow up,
I can't see you, Princess?

158
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,480
Once you accomplish
what you must as a grown-up...

159
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,880
and start living your life again,

160
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,750
we can meet then.

161
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,750
Then...

162
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,860
Promise me.

163
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,490
Promise you'll meet me for sure
when I'm a grown-up.

164
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,830
I promise.

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,640
That crazy bastard.
Cutting ties with his family?

166
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,870
He's so obsessed with that woman,
he's completely blind to his family.

167
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,540
After everything I did to raise him?

168
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,650
That Kang Jae In is a total vixen.

169
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,520
This is so unfair.

170
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,750
It's so unfair.

171
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,060
You're early.

172
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,590
Come and sit down.

173
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,200
I've been wronged,
and I demand an apology.

174
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,840
How long are you going
to keep ignoring your mother?

175
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,810
Are you looking down on me
because I lost six million dollars?

176
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,540
I said, come here so we can talk!

177
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,940
Darn it.

178
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,910
Don't forget, I'm still your mother.
Got it?

179
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,120
I'm Noh Sook Ja.

180
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,120
Let's see who wins this fight.
Bring it on.

181
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,420
Why you...

182
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,310
You weren't at work
and didn't answer.

183
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,140
Where have you been all day?

184
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,180
What are you trying to do?

185
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,350
You don't care
if I expose everything you've done?

186
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,750
Do you really intend to go to jail?

187
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,930
Honey! Say something. Anything.

188
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,180
I don't think he's going to eat.
He won't even answer me.

189
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,540
My goodness.
Why does he get to act like this?

190
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,750
Mother, he's been acting
really strange lately.

191
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,150
He even asked me for a divorce.

192
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,320
That's music to my ears.
He's clearly so sick of you.

193
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,420
If I were you, I'd demand a divorce.

194
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,330
Don't you have any pride?

195
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,630
He's going to turn himself in.
Can you believe that?

196
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,660
He'll confess he killed Kim Do Hee.

197
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,330
Talk some sense into him, Mother.

198
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,540
He can't be in his right mind.

199
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,170
Don't tell me he's shooting himself
in the foot on purpose.

200
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,340
Since she's been using that
to blackmail him,

201
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,180
he's playing the "so sue me" card
to get rid of her.

202
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,850
That's my boy.

203
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
The nerve of her,
trying to blackmail him.

204
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,620
Mother,
are you even listening to me?

205
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,630
I'm home.

206
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,700
These kids are always protesting,
going on hunger strikes on a whim.

207
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,230
You think I can't do the same?

208
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,370
I'll starve myself until I'm nothing
but skin and bones,

209
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,810
and maybe they'll finally come
to their senses when I drop dead.

210
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,510
What "ungratefull" children.

211
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,410
Isn't it "ungrateful?"

212
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,210
Gosh, my mom is so dramatic.

213
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,730
Mom, you should eat.

214
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,530
Trust me,
I've tried starving myself,

215
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,230
and you're only hurting yourself.

216
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,130
Are you really on a hunger strike?

217
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,770
No way. Mom, are you crying?

218
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,540
My goodness.

219
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,410
Mom.
I thought you were going to starve?

220
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,750
At least I know how to bluff.

221
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,420
Even if I don't say anything,

222
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,290
after you get chubby
after gorging on puffed rice,

223
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,760
Gi Chan will know.

224
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
My goodness.

225
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,370
Come down and eat some food.

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,610
The mail sorter from earlier...

227
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,450
said this was for you, Jae In,
and left it here.

228
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,360
Who on earth would do this?

229
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,100
Jae In, are you okay?

230
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes.

231
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,280
It was you, wasn't it?

232
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,750
What are you on about now?

233
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,160
Who else would do a thing like this
but you?

234
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,960
Whose handiwork is this?

235
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,330
It's a masterpiece.

236
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,000
It's cute,
but the message is crystal clear.

237
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,670
"Kang Jae In,"

238
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,080
"I'm coming for you
and your family."

239
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,250
That's the gist of it, right?

240
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,350
Are you confessing
that you did this?

241
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,820
You think I'd waste my time
with a childish prank like this now?

242
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,890
When even blinding you isn't enough,

243
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,630
you think I'd settle for a picture?

244
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,130
Still, it's a relief.

245
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,330
If I alone wanted you dead,
it would be a lot to handle.

246
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,840
Looks like I'm not the only one
who wants you to disappear.

247
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,260
Hey, Gi Chan. Come on, let's play!

248
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Gi Man.

249
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,730
I'm in a lot of pain.

250
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,270
Where does it hurt?

251
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,540
You feel the same.

252
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,080
I'm not feeling well,
so please leave.

253
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,300
A present for me?

254
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,270
It's an apron.

255
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,310
I was buying
a new one for my house...

256
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,650
and thought I'd get one for you too.

257
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,790
Thank you.
They make pretty aprons these days.

258
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,290
I know, right?
Even aprons are a fashion statement.

259
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,460
The new designs are so pretty.

260
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,100
I'm not giving it to you
to make you do more chores.

261
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,170
I just hoped it would make them
a little more pleasant.

262
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,370
How do I look?

263
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,140
It brightens you up,
and it looks great.

264
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,910
Do I tie it in the back?

265
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,680
Let me help you.

266
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,450
Thanks.

267
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,990
There we go.

268
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,000
Thanks.

269
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,630
We're home!

270
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,900
You've got such a strong voice.

271
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,710
I told her I was feeling good today,

272
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,470
but if I step away even
for a second from her,

273
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,640
she'll scream her heart out for me.

274
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,110
I made sure Grandma Ja Young
wouldn't get lost,

275
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,850
so I held her hand tight
the whole way here.

276
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,990
Good girl.

277
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,120
Did you get us some yummy ice cream?

278
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,160
Yes, for you and Grandpa Min Jun,

279
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,030
I bought them the same kind
as Bo Ram's.

280
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,770
Goodness. That's so nice of you.

281
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,040
Thank you, Bo Ram.
I will enjoy this.

282
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,310
Okay.

283
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,850
- Registering your marriage?
- Yes.

284
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,650
First, I was curious about
how you'd feel.

285
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,950
Of course you should.
Congratulations, you two.

286
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,120
So when's the wedding?

287
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Where will you go
for your honeymoon?

288
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,560
Well, the thing is...

289
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,130
My older sister...

290
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
So she'd be your aunt.

291
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,700
You met her at my house for dinner.

292
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,710
She's my only sister
and is like a mother to me.

293
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,010
I was a complete mess
after we broke up.

294
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,450
It really left a scar on my sister.

295
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,790
There's a right way to end things,

296
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,520
and it was mostly my fault.

297
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,290
Listen, I don't care about
having a big wedding.

298
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,060
If we do have one,
I want Oh Seong's family's blessing.

299
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,840
We can always do it later,
so I'm okay with that.

300
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,070
Is she really that against it?

301
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,410
These are old feelings.

302
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,840
They're not going to go away easily.

303
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,780
She accepts you
since you're her nephew,

304
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,020
but she isn't ready
to open her heart to her yet.

305
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,920
And I understand
why she feels that way,

306
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,330
but finding each other again
after a long time has to be fate.

307
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,500
And this time,
there's one thing I know for sure.

308
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,900
I love Kang Mi Ran more deeply
than I ever did before.

309
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,180
I don't want to break up again
over my family's disapproval.

310
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,220
So, I felt I needed to prove
my feelings more definitively.

311
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,660
So I think we should register first.
What do you think?

312
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,800
What's there to even ask?
I'm a hundred percent behind you.

313
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,220
You've been sitting here all day
with all the lights off?

314
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,830
What happened?

315
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,470
You've been so out of it all day.
What's gotten into you?

316
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,270
Honey.

317
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,670
Why are you acting like this?

318
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
Is it because you're scared?

319
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,610
Scared that I'll actually give
the dashcam footage to the police?

320
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,480
You're Ji Ho's father.
Why would I make you a criminal?

321
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,380
I have no intention of doing that.

322
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,590
It's just that you keep
pushing me away,

323
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,290
and you asked for a divorce,
so I said it without thinking.

324
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,260
I was at my wits' end.

325
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,790
Honey,

326
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,560
this is so hard for me.

327
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,670
If you just call off the divorce,
we wouldn't have to fight like this.

328
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,410
- Fine, let's do that.
- What?

329
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,340
Let's forget about it.

330
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,110
Getting custody is pointless for me.

331
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,280
If I'm gone, it's better
if his birth mother raises him.

332
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,220
Do you really mean that?

333
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,060
Yes.

334
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,390
I'm going to withdraw
the divorce suit.

335
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,030
- Honey.
- Ji Ho.

336
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,800
Don't worry about me.
Just take good care of Ji Ho.

337
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,640
I'm calling off the divorce
for his sake.

338
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,840
Leave.

339
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,340
Okay. Get some rest.

340
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,660
We're here.

341
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,630
You really didn't have to.

342
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,430
I'm worried because of that package.

343
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,800
Don't go anywhere alone for now.

344
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,230
Let's commute to and
from work together.

345
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,000
I have plenty of defense items
you gave me. See?

346
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:38,040
- You don't have to worry.
- I can't do that.

347
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,380
I'm doing this for
my own peace of mind.

348
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,950
Okay. Thank you.

349
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,890
- Go on in.
- Get home safe.

350
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,020
Why isn't Gi Chan coming down?

351
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,190
I think Gi Chan's taking time off.
He's postponed all his meetings.

352
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,190
I'm the Chairman's secretary,
so why am I working if he's not?

353
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,260
- Anyway, I'm off.
- Okay.

354
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,830
I don't think Gi Chan is well.
He's just lying in the dark.

355
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,670
He'll snap at you if you bother him,
so just leave him alone.

356
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,880
Darn it.
She acts like I'm scared of my son.

357
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,950
Gosh.

358
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,190
You can't go! You promised.

359
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,150
What is he talking about?
What's gotten into him?

360
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,660
I said you can't!

361
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,230
You have to keep your promise
to the Princess.

362
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,500
What are you doing?

363
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,670
Being a grown-up means
doing things you don't want to do.

364
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,470
You have to bear it to be an adult.

365
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,410
I said, what are you doing?

366
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,180
I am becoming an adult.

367
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,380
Gi Man.
Should we wish to see the Princess?

368
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,080
How do you make a wish?

369
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,590
Grandma. How do you make a wish?

370
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,030
You can wish on purified water
or on a shooting star.

371
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,630
There are lots of ways to do it.

372
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,630
What else?
What other ways are there?

373
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,400
There's that thing with cranes,
paper cranes or something.

374
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,300
I heard if you fold 1,000 of them
and jar them, a wish comes true.

375
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,840
Let's do that one!
Ji Ho, let's fold them together!

376
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,540
Let's go!

377
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,950
You need money
to give generous alms,

378
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,590
make big offerings,
and make a ton of wishes.

379
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,890
Darn it.

380
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,990
Today's the board meeting, right?

381
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,600
As soon as we get a majority vote
in today's meeting,

382
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,730
I'm posting the notice for
the special shareholders' meeting.

383
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,900
We'll definitely get a majority,
don't you think?

384
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,740
Before, people were too afraid of
Hwang Gi Chan to even meet with us.

385
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,740
But this time, once I made my move,

386
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,350
some even asked to meet me first.

387
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,750
By the way, I heard Hwang Gi Chan
hasn't been coming in to work.

388
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,720
Do you know anything about that?

389
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,260
I'm not sure.

390
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,860
When I contacted the board members,
they didn't say anything specific.

391
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,800
He canceled today's meeting
with us as well.

392
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,670
He doesn't have another trick
up his sleeve, does he?

393
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,200
I tried to feel Hwang Na Ra out,

394
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
but she said he wasn't feeling well.

395
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,110
Whatever it is, let him try it.
Even if he has another trick,

396
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,210
he's in the palm of your hand
anyway, right, Jae In?

397
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,580
That's right.

398
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,750
I'll make sure he can't do anything
in the palm of my hand.

399
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,760
Dad, please feel better.
Dad, I love you.

400
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,610
Ji Ho?

401
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
Where is Ji Ho?

402
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,580
Ji Ho.

403
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,490
Ji Ho, why are you on a chair?
It's dangerous.

404
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm trying to get a book.

405
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,590
What book?

406
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,160
The other day,
Uncle put a book up there,

407
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,830
and he told me to give it to you
if he didn't come, but I forgot.

408
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,470
He said he'd get it himself
when he came over.

409
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,610
It's still just sitting up there.

410
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,910
I'll take it down for you.

411
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,620
(If something happens to me,
Se Ri is behind it.)

412
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,660
If something happens to me,
Se Ri is behind it.

413
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,540
(Paternity Test Result)

414
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,440
(Test Results)

415
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,820
(A: Hwang Gi Chan, B: Hwang Ji Ho)

416
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,620
(Are not biologically related)

417
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,330
(Queen's House)

418
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,670
To really set them up,

419
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,370
I need to get
them alone together one more time.

420
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Stop...

421
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,270
with the Cupid act.

422
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,980
It's because I like Jae In.

423
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,680
Darkness is the side of time
that makes us remember the light.

424
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,320
This looks like
Kim Do Hee's handwriting.

425
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,090
You didn't know
you were being fooled?

426
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,360
Kang Jae In.
Don't trust me too much.

427
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,230
I knew it.
You really are a piece of trash.

428
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,000
I'll be throwing you in the trash,
so just wait.

429
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,130
Bingo.

430
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
