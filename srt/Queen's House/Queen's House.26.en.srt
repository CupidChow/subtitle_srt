00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,870
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,550
Eun Ho, you must be hungry.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,320
(Episode 26)

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,650
- Eun Ho's gone.
- What?

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,990
I don't see him anywhere.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,660
Is he not in his room?

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,960
I looked all around the 1st and
2nd floors, but he wasn't around.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,530
What about the garden? What?

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,130
Goodness, this is bad.

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,030
Is he not around?

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,370
- No.
- No.

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,640
- Goodness.
- He's not outside, either.

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,070
Did you look inside the house again?

16
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,840
We did, but he wasn't around.

17
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,210
Maybe he went
to look for his mother.

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,010
What? But...

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,520
Eun Ho.

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,720
Eun Ho.

21
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,120
Eun Ho?

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,460
Wake up, Eun Ho.

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,730
Eun Ho, Mommy's here.

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,400
Eun Ho!

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,740
No, please.

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,210
No. Please help him.

27
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,740
Help!

28
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:25,620
(Funeral Hall)

29
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,460
How dare you
shamelessly show up here?

30
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,060
- Eun Ho...
- Shut your mouth!

31
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,730
Do not even speak of my son's name.

32
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,630
You don't deserve to do that.

33
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,870
I made myself clear and told you
not to see him without my permission!

34
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,210
Why did you call him out?

35
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,610
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,480
You're sorry?
Did you say you were sorry?

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,020
Do you think that's enough?

38
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,090
Eun Ho died because of you.

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,720
You're a murderer.

40
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,160
You're my son's murderer!

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,860
(Funeral Hall)

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,330
Eun Ho would also
never want to see you again,

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,130
so get lost.

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,690
Yu Gyeong,
did Eun Ho pass away in peace?

45
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,030
Mother must be quite heartbroken.

46
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,800
Please do comfort her.

47
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,770
I should've been there,
but Gi Chan wouldn't let me come.

48
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,610
Most people in his life
don't know that he remarried.

49
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,140
You're on your way back?

50
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,050
All right. Have a safe trip back.

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,350
Why did he sneak out?

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,220
How did he know about that place
and go there?

53
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,760
Did he overhear my phone call?

54
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,090
No one knows, right?

55
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,230
Well, if anyone did,
they would've caused a scene already.

56
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,050
Thank you for letting me in.

57
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,530
You said you were here
to take Eun Ho's stuff. Go ahead.

58
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,560
Do you know...

59
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,600
where Eun Ho is resting?

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,940
As you can see,
I wasn't there at the burial.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,010
I want to tell you where he is,

62
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,410
but I have no idea.

63
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,280
This is the end of everything.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,790
It's for the better.

65
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,860
This is a promise sticker.

66
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,090
I'll keep you safe, Mommy.

67
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,600
We're done!

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,740
This is for you.

69
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,470
It's a present from me.

70
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,910
- Eun Ho.
- Mommy!

71
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,080
You came back early.

72
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,780
You should've told me
if you were nearby.

73
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,150
Why didn't you show up?

74
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,290
Is that a ghost or a person?

75
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,560
Why is she here?

76
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,530
She wanted to take Eun Ho's things.

77
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,030
She's his mother.

78
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,200
His mother? My foot.

79
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,700
Who do you think you are
to take my grandson's things?

80
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,970
Burn everything
and let him pass away in peace.

81
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,480
No, these belonged to Eun Ho.

82
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm going to take these.

83
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,540
Don't touch them.

84
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,410
You evil brat.

85
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,480
He died because of you.

86
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,090
Bring him back!

87
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,490
You killed him. It was you!

88
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,220
You should've thrown yourself
and saved him if you were his mom.

89
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,130
You should've died
instead of my grandson!

90
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,600
Why didn't you do that?

91
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,070
Mother, you need to stop.

92
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,470
- Honey.
- Okay.

93
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
Mom, that's enough.

94
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,210
Goodness, this is injustice.

95
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,570
Eun Ho, my dear!

96
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,180
Goodness, what have I done wrong
in my past life...

97
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,080
to get involved with that family?

98
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,480
Goodness, Eun Ho.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,220
- Take her to her room.
- Okay.

100
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,320
- Mom.
- Let's go, Mother.

101
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,400
Give them back, Gi Chan.
Please let me take them.

102
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,340
Didn't you hear what she said?

103
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,870
We have to burn these
to let him pass away in peace.

104
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,140
It's for his sake.

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,210
And remember this.

106
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,610
Don't ever let me see you again.

107
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,080
I don't know what I'll do to you
the next time I see you.

108
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:27,050
Gi Man, get this woman
out of my home right now.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,990
What?

110
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,620
Right. Okay.

111
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,860
You should go.

112
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,430
This wouldn't have happened
if you dropped him off.

113
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,100
No, at the very least,
you should've done so.

114
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,640
How can you let him come alone?

115
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,840
How can you do this?

116
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,780
He snuck out to see you
without telling me. What could I do?

117
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,410
Is that my fault?

118
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,750
- You...
- I'm also a mom,

119
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,580
so I understood
how heartbroken you were...

120
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,180
and let you into this house.

121
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,620
So, why are you blaming me
when I didn't do anything?

122
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,160
You're the worst.

123
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,420
What are you doing, Gi Man?

124
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,430
Get her out right now.

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,200
You should go, Jae In. Come on.

126
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,470
Eun Ho, no...

127
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,320
Should I talk to my shaman?

128
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,760
I haven't had
a single day in peace lately.

129
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,430
What was that saying?
Life and death are fading? Fated?

130
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,900
I know people's lives
aren't in human hands,

131
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,200
but people keep dying.

132
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,770
Is there a problem
with the feng shui of this house?

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,170
What if I die, too?

134
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,550
Are you all right?

135
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,950
I don't even have
enough energy to speak.

136
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,950
Did you get that woman out of here?

137
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,220
Yes.

138
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,820
What about Eun Ho's things?

139
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,520
They're still here.

140
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,230
Burn everything.

141
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,990
That way,
Eun Ho will pass away in peace,

142
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,460
and it's better for the living, too.

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,430
Do you know what I mean?

144
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,070
Yes.

145
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,440
Did the police reach out?

146
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,240
Not yet.

147
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,840
As soon as I catch
my son's murderer,

148
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,250
I'll skin them alive,

149
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,320
drain their blood,
and make sure they don't live.

150
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,590
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

151
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,690
I'll make sure we catch the culprit.

152
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,120
I must.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,400
You need to sell this house.

154
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,800
Something isn't right
with the feng shui here.

155
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,140
People keep dying.

156
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
I'm scared to death
that I'll end up dead, too.

157
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,710
That won't happen.

158
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,880
Don't worry.

159
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,150
You didn't even do your job.
How can you ask me for money?

160
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,850
I told you to hit the woman,
not the kid.

161
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,520
Everyone is dying to catch you.

162
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,820
If you get caught
or whatever else happens,

163
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,120
everything is on you.

164
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,060
Ji Ho.

165
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,230
Mommy, what are you doing here?

166
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,370
I was talking to a friend.

167
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,600
Did you have a good day...

168
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,210
- at the kindergarten?
- Yes.

169
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,010
When will Eun Ho come back?

170
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,540
He won't come here anymore.

171
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,810
Why not?
Will Eun Ho live with his mommy?

172
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,750
He went to see her.

173
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,320
How do you know that?

174
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,390
I heard you
and his mom talking on the phone,

175
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,790
so I told him about it.

176
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,930
Ji Ho, you have to listen up.

177
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,300
Don't tell your daddy...

178
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,630
that I talked to Eun Ho's mom...

179
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
and that you told Eun Ho about it.

180
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,640
And you also can't tell...

181
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,510
your grandma, big auntie,
big uncle, and little auntie. Okay?

182
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,510
Why not?

183
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,350
Because if Daddy
or Grandma find out,

184
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,450
they won't let me live with you.

185
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,850
They'll kick me out of this house.

186
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,720
Can you live without me?

187
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,850
I want to live with you.
I don't want that.

188
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,390
I also can't live away from you.

189
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,060
So, you cannot tell anyone.

190
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,360
It's a secret
just between you and me.

191
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,730
Can you keep it a secret?

192
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,400
Yes.

193
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,140
Just get the CCTV footage
and track him down.

194
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,910
What's taking you so long?

195
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,310
Do you even want
to catch the culprit?

196
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,550
What will you do
once the culprit flees far away?

197
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,550
Do whatever it takes to find them.

198
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,420
Make sure you find them
and bring them to me!

199
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
Daddy!

200
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,200
Eun Ho.

201
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,340
Honey, it's Ji Ho.

202
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,150
Right.

203
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,750
I got confused for a moment.

204
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,420
Ji Ho, did you have fun
at the kindergarten?

205
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,330
Yes, Daddy.

206
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,530
I love you so much, Daddy.

207
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,030
Thanks, Ji Ho.

208
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,770
I love you so much, too.

209
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,580
Eun Ho died?

210
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,380
Yes.

211
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,890
How's Jae In?

212
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,600
I heard that she was deeply grieved.

213
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,660
Of course, she is.

214
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,830
He was everything to her.

215
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,110
Attorney Seo,
I need to get out right now.

216
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,310
I can't leave Jae In alone.

217
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,550
Do whatever it takes
to get me out of here.

218
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,890
Find a way to let me leave
as soon as possible.

219
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,120
Why won't you say anything?

220
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,230
Will you just keep
sitting around like this?

221
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,900
As you already know, the prosecutor
in charge of your case is...

222
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,800
Hwang Gi Chan's direct junior.

223
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,370
Honestly speaking,
I'm not so sure...

224
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,540
if you'll be able
to avoid imprisonment.

225
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,240
- Of course, I'll appeal...
- I don't want to hear this anymore.

226
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,540
Is this...

227
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,310
all my attorney can do?

228
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,180
Don't show me such incompetence.

229
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,520
I won't take no for an answer.

230
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,420
Find as many connections
as you can...

231
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,090
and do whatever it takes!

232
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,360
Well, there is one way.

233
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,500
You should meet with Hwang Gi Chan.

234
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,200
For now, that'll be
your fastest way out of here.

235
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,540
- Have some, Grandma.
- Okay.

236
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,920
Shouldn't we call her?

237
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,250
She's running too late.

238
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,820
I thought
today was her son's burial.

239
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,620
Grandma, what's a burial?

240
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,890
Bo Ram.

241
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,360
It's your bedtime.

242
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,200
You should finish up
and brush your teeth.

243
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,300
Okay.

244
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,800
I want to get some air.

245
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,940
- I'm back...
- Whoa!

246
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,780
Ms. Kang...

247
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,920
Eun Ho...

248
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,620
Eun Ho...

249
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,490
Eun Ho...

250
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,230
How is she?

251
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,360
She's a bit feverish,

252
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,100
but she'll recover after some rest.

253
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,800
Eun Ho...

254
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,700
Eun Ho.

255
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,170
She must be in deep sorrow.

256
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,470
People who haven't lost their child
wouldn't understand how she feels.

257
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,110
It aches, hurts, and feels sore...

258
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,380
as if someone seared my heart
with an iron.

259
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,880
People say time will heal
all wounds,

260
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,750
but not losing your child.

261
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,020
It's not the kind of wound
that'll heal until the day you die.

262
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,430
I'll get a wet towel.

263
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,340
Eun Ho!

264
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,270
Are you all right?

265
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,540
Yes.

266
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,680
I had a dream.

267
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,350
Eun Ho got into a car accident...

268
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,820
I'm so glad it was just a dream.

269
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,590
My goodness. I'm so out of it.

270
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,960
What time is it right now?

271
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,890
It's over ten o'clock.

272
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,160
I have to make some food
before I meet Eun Ho tomorrow.

273
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,560
Let me go out
and get some groceries.

274
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,670
The supermarket is
probably closed, right?

275
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,340
Am I too late? I hope not.

276
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,070
Don't you remember...

277
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,140
what happened to your son?

278
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,810
To my Eun Ho?

279
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,250
What about him?

280
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,850
No, it can't be true.

281
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,590
I didn't even meet him.
How can he...

282
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,020
Mommy!

283
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,790
Mommy!

284
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,100
No, it can't be true.

285
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,040
No!

286
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,870
No, it can't be!

287
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:18,980
No, right?

288
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,910
Ms. Jung, nothing happened
to Eun Ho, right?

289
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,090
Please say it isn't so.

290
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,560
No, right?

291
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,460
Please say
nothing happened to Eun Ho.

292
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,760
Please.

293
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,100
My Eun Ho...

294
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,200
Eun Ho!

295
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,440
No, Eun Ho!

296
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,340
My Eun Ho...

297
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,080
It didn't happen, right?

298
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,250
Eun Ho!

299
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,180
Eun Ho!

300
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,560
Eun Ho!

301
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,160
Eun Ho!

302
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,180
I didn't want Ji Ho to be shocked,
so I didn't tell him about Eun Ho.

303
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,810
I said he was staying with his mom,
so don't say anything else.

304
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,430
Gi Chan.

305
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,070
We're a married couple.

306
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,440
I wanted to comfort you.

307
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,810
You have to share your sorrow.

308
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,810
You should go to sleep.

309
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,810
Who's out here at this hour?

310
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,320
What are you doing?

311
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,950
I was grabbing a drink.

312
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,320
Are you trying to kill yourself?

313
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,590
You're drinking liquor
like it's water.

314
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,790
Give it back.

315
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,670
Those who are alive
must continue to live on.

316
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,230
You have work tomorrow.
Go upstairs and sleep.

317
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,840
Mom.

318
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,470
Eun Ho died.

319
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,640
My son, Eun Ho...

320
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,950
Eun Ho died.

321
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,980
I lost my husband,

322
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,420
and I lost my grandson, too.

323
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,250
Is that all you have to say?

324
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,220
Eun Ho died!

325
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,890
So what? Will you die after him?

326
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,200
Or will you give up on everything,
including work,

327
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,430
and just sit around,
waiting for your day to die?

328
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,500
Then, you can kill yourself now.

329
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,840
Get a grip on yourself.

330
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,240
Don't you remember
how you got to this place?

331
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,410
You gave it your all,
like your life depended on it.

332
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:43,250
So, will you throw that all out
just because your kid died?

333
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,580
And if you do,
will it bring Eun Ho back?

334
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,650
It'll only ruin your life.

335
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,090
Is that how you want to live?

336
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,030
My grandson died.

337
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,000
It's also hard on me as a human.

338
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,130
It hurts. I'm grieving too.

339
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:05,140
But I must go on. Is that a crime?

340
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,070
Anyway, when you betrayed
your faithful wife,

341
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,710
both you and I
already tossed away...

342
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,250
our conscience
and humanity in the trash.

343
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,610
I never betrayed Eun Ho.

344
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,720
You cheated on Jae In.

345
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,150
Shut your mouth and listen.

346
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,590
I'll light candles
or hold rituals...

347
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,490
to let Eun Ho pass away in peace.

348
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,160
You must focus on your future.

349
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,890
Do you understand?

350
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,070
I posted the personnel announcement
according to our reorganization.

351
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,540
Just as you wanted,
I dissolved the Strategy Planning Team...

352
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,080
and merged its duties
and personnel...

353
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,150
with the Planning and Design Team.

354
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,250
Kang Seung Woo has also been promoted
as an assistant manager,

355
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,820
so please train him well...

356
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,660
as the leader of his team
and turn him into YL's successor.

357
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,620
I will.

358
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,390
Let me remind you once again...

359
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,700
that Kang Seung Woo is
the owner of YL Group.

360
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,330
Of course.

361
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,100
No, you're wrong.

362
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,670
I am the owner of YL Group.

363
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,570
It is I, Hwang Gi Chan.

364
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,250
Hello.

365
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,280
My name is Hwang Na Ra,
and I recently started here...

366
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,750
as Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's secretary.
It's nice to meet you.

367
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,950
It's not so proper to pull strings
and hire people like this.

368
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,520
Please refrain from doing this
in the future...

369
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,090
to save our corporate image.

370
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,130
I apologize
for not telling you in advance.

371
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,330
I'll refrain from doing this.

372
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,500
Enjoy.

373
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,370
Ms. Hwang Na Ra.

374
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,870
You should ask the guest
before you serve them coffee.

375
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,040
It may seem trivial,
but it's a part of your job.

376
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,480
What? Right. Okay.

377
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,850
I must catch up on work
regarding the planning team,

378
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,350
so please excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

379
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,590
What was that?
She has such an awful temper.

380
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,030
Don't you think so?

381
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,600
I told you
to call me chairman at work.

382
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,300
I'll fire you right away
if you fail to do your job.

383
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,330
Make sure you learn
your job manual by heart.

384
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,180
Did you see
the personnel announcement?

385
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,680
Yes, it said Strategy Planning Team
would merge with our team.

386
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,150
You've become a team leader now,

387
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,420
so be prepared
for more responsibilities.

388
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,020
Of course. Don't worry.

389
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,220
I'll do my best.

390
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,690
He's your new colleague,
Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo.

391
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,660
I called him for the three of us
to talk in person.

392
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,670
Hello. My name is Kang Seung Woo.

393
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,240
I'll prepare a meet-up
with other team members soon.

394
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,470
We'll also reorganize the office
according to the restructuring.

395
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,240
There will be lots of changes.

396
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,440
Everyone, please do your best...

397
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,650
so that Planning and Design Team...

398
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,780
will become the heart of YL Group.

399
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,990
(YL Group Clinic, Doctor Kim Do Yun)

400
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,230
They didn't even let her
set foot in his funeral.

401
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,560
It must be very stressful
not to know where her son is buried.

402
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,870
She can't even swallow porridge.

403
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,000
I feel so bad for her.

404
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,110
It's me, Dr. Do Yu Gyeong.

405
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,080
Have you been well?

406
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,190
Everything's the same with me.

407
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,760
I heard
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's son...

408
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
died in a car accident.

409
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,090
Do you know where he's buried?

410
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,800
Well, he seemed like a young child,

411
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,340
so I thought of my sister's family
and felt kind of bad.

412
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
I got curious and thought I'd ask.

413
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,670
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

414
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,740
Choi Ja Young wants to see me?

415
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,720
All right.

416
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,890
Secretary Hwang!

417
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,120
May the deceased rest in peace.

418
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,960
I heard the tragic news
of your son's passing.

419
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,530
I came to share my consolation.

420
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
You must be deeply grieved.

421
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,440
We run into each other
every time I come to see the chairman.

422
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,940
How did you know my son died?

423
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,680
Intel is everything
in my field of work.

424
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,220
I have no intention of accepting
condolences from you, so leave.

425
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,290
Have you caught the culprit?

426
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,690
I'm an expert at finding people.

427
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,460
- Should I look into it?
- Hey.

428
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,060
The police will manage,
so stop talking nonsense and leave.

429
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,300
Didn't you hear him
telling you to leave?

430
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,970
All right.

431
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,770
Please call me whenever you need me.

432
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,050
What's wrong?
Do I have something on my face?

433
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,120
No, didn't you come
to say something to me?

434
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,660
Thank you for the promotion.

435
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,730
- Let's eat dinner out to celebrate.
- We'll eat at home.

436
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,790
We have Ji Ho, too.

437
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,600
Then, I'll shop for groceries
and make a nice meal tonight.

438
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,030
See you at dinner.

439
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,640
Have you lost your mind?

440
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,940
Why did you come here?

441
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,450
Do you want me to die?

442
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,310
I didn't receive much education,
but I was always good at math.

443
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,020
I was especially good
at adding and subtracting,

444
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,220
so I never lost anything
when I did business.

445
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,220
I'll give you the money.

446
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,320
I said I would!

447
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,540
Is something going on?

448
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,480
Oh, is something going on?

449
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,220
It's not me.

450
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,420
An acquaintance of mine
lost their young child.

451
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,190
Oh, no.

452
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,130
I'm sorry.

453
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,230
It must be heartbreaking.

454
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,300
Didn't you recently say
someone you knew passed away?

455
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,930
Yes.

456
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,370
This time, it was the grandson
of the person who passed away.

457
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,240
My goodness.

458
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,110
What's going on
with everyone these days?

459
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,410
Someone I know
also has lost their child,

460
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,280
and so have I.

461
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,250
You've lost your child?

462
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,550
She was such a kind daughter,
the apple of my eye.

463
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,190
She passed away last fall.

464
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,630
It must've been hard on you.

465
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,700
An employee I valued
in my previous workplace...

466
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,030
also has...

467
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,940
She was such a smart
and friendly person.

468
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,470
Did she pass away?

469
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,570
Yes.

470
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,080
I'm sorry. She must've been young.

471
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,150
I don't know who she is,
but she must be in a great place.

472
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,780
I'm sure she is.

473
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,290
And the same to your daughter.

474
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,860
Of course.

475
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,290
My daughter was a kind person,

476
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,060
so she must be doing good things
on the other side, too.

477
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:51,000
Dr. Kim, I'm so dizzy.

478
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,210
What? Where did he go?

479
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,280
Why is it so hard to run into him?

480
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,190
Why are we here?

481
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,920
Eun Ho was buried here.

482
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,460
Eun Ho?

483
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,800
My Eun Ho?

484
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,630
Yes.

485
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,800
Eun Ho.

486
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,040
Eun Ho.

487
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,410
Hwang Eun Ho.

488
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,680
Mommy's here.

489
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,950
Mommy's here, Eun Ho.

490
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,190
Mommy's here.

491
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,530
Mommy came, Eun Ho. I'm here.

492
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,570
Eun Ho!

493
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,200
Hwang Eun Ho!

494
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,770
My poor child.

495
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,140
No, Eun Ho!

496
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,910
Mommy's so sorry for coming late.

497
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,710
No, Eun Ho!

498
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,480
Eun Ho...

499
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,990
You're good at math, too.
It's exactly what you promised.

500
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,730
This is the end of our business,

501
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,660
so don't blackmail me
or find me over Eun Ho's matter.

502
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,030
You won't get anything
from messing with me.

503
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,070
You're quite a charming lady.

504
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,740
I'll always be a gentleman
as long as you pay me what you owe.

505
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,270
Call me anytime...

506
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,310
if you need another job done.

507
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,190
Did you two...

508
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,160
kill my son?

509
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,510
(Queen's House)

510
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,070
You always blame others
whenever something goes wrong.

511
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,210
Did you say Eun Ho died
because I sided with Chairman Hwang?

512
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,710
Jae In,
let's set the record straight.

513
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,380
You killed Eun Ho.

514
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,350
She should be in prison.
Why is she here?

515
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,720
She must've broken out.

516
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,360
Why are you people in my home?

517
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,090
Get out. Get out of here!

518
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,090
- Get your hands off my hair.
- You!

519
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,100
What? Really?

520
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,070
Did you really catch the culprit?
