1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,080
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,310
Is Jae In not back yet?

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,420
No.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,590
It's almost midnight.
Why don't you call her and check?

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,920
She had a lot to do
after her design was chosen,

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,190
so she had already told me
she'd be late.

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,930
Why aren't you asleep yet?

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,560
I wanted some water.

11
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,230
At this hour?

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,870
Hey, Dr. Kim.
Why are you calling this late?

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,390
Do Yun!

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,700
Is Jae In...

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,200
What about her mother?

16
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,910
My dad said she'd bring her.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,850
I rushed over before them.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,650
We need her portrait.
Do you have one?

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,750
Hello?

20
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,390
Wait a second.
Can you say that again?

21
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,370
All right.

22
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,370
Who just called?

23
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,540
Director Kang Mi Ran.

24
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,210
Jae In died.

25
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,050
Really?

26
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,580
Did you do this?

27
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,190
Baek Mun Su.

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,790
That name sounds familiar.

29
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,100
He was in charge of Do Hee's case.

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,130
Something smells fishy.

31
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,070
That detective was
involved in all these cases?

32
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,670
He might have a connection
with Hwang Gi Chan.

33
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,510
So, even if I take the evidence
to the police station,

34
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,480
I'm not sure if they'll conduct
a proper investigation.

35
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,780
I don't know
how deep the connection...

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,750
really goes.

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,850
Yes, right. Should I call Wang Sik?

38
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,060
My friend from the army has...

39
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,090
an older brother named Son Wang Sik,
and he's a detective.

40
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,360
I heard he was
recently appointed to Seoul,

41
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,030
so should we leave this with him?

42
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,530
I know we can trust him.

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,060
You just need to follow
my instructions and make a call.

44
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,330
Hello?

45
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,300
I'm calling
because Oh Seong told me about you.

46
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,170
I'm Detective Son Wang Sik.

47
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,340
I told you to take
the voice recorder, not kill her!

48
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,210
You didn't have to do that.

49
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,280
You should've asked me first.

50
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,220
I said it'd be a perfect crime.

51
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,750
And you meant that you'd kill her?

52
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,820
I did it for you.

53
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,120
How is this for me?

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,820
You did this for yourself.

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,460
I warned you...

56
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,160
not to make a move
on your own, didn't I?

57
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,930
Eun Ho died in the accident
because you tried to kill Jae In.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
How is that for my sake?

59
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,570
Are you mad at me
for Jae In's death?

60
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,240
Stop clouding the issue.

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,540
Don't you get what I mean?

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,910
I'm also heartbroken
about what happened to Eun Ho,

63
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,010
and I'm sorry.

64
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,640
But this time, it was different.

65
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,480
I did it all for you.

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,750
I felt bad
to see you seem so anxious,

67
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,550
so all I wanted to do was
give you peace.

68
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,050
I tapped their office,
but I couldn't figure out...

69
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,360
where she hid the voice recorder,

70
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,990
and if I hadn't stopped her,

71
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,690
you wouldn't be here today.

72
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,690
CEO Patrick
introduced her to a detective,

73
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,000
and she was on her way to see him.

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,030
If you don't believe me,
listen to the tapping.

75
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,770
Fine. Let's say everything is true.

76
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,640
Did you still have to kill
an innocent woman?

77
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,810
I do not want to share
the man I love.

78
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,780
Is that wrong?

79
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,080
Tell me the truth.

80
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,080
Did you do this alone?

81
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,290
Or is Mr. Hong involved
just like Eun Ho's incident?

82
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,060
No, this time,
I handled everything alone...

83
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,590
because I did it for you.

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,160
It'd be impossible to find out
that I used a homeless man...

85
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,260
to lure Jae In out there.

86
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,830
What about the CCTVs?

87
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,670
I made sure I only traveled
in the blind spots.

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,170
I couldn't do that
in the parking garage,

89
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,640
so I disguised myself
and made sure I was hidden.

90
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,150
Secretary Yoon, please delete
all videos recorded by the CCTV...

91
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,450
in the parking garage.

92
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,150
Say it was broken
or the system had a failure.

93
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,350
Use whatever excuse
you can think of!

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,960
This is the last time
I patch up your rash behavior.

95
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,130
If this becomes a problem later,
you'll take the blame alone.

96
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,530
That is,
if you really did this for me.

97
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,950
(May the deceased rest in peace.)

98
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,790
Whose funeral is it?
Why did I have to tag along?

99
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,630
We're here.

100
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,430
Ms. Choi.

101
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,170
Please brace yourself.

102
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,750
Jae In?

103
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,220
Why is Jae In...

104
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,910
Why is Jae In's picture up there?

105
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,980
Can't you hear me?

106
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,210
- Why is she...
- The car she was driving...

107
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,820
blew up in an accident.

108
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,190
She was engulfed in flames,

109
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,590
so they could only retrieve
some of her bones.

110
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,490
This is ridiculous.

111
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,090
No.

112
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,500
It couldn't have been her.

113
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,270
Yu Gyeong, call Jae In right now.

114
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,240
What are you waiting for? Call her!

115
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,640
Ms. Choi.

116
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,280
No.

117
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,920
No!

118
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,420
No!

119
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,290
- This is just ridiculous!
- Ms. Choi.

120
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,890
- No!
- Calm down, Ms. Choi.

121
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,590
Where's my daughter?

122
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,360
Jae In. Jae In!

123
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,270
Jae In!

124
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,910
It was you.

125
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,180
You killed her, right?

126
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,710
It was you!

127
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,280
Did you get your revenge on me
for killing your sister?

128
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,780
Then, you should've killed me.

129
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,350
Why did you kill Jae In?

130
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,260
She didn't do anything wrong!

131
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,170
Please bring her back.

132
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,700
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,110
I'm sorry for everything.

134
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,180
Please... Please bring her back.

135
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,950
Please save her.

136
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,220
- Please...
- Ms. Choi.

137
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,690
I'm sorry
for what I did to your sister.

138
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,190
Just kill me instead.

139
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,560
Please.

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,800
Please let my poor girl live.

141
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,970
Please.

142
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,940
I'll die instead,
so please save her.

143
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,180
Please bring Jae In back. Please.

144
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,540
- Calm down, Ms. Choi.
- Please!

145
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,650
Jae In. Jae In!

146
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,480
Jae In!

147
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,450
Jae In!

148
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,490
Ms. Choi!

149
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,290
Wake up, Ms. Choi.

150
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,660
Ms. Choi.

151
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,940
Jae...

152
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,980
Who died? Kang Jae In?

153
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,980
Eun Ho's mother, Jae In, died?

154
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,920
Her car blew up?

155
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,820
Then, it must've caught on fire...

156
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,420
So, the car was on fire, right?

157
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,420
Oh, no. How...

158
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,930
That's enough.
Don't say anything more.

159
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
What on earth is going on?

160
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,460
No, wait. I should get ready to go.

161
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,970
Where do you think you're going?

162
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,500
I have to go to Jae In's funeral.

163
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,040
Yu Gyeong must be there, too.

164
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,310
She must be deeply grieved
over losing her friend.

165
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,470
- If I comfort her...
- Good grief.

166
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,080
and look after her in these times,

167
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,580
her heart may melt,

168
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,950
and she may want
to work things out...

169
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,650
Hey, you're still saying that?

170
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,650
Are you still
not in your right mind?

171
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,850
The dead girl and her friend
both have nothing to do with us.

172
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,890
It'll be a waste of money
to go there.

173
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,830
We'll go alone.

174
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,560
She may be a stranger,
but we still have to go...

175
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,800
because of her relationship
with Director Kang.

176
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,340
May the deceased rest in peace.

177
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,540
Your sister must've passed away
to a good place.

178
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,370
Jae In,
I can't believe this is real.

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
I still have a tough time
believing this.

180
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,670
You can't pass away like this.

181
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,650
I still need you, Jae In.

182
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,880
I still owe you an apology.

183
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,820
I'm sorry, Jae In.

185
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,360
Jae In...

186
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,570
What in the world is going on?
I still can't believe this.

187
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,310
How could her car blow up?

188
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,440
Doesn't it sound crazy?

189
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,150
Jae In.

190
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,680
Let this finally be
the end to our toxic tie.

191
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,450
Farewell.

192
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,780
What do you think you're doing?

193
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,140
How dare you two come here?

194
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,080
How do you dare show up here?

195
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,420
You two will be cursed forever.

196
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,920
You have to stop, Ja Young.

197
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,750
We need to let
Jae In pass away in peace.

198
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,860
Move aside.

199
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,790
All of you are here,

200
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,400
the four of you
who killed my daughter.

201
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,970
You're nothing but evil.

202
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,370
The devils who killed my daughter!

203
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,610
Do you think
you'll get to live in peace?

204
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,580
No, not a chance.

205
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,650
I'll put the worst curses on you.

206
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,950
You need to stop!

207
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,020
He didn't do anything wrong!

208
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,820
And the same goes for you.

209
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,050
All of you...

210
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,960
will live in torturous pain
and even wish you were dead.

211
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,790
I'll pray every single day
until I spit out blood!

212
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,000
Just wait.

213
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,670
You practically killed her.

214
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,770
You were her family,
yet you betrayed her.

215
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,610
You're just like them.

216
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,350
Jae In adored you so much,

217
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,520
yet you sided with Gi Chan
and cornered her to her demise.

218
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,750
You called her your sister,

219
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,120
yet you watched her die
without doing a thing!

220
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,420
Bring her back.

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,490
Bring back my daughter!

222
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,330
Bring back my daughter!

223
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,760
Bring Jae In back!

224
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,900
Bring her back!

225
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,500
- Jae In...
- Goodness.

226
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,170
- Mom.
- Ja Young.

227
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,470
Seung Woo.

228
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,770
Mom.

229
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
- Mom!
- Hurry.

230
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,580
- Let's go.
- Mom!

231
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,600
Jae In recently said...

232
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,170
you were under a lot of stress
because of her.

233
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,770
She felt very sorry.

234
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,240
She said
she wanted to travel with you...

235
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,380
once she was finished
with what she was doing.

236
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,250
She loved you a lot.

237
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,650
You know that, right?

238
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,960
I hope you let her go in peace...

239
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,890
and help her rest.

240
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,360
Let's go meet her...

241
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,060
after you calm down a little.

242
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,400
Get some rest.

243
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,560
Did you go to her funeral?

244
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,970
What about Do Yun?

245
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,800
Well...

246
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,070
I think he should stay there.

247
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,440
This time,
you should try to understand.

248
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,050
I just feel really bad.

249
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,390
I thought I'd get mad at her mother
as soon as I ran into her,

250
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,790
but she looked awful.

251
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,690
Of course.
She lost her precious daughter.

252
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,200
I felt the same way.

253
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,200
Do Hee was precious to me, too.

254
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,470
I know that.

255
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,400
That's why
I can empathize with her.

256
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,640
I began to think
you must've been like that woman...

257
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,910
when you lost Do Hee, so...

258
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,750
Oh Seong.

259
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,750
What goes around
really comes around.

260
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,620
She committed a sin...

261
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,090
for her daughter's sake
and considered my girl's life petty.

262
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,320
But look.

263
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,090
All of her sins
went back to her daughter.

264
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,730
This is why people should live
without sinning.

265
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,440
Isn't that so?

266
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,910
Keep it a secret from Bo Ram.

267
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,780
- Yun Hee.
- That's enough.

268
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,250
You must be tired.
Take a shower and get some rest.

269
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,550
I'm going to sleep, too.

270
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,440
All done.

271
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,970
What do you think, Bo Ram?

272
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,040
It's so pretty.

273
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,780
It looks pretty to me, too.

274
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,210
Ms. Kang, will you make
my hair look pretty every single day?

275
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,780
Of course,
I'll make it look pretty every day.

276
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,390
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

277
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,860
All right!

278
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,660
How can you look at us
and dare to show a smile?

279
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,460
How dare you act like
nothing had happened...

280
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,930
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,540
I'm so sorry.

282
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,800
It's a reconciliation present.

283
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,040
I'm so glad I married you.

284
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,340
Thank you for the present.

285
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,440
- You can have a bite.
- I can?

286
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,450
My gosh.

287
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,910
It's so delicious.

288
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,390
You killed him. It was you!

289
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,190
You should've thrown yourself
and saved him if you were his mom.

290
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,270
You should've died
instead of my grandson!

291
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,470
Give them back, Gi Chan.
Please let me take them.

292
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,610
Have you gone crazy?

293
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,580
Yes, I've gone crazy.

294
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,180
How can anyone not go crazy?

295
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,450
Yes, I'm crazy!

296
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,890
I still remember what you said
right next to my ear.

297
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,860
I thought about it every single day
and some more.

298
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,460
A mistake?

299
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,230
Marrying you was my mistake?

300
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,800
That was the first mistake?

301
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,100
Then, what was the second one?

302
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,770
What's the third mistake?

303
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,800
Gi Chan.

304
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,110
You're the filthiest of them all.

305
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,910
I will rip you into pieces
and take your life.

306
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,750
Don't even dream
of a peaceful death.

307
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,980
You don't deserve to die like that.

308
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,750
I won't let it happen.

309
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,220
I only had one dream.

310
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,590
You and Eun Ho,

311
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,660
you two were everything to me.

312
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,770
My only dream was
for us to have a happy life.

313
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,340
That was the only thing I wanted.

314
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,810
But you destroyed that brutally.

315
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,450
You...

316
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,950
do not get to claim
that you loved Eun Ho.

317
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,770
Why are you
acting sentimental all alone?

318
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,340
You aren't mourning
your ex-wife's death, are you?

319
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,510
You're way too soft-hearted.

320
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,310
Your son isn't here anymore,
so she's just a stranger.

321
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,320
You should feel lighthearted
that your eyesore is now gone.

322
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,120
She harassed you so much.

323
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,190
That's enough.

324
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,520
She's not here anymore.

325
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,690
That's what I'm saying.

326
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,360
Everyone's fate is sealed,

327
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,900
and that was hers.

328
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,300
Mourning won't bring her back,

329
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,030
so empty your drink
and forget about it.

330
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,240
It always felt like I had
a heap of rocks up to my neck...

331
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,740
ever since Eun Ho passed away.

332
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,080
And now...

333
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,390
I hope Eun Ho and Jae In...

334
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,690
pass away to a good place.

335
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,200
It's weird for me to say it,

336
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,200
but she was a kind person.

337
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,340
It's not like you killed her.
Don't act like you're guilty.

338
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,510
Since I was young,
you always made sure I knew...

339
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,150
money was everything in life.

340
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,750
Of course.

341
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,580
Nothing in this world is
better than money.

342
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,690
Look around everywhere.
You won't find a thing.

343
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,660
You said I needed money...

344
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,890
to make sure no one looks down on me
or holds me in disdain.

345
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,630
You don't have to state the obvious.

346
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,430
See? Everyone reveres you
now that you have money.

347
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,470
Does anybody
nitpick over anything you do?

348
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
That's why money is best.

349
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,440
No one else may understand,

350
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,510
but you know.

351
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,440
You know why I had to have YL Group.

352
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,280
Of course, I do.

353
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,520
Those who haven't experienced poverty
can't understand...

354
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,620
how precious money is.

355
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,190
Gi Chan, you are...

356
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,660
the best among all my children.

357
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,130
You're the most distinguished.

358
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,030
But it's weird.

359
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,800
I keep feeling guilty...

360
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,570
and scared.

361
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,680
Drink the night away.

362
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,750
Empty the bottle,

363
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,620
erase everything from your head,
and forget it all.

364
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,360
Honey. Se Ri.

365
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,370
What kind of a dream did you have?

366
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,540
Honey, can you hold me in your arms?

367
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,680
Jae In, harass me all you want.

368
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,950
I'm still alive, but you're dead.

369
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,620
Come at me.

370
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,660
You'll never get to win.

371
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,480
Jae In.

372
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,680
Promise me we'll meet again.

373
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,690
Promise me.

374
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,110
You want to reinstate
Team Leader Kang Se Ri?

375
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,640
We do not have anyone
who can take up her job right now.

376
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,810
And now, Designer Kang...

377
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,850
can no longer take over
Team Leader Kang's job.

378
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,250
I'll find a competent replacement
as soon as possible.

379
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,090
It won't look good
to other employees...

380
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,990
to bring back someone
who had been dismissed.

381
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,960
Her resignation
hasn't been processed fully,

382
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,230
so there won't be a problem.

383
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,330
You had been planning
to bring her back anyway.

384
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,840
It wasn't intentional,

385
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,040
but it'd be better
to reinstate Team Leader Kang,

386
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,970
who had participated in the contest,
than to hire someone new.

387
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,410
The winner of the contest,

388
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,650
Designer Kang,
can no longer hold her office,

389
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,180
so it's like an unearned win.

390
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,950
I know DH Holdings will protest.

391
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,690
Can you handle them?

392
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,460
In my case, it's my wife,
Team Leader Kang Se Ri.

393
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,500
In your case,
it's Mr. Kang Seung Woo.

394
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,740
Both you and I have a weakness.

395
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,940
What do you mean?

396
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,410
We're strategic partners,

397
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:54,240
so I mean, there's no need
to blow up this matter.

398
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,980
The contest winner who wanted
Se Ri's dismissal is gone,

399
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,150
so DH Holdings wouldn't be able
to protest for long.

400
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,890
You seem to be set on this,

401
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,730
so there's no point
in discussing this anymore.

402
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,100
Good luck mediating the matter
with DH Holdings.

403
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,310
Are you okay?

404
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,010
I'm fine.

405
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,380
It must be anemia.

406
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,790
Doesn't this seem suspicious?

407
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,360
Yes, it's the American agency
that handles the matters...

408
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,960
for the Korean-style
apartment complex.

409
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,160
Take a look at this.
This is very suspicious.

410
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,670
The way the funds
go into this agency...

411
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,570
seems almost too smooth.

412
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,540
And it's odd
how this no-name company...

413
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,010
suddenly became an agency
for YL's contracts.

414
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,480
Let's ask our US headquarters...

415
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,680
to track this agency
as they trace H and K Company.

416
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,520
Okay. I'll let them know.

417
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,750
Okay.

418
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,490
I'm leaving, then.

419
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,520
What? Are you
going to come home late again?

420
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,060
Bye.

421
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,940
He hasn't been himself
since Jae In passed away.

422
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,240
Hello, everyone.

423
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,740
This is...

424
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,980
the chicken. No.

425
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:42,320
The kitchen. It's my kitchen.

426
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,320
This is where we cook.

427
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,730
As you can see,
there's a table here.

428
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,860
Is it the die room?

429
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,800
It's the dining room.

430
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,170
I sit here elegantly
every single morning...

431
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,980
and eat half an apple
with some peanut butter...

432
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,110
to start the day.

433
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,680
What are you doing here?

434
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,450
My gosh. My neck.

435
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,320
Your neck? Why?

436
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,890
I pulled my neck.

437
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,420
Goodness.
You should've been honest...

438
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,290
and said you always need
a huge portion of rice...

439
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,890
and stew for breakfast.

440
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,400
You felt guilty after lying
about half an apple...

441
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,230
and peanut butter,
so you pulled a muscle.

442
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,070
I'm trying my best
to make at least another penny,

443
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,870
sharing my home
with a bunch of strangers.

444
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,270
What have you been doing out there?

445
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,040
People would laugh at that.

446
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
You don't need
another penny in your wallet.

447
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,410
Even if you splurge
until the day you die,

448
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,880
you won't even use up
everything in your bank account.

449
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,120
You punk.

450
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,950
How can you
bring up my death that easily?

451
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,490
Stop going around
wasting gas in your car...

452
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,990
and be my cameraman.

453
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,990
Wasn't it enough
that I cooked pig's feet?

454
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,660
I have to be your cameraman, too?

455
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,330
Gosh.
You don't have to do it for free.

456
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,270
I'll give you pocket money
once I get monetized.

457
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,770
So, just do as I say.

458
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,440
I have to film my room. Follow me.

459
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,370
It'd be faster
for me to win the lottery...

460
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,710
instead of waiting for the day
you're monetized.

461
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,480
I'm sorry.

462
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,410
If I had known
you were Ms. Kim's mother,

463
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,520
I wouldn't have invited
Jae In's mother...

464
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,850
to work here.

465
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,520
I know.

466
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,260
You aren't the type
who would do that intentionally.

467
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,430
I was mad at first,

468
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,270
but I slowly found my reason
after some time.

469
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,300
Yet feelings don't work like that.

470
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,010
I understood your situation,
but I still resented you.

471
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,980
I'm so sorry.

472
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:53,750
It must be uneasy for you to see me,
so I should...

473
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,650
probably quit.

474
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,120
It wasn't your fault,
so it'd make me feel worse...

475
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,530
if you quit over this matter.

476
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,060
Don't do that.

477
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,160
Okay.

478
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,400
But if you feel uneasy in any way,

479
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,770
feel free to let me know anytime.

480
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,340
Okay. I'll do that.

481
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,580
I came to tell you that today.

482
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,540
Please excuse me.

483
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,380
Is something going on at home?

484
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,780
No.

485
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:31,420
Ms. Choi is
deeply mourning her loss.

486
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,320
She's always in bed.

487
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,560
No parent would be in their right mind
after losing their child.

488
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,870
All right, then. You should go.

489
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,610
(Queen's House)

490
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,410
Jae In!

491
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,480
I couldn't tell anyone
you were still alive.

492
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,220
I didn't know
what people would do...

493
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,120
if they found out
you were still here,

494
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,490
so I had to keep it a secret.

495
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,390
What do you think you're doing?

496
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,630
I was reinstated.

497
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,260
I'm in charge of that project
from now on.

498
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,000
Jae In must've passed away
to a good place.

499
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,870
I don't think
that's something for you to say.

500
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,700
- What is this?
- After I found this bug,

501
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,300
I began to think...

502
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,140
Ms. Kang Jae In's death
may not have been a simple vehicle defect.

503
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,410
Do you still not know anything?
