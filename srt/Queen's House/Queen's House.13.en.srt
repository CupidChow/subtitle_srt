(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

(Episode 13)

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,820
(Restricted Number)

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,820
Hello?

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,990
Hello.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,990
Did you receive
the photos I sent you last time?

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,660
Who's calling?

10
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,300
Isn't it your priority
to find out...

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,070
why your sister, Kim Do Hee, died,
more than my identity?

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,770
Don't you want to know...

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,770
the reason your sister died?

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,940
She found out
her son-in-law was cheating,

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,410
so she killed Ms. Kim
to prevent her daughter from the shock.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,080
She thought...

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,050
your sister was his other woman.

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,460
How am I going to believe you?

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,590
Your sister died,
and the culprit was caught.

20
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,800
Isn't that enough evidence?

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,470
I felt so bad
for Ms. Kim's unfortunate death,

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,830
so I only wanted to share the truth.

23
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,770
That woman, Choi Ja Young,
doesn't hesitate to use money and power...

24
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,670
to attack, blackmail,
and even murder someone.

25
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,610
She'll do anything.

26
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,710
She took another woman's life
like it meant nothing,

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,510
just to protect
her only daughter's happiness.

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,020
Your sister's life...

29
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,690
came to nothing
because of Kang Jae In.

30
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,490
Kang Jae In?

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,160
You saw her picture.

32
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,030
Kang Jae In is
Choi Ja Young's daughter.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,060
My sister died...

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,600
because of you.

35
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,940
You...

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,540
also need to die.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,770
Do Yun...

38
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,320
Hello. Did you just come to work?

39
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,390
Come again?

40
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,930
My husband is
getting discharged today.

41
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,430
I was on my way to see you.

42
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,300
Jae In.

43
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,440
Hey, Yu Gyeong.

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,770
How did this happen?

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,580
- Yu Gyeong.
- Yes?

46
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,780
Can we talk in private?

47
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,810
It's about a patient.

48
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,850
Congratulations on his discharge.

49
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,480
Goodbye.

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,190
Okay.

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,720
Bye. I'll call you later.

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,220
Okay.

53
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,770
Did you not tell her?

54
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,210
Her finding out
won't resolve anything,

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,780
and we'll never meet again,
so I didn't think I had to.

56
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,450
Don't say anything to her.

57
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,180
I won't.

58
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,830
I didn't run into Jae In.

59
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,830
Are you going home?

60
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,030
I told you not to come.

61
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,700
I was working outside,
so I quickly stopped by to see you.

62
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,640
You need to go before my wife comes.

63
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,110
If she's your wife,

64
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,610
what does that make me?

65
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,310
I'm your wife, too.

66
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,910
I also married you.

67
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,580
I know. I know that.

68
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,020
I'm sorry. I became sensitive,
thinking everything could fail.

69
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,930
Congratulations on your discharge.

70
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:26,540
(VIP Ward)

71
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,080
What is wrong with...

72
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,650
- Oh, Mother.
- What?

73
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,380
My stomach hurts!

74
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,320
- Oh, no!
- Mother, are you okay?

75
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,390
Does your stomach hurt?

76
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,190
I feel like I'm about to die.

77
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,960
- Goodness, no. I'm dying.
- Mother, hold on.

78
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,030
You should go inside.
I'll get the doctor for you.

79
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,690
No, can you get the doctor first?

80
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,700
- But you should go in first.
- Goodness.

81
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,300
Mom!

82
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,670
- What's wrong, Mom?
- Na Ra.

83
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,800
Can you help her get up?

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,240
- Goodness. Oh, please.
- Mother.

85
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,810
- My stomach hurts.
- Mother, get up.

86
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,980
- Be careful.
- What?

87
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,810
What's wrong, Mom?

88
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,850
I have no idea.
She suddenly flopped down in pain.

89
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,150
It feels like
my stomach got twisted and turned.

90
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,920
We need to go home.

91
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,520
You should get checked up first.
Please lie down here.

92
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,660
Wait, it doesn't hurt anymore.

93
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,700
That's so weird.

94
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,300
Let's get you discharged. Go.

95
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,630
Mother, you still need
to get examined.

96
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,900
- Please lie down.
- Goodness.

97
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,270
No, I'm fine.

98
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,800
I can tell when I'm unwell.

99
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,110
I'm fine now,
so you don't have to worry about me.

100
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,240
I'll end up feeling worse
if I stay here any longer.

101
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,310
Let's leave
before I end up collapsing. Go.

102
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,950
- Go.
- Wait, Mother.

103
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,550
Oh, my.

104
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,820
- Go.
- But...

105
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,960
My gosh!

106
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,600
Who are you?

107
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,230
I must've found the wrong room.

108
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,240
What was that?

109
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,350
Bring me a full glass of iced water.

110
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,420
Okay.

111
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,060
Has he lost his mind?

112
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,860
How can he cheat on his wife,

113
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,800
who's made of money?

114
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,000
Goodness. It felt like
I lost 20 years of my life.

115
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
What if he got caught?

116
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,480
It's probably because
she loved her son-in-law so much.

117
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,840
I understand that she got mad...

118
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,880
at her son-in-law's affair,

119
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,020
but still,
how could she kill someone?

120
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,150
Who's having an affair,

121
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,090
and who killed someone?

122
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm talking about Jae In's mom.

123
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,490
She thought Director Hwang had
another woman on the side.

124
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,030
Goodness, you didn't know?

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,860
Oh, my. This is my mistake.

126
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,970
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,900
Did that wicked girl
play the fool with me?

128
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,970
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

129
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,570
Here's your water.

130
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,680
Mom, you faked that, right?

131
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,980
No, you were craving attention.

132
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,850
- Craving what?
- Craving attention.

133
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,720
You put on a show
to get everyone's attention.

134
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,350
If I hadn't done that today, we...

135
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,360
I can't say anything
to a big mouth like you.

136
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,630
Yes, I know! I finally remembered.

137
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,700
I ran into Jae In's friend...

138
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,130
in Gi Chan's hospital room.

139
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,570
You know, the one
who came to our place last time.

140
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,600
Do you remember her?

141
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,000
I saw her when I went back
to get my phone from the room.

142
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,010
- I'll tell Jae In.
- Hey.

143
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,380
Don't call her. Do not tell her.

144
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,440
Why not?
I have to get on her good side...

145
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,050
to ask her
to set me up with someone.

146
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,750
Do you want everything
to go haywire?

147
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,980
Do not tell her
that you saw her friend. Okay?

148
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,060
I'm glad you were fully treated.

149
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
I apologize for causing concern.

150
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,600
You'll make me feel worse
if you say something...

151
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,570
I should be telling you.

152
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,170
I'm so sorry.

153
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,040
She shouldn't have done that
as someone in our family.

154
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,650
If you want to divorce Jae In...

155
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,650
after what happened this time,

156
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,650
I don't plan to stop you.

157
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,060
It's not like
I'm in the position to do that.

158
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,690
I don't want to divorce her.

159
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,230
That kind of idea
never occurred to me.

160
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,800
My feelings for Jae In
haven't changed.

161
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,440
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't surprised...

162
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,110
at what my mother-in-law did.

163
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,310
But on the other hand,
it was also heartbreaking.

164
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,580
She must've had
such little trust in me.

165
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,580
I want to apologize to you...

166
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,350
and Jae In.

167
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,190
Don't say that.

168
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,390
You've done more than enough.

169
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,790
My wife and I are the ones at fault.

170
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,200
Please let Ms. Noh know
that I apologized once again.

171
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,170
Yes, I'll do that.

172
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,740
I have something to say.

173
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,610
I haven't talked to Gi Chan,

174
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,040
but I thought we should move out.

175
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,210
Honey.

176
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,080
Gi Chan was brought here
to live with his in-laws.

177
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,290
I came and lived here
under my mother-in-law's consent,

178
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,290
but I always felt bad for her.

179
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,860
So, I want to move in
with my in-laws.

180
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,360
Is that the only reason?

181
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,030
I want to escape
from Mom's influence.

182
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,000
No one would've been hurt...

183
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,170
if I had done that before.

184
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,070
It's hard for me
to face Seung Woo lately.

185
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,240
It all feels like my fault,
so I feel really bad.

186
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,720
Also,

187
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,820
I want to meet
the victim's family...

188
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,720
and apologize.

189
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,960
I'll handle that.

190
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,460
It wouldn't look good
if you got involved in this.

191
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,600
I agree with you, Father.

192
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,260
It could end up backfiring.

193
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,730
But ethically speaking...

194
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,000
I understand how you feel,

195
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,370
but the more you show yourself,
the more people will blame you, too.

196
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,510
We may be able to handle it,

197
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,740
but what if it impacts Eun Ho?

198
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,810
Gi Chan has a point.

199
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,950
I'll apologize
and take responsibility for this.

200
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,550
I don't want to make
my daughter a sinner.

201
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,990
I'm mostly responsible...

202
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,290
for what happened to Ja Young.

203
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,330
I need to get some rest.

204
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,330
You two should go upstairs, too.

205
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,350
Mom...

206
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,220
- Seung Woo.
- Mom.

207
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,450
That's not your room.

208
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,620
It smells like Mom.

209
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,660
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,690
I'm sorry, Mom.

211
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,330
Get up, Seung Woo. Hey.

212
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,330
Go to your room and sleep.

213
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,570
Let him crash here.

214
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,970
I'll go to another room
and sleep there.

215
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,910
You can go.

216
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,980
All right. Goodnight.

217
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,700
If you want to move in, all I have
to say is, "Thank you very touch."

218
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,670
I'll clean up the rooms.

219
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,070
What's Gi Chan up to?

220
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,540
He's asleep?

221
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,480
No, you don't have to wake him up.

222
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,810
You should have a good night, too.

223
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,720
Mom, you mean,
"Thank you very much."

224
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,690
Touch is when you feel something.

225
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,320
Repeat after me. Much.

226
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,020
Just stop using English.

227
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,230
You'll only get humiliated
when you get it wrong.

228
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,730
Did Jae In say
she wanted to move in here?

229
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,060
Apparently so.

230
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,630
I kept turning her down,
but she insisted on moving in.

231
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,570
How annoying.

232
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,240
Good grief.
She says she'll come and serve me,

233
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,340
but I know I'll end up
reading her countenance.

234
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,510
For now, you two need
to move your things...

235
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,050
to the small room.

236
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,680
Our room?

237
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,180
That room is bigger.

238
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,980
They'll bring in lots of things,

239
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,490
so you need to let them have it.

240
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,950
Technically speaking,
your room is the biggest...

241
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,090
We'll move our stuff.

242
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,730
Mother, isn't the place too small
for seven people to live in?

243
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,370
Well, that's true.

244
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,170
So, what do you think...

245
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,970
about us moving out?

246
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,210
You want to move out?
Can you even afford it?

247
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,910
- My father's place...
- Who's the eldest son of my family?

248
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,980
It's your husband.

249
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,550
Then, of course,
he should live with my parents.

250
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,820
Did you want to use this
as a chance to run off?

251
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,520
We're a distinguished family,

252
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,190
so I don't want to hear
this nonsense.

253
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,960
All right. Please excuse me.
I want to get some rest.

254
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,730
Good grief. That unfriendly girl.

255
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,500
Why can't she play nice
and just say sorry?

256
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,700
She was concerned
because my father-in-law lives alone.

257
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,970
We're free to move out
after Gi Chan moves in, right?

258
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,640
Stop talking like a fool.

259
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,140
Who's going to do the chores?

260
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,210
Who'll cook and clean the place?

261
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,110
Jae In isn't going to do that,

262
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,550
and I can't make her.

263
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,120
Tell her you two can't move out
even if she asks you to.

264
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,850
My wife is a doctor.

265
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,920
She doesn't sit around at home.

266
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,520
You can find a housekeeper.

267
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,390
I'd love to do that, too.

268
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,260
So, give me money to find one.

269
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,860
Then, I'll get you
as many people as you want.

270
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,960
You can make Na Ra do it.

271
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,200
She's always sitting around at home,

272
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,630
living off us.

273
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,400
Gi Man, I'll marry
the great-grandson of a rich man...

274
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,040
and live just like Jae In...

275
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,210
by hiring helping hands.

276
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,610
I have to practice living that life,

277
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,050
so I'm not doing any chores. Never.

278
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,120
Na Ra, men have standards, too.

279
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,920
I have a feeling there is...

280
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,150
a 99.99 percent chance
you'll grow old without marrying.

281
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,490
- Stop cursing her.
- Hey!

282
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,690
Thank you.

283
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,770
Hello. Can you move this
to the other room?

284
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,840
- Can you put those in there?
- Sure.

285
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,350
Mommy, are we going to live
with Grandma now?

286
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,620
Yes, she decorated your room...

287
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,650
really nicely, too.

288
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,520
Thank you, Grandma.

289
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,090
Goodness, my little prince,
thank you for saying that.

290
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,730
I'm moved.

291
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,660
My prince, go with your mommy
and look at your room.

292
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,030
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go, Eun Ho.

293
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,100
Hey, there.

294
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,600
Are you excited?

295
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,280
What's wrong?

296
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,950
Do you have a secret to share?

297
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,550
Tell me the truth.

298
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,320
You're having an affair, aren't you?

299
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,520
Be straight with me.

300
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,290
I clearly saw you two kissing.

301
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,730
Just pretend like you never saw it.

302
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,270
What is wrong with you?
You'll be in so much trouble.

303
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,300
Just as Ms. Choi said,
if you were really having an...

304
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,440
Goodness.

305
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,600
You're crazy.

306
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,510
Have you lost your mind?

307
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,380
And of all people,

308
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,480
how can you have an affair
with your wife's friend?

309
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,910
And why would you have an affair?

310
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,910
Do you want to ruin yourself?

311
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,880
What if Jae In found out?

312
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,450
She'd divorce you right away.

313
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,350
I'll manage.

314
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,660
I just need you to stay quiet.

315
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,160
Hey, you said
YL Group was practically yours.

316
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,890
If you quit your job
as a prosecutor...

317
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,360
and bet everything on this,
you need to see it bear fruit.

318
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,570
It'll all come to nothing
if you divorce her.

319
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,540
You'll get kicked out
empty-handed...

320
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,640
without a penny of alimony.

321
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,910
How are you going to manage?

322
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,080
If Ms. Choi found out,

323
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,610
she'd get someone to kill you first.

324
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,880
Do you have more than one life?

325
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,880
Why would I die?

326
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,980
I'm not going to die
or get kicked out.

327
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,590
Don't worry.

328
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,720
You have to end this
before Jae In finds out.

329
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,890
If you can't end it with her,
I will.

330
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,830
- Mom.
- Yes.

331
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,430
I'm your mother.

332
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,700
And old adages say...

333
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,260
you should
always listen to your mother.

334
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,400
Men have ruined businesses
and even countries...

335
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,570
when infatuated with the wrong women.

336
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,340
You'll ruin your life.

337
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,540
You won't be able to find an escape
if that sly woman doesn't leave you.

338
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,510
I said I'd manage.

339
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,810
Don't do anything.

340
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,550
That's what you can do
both for me and you.

341
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,080
Daddy!

342
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,520
Wait.

343
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,320
Goodness. No.

344
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,430
He's completely mesmerized by her.

345
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,960
I can't let her
ruin my son's future.

346
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,810
You probably haven't done
anything like this before.

347
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,980
Can you really do this job?

348
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,380
You'll have to serve the food
and help out in the kitchen, too.

349
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,550
I haven't worked at a restaurant,

350
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,280
but I've cooked for myself
for quite a while.

351
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,920
I may be older in age,
but my spirit is still in my thirties.

352
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,660
I can always learn to do the job.

353
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,290
Is he the new owner?

354
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,430
Are you looking for something?

355
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,430
No, I'm not.

356
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,140
Why don't you start today?

357
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,570
Sorry? Did I get the job?

358
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,070
Yes.

359
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,680
I only need you
to clean up the place today.

360
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,980
We couldn't open for a while,

361
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,280
so we needed to clean the place.

362
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,150
I hope to have a great run with you.

363
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,720
I should be saying that.
It's great to meet you.

364
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,920
Me, too.

365
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,000
Hey, Yun Hee. I hired someone.

366
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,800
He's a bit older,
but he looks very diligent.

367
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Age is only a number now.

368
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,300
You'll be happy with him, too.

369
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,640
Anyway, I have to go out
and do something.

370
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,880
If you want to know that badly,
you can come and meet him.

371
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,210
Bye.

372
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,090
I hear Ms. Kim Do Hee's mother
operates a restaurant business.

373
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,590
This is the address, sir.

374
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,040
Hello.

375
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,010
Mr. Chairman.

376
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,520
Why are you working here?

377
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,450
Did you open a new business?

378
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,460
I see. That must be the case.

379
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,560
The owner must've changed.

380
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,560
What brings you here, sir?

381
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,130
I saw you through the window
as I was passing by.

382
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,370
Jae In told me about you.

383
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,710
I heard you two met at the hospital.

384
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,380
You probably resented me very much,

385
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,950
so thank you for your kind gesture.

386
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,480
Don't mention it, sir.

387
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,550
She's my daughter,
Yu Gyeong's friend.

388
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,120
I was worried about her
as her friend's dad.

389
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,520
That was all.

390
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,060
Life is just like the weather.

391
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,030
I liked how sunny
and bright it was to me,

392
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,270
but these days, it felt like
I was always standing in a storm.

393
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,100
You'll come through.

394
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,810
I wanted to call you
time and time again...

395
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,370
and ask you out
for a glass of drink.

396
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,640
Isn't it shameless of me?

397
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,150
Please call me anytime.

398
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,620
I can grab a drink as a friend.

399
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,650
Thank you.

400
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,090
I should go.

401
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,990
I'll come by again to hang out.

402
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,090
We can grab a drink then.

403
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,630
- Of course.
- Goodbye.

404
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,310
What do you have to say to me
in private?

405
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,350
No, I don't want to settle
or show her mercy.

406
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,990
I have
nothing more to hear from you.

407
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,090
Don't ever call me again.

408
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,720
I'll see you in court.

409
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,360
Good one.

410
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,530
You did a great job.

411
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,660
She's probably dying
to reduce her sentence.

412
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,070
How can she shamelessly want to settle
after killing someone?

413
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,670
- Jeez.
- A million dollars?

414
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,500
They may offer us ten million,
a hundred million,

415
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,010
or their entire fortune,
but you will never settle the case.

416
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,370
I won't. Don't worry about it.

417
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,020
My house is full of people,
thanks to the wonderful children...

418
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,550
I raised.

419
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,290
I feel so satisfied
without eating anything.

420
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,460
Jae In, thank you
for working hard on dinner.

421
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,730
Yu Gyeong did
much of the work, not me.

422
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,860
She did everything,

423
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,500
and I was just there to help.

424
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,330
You're such a kind-hearted person.

425
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,130
Thank you, Yu Gyeong.

426
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,570
Don't mention it.
It was much easier...

427
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,710
with Jae In's help.

428
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,780
I'm not done
cleaning up the kitchen.

429
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,110
Eun Ho, I need to get up.

430
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,880
Yu Gyeong, let's do it together.

431
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,920
Goodness, Jae In.
Why don't you sit with us?

432
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,120
It must've been a hard day
after you moved in.

433
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,060
Hey, you need to
at least pretend like you're helping.

434
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,660
I don't want to.

435
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,430
I'm going to work starting tomorrow,
so please excuse me.

436
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,830
I'll go to sleep first, Eun Ho.

437
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,470
Okay. Goodnight, Daddy.

438
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,630
Goodnight.

439
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,370
You're such a polite
and big boy now.

440
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,540
Hey, aren't you jealous?

441
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,880
Don't you also want a son like him?

442
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,620
I can't control that.

443
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,020
I'm sure you didn't want
an eldest son like me.

444
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,650
Don't be so smart.

445
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,170
Yu Gyeong.

446
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm sorry.
You had to switch rooms because of us.

447
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,210
You didn't have to do that.

448
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,640
You can relax when we're alone.

449
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,280
Mother wanted us to move the room,

450
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,450
but it didn't seem so bad
after we changed rooms.

451
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,650
It's all right,
so don't worry about it.

452
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,320
How's Seung Woo?

453
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,730
He's very troubled.

454
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,730
Can you reach out to him
and try to comfort him?

455
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,230
- Me?
- If you think about it,

456
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,200
he used to listen to you
more than me.

457
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,540
All right. I'll call him.

458
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,110
You should stay strong, too.

459
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,870
Thanks.

460
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,510
It's great to stay with you
under the same roof.

461
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,580
So, you couldn't settle the case?

462
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,320
I've been
contacting them continuously.

463
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,880
Please give me some more time.

464
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,350
How long do I have to wait?

465
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,790
Is this all you can do,
Attorney Seo?

466
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,360
You couldn't stop me
from getting detained...

467
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,430
and left me to stay in this pigsty.

468
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,900
You should've taken a measure
right away.

469
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,930
How long will you tell me to wait?

470
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,500
If you can't do it, just say so.

471
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,740
I'm sorry.

472
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,040
Don't you understand what I mean?

473
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,410
Do whatever it takes...

474
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,210
to get me out of here!

475
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,950
You better earn your keep.

476
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:48,530
Well, there is one way.

477
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,040
Did my prince go to kindergarten?

478
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,510
Yes.

479
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,580
Your son is gone now,

480
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,810
so what should we do today?

481
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,250
Why don't we go shopping
and eat something delicious, too?

482
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,480
What do you think?

483
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,920
I'm already excited
just to think about it.

484
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,290
Well, Mother.

485
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,960
I have something to say.

486
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,930
I want to go back to work
if you're okay with it.

487
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,960
Wait a second.

488
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,930
If his wife is at work with him,

489
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,870
he wouldn't be able
to have an affair.

490
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,640
I've been trying
to think of a way, anyway.

491
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
You should do that.

492
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,350
I'm not that uptight.

493
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,650
You should go back to work.

494
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,880
Really?

495
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,490
Thank you, Mother.

496
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,290
Gosh, you don't have to thank me.

497
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,190
Anyway, about your friend,
the one I saw at the hospital.

498
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,200
You mean Se Ri?

499
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,100
What does she do?

500
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,100
It seemed like
she worked for YL Group.

501
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,770
Is she a single woman
who lives alone?

502
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,870
She's married.

503
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,110
She's a married woman?

504
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,610
Yes.

505
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,420
Why did you ask about Se Ri?

506
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,820
You said she was your friend,
so I was curious.

507
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,720
If you're done talking,
let's go shopping.

508
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,990
Goodness.

509
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,430
Let me get some water, Mother.

510
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,000
Goodness.

511
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,810
Have some water.

512
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,730
Goodness, are you pregnant?

513
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,470
I brought herbal tea.
I thought you could use less caffeine.

514
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,630
Where's Aunt Mi Ran?

515
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
She's meeting someone outside,
so she'll be late.

516
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,210
You've become a coward.

517
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,910
You're walking on eggshells
around everyone.

518
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,340
How do you live like that?

519
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,510
I should lie low for a while
after my mother-in-law got arrested.

520
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,320
Be quiet.

521
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,450
Yes, Mom?

522
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,360
Is something going on?

523
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,630
She's pregnant?

524
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,730
Yes, we just went to see a doctor...

525
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,430
and confirmed her pregnancy.

526
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,940
How's Jae In?

527
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,310
All right. I'll be home early.

528
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,650
Jae In got pregnant?

529
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,050
Yes, she did.

530
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,020
You're so ridiculous.

531
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,790
You said you'd divorce her,

532
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,490
yet you spent the night with her?

533
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,430
We're a married couple.
I was trying to comfort her.

534
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,930
What now?

535
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,800
I told you that
I was already at my limit.

536
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,900
Divorce her now.

537
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,600
My goal is to take over YL Group
before I divorce her.

538
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,740
You wanted that, too.

539
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,010
Don't you trust me?

540
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,350
Hang in there
and wait just a little more.

541
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,620
Only I'll end up betrayed
if he never divorces her...

542
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,330
after I take his word
and wait around quietly.

543
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,730
I can't let that happen.

544
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,300
I'm Kang Jae In, too.

545
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,930
I'll have both YL Group...

546
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,070
and Gi Chan.

547
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,670
What should I do?

548
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,210
It's like a gamble, anyway.

549
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,280
If I can't have it,

550
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,650
you can't have it, either, Gi Chan.

551
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,290
Come in.

552
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,060
Dr. Do.

553
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,930
Your family was hospitalized
in the VIP ward, right?

554
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,860
That was found on the bed.

555
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,100
I'll give it back.

556
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,600
- Thank you.
- Sure.

557
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,180
- Baby!
- Hey, baby.

558
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,380
Goodness! That hurts!

559
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,410
- What? Pull that up!
- Goodness.

560
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,650
Why did you walk out?
You need to go and get some rest.

561
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,090
I need to make dinner.
Everyone will be home soon.

562
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,320
No, I'll manage.
You need to go back.

563
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,090
- Hey.
- I'm home.

564
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,130
I'm glad you're here.
You need to make dinner.

565
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,930
Jae In will be hungry.

566
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,530
No, Mother. I'm okay.

567
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,170
I'll help Yu Gyeong.

568
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,140
Goodness, you can't do that.
You're a pregnant woman.

569
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,370
You need to be extra careful.

570
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,780
Why are you standing around?
Start making dinner.

571
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,450
- I'm home.
- Hey, welcome back.

572
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,950
- You came home early.
- Yes.

573
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,980
Congratulations.

574
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,920
Thank you.

575
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,360
Take her to your room
and let her rest.

576
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,230
I'll call you when dinner is ready.

577
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,290
Okay.

578
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,660
- Let's go.
- Okay.

579
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,230
I'll be back soon, Yu Gyeong.

580
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,570
Why are you standing there?

581
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,170
I told you to make dinner.

582
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,180
If you think this is unfair,
you can get pregnant, too.

583
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,780
I'm worried you'll end up
cutting off this family lineage.

584
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,490
Good grief. That girl.

585
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,620
The least
she can say is she's sorry,

586
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,130
but she gets mad at me instead.

587
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,600
It feels like a dream.

588
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,170
Everything had been
really tough lately.

589
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,570
But when I heard Eun Ho was
about to have a younger sibling,

590
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,080
I found more energy.

591
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,110
It felt like
I got the courage to live on.

592
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,820
You've done well.

593
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,900
Jae In will be here for lunch.

594
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,740
We wanted to eat
with Father and you.

595
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,240
Is she doing well?

596
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,750
I was going to tell you over lunch.

597
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,580
Eun Ho will have
a younger sibling soon.

598
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,850
Really? Congratulations.

599
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,150
Thank you.

600
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,720
So, did you want
to say something to me?

601
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,630
I wanted to thank you.

602
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,170
Seung Woo would've been framed
if it hadn't been for you,

603
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,000
and that would've ruined his life.

604
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,070
Thanks.

605
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,640
If you need any help,
feel free to let me know.

606
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,940
Thank you for saying that.

607
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,110
Hey, Dad.

608
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,280
I was on my way to the office.

609
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,990
What? Mom did what?

610
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,030
Hey, it's Kang Jae In!

611
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,600
- Ms. Kang!
- Are you Ms. Kang?

612
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,530
Was your mother,
Director Choi Ja Young, detained...

613
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,630
for attempted murder
by hit-and-run accident?

614
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,800
Is it true that she forged
her medical document...

615
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,540
for stomach cancer
to be suspended...

616
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,870
from her detainment?

617
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,040
Is your father,
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol, aware of this?

618
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,970
Did Chairman Kang
exert his influence...

619
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,140
to suspend Ms. Choi's detainment?

620
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,050
- Did he abuse the justice system?
- Wait.

621
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,210
Please explain, Ms. Kang!

622
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,280
- Wait.
- Ms. Kang.

623
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,820
- Ms. Kang!
- Please explain the situation.

624
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,520
- Say something, Ms. Kang!
- What about the suspension...

625
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,990
Are the allegations true?

626
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,420
Please wait. Please.

627
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,770
- Ms. Kang!
- Whoa.

628
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,660
(Queen's House)

629
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,020
How can you shamelessly be there...

630
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,460
after taking someone's life? How?

631
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,830
You're a murderer.

632
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,430
Bring my daughter back.

633
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,170
I'd rather die than go to prison.

634
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,370
I'll do anything for you.

635
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
Do you understand?

636
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,240
You keep saying you'll do
anything for me, but I don't get it.

637
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,580
Don't end up hurting Jae In, too.

638
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,980
You're her mom.

639
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,950
Watch and see
how your dear daughter...

640
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,550
crashes and falls.

641
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,020
I'll destroy her happiness,

642
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,460
the very thing
you wanted to protect.
