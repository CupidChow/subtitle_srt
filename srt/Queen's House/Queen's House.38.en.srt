1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,950
(Episode 38)

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,890
- Hello?
- Come and get your mom.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,520
Did something happen?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,190
She's the most entitled person
in this world.

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,230
She was still the same
at my dad's place.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,330
She's treating him
like he was her servant,

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,000
and I can't stand it anymore.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,940
I won't repeat myself.
Take her with you.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,210
You've reached Kang Jae In.

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,790
This was
why I didn't want you to work here.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,150
I told you not to cause a ruckus.

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,120
I never said Gi Chan had an affair,

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,090
but she pulled my hair out
as soon as she saw me,

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,630
claiming I've been telling everyone.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,530
Did you expect me
to let her do that?

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,730
She's your elder.

20
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,100
That doesn't matter.
What she did was wrong.

21
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,300
On top of that,
she should've been more careful...

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,670
as the mother of YL's chairman.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,010
So? Are you saying
what you did was good?

24
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,510
Director Kang, rank-and-file workers
are still humans.

25
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,120
What will you do if I sue her...

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,680
and meet with reporters?

27
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,350
Things will blow up.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,890
Are you saying you'll do that?

29
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,160
- Kang Jae In.
- You shouldn't be blaming me.

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,530
What you should be doing
as my immediate superior is...

31
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,990
checking with me and comforting me
to make sure no harm is done...

32
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,330
to the business.
I was offering a piece of advice.

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,030
Please excuse me.

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,550
Good one.

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,650
That was cool.

36
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,970
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,940
Yes? What is it?

38
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,640
I'm disappointed in you.

39
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,810
It wasn't Jae In's fault.

40
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,750
It's not even her fault,
so why are you harsh on her?

41
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,780
Shouldn't it be blamed on the one
who shamelessly pulled her hair out?

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,120
Seung Woo.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,850
She's still our family.

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,420
Isn't that so?

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,160
I know
I was the first to betray her.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,030
I know what I did was wrong.

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,130
But I would...

48
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,670
rather be the one
to hurt my family...

49
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,740
than to have them beaten
by strangers.

50
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,870
And?

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,070
Would you have done this
even if my dad was here?

52
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,770
No, right?

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,610
I'm disappointed in you.

54
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,350
This must run in our family.

55
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,090
Did she call me Ms. Noh Sook Ja?

56
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,230
Has she gone completely insane?

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
How dare she address me like that?

58
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,970
This is for you.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,140
This is so awful.

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,140
Mom, do you think
I need a hair transplant?

61
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,010
She pulled out everything.

62
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,410
Take a look, Mom.
Is there a patch missing?

63
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,920
You idiot.
If she pulled out your hair,

64
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,850
you should've done the same to her.

65
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,650
All you did was scream at her.

66
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,820
You're too reckless.

67
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,720
What about you?
You're reckless, too.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,960
All you have is a lot of strength.

69
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,390
Dr. Kim
and everyone at work saw that.

70
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,530
How am I going
to hold my head up high?

71
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,230
You've embarrassed me to death!

72
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,730
- Enough is enough!
- Jeez!

73
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,800
Good grief. I can't believe this.

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,310
My wrist hurts.

75
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,810
Anyway, who was that punk?

76
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,010
That punk who stood next to her,
the one who looked like a pushover.

77
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,080
He had such an awful temper.
Who is he?

78
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,780
You know him, too.

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,950
Don't you remember?

80
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,520
I do?

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,750
He was the guy
who had an affair with Jae In.

82
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,720
I showed you a picture of him.
Don't you remember?

83
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,290
He was that punk?

84
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,460
Yes, and he was the same one
who got Jae In out...

85
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,130
from that mental hospital.

86
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,830
What did you say?

87
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,430
Why is he there?

88
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,100
He works at our in-house clinic.

89
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,470
I can't believe this.

90
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,810
An unfaithful couple had been
roaming about at my son's business,

91
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,180
messing around with everything.

92
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,110
Does Gi Chan know?

93
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,310
Of course, he does.

94
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,380
And he still lets them stay?

95
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,520
He'll get rid of them soon.
Don't worry about it.

96
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,090
Jeez.

97
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,920
Hey, honey.

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,590
I'm home.

99
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm comforting Mother.

100
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,530
My gosh.

101
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,200
She was greatly shocked.

102
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,830
Goodness.

103
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,270
Right now? Okay.

104
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,270
Hey...

105
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,810
Didn't he ask you to put me on?

106
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,110
He told me to run over right now.

107
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,280
You should get some rest, Mother.

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,620
Darn it.

109
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,530
What is it?
Why did you suddenly need me here?

110
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,510
Your aunt said you've been popular
since when you were in school.

111
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,410
You called me here to ask just that?

112
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,940
I suddenly got curious.

113
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,880
You already know
how simple my dating history is.

114
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,420
What about you?

115
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,890
You must've dated other men
before you were with me.

116
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,660
Yes, I've dated other men.

117
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,300
I was too young,
and none of it was serious,

118
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,830
so I don't remember much.

119
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,630
It wasn't serious?

120
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,840
What do you mean
when you say it wasn't serious?

121
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,640
Relationships that have faded
from my memory.

122
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,840
I see. Then,

123
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,280
what was this relationship?

124
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,960
Do you take wedding photos
with a guy you don't remember,

125
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,290
even though things weren't serious?

126
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,660
What is this?

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,230
Who's this guy?

128
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,530
You shouldn't be asking me.

129
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,940
You'd know better
as the woman in the picture.

130
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't know who this is.

131
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,670
I've never seen him before.

132
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,310
And I've never taken
a picture like this.

133
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,910
Why would I lie to you
about something like this?

134
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,990
I think this was Photoshopped.

135
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,290
Who gave this to you?

136
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,020
Who knows?

137
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,160
It was left on my desk.

138
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,500
Then, it must've been faked.

139
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,500
Why would anyone
leave this photo here...

140
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,130
instead of giving it to you
in person?

141
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,110
This was a trick someone pulled
to play us against each other.

142
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,040
I don't know.

143
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,380
Are you sure you don't know him?

144
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,820
Don't you remember the wedding photo
Director Kang used...

145
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,150
to make me her real niece?

146
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,250
Everyone was deceived
by that fake picture.

147
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,590
So, you're saying this was faked?

148
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,800
Wait, do you actually believe this?

149
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,860
Are you saying I've been married?

150
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,630
All right.

151
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,600
Then, what would this person get
by coming between us?

152
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,840
It's an attempt to split us up.

153
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,840
Who would want that the most?

154
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,440
Yes, it's the person
that just came to your mind.

155
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,880
Kang Jae In.

156
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,020
She's such a nasty girl.

157
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,960
She won't give up
on trying to split us up.

158
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,160
She's been doing that
since our wedding and until now.

159
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,630
I'm going to demand an answer.

160
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,800
And I'll tell her...

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
nothing she does will be enough
to split us up.

162
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,040
Aunt, did you forget
your promise with me?

163
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,610
I asked you to work with me.
How can you send him my wedding photo?

164
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,750
Are you sure
you returned all my things?

165
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,250
No, right?

166
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,020
I told you to give me everything.

167
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,890
What wedding photo?

168
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,420
The one you took with Ji Seong Jun?

169
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,520
I gave you everything.

170
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,420
Who sent it to him if it wasn't you?

171
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,690
You burned everything
that belonged to you.

172
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,530
How could I
send that picture to him?

173
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,300
And think about it.

174
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,700
I'm now
financially dependent on you.

175
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,300
I'm not crazy enough to do that.

176
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,700
I'm hanging up.

177
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,510
Then, who gave him this picture?

178
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,610
Is it a copy?

179
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,110
Who made a copy of this?

180
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,180
She said
a thief broke into her place.

181
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,950
Does this mean it was the thief?

182
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,490
Wait, was it Jae In?

183
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,190
Did you send this?

184
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,260
Se Ri, is Chairman Hwang Gi Chan...

185
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,960
your second husband?

186
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,700
Or are you two-timing him,
just like your current husband did?

187
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,970
Isn't it obvious?

188
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,000
It's obviously Photoshopped
with malicious intent.

189
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,240
It was you, right?

190
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,510
You sent it to my husband,
didn't you?

191
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,280
Me? It wasn't me.

192
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,910
I want to know who sent that
even more than you.

193
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,820
It means someone else
holds a grudge as big as mine...

194
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,990
against you and Gi Chan.
Don't you think so?

195
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,290
Don't be smart with me.
I know it was you.

196
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,990
Kang Jae In B.

197
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,760
I didn't know
you were married twice.

198
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,900
Well, I guess
I don't know much about you.

199
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,870
You said you studied Interior Design
at Koyeon University, right?

200
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,010
Did you really graduate
from that university?

201
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,410
Does she know something?

202
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,310
No, she's just feeling me out.

203
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,690
It must be you.
You keep giving me this nonsense.

204
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,460
I'm warning you.

205
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
Something like this
can't break up our love.

206
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,830
Don't even dream that
Gi Chan will return to you.

207
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,000
He'll be mine forever.

208
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,010
I'm going out for a meeting.

209
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,370
Tell Director Kang when she returns.

210
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,980
I did some digging on Kang Se Ri.

211
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,490
Her mother passed away
a long time ago,

212
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,750
but she still has an aunt.

213
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,060
This is her address
and phone number.

214
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,500
She must have
lots of information on Se Ri.

215
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,300
I'm sure.

216
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,530
I'll send her a present...

217
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,270
and let her reunite with her family.

218
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,810
I knew it.

219
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,010
Yes, of course, I know you.

220
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,040
My sister used to work
as a housekeeper for your...

221
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
That's enough, Aunt.

222
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,860
Thank you
for your good work, Mr. Do.

223
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,290
Se Ri's aunt just came by.

224
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,660
A wedding photo?

225
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,030
So, her marriage to Gi Chan was
the second time?

226
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,270
Se Ri.

227
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,410
You act like you're fine,
but I know you're already crashing down.

228
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,010
Enjoy everything while you can.

229
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,950
I'll slowly suffocate you.

230
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,780
I'm going to make you
spill everything in your own words.

231
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,520
Apologize to me!

232
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,420
You pulled out so much hair.

233
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,290
I'm sorry. Did it hurt a lot?

234
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,990
What? Why are you
apologizing right away?

235
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,600
My sister-in-law...

236
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,370
Na Ra,
if I didn't pull out your hair,

237
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,140
I would've lost all mine,
so I had no choice.

238
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,540
Forget that.
Let me cut to the chase.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,870
What's going on
between you and Dr. Kim?

240
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,580
You two aren't into each other,
are you?

241
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,080
He stepped in
like a knight in shining armor...

242
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,450
and saved you.

243
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,350
He's a good man.

244
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,020
He would've stepped in
and done the same...

245
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,450
even if it weren't me.

246
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,060
That sounds so complicated.

247
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,960
Let's not make this hard
and keep it simple.

248
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,590
Do you two like each other?

249
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,300
No, nothing is going on between us.

250
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,970
Do you mean it? Do you really?

251
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,170
Yes.

252
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,770
Can you promise?

253
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,970
I do.

254
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,570
Okay.

255
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,610
I accept your apology
for pulling out my hair.

256
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,220
(Really pretty! Hot body! Rich!
Love babies! So cute! Thoughtful!)

257
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,750
(Very kind! Good cook!
Love to show love! Totally serious!)

258
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,960
One. My body size is
34 inches, 24 inches, and 35 inches.

259
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,030
I did get a little bit
of medical help on the face,

260
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,370
but everything else is mine.

261
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,540
It's all from my mom.

262
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,200
- Hey, Na Ra...
- Two.

263
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,410
I'm really rich.

264
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,510
You only know that
my brother is the chairman here,

265
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,580
but my mom is the real deal.

266
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,180
She's made of cash.

267
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,290
She can let you open
a few clinics without a problem.

268
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,190
- Na Ra, I...
- Three.

269
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,190
My grandmother on my mom's side
had seven kids, including her.

270
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,530
My mom also had three kids,

271
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,400
so I'll give you
as many kids as you want.

272
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,070
But you have to get me
the best postpartum care center.

273
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,310
I have to take good care of myself
after childbirth.

274
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,440
So, why are you doing this to me?

275
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,110
I'm asking you out.
Go out with me, Dr. Kim.

276
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,180
There's only one answer
I can give you.

277
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,890
Go ask Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

278
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,990
your older brother,
if you're allowed to date me.

279
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,930
So, we can start dating
as soon as I have his permission?

280
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,230
I need to go shopping today
for an outfit to wear on our date.

281
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,730
See you tomorrow!

282
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,850
Even if Jae In wasn't behind this,
it must look like it was her.

283
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,890
Honey, as I expected,
it was Kang Jae In.

284
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,690
Are you sure?

285
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,530
I showed her the photo
and demanded an answer.

286
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,100
If it wasn't her,
she could've just denied it.

287
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,000
But she just gave me
ridiculous excuses.

288
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,570
What do you think that means?

289
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,140
It means she did it.

290
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,740
She's trying to get us divorced.

291
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,480
Honey, you can't fall
for her tricks.

292
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,280
You know that, right?

293
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,590
(Mr. Hong)

294
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,900
Find out more about the man
in the photos I sent you.

295
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,340
Mom's really worried.

296
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,910
Send Ms. Kang away
while I act like a madman...

297
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,310
to stall for time.

298
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,210
Your mom said...

299
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,520
our family needed her right now.

300
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,320
She called her gentle and kind.

301
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,160
I felt suffocated...

302
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,720
when she said that to me.

303
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,390
She's like that.

304
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,730
You know it, too.

305
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,660
That's not what's important!

306
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,030
How many times
do I have to tell you?

307
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,900
What if Yun Hee knew she was...

308
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,170
the daughter of the woman
who killed her daughter?

309
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,200
If she did,
would she have said that?

310
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,170
Choi Ja Young should be punished
for what she did to Do Hee,

311
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,110
but Ms. Kang didn't do that.

312
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,140
It wasn't her choice...

313
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,910
to be born as Choi's daughter.

314
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,850
Last time,

315
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,320
you said you weren't sure
if it was right...

316
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,150
for you to shift the blame
to an innocent person.

317
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,520
That was all about Ms. Kang.

318
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,690
You said...

319
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,760
I'd be the worse person
if I hated on someone innocent.

320
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,130
- Hey, that was...
- As you said,

321
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,070
it wasn't easy to hate someone.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,070
And it must've been harder
because she wasn't someone I should hate.

323
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,510
Once I let go of my hard feelings,

324
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,110
I finally saw...

325
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,350
how tormented Ms. Kang was.

326
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,780
She suddenly lost
both her father and son.

327
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,890
I realized
her life must've become...

328
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,490
as ruined as mine,

329
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,860
no, even more devastated.

330
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,900
As you already know,

331
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,470
there are lots of mysteries
surrounding Do Hee's death.

332
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,970
Ms. Kang's ex-husband,
Hwang Gi Chan,

333
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,970
is in the center of it all.

334
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,510
Ms. Kang and I are working together
to expose the truth.

335
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,280
Please give us a little more time.

336
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,450
I know it wasn't her fault...

337
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,280
and that
unfortunate things happened to her.

338
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,120
But we each have to bear
the weight of the life we face.

339
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,820
I don't think...

340
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,860
this situation is something
Yun Hee has to bear, Do Yun.

341
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,960
I don't want her to be hurt anymore.

342
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,400
Call me after you send her away.

343
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,980
How many times
do I have to tell you?

344
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,190
This isn't your place, Mom.

345
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,250
I never said it was.

346
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,660
Did you apologize to Mr. Do?

347
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,190
Don't you know what I'm like?

348
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,730
I never lower my head
to just anybody.

349
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,300
You live off him,

350
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,470
yet you refuse to apologize,
never pay for your expenses,

351
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,370
and even treat him like a servant.
Who would appreciate that?

352
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,000
Even I would hate it.

353
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,310
Mom, please pull yourself together.

354
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,040
Who told you what
to make a scene like this?

355
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,310
Was it Yu Gyeong?

356
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,450
Mom, come and live with me.

357
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,290
I should be able to rent out
a tiny room.

358
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,520
What do you mean, a tiny room?

359
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,490
A place made of one room,

360
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,630
somewhere without a living room?

361
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,060
Hey, I can't live there.

362
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,100
I'm already stifled in this place.
How am I going to live there?

363
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,340
I checked my text message.
Don't come here.

364
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,900
I don't want to see you or Mother.

365
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,310
Bye.

366
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,380
You two friends should chat.

367
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,680
I'm tired. I need to sleep.

368
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,650
Didn't you come
to take her with you?

369
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,820
I don't have enough means
to do that right now,

370
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,660
and there's something I must do.

371
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,200
Yu Gyeong, let me apologize
on her behalf.

372
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,760
I told her to be careful, too.

373
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,900
Where are you staying?

374
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,970
Are you still at Dr. Kim's place?

375
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,870
Yes.

376
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,510
You're so shameless.

377
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,240
Does his family know who you are?

378
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,880
You didn't tell them?

379
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,180
You and your mom are the same.

380
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,820
Don't you think you're too selfish?

381
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,260
Yu Gyeong.

382
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,390
What did I do so wrong to you?

383
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,260
I'm not trying to nitpick over this.
I just want to know.

384
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,800
It's hard to understand
this sudden change.

385
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,670
You never had to be in a position
to understand anyone.

386
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,870
See? My dad is
tending to your mom...

387
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,210
like he's still
your family's servant.

388
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,980
How would you understand that
if you were me?

389
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,650
Can you understand it?

390
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,150
Wouldn't it be weirder
to ask me to treat you...

391
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,820
like how I did before?

392
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,290
Don't ask me for much.

393
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,890
That's why I'm calling you selfish.

394
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,370
Yes, everything you said was right.

395
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,370
I should've thought it through.

396
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,370
Forget it.

397
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,870
If you aren't here to take Ms. Choi,
just leave.

398
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,340
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

399
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,140
I'll take her with me soon.

400
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,750
It must be inconvenient,
but please put up with her a little more.

401
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,880
Bye.

402
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,040
Hey, welcome back.

403
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,800
You're late. Have you had dinner?

404
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,110
I ate.

405
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,510
Why is there
an adhesive bandage on your neck?

406
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,150
Ms. Kang, did you get hurt?

407
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,550
Yes, a little.

408
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,620
Let me see that.
Did you disinfect it?

409
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,890
It's not that bad. I'll be fine.

410
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,190
The doctor wants to see it,
so show him.

411
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,660
Let me bring the first aid kit.

412
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,040
- Bo Ram, you're up.
- Okay.

413
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,340
What happened?

414
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,050
I scratched myself...

415
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,180
while trying to relieve an itch.

416
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,690
How did you do that,
no matter how itchy it was?

417
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,890
By any chance,

418
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,090
is someone harassing you at work?

419
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,730
Something similar
happened to my daughter before.

420
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,930
I can't share the details,

421
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,470
but she had a tough time.

422
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,040
No one did that to you, right?

423
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,170
Grandma, someone hit my mommy?

424
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,470
Who was it?

425
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,880
No, it's not like that.

426
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,550
I had the wrong information.

427
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,420
Bo Ram, you did a great job
with the adhesive bandage.

428
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,980
It won't get infected.

429
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,450
Should we clean this up?

430
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,590
Okay.

431
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,820
Here.

432
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,630
Put that inside.

433
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,670
Please excuse me.

434
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,010
Yes, goodbye, Min Jun.

435
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,420
Your sister is quite worried.

436
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,990
I don't know the whole story,

437
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,120
but you should return home.

438
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,930
Hey, Min Jun.

439
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,900
Can we love our enemy's child?

440
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,670
Love?

441
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,470
No, don't take it the wrong way.

442
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,100
I'm not talking
about anything sexual.

443
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,970
I mean something more...

444
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,570
You know...

445
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,710
Affection?

446
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,810
Yes, that's it.

447
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,410
Or was it called agape love?

448
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,820
No, never mind.
Pretend like you never heard that.

449
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,920
You should go.

450
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,420
Then, please excuse me.

451
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,870
Father!

452
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,510
Father! Your son-in-law is here!

453
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,140
I'm here.

454
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,050
You need to go. No one is here.

455
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,750
He's not here? What?

456
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,050
He's not. He's not here.

457
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,720
Hey, gigolo.

458
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,090
Yes, you, the gigolo.

459
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:21,700
Do not muddy the waters here,
and go pick someone else.

460
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,100
Don't lay a finger on my mom.
You better be careful!

461
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,340
Be careful, you.

462
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,240
Be careful.

463
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,820
Yu Gyeong!

464
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,890
Hey.

465
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,320
He still barges into
any old house...

466
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,230
whenever he gets drunk.

467
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,100
What are you doing
this late at night?

468
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,530
Don't you think you'll humiliate my dad
before his neighbors?

469
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,440
It's because you wouldn't see me.

470
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,810
But I finally got to see you
after doing this.

471
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,880
How can you laugh right now?

472
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,550
No, I'm not.

473
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,850
Yu Gyeong.

474
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,880
Yu Gyeong, I'm sorry for everything.

475
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,120
I'm your husband,

476
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,520
so I should've only trusted you.

477
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,790
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,460
Forget it. Get up.

479
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,460
If you tell me to go die,
I'll kill myself.

480
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,070
If you tell me to become a dog,
I'll be one.

481
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,970
If you tell me to bark, I'll bark.

482
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,070
Woof.

483
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,610
- Stop the nonsense and get up.
- Yu Gyeong!

484
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,440
Yu Gyeong, I can't live without you.

485
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,680
I can live without money,

486
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,380
but I can't live without you.

487
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,620
Please don't leave me.

488
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,150
If you do, you're going to kill me.

489
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,820
Yu Gyeong...

490
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,130
- Please don't...
- Hey, get up.

491
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,960
Father.

492
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,530
- I made honey water. Wake up.
- Yu Gyeong...

493
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,460
Yes, right.

494
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,870
Father!

495
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:13,180
I love Yu Gyeong so much.

496
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,910
I'll be good to her.

497
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,110
So, please...

498
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:20,250
let me marry her.
Let me have her hand.

499
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,850
You didn't have to make him
honey water.

500
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,090
Have you figured out how you felt?

501
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,030
Yu Gyeong, to me,

502
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,870
how you feel
and what you want to do are...

503
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,600
the most important.

504
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,810
No, only those things are
important to me.

505
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,380
You don't have to mind
anything else.

506
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,250
Just do whatever you want to,
no matter what it is.

507
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,300
Yu Gyeong, I'm sorry.

508
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,770
I won't do that again.

509
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,650
Good grief, you idiot.

510
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,760
You shouldn't have come here,
no matter how drunk you were.

511
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,800
I know you're up. Get up.

512
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,570
Where's Father?

513
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,740
He went out...

514
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,780
with Jae In's mom to eat breakfast.

515
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,510
Yu Gyeong, I'm so sorry.

516
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,650
Please forgive me.

517
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,920
All right. Let's go.

518
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,490
I'll see you at home after work.

519
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,720
Really?

520
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,820
Then, I'll escort you to work...

521
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,360
and pick you up later, too.

522
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,260
- You don't have to do that.
- Hey.

523
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,930
I want to do that. Let's go.

524
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,530
Gosh, my feet are cold.

525
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:15,770
I won't put my socks on.

526
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,030
Let's go. Come on.

527
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,040
(YL Planning and Design)

528
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,110
Overall, I stuck
with the classic Nordic design.

529
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,980
I asked you to put
something together in a hurry...

530
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,510
to add to the special catalog
we're sending out...

531
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,410
only to our VIP customers.

532
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,950
What do you think, Mr. Kang?

533
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,820
It's not bad,

534
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,530
but it seems oddly strange.

535
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,530
What would Mr. Kang know
about interior design?

536
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,970
I think he's right on point.

537
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,500
Ms. Kang, this isn't your place
to step in.

538
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,440
You've either added
or removed some assets...

539
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,510
from a previously completed design,

540
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,440
so it doesn't look complete,
and of course, oddly strange.

541
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,910
She only changed some structures
and created variations.

542
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,120
This was a design
by a furniture company...

543
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,790
that received lots of attention...

544
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,160
at a furniture and light fair
a few months ago.

545
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,730
This was a kitchen design
presented by a new designer...

546
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,700
last year
at the Milan International Furniture Fair.

547
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,400
No, I really didn't know.

548
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,040
Designs are all done by people,

549
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,270
so we may have had similar ideas.

550
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,310
I'm falsely accused, Director Kang.

551
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,710
Let's forget adding
another design to the catalog.

552
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,150
I'll let this go because you said...

553
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,720
you didn't copy these.

554
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,890
But you're putting out these designs
with our name behind it.

555
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,120
I won't condone the same mistake twice.
Remember that.

556
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,990
That's all for today's meeting.

557
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,100
Ms. Kang.

558
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,230
If you have time to meddle in
your superiors' business,

559
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,070
do your job right.

560
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,010
Go to the design team
and pick up some materials.

561
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,310
Sure. As you wish.

562
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,520
Hey, Ms. Kang.
You know that was immature, right?

563
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,390
I thought you were like seven.

564
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,820
Mr. Kang!

565
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,460
I have to be at a meeting
with the PR team.

566
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Would you like a cup of warm tea?

567
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,950
(YL Group Clinic, Doctor Kim Do Yun)

568
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,320
Please relax...

569
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,750
and talk to me whenever you want to.

570
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,590
It's too painful...

571
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,260
for me to keep coming to work.

572
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,530
I see.

573
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,570
Can you tell me
what's troubling you?

574
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,910
My direct senior hates me.

575
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,810
I get blamed
for doing things I didn't do...

576
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,250
and get talked about behind my back.

577
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,520
It feels like I can hear people
keep saying bad things about me,

578
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,990
so I have trouble sleeping, too.

579
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,120
It must've been tough.

580
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,730
It's tough to focus on work,

581
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,000
and I keep making mistakes.

582
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,470
I don't know what to do.

583
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,970
It's only natural
for you to lose focus...

584
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,170
when you become
stressed out and anxious.

585
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,140
Your mental condition may impact
your physical condition, too.

586
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,880
Let me write you a referral.

587
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,310
You should receive professional
counseling and treatment.

588
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,680
Active treatment will
help you very much.

589
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,090
What do you say?

590
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,020
Please sit there for a moment.

591
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,540
Excuse me.

592
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,480
Why are you doing this to me?

593
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,310
- What's wrong? Calm down.
- Go away!

594
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,480
- Stop it!
- Calm down!

595
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,150
- Help!
- What's wrong?

596
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,220
What's going on?

597
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,390
Did something happen at work?

598
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,730
Why?

599
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,830
I saw police officers
going to the clinic.

600
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,300
Is something going on?

601
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,070
You need to hear me out!

602
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,310
I didn't do it!

603
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,110
I said I didn't.
Why are you doing this?

604
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,580
You're under arrest
for attempted rape.

605
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,360
(Queen's House)

606
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,060
He must've realized...

607
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,770
nothing good will come of
messing with me.

608
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,430
You're so great, honey.

609
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,740
The same applies to you.

610
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,640
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan...

611
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,110
called me himself
and asked me to find this man.

612
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,280
So? Should I look for him?

613
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,950
Uncle Gi Man will talk to Santa.

614
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,720
Please be a good kid
and let me off this once. No?

615
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,350
- You're here.
- Hello.

616
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,260
You seem quite familiar.

617
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,530
Why won't you keep going?

618
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,130
Wait, is she...
