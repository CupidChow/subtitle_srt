1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,840
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,380
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,080
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,050
(Episode 54)

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,680
You must be in shock.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,520
I understand completely.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,860
So, I had been wondering
if I should share this with you or not,

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,230
but I had to tell you
to prevent something worse...

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,860
from happening in the future.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,800
Something worse?

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,170
I mean your son.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,940
Your son seemed to have
an unusual relationship with Jae In.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,780
Your son cannot fall in love
with the daughter...

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,580
of the woman
who killed Ms. Kim Do Hee.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,520
That just can't happen.

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,490
I thought you should know.

17
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,630
That's all I have to say.

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,860
Goodbye.

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,750
It can't be true. No.

20
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,520
What kind of awful joke is this?

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,050
No.

22
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,590
It can't be.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,270
What's next?

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,700
What will you send me next?

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,140
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,410
Can you at least give me a hint?

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,040
Designer Kang Jae In,

28
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,110
you barged in without knocking.
What is this nonsense?

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,680
So, you're going to play the fool?

30
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,580
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,490
(Kang Jae In is the daughter
of Kim Do Hee's murderer!)

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,720
Will you continue to act dumb?

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,120
I'll read you
the text messages, too.

34
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,760
"Kang Jae In is the daughter..."

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,900
"of Kim Do Hee's murderer."

36
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,370
If you tried to kick me out
of their home, you failed.

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,370
They already know who I am.

38
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,010
These kinds
of immature tricks are futile.

39
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,380
If you wish to continue this,
then go ahead.

40
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,440
I'll make my moves, too.

41
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,050
I'll upload this piece of paper
on the intranet...

42
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,050
as well as a screenshot
of those text messages.

43
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,550
That'll cause
quite an uproar, right?

44
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,790
Reporters will notice something
and want to write about it, too.

45
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,230
Isn't this enough to bring damage
to YL's chairman, Hwang Gi Chan?

46
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,730
What do you think?

47
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,230
Are you really the Jae In I know?

48
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,800
You're becoming slier as days go by.

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,270
I'll take that as a compliment.

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,640
I learned through experience...

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,070
that I must go down
to your level to fight.

52
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,810
So, do whatever you want.

53
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,880
I'll return it all to you.

54
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,990
Team Leader Kang,
go to the staff lounge.

55
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,230
Please remember that
I had no other choice.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,300
(Kang Se Ri)

57
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,370
Do you like it?

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,910
This is your office from now on.

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,610
What?

60
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,980
If the loser
cannot be dismissed right away,

61
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,780
you need to pay a similar price.

62
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,820
You're no longer the team leader,
so you should leave the desk open.

63
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,960
If you want to stick around...

64
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,490
using the transition
as an excuse, do it here.

65
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,430
That was our term to let you
come to work for a few more days.

66
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,860
Director Kang told you, right?

67
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,070
What are you waiting for? Sit down.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,400
If you don't want to do that,
I'll remove it right away.

69
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,410
But you'll have to leave
this company immediately.

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,320
That seat suits you well.

71
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,750
It's just as petty
and useless as you are.

72
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,230
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

73
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,770
Honey, Jae In just demanded
that I work in the staff lounge.

74
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,380
Why do you have this?

75
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,080
Jae In gave it to me.

76
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,450
So, Kim Do Yun's family
didn't see this?

77
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,850
- I even sent a text...
- That she's the daughter...

78
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,790
of Kim Do Hee's murderer?

79
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,030
Did you say you'd take her down
by using a cheap trick like this?

80
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,430
Kim Do Yun's family doesn't care,
even though they know who she is?

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,830
That's crazy.

82
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,170
She's the daughter of the woman
who killed his younger sister.

83
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,430
How would I know?
But they couldn't care less.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,670
Resign, if you don't want to work
in the staff lounge.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,370
DH Holdings demanded
that you work there...

86
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,040
until your replacement comes.

87
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,050
Honey, without me,

88
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,350
no one here can protect you.

89
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,720
I'll protect myself.

90
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,790
You'll only get in my way
with that kind of petty talent.

91
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,460
You've changed.

92
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,860
You've become a different man.

93
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,060
I lived my life for you...

94
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
and did everything for you.

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,670
But this is all your love is worth?

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,570
I'll do as you say.

97
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,040
I'll work in the staff lounge
as I am told.

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,610
I'll also quit
when Kang Seung Woo returns to work...

99
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,180
and my replacement comes
to let business continue.

100
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,020
You have nothing more to say, right?

101
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,700
It took everything I had
to get to this place.

102
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,870
Did he just tell me to quit?

103
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,040
No, I'm never going to quit.

104
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,710
- Darn it.
- Hey!

105
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,550
If you're going to stay drunk...

106
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,680
and sit around all day
without paying living expenses,

107
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,320
pack up your things
and leave my home.

108
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
You know, that thing people say.

109
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,260
If you don't make money,
you shall not sit around like a bum.

110
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Don't you know that?

111
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,590
You mean, "He who does not work,
neither shall he eat."

112
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,730
What?

113
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,070
Give me money
if you want me to move out.

114
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,700
I have no money to leave,
so I need some.

115
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,270
I have no money to give you.

116
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,370
I got nothing,
even if you dig up the earth.

117
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,010
Then, just let me be.

118
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,280
This is probably better
than seeing your eldest son...

119
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,050
become a homeless man,
Ms. Noh Sook Ja.

120
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,920
Fine. It will
only make me stressed out...

121
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,650
to see an awful kid like you.

122
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,250
I need a change of scenery. Gosh.

123
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,020
Your coffee is ready, Director Kang.

124
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,530
How's Mr. Kang?

125
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,570
He's still the same.
I barely see him at home.

126
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,770
I don't know what's going on,

127
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,510
but let him vent outside
if he has to.

128
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,280
He's at that age.

129
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,050
You know...

130
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,450
What does he know?

131
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,020
People may think
you two just saw a ghost.

132
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,830
You don't have to mind me.

133
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,700
You can pick up where you left off.

134
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,730
Something I had been seeing
made me freaking stressed...

135
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,600
Made me stressed out,
so I came to see something nice...

136
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,870
and regain my peace of mind.

137
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,310
Then, shouldn't you go
to an art gallery?

138
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,180
There's no need.

139
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,620
This place is much more fabulous.

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,020
What was it called? Tavit? Thavith?

141
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,990
What's that naked stone thing...

142
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,490
people all call handsome?

143
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,130
Anyway, this place has
something better than that thing.

144
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,330
Michelangelo's David?

145
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,200
Yes, David. That thing.

146
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,300
Oh Seong, you have
a much better proportion.

147
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,200
Are you looking
for Mr. Kang Seung Woo?

148
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,030
He's not here today, either.

149
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,600
Why are you here
instead of sitting at your desk?

150
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,870
I came to pick up some files
to get ready for the transition.

151
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,810
That desk is too tiny,
so I can't leave everything there.

152
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,210
I need to train my replacement well.

153
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,550
That's something people do
when they actually have talent.

154
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,280
Who can you train by plagiarizing?

155
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,550
Or is it your talent
to speak nonsense?

156
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,260
You were the one
who talked nonsense.

157
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,230
You claimed that
we sent you something.

158
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,760
Didn't you?

159
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,530
Aren't you putting on a show,
trying your best to kick me out?

160
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,030
Korea decides everything
by evidence.

161
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,370
If you want to nitpick over this,
bring me the evidence first.

162
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,940
Only then will I let you fight me.

163
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,510
Before I do that,
go back to your seat and sulk there.

164
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,190
Ms. Jung, I don't think we received
the right amount of raw chicken.

165
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,560
Ms. Jung?

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,200
Is something going on?

167
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,270
I have to pick up Bo Ram.

168
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm here.

169
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,580
What should I do first?

170
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,350
Something came up,

171
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,180
and I can't open for dinner,
so you two can go home.

172
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,650
Goodbye.

173
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,490
Is something going on?

174
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,060
I'm not so sure, either.

175
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm home.

176
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,530
I'm home, too.

177
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,870
Where's Bo Ram?

178
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,970
Bo Ram, Uncle Do Yun is home.

179
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,470
She's next door.

180
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,210
Is she? I'll pick her up.

181
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,440
Before you do that,

182
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,110
I have a question to ask.

183
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,990
What is it?

184
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,860
Did you receive
a weird call or box again?

185
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,530
Let me ask you one thing.

186
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,930
Yes, sure.

187
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,830
What's your mother's name?

188
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,940
- Mom, why are you suddenly...
- Stay out of this.

189
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,170
Choi Ja Young.
Is her name Choi Ja Young?

190
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,450
Mom, why are you suddenly...

191
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,720
I told you to stay out of this!

192
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,520
Why won't you say anything?

193
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,760
Is that right?

194
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,540
No, I can't believe this.

196
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,080
Did you know, Do Yun?

197
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,150
You didn't know she was
Choi Ja Young's daughter, did you?

198
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,920
I did.

199
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,120
No, Mom!

200
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,260
Let go.
Let go of me, and move aside!

201
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,230
Get out.

202
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,170
Do you know whose room this is?

203
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,670
Do you know
who this room belonged to?

204
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,670
It used to be my daughter's,
my poor Do Hee's room.

205
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,510
How can you shamelessly stay here...

206
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,150
knowing whose home this is?

207
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,050
How can you do this knowingly?

208
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,020
You knew everything!

209
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,720
- Mom, you need to calm down!
- How?

210
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,660
How can you look at us
and dare to show a smile?

211
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,130
How dare you act like
nothing had happened...

212
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,300
and smile at Bo Ram?

213
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,200
How?

214
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,870
Mom, you need to stop.
Let me explain everything, okay?

215
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,310
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,880
I'm so sorry.

217
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,890
I don't want to hear that.
Just bring her back.

218
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,760
Bring back my poor daughter.

219
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,290
Bring her back!

220
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,760
Bring her back! My Do Hee...

221
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,700
Bring my poor Do Hee back.

222
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,300
Bring her back!

223
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,970
Do Hee!

224
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,150
- Bring my Do Hee back!
- What's going on?

225
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,180
Bring her back!

226
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,620
- Just bring her back!
- Mom.

227
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,250
You need to stop. Please.

228
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,730
Do Hee...

229
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm so sorry.

230
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,540
I'm at fault.

231
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,440
I must've been crazy.

232
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,380
No, Do Hee!

233
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,010
My poor daughter!

234
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,750
Goodness, Do Hee!

235
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,920
- Mom!
- Yun Hee!

236
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,520
Yun Hee. Hey.

237
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,750
Mom, can you see me?

238
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,980
Oh Seong, is that woman gone?

239
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,390
- Calm down, Yun Hee.
- Get off me.

240
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,160
I need to kick her out.

241
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,360
She can't stay here.

242
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,960
Did you know?
Did you know who she was?

243
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,800
You two are both insane.
You're both out of your minds.

244
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,740
How can you let this happen?

245
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,040
Did you forget Do Hee?

246
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,810
You're her brother and her uncle.
How can you do this?

247
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,840
Don't you know why she died?

248
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,980
Why did she die?

249
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,580
It was her fault.

250
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,550
Her mother killed Do Hee
for her daughter's sake.

251
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,350
So, how can you let this happen?

252
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,790
Don't you feel bad for Do Hee?

253
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,890
Of course, we know that.

254
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,230
She's my niece and his sister,
so yes, we know that.

255
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,800
We know that
better than anyone else.

256
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,560
Please calm down and let us explain.

257
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,370
Get out. I don't need you two.

258
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,240
You two are no longer my family.

259
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,240
You can't do this
if you're our family.

260
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,210
All I need is Bo Ram.

261
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,640
Get out of here.

262
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,210
- I don't need you two.
- Calm down.

263
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,510
I'll send her away.

264
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,050
I'll tell her to leave.
Did you hear that, Do Yun?

265
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,680
Mom.

266
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,520
Let go of me. I don't need you.

267
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,060
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,230
I should've thought this through.

269
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,960
Uncle Oh Seong didn't do
anything wrong. It's all my fault.

270
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,830
I'm sorry, Mom.

271
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,570
Do Hee, I'm so sorry.

272
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,870
I must've been crazy.

273
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,940
I had no idea
she was your murderer's daughter...

274
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,510
and let her live here.

275
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,450
Do Hee, I'm so sorry.

276
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,250
This is... This is my fault.

277
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,360
Do Hee, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

278
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,600
This is my fault.

279
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,830
Do Hee...

280
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
I'm so sorry.

281
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm sorry, Do Hee.

282
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,240
I'm so sorry.

283
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,890
I know nothing I say
can make you forgive me,

284
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,760
but I am truly sorry.

285
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,670
Thank you for everything.

286
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,670
Sincerely, Kang Jae In.

287
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,590
Hello?

288
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,960
Where are you, Jae In?
I need to see you.

289
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,130
Please don't worry about me,

290
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,530
and take good care of Ms. Jung.

291
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,470
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

292
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,240
Goodbye.

293
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,500
Wait...

294
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,590
How's Mom?

295
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,950
She fell asleep.
It must've been the sedative.

296
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,190
- Where's Jae In?
- She's gone.

297
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,430
She's gone? Did she leave?

298
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,230
Yes, she probably couldn't stay
now that Mom found out.

299
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,530
I told you this would happen.

300
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,640
You should talk to her
once she calms down.

301
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,740
You know this is tough to accept.

302
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,710
Okay.

303
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,240
This is a lot.
I need to get some air.

304
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,160
Hey, Mr. Kang Seung Woo. Wake up.

305
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,870
You'll be in pain if you sleep here,
and even suffer from a stroke!

306
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,370
Seung Woo. Kang Seung Woo!

307
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,910
He's completely out.

308
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,750
I'm sorry to ask,
but can you carry him with me?

309
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,320
Sure.

310
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,960
Goodness, when did
the pig's feet place turn into this?

311
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,330
I opened only recently.

312
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,770
Hey, Yu Gyeong.

313
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,010
Hey, Seung Woo.

314
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,340
Are you all right?

315
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,010
Why did you get so drunk?

316
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,510
Seung Woo.

317
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,820
Yu Gyeong.

318
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,950
Everything is so hard.

319
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
- It's hot.
- Yes, it's still hot.

320
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,130
Blow on it and take your time.

321
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,510
You mentioned
your birth mother before. Remember?

322
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,480
Is that still troubling you?

323
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,020
I found out who my birth mother was.

324
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,590
Right.

325
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,230
I see.

326
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,700
Why won't you ask?

327
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,430
Don't you want to know?

328
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,600
I don't want to pressure you
into telling me.

329
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,770
You can tell me when you want to.

330
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,270
Don't force it.

331
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,510
It was my aunt.

332
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,140
My aunt...

333
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,910
gave birth to me.

334
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,250
It must've been shocking...

335
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,790
and very troubling.

336
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,130
Thanks, Seung Woo.

337
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,130
For what?

338
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,900
You told me something...

339
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,500
that isn't easy
to share with someone.

340
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,010
Sure.
May I stay here a little longer?

341
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,710
Of course.
I'm going to study some more, too.

342
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,710
I'm not used to my job yet.

343
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,900
Why are you here again?

344
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,540
I want to see your sister.

345
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,170
Can you get her?

346
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,170
She's not here. She's home. Why?

347
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,750
Give me a drink, too.

348
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,390
You must've had
a few drinks already.

349
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,360
Yes, I did.

350
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,490
But it's not getting me drunk.

351
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,120
Can I have another drink?

352
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,460
Don't ask me anything.

353
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,800
I just want to drink.

354
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,200
I don't feel like
talking today, either.

355
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,320
Thanks, Yu Gyeong.

356
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,660
This reminds me of our old days.

357
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,630
We had so much fun back then.

358
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,470
At times, I even dream
of those days. I must miss us.

359
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,300
What about you?

360
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,770
I won't say anything.
I don't want to tell you.

361
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,780
This is the last drink.
Everything's gone.

362
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,120
I want another drink.

363
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,850
I can always grab another one.

364
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,590
I'll get it.

365
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,280
I must've been crazy.

366
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,760
Hey, Do Yun.

367
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,930
Where am I?

368
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,370
Well, I'm at a bar.

369
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,630
I got too drunk and fell asleep.

370
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,340
How's Yun Hee?

371
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,250
You got here early.

372
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,350
Yes.

373
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,750
Where did you stay last night?

374
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,350
At a friend's house.

375
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,360
I told you not to worry about me.

376
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,290
I brought it with me this morning.

377
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,360
How's Ms. Jung?

378
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,000
She calmed down a little.

379
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,670
Do you want a cup of coffee?

380
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,240
I have to go out for a meeting.

381
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,170
Then, let's eat lunch together.

382
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,480
Okay. I'll be back.

383
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,960
I'm sorry, Do Hee.

384
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,900
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,330
I must've been out of my mind.

386
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,770
Of all people,

387
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,770
I let your murderer's daughter
stay in this room.

388
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,940
I must've been crazy.

389
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,680
You probably thought
this was so ridiculous.

390
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,920
I'll erase all her traces.

391
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,660
I'm so sorry.

392
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,000
I don't have to come to work today?

393
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
I don't think
I can open for business.

394
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,340
All right.

395
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,240
Wait, you don't sound too well.

396
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,680
Are you sick?

397
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,610
It's nothing serious.
I think I just lost my voice.

398
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,480
I see.

399
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,280
You should get some rest.

400
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,650
Hey, Mi Sook.

401
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,220
Do you want to come over?

402
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,360
To your house?

403
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,730
You're the one who's unwell,

404
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,770
so why am I sitting here
eating this?

405
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,610
Are you not going to eat?

406
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,640
My boys left that for me to eat,

407
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,540
but I felt too infuriated to eat.

408
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,110
I thought it'd be nice
if you had some.

409
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,310
Does it taste okay?

410
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:40,120
Well, it's pretty light.

411
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,190
That's very generous
if it came from you.

412
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,990
Thank you so much for coming.

413
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,890
I wondered...

414
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,660
whom I should meet
to vent my frustration...

415
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,930
and stifled heart.

416
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,130
But I couldn't think of a friend...

417
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,500
I could share everything with
and confide in.

418
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,210
That's just life.

419
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,840
When I got your call,

420
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
I thought, "There was Mi Sook."

421
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,410
I thought I could talk to you,

422
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,380
so I invited you over.

423
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,890
What's making you so frustrated...

424
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,450
and stifled?

425
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,360
My daughter passed away.

426
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,430
Then, someone who was
as lovely and nice...

427
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,960
as my daughter came into my life.

428
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,530
She wasn't in a good situation,
so I told her to stay here.

429
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,870
My granddaughter, Bo Ram,

430
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,540
also adored her like a mother.

431
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,040
I thought she was...

432
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,810
a present and treasure
sent by my girl.

433
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,210
But she turned out to be...

434
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,450
the daughter of the woman
who killed my daughter.

435
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,490
What kind
of awful coincidence is that?

436
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,820
A woman who did that
to your daughter...

437
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,190
must be your worst enemy.

438
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:59,230
If I were you, I would've done
everything I could...

439
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,830
to avoid that kind of coincidence
from happening.

440
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,970
You're too kind.

441
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,070
I get to laugh, thanks to you.

442
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,010
Right?

443
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,810
What kind of coincidence is this?

444
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,120
How can fate be so cruel?

445
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,490
But what kills me the most is...

446
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,300
that I can't just hate her.

447
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,130
Isn't that ridiculous?

448
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,370
My daughter would be heartbroken
if she found out.

449
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,080
Goodness, Mi Sook.
Go to my room and take a nap.

450
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,180
I'm fine.

451
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,680
Come on.

452
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:57,850
I have to pick up my granddaughter,
so go ahead and take a nap.

453
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,990
I'm okay, really.

454
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,240
I fell asleep
after eating some porridge.

455
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,380
It must be the medicine.
I keep feeling drowsy.

456
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,000
Kneel.

457
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,470
I don't care what you say about me,

458
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,970
but it's just discourtesy
to bring up my family.

459
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,670
I want you to apologize.

460
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,030
(I know nothing I say
can make you forgive me,)

461
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,500
(but I am truly sorry.
Thank you for everything.)

462
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,520
(Queen's House)

463
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,790
You're home.

464
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,430
Ms. Jung was Kim Do Hee's mother?

465
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,930
Congratulations on your divorce.

466
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,970
A superstition says you'll run away
when you get new shoes as a gift.

467
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,140
Run, Yu Gyeong.

468
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,100
Forget all about the past
that tortured you.

469
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,240
Nothing happened.

470
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,780
We were both completely drunk,
so how could anything happen?

471
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,680
Just think of it as a mishap.

472
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:03,950
It won't be anytime soon,

473
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,150
but there will come a day
when my mom understands you.

474
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,480
How did she find out?

475
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,920
Director Kang visited her
at the restaurant.

476
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,390
My aunt?
