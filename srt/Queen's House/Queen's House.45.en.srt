1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,450
I'm asking you.
Why did you return to YL Group?

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,220
It's probably the same as you.

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,520
Yet you did something like this?

7
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,820
What's going on?

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,790
Ms. Kang Jae In,
you must've lost your mind.

9
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,270
Hello? All right.

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,800
The chairman wants to see you
and Ms. Kang.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,270
Come with me.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,690
This is exactly the same
as Jae In's design.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,520
Who did this?

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,590
The person
who designed it, obviously.

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,960
We'll suffer from a huge loss...

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,860
if this project falls through.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,470
What's she going to do?

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,570
Why are you so happy?

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,370
Didn't you hear me? I was concerned.

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,440
Your words sounded concerned,
but your eyes were smiling.

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,150
I didn't do it.

22
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,890
There's no reason for me to do that.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,260
It was your design,
the one you won the contest with.

24
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,590
No one else has seen it
other than the judges.

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,060
Are you saying
it was one of the judges?

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,930
It may be Team Leader Kang Se Ri.

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,130
Ms. Kang Jae In!

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,770
Do you have proof
that it was Team Leader Kang?

29
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,300
No.

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,640
Where did you learn to frame people
without any evidence?

31
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,410
You're claiming that
she did that to mess with you,

32
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,110
but try something
called thinking reasonably.

33
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,510
Do you think she'll do anything
to harm YL Group,

34
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,080
no matter how much she hates you?

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,550
It's obvious the impact will
end up reaching me, the chairman.

36
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,190
I agree with him.

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Why would she cut off her nose
just to spite her face?

38
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,100
I guess blood isn't
always thicker than water.

39
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,570
I didn't expect you
to only take Se Ri's side.

40
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,370
I don't want to go on.

41
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,900
You're fired, Ms. Kang.

42
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,740
I can't have
an industrial spy on my payroll,

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,570
so pack your stuff and leave now.

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,510
There's no evidence I did it.

45
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,850
If you had
any reason or common sense,

46
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,010
shouldn't you find the evidence,
catch the culprit,

47
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,920
and hold the culprit responsible?

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,650
I'll sue you for the damages made
to the project we had been preparing...

49
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,950
and for releasing
our confidential information,

50
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,220
so you better get ready.

51
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,120
Releasing confidential information?

52
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,730
I don't want to see you here,
so get out.

53
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,840
Do you know how scary it is
to leak confidential information?

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,140
The fate of a corporation
depends on it.

55
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,940
You were the one
who crossed the line first,

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,810
and you should take responsibility
just as you said.

57
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,180
Don't set another foot in here.

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
I was going to get some rest,
but I fell asleep again.

59
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,600
Why did I set this alarm?

60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,810
I think I had to go somewhere.

61
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,340
Do you know
that Jae In works for me now?

62
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,910
Your great daughter, Kang Jae In,

63
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,350
now has me as her boss.

64
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,650
No, that's impossible.

65
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,790
My daughter is better than that.

66
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,490
She wouldn't be that desperate.

67
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,730
Well, look at you now.

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,030
You were an industrial spy?

69
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,540
How can you do
something that audacious,

70
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,540
no matter how much
you despised my husband?

71
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,370
Yes, right.

72
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,870
Your mom works at a restaurant.
Did you know that?

73
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,240
I felt so bad
and couldn't bear to watch her.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,210
Why would you feel bad?

75
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,380
That haughty
Director Choi Ja Young...

76
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,380
is now a server, not even the owner.

77
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,650
Why wouldn't I pity her?

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,760
Everything you have
in your life is stolen.

79
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,220
Who are you to pity her?

80
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,860
That's nothing to pity her for.
That's something you admire.

81
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,300
My mom isn't ashamed of her poverty,

82
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,230
so she even put her reputation down
to work hard.

83
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,630
I'm proud of her.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,800
You're the one whom I pity,

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,670
and the word pity
even seems too good for you.

86
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,910
You hate me, don't you?

87
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,540
I really hate you, too.

88
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,010
Let us never meet again.

89
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,080
I won't see you off. Goodbye.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,530
Do you really work here?

91
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,930
Why do you work
for these indecent people?

92
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,400
Mom, you need to stop.

93
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,340
You shouldn't be here.

94
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,610
You should be in
the chairman's office up there.

95
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,410
This isn't your place!

96
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,310
Who did this?
Who made you work here?

97
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,180
Was it your aunt? Was it?

98
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,520
No, I came to work here.

99
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,620
What? Why would you volunteer
to work here?

100
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,520
You need to quit now.

101
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,930
I got fired,
so I was packing up anyway.

102
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,690
Stop shouting at me.

103
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,760
What was your aunt doing
when you got fired?

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,230
She was on the same page.

105
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,330
I was framed unfairly,
but I'll get through this.

106
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,170
She's not in there anyway.

107
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,140
She went out to work with Seung Woo.

108
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,910
And?

109
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,280
You plan
to get kicked out like this?

110
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,340
If something is unfair,
you must put up a fight.

111
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,080
Why do you let them do this
like an idiot?

112
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,680
If you're going to leave,
leave with dignity.

113
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,820
I can't bear
to see you leave like this.

114
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,290
Wait here.

115
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,060
Mom!

116
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,400
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

117
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,970
You can't do this, Ms. Choi.

118
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,570
Gi Chan will get mad at me.

119
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,370
Na Ra, it's all right.
You may leave.

120
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,370
Okay.

121
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,750
Welcome.
I've been wanting to see you.

122
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,350
Have a seat.

123
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,250
Do you think I won't?

124
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,430
It was already unfair that
you stole Jae In's position.

125
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,570
So, how dare you frame her?

126
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,170
Tell me what kind of a scheme you plotted
to frame my daughter...

127
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,770
right now.

128
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,210
She sent her own design
to a competitor herself...

129
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,540
and got caught.

130
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,750
She brought it on herself.

131
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
That's impossible.

132
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,920
I know her best.

133
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,790
You know that it's taboo to act
as an industrial spy, don't you?

134
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,120
I don't know...

135
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,660
how many years she'll spend
locked up in prison if I sue her.

136
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,990
I was already resolute
when I spoke to Jae In,

137
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,000
but I could
always let it go amicably...

138
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,300
for whatever's left
of our old times' sake.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But I'll show her mercy only once.
It won't happen twice.

140
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,410
I don't want to see her
anywhere in my life again.

141
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,640
That's why I wanted to see you.

142
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,360
(Cashier's Check)

143
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,270
Don't feel self-conscious
and fill it in.

144
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,840
I'm pretty much paying you
in return for your daughter.

145
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,670
You can write down
however much you want.

146
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,840
You don't have to mind me
and put down a small amount.

147
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,550
I'm pretty much paying you
in return for my daughter,

148
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,020
so you may write down
however much you want.

149
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,650
In return, you will leave her
without another word.

150
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
That's the price I pay
for removing her from my life.

151
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,560
But just make sure you make her disappear
without a problem.

152
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,500
Do you dare to humiliate me?

153
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,970
Do I dare?

154
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,780
Don't be deluded into thinking
we're all equal just because...

155
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,940
we live under the same sky
and breathe the same air.

156
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,980
Don't be deluded into thinking
we're all equal just because...

157
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,580
we live under the same sky
and breathe the same air.

158
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,320
People are
all born into their places.

159
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,360
And I am too good
for the place Jae In is in.

160
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,930
People are
all born into their places.

161
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
And Jae In is
too good for the place you're in.

162
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,430
And she's useless now.

163
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,940
You're a money-obsessed woman,

164
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,370
so I'm curious to find out
how much you'll jot down.

165
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,810
Why aren't you doing it?

166
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,540
What is it?

167
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,640
Are you wondering
how much you should write down?

168
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,880
This is your last chance.

169
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,820
You can ridicule me all you want
but do not ridicule my mom.

170
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,830
Show her the least bit of respect.

171
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,130
It's exactly what she did to me.

172
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,130
Is this wrong of me?

173
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,300
I know what she did wasn't good.
I agree with that.

174
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,240
But she was trying to protect me.

175
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,300
You're just mocking her.

176
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,970
That's really low.

177
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,080
Mom, get up.

178
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,800
Do you want some water?

179
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,540
I don't need it. You should go.

180
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,480
I heard you took up a part-time job.

181
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,680
Isn't it too hard?

182
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,850
It seemed like
Se Ri came to see you.

183
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
Did she harass you in any way?

184
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,520
Mom.

185
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,420
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,860
I always wonder
how things could've been...

187
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,530
if I did as you said.

188
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,570
Back then, Gi Chan was
all I had on my mind.

189
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,240
I believed
I had made myself a happy family,

190
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,470
and I really was happy...

191
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,380
as I watched Eun Ho grow up.

192
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,580
I don't regret my decision
because I got to have Eun Ho in my life.

193
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,080
But still,

194
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,750
I wanted to tell you that.

195
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,420
I'm sorry, Mom.

196
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,130
I don't consider Gi Chan a human.

197
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,390
I won't forgive him,

198
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,170
so don't go there anymore,
no matter what happens now.

199
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,970
Okay?

200
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,080
Mom.

201
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,560
Do you know how I felt back there?

202
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,490
I wanted...

203
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,060
that blank check.

204
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,700
I wanted to take it.

205
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,070
I looked down on people
for their crudeness,

206
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,410
but I was the same as all of them.

207
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,820
You should try it first,
Auntie Yu Gyeong.

208
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,190
My tutor said I should always offer food
to my elders first.

209
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,890
Thank you.

210
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,590
You're such a good boy, Ji Ho.

211
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,030
You learned to show respect
to your elders.

212
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,900
Hey, honey.

213
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,240
Auntie Yu Gyeong,
I think Uncle Gi Man wants to pee.

214
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,740
He keeps sitting down
and standing up...

215
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,680
after calling your name.

216
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,180
Stop making him concerned
and say what you have to say.

217
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,720
I'll handle the money problem.
I mean it.

218
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,220
Does your mother know...

219
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,660
you did something like this
without focusing on the restaurant?

220
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,430
Please keep it a secret from her.

221
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,630
They haven't reached out to you
since that time, right?

222
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,400
It's because I talked to them
and said I'd handle everything.

223
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,730
The only way
for me to trust you again...

224
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,570
and for us to restore
our relationship is...

225
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,500
by having a child.

226
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,340
So, you need to cooperate.

227
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,640
That's the only thing
you can do for me.

228
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,880
All right.

229
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,850
I'll do my best.

230
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,090
You're going to the hospital? Why?

231
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,920
Taking a test won't change anything.

232
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,660
Come back quickly when you're done.
I have to go.

233
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,700
Oh Seong.

234
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,230
Why haven't I
seen you around for so long?

235
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,600
I started a new job,
so I have been busy.

236
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,410
I lost all my appetite...

237
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,470
because I couldn't see you.

238
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,710
Why don't you
eat something delicious with me...

239
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,310
and stay for a cool drink, too?

240
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,850
- Wait, no. I have to...
- Come on.

241
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,860
(Closed)

242
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,080
I also don't feel at ease
about Jae In's incident.

243
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,250
But I couldn't turn a blind eye...

244
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,980
to an evident problem.

245
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,620
Even if it had been
any other employee,

246
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,250
they would've been fired, too.

247
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,630
I keep thinking about it,
but I still can't believe she did it.

248
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,360
We couldn't eat dinner last time,
so let's eat out tonight.

249
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,500
Do you know a good restaurant?
Let's get some fresh air.

250
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,410
Do you like pig's feet?

251
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,740
I'm a rich woman...

252
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,680
with a house and land.

253
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,650
I have everything...

254
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,820
except for one thing.

255
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,490
My significant other.

256
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,560
Love is such a fickle thing.

257
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,390
It always seems so close,

258
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,000
but it's just out of reach.

259
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,300
It's way too difficult.

260
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,970
Yes, it's a difficult thing.

261
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,780
I always thought
money was everything,

262
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,550
that it was the best.

263
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,280
But my heart still feels empty.

264
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,250
I guess it wasn't everything.

265
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,820
What do you think, Oh Seong?

266
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,520
Me?

267
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,430
Love is always my priority.

268
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,560
When you fall in love,

269
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,570
one's nationality, background,
or age doesn't matter.

270
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,540
That must be why I'm still alone.

271
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,470
Everyone has
different values in life,

272
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,940
yet some may say
I'm too naive to consider it love.

273
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,520
Don't I seem too old-fashioned?

274
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,990
Love is everything to this man.

275
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,820
I'll make sure
I get him into my bed today.

276
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,030
I must've had too much to drink
in such a short time.

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,730
Goodness, Ms. Sook Ja.
Are you already drunk?

278
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,170
But I know
you can contain a lot of alcohol.

279
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,600
Ms. Sook Ja?

280
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,770
Ms. Sook Ja? My gosh. Ms. Sook Ja?

281
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,610
Ms. Sook Ja? Goodness. What do I do?

282
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,190
This is it.

283
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,230
What a day.

284
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,760
Nice timing, Min Jun.

285
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,200
You know Ms. Noh, right?

286
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,770
You should grab a cab for her.

287
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,640
I have to pay the bill.

288
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,710
All right. You should go.

289
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,840
Darn it.

290
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,880
No!

291
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,040
Goodbye.

292
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,780
Why did you suddenly come out
right at that time?

293
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,760
Mom, Father.

294
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,360
What are you two up to?

295
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,560
Why didn't you come
when I told you to?

296
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,430
I failed yet again. Darn it.

297
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,800
Why did she turn this over?
We aren't taking the day off.

298
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,270
Please give me a moment.

299
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,880
- Did you drink with my mom?
- Yes.

300
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,110
She must be in bad condition.
She got drunk quickly.

301
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,150
How much do I owe you?

302
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,980
It's 40... It's 100 dollars.

303
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,020
Put it on this card.
I don't need the receipt.

304
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,590
Here.

305
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,860
Goodbye.

306
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,970
What was that?

307
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,800
He didn't care
that I just ripped him off.

308
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,740
What if I really end up
with a stepfather...

309
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,510
who isn't much older than me?

310
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,950
Is Patrick Jung a gigolo?

311
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,450
What?

312
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,920
I mean, isn't it suspicious?

313
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,460
That scruffy man
suddenly became so sleek.

314
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,760
Maybe older women gave him money
to invest in our company.

315
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,500
It's DH Holdings you're talking about,
not just a random firm.

316
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,360
You already know
it's a global business.

317
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,530
That's true.

318
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,600
I just don't like that guy.

319
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,140
Hello.

320
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
Would you like to order?
What would you like?

321
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,880
How's Yu Gyeong?

322
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,890
Well, everything is the same.
She's doing all right at home.

323
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,020
Don't worry too much.

324
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,960
I'll take the usual dish.

325
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,290
Okay. Excuse me.

326
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,470
You seem rather familiar.
Have you come here often?

327
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,770
A few times.

328
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,880
Do you really want to know...

329
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,010
who gave birth to you?

330
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,820
Honestly speaking, I'm torn.

331
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,890
She...

332
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,390
She's someone
who abandoned me, her child.

333
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,230
She probably didn't abandon you.

334
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,500
You don't have to comfort me.

335
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,940
I keep remembering that time...

336
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,340
when Ms. Kim Do Hee's mother came.

337
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,840
That's how a mother acts
when she loses her child.

338
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,280
But that woman...

339
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,750
never wanted to see me to this day.

340
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,160
Do you have an idea
who might be behind this?

341
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,630
I have a feeling that it's Se Ri,

342
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,260
but I don't know for sure.

343
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,070
The design file was at work,
so no matter who it was,

344
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,040
they must've had me as the target
when they sent the file.

345
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,840
What will you do now?

346
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,540
I'm going to track down
how the file was leaked...

347
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,740
and how it ended up
with that company.

348
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,710
I'll go
to the model house tomorrow...

349
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,010
and meet
with the person in charge, too.

350
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,410
Then, I'll go with you.

351
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,180
What about work?

352
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,680
I'll tell my uncle in advance.

353
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,050
It's always better
to have a partner.

354
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,720
You're a big help
as a trustworthy support.

355
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,890
Thank you.

356
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,530
What do you mean
I sent you an e-mail?

357
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,270
I never did that.

358
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,470
Then, why would I say
I received it from you?

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,040
You sent me
the floor plan and said...

360
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,910
you wanted to ruin YL Group,

361
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,840
so you didn't even want money
and told us to see it to decide.

362
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,980
You said
you'd take full responsibility,

363
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,910
so why wouldn't we accept it?

364
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,250
Can we confirm if the e-mail
really came from her address?

365
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,820
Do you think I'm lying?

366
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,020
I replied to the e-mail,
so you can check it for yourself.

367
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,400
(To Manager Jung Hyeon Su
of AZ Design)

368
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,600
It was sent from my e-mail.

369
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,540
Manager Jung!

370
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,940
Are we good now? Please leave.

371
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,270
You should've ended it
after sending us that e-mail.

372
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,440
Are you trying to stab my back?

373
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,850
Someone must've
sent the e-mail at my desk...

374
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,750
using my account.

375
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,990
I need to find out where they get
their materials manufactured.

376
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,830
You must be tired.
Get some sleep on our way there.

377
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,340
I'm fine. You must feel exhausted
after driving me around...

378
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,670
since this morning.

379
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,920
- Thanks.
- Sure.

380
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,210
Okay.

381
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,410
(DH Holdings)

382
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,610
Come in.

383
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,250
Where's Director Kim Do Yun?

384
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,560
He's out on business.
What does this concern?

385
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,420
I must discuss this with him.

386
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,930
You must have a lot of free time.

387
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,870
Weren't you having a tough time
because of your late niece?

388
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,840
Did you come and get furious at me
just for a show?

389
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,440
What are you trying to say?

390
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,150
I thought you were
deeply grieved for her,

391
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,420
but maybe that wasn't the case.

392
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,820
Stop beating around the bush
and just get to the point.

393
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,490
You said you were worried
about your older sister,

394
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,220
but that didn't seem so convincing
when I saw you drinking...

395
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,130
and laughing with another woman.

396
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, I guess it may feel different
because she's just a niece.

397
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,570
I could feel your sister's grief
with every inch of my body.

398
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,940
The grief and sorrow
of her loss was...

399
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,410
different from yours.

400
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,410
How do you know
if my sister was that grieved?

401
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,910
I've met her.

402
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,750
You have? When?

403
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,350
It was before DH Holdings
joined us as an investor.

404
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,650
She had come here.

405
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,450
Why are you telling me this now?

406
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,620
What did you say to her?
How did you hurt her this time?

407
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,360
I didn't say anything!

408
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,090
I wanted to apologize,
but she cursed me instead.

409
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,560
She said I'd be cursed by fate.

410
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,670
If you deserve it, you should be.

411
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,540
Did you say
you felt sadness and pain?

412
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,840
Don't be ridiculous.
You have no idea.

413
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,440
You couldn't know how it feels
to lose your entire world.

414
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,310
I know.

415
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,580
How would you know?
You don't even have a child.

416
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm also...

417
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,150
a fellow woman.

418
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,520
I know
what maternal instinct is like.

419
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,190
Let me tell you this again.

420
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,030
I can't forgive everyone
who made my sister shed...

421
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,860
tears of blood.

422
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,760
And that doesn't change
even if that person is you.

423
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,200
Watch out.

424
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,340
You've reached
Team Leader Kang Se Ri.

425
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,280
She came by?

426
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,420
You didn't say anything, right?

427
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,290
Erase all traces
of our communication.

428
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,290
I met you in person
and gave you that file,

429
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,660
so nothing will happen
if you keep your mouth shut.

430
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,100
Kang Jae In,
you're as persistent as vermin.

431
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,540
I keep taking you down,
but you keep trying to crawl back.

432
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,110
What are you doing over there?

433
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,120
I was about to leave
for a meeting outside.

434
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,290
I'll go straight home
if it goes on for a while.

435
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,150
Can you change this to 1764?

436
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,890
- Did you say 1764? Okay.
- Yes.

437
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,030
I heard you came to conduct
the due diligence.

438
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,330
The factory manager isn't here,

439
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,730
and I don't know much about this.

440
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,800
It's all right.

441
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
Do you know Manager Jung Hyeon Su,
the person in charge?

442
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,170
He sent us here.

443
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,170
It's highly sensitive,
so he told us to move quietly.

444
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,680
This is the e-mail from him
telling me to be here.

445
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,940
Yes, right.

446
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,080
That's his work e-mail address.

447
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,810
We just need to see the proposal...

448
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,850
for the model house
to explain this project.

449
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,120
Sure.

450
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
(Monthly Schedule)

451
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,690
(June 13:
Material order from AZ Design)

452
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,060
(June 13:
Material order from AZ Design)

453
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,090
Are you yet to find out
where Jae In is staying?

454
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,600
Keep looking into it.

455
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,770
And text me the address
of the business...

456
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,440
Ms. Kim Do Hee's mother is running.

457
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,880
You got home early.

458
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,120
You should get some rest.
I'll call you when dinner's ready.

459
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,590
I heard you went to YL Group.

460
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,160
Mi Ran told me.

461
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,530
Yes, I went there.

462
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,200
I lost my cool when I learned
Do Yun was working there.

463
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,900
Do Yun would've lived...

464
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,310
a good life like other doctors
if it hadn't been for Do Hee's case.

465
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,110
That thought just hit my head,

466
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,840
and I felt bad for Do Hee, too.

467
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,650
Yun Hee.

468
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,520
I'll get revenge for everything.

469
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,760
So, don't be so sad anymore.

470
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,520
I'll keep Do Yun safe, too.

471
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,730
So, just focus on Bo Ram.

472
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,030
You need to show a smile
for her sake.

473
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,410
Make sure you're always careful.

474
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,310
You should also keep an eye
on Jae In when you're there.

475
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,150
Okay.

476
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,980
Hey, Uncle Do Yun, Ms. Kang.

477
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,050
- Hey.
- Hey.

478
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,690
What were you doing in your room?

479
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,820
I was drawing.

480
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,630
I'm home.

481
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,160
Welcome back.

482
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,730
You haven't had dinner, right?

483
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,600
I'll be done soon,
so give me a second.

484
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,870
Let me give you a hand.

485
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,100
Dad.

486
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,310
I'm sorry.

487
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,910
I'm sorry
I couldn't keep Jae In safe.

488
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,410
I already know...

489
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,790
she would do anything...

490
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,790
for YL's sake.

491
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,830
I'm sorry, Jae In.

492
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,070
Mom, I miss you.

493
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,380
My gosh. He had so much to drink.

494
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,850
Are you okay?

495
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,690
Where's the restroom?

496
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,690
Go outside and take a right, sir.

497
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,270
Watch where you're going!

498
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,870
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,540
Hey, Mom.

500
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,180
Did you come out to get me?

501
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,210
Mom!

502
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,750
What do you think you're doing?

503
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,320
Seung Woo.

504
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,250
Are you all right?

505
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,920
Are you hurt?

506
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,490
Let me see you.

507
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,730
How dare you push him?

508
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,700
Goodness. I didn't push him.

509
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,130
He got drunk and fell on his own.

510
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,100
I saw what you did.
How dare you lie to me?

511
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,710
Did you just scream at me...

512
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,610
because of some kid like that?

513
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,010
Watch what you say!
Don't call him some kid!

514
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,280
You have no idea who he is.

515
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,390
Let's go.

516
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,520
Mom...

517
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,330
I won't let it go
if you treat him like dirt...

518
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,700
from this day on.

519
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,570
Let's go.

520
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,370
Come on.

521
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,540
Hello?

522
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,100
At the chairman's office?

523
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,670
Okay.

524
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,320
Why are you here, Director Kim?

525
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,520
Because this concerns YL Group.

526
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,990
If there's an actual industrial spy
other than Ms. Kang,

527
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,830
I need to be aware of that.

528
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,600
We're all here, so let's hear out
the proof she has of her innocence.

529
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,000
But if this is nonsense,

530
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
I'll sue you according to the law.

531
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,570
Someone leaked my design
through my e-mail account...

532
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,910
on June 20.

533
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,980
The competitor also claimed
they copied my design...

534
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,810
after receiving that e-mail.

535
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,680
However, the competitor
gave the order with my design...

536
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,150
to their material supplier...

537
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,290
a week before that, June 13.

538
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,860
This means
they already had the design...

539
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,230
before they got the supposed e-mail.

540
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,230
Hence, if they claim to have copied
my design through that e-mail,

541
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,270
it must mean
there was a malicious attempt...

542
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,140
to make me the leaker.

543
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,310
You'll find the recording...

544
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,370
of the conversation I had
with the competitor's employee,

545
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,280
the information I found
at the materials factory,

546
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,180
as well as a file
of the timeline of the events.

547
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,480
If anyone continues to frame
Ms. Kang for this incident,

548
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,890
we must be suspicious
of that person instead.

549
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,630
Please allow me to take this.

550
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,000
Hello?

551
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,670
A witness to the accident?

552
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,620
(Queen's House)

553
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,260
Hey, does this mean
my numbers have gone up?

554
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,920
Don't worry about the possibility,

555
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,530
and give it a try with confidence.

556
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,590
Hooray!

557
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,060
Hooray, Gi Man!

558
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,500
You didn't even doubt
that I did something like that.

559
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,500
That's why
I'm apologizing right now.

560
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,240
Find out
who really leaked my design...

561
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,870
and punish them.

562
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,440
Who is Seung Woo to you?

563
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,010
What do you mean?

564
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,440
You did this to your wife,
the woman you said you loved!

565
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,150
How can you do this to me?

566
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,550
Even when you went around
causing trouble like a madman,

567
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,280
I still put up with everything
every single time. Why?
