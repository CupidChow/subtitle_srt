1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,550
Yun Hee...

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,320
must miss Do Hee a lot.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,420
Jae In left a big hole in her life.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,220
It's probably more so
because Bo Ram would mention her...

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,350
from time to time.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,460
Hello, Mom. Are you having trouble
finding the call recording?

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,300
What?

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,670
At the time of Do Hee's accident?

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,010
I'll be there now.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,710
What's going on?

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,610
She must've been on the phone with Bo Ram
at the time of the accident,

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,180
and it must've been recorded.

16
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,490
Come on in...

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,230
and take a listen.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
Please spare my life.

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,380
Please let me...

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,610
Please let me live.

21
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,650
Will you ruin everything like this?

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,250
Mommy?

23
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,360
Hello?

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,660
It's hard to make out
because of the noise,

25
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,590
but there's someone else
other than Do Hee.

26
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,030
Didn't you
also hear a woman's voice?

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,700
I did.

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,340
Can you tell us
everything you saw on that day?

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,770
I'm not sure if it was the car
that hit the woman,

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,510
but I saw a young man and a young
woman who seemed like a couple...

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,650
bickering with one another
next to the car...

32
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,350
parked at the scene of the accident.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,450
Uncle Oh Seong, this voice is...

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,950
I know what you're thinking.

35
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,890
This is evidence
that can help us find out...

36
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,960
what happened
before and after the accident,

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,290
but the problem is that it's hard
to make out because of the rain.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,660
I'll find someone who removes
such noises and make a request.

39
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,530
You're right. Can you send me
that file from her phone?

40
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,840
I'll ask Wang Sik
if he knows someone.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,070
Sure.

42
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,910
I thought Choi Ja Young
hit her and ran off.

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,910
You said you saw it in the video.

44
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,550
But it seemed like
there was more than one car...

45
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,590
that came and went.

46
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,190
Calm down, Mom.

47
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,660
We'll find out for sure
once the noises are removed.

48
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,930
Yes, Yun Hee.
I'll look into it as soon as possible,

49
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,060
so don't worry.

50
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,600
All right. I won't worry.

51
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,640
I'm leaving first today.

52
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,780
I don't think
you're leaving now, Ms. Kang.

53
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,250
I'm the team leader here.

54
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,080
You don't get to decide that.

55
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,590
Where should I put this?

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,760
On Team Leader Kang's desk.

57
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,400
Summarize the whole thing
and make 20 copies of the file.

58
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,970
It's the reference for our meeting
with the Design Team tomorrow.

59
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,210
Have you gone deaf?
I'm the team leader here,

60
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,980
so why should I do this?

61
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,240
Mr. Kang is here, too.

62
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,310
You can do it, Mr. Kang.

63
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,080
It's my order as the team leader.

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,020
I think you're the one
who's gone deaf.

65
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,490
She just told you to do the job.

66
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,990
Designer L is now in charge
of the Planning and Design Team.

67
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,560
She's your boss.

68
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,560
Do you realize
you're using your sister...

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,800
as an excuse to cross the line?

70
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,070
You're worse for acting up...

71
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,300
by using the chairman,
your husband, as an excuse.

72
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,840
I put you up for the job,

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
so stop talking back to me
and do as I say.

74
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,610
I have no reason
to keep you around...

75
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,110
if I can't have fun
bossing you around.

76
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,140
Know your place.

77
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,280
I'm going straight home
after a meeting outside.

78
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
Okay.

79
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,990
(Planning and Design Team)

80
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,730
Did Jae In make me do
busywork like this...

81
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,040
to go back to my home,
meet Ji Ho, and toy with Gi Chan?

82
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,510
Ji Ho. Mommy's here.

83
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,680
I missed you, Mommy.

84
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,590
I missed you so much, too.

85
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,050
The elders aren't home.

86
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,660
I can't let random people come in
when they aren't around.

87
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,390
My mommy will get mad for opening
the door for a stranger.

88
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,700
She's really scary
when she gets mad.

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,200
She's like a witch.

90
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,570
Gi Man, she's not a stranger.
She's my mommy.

91
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,670
It's all right.

92
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,970
Gi Man, I'll leave
right after I see him.

93
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,180
Hey, you!

94
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,940
Hey. It's the police!

95
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,610
You have to arrest this woman!

96
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,550
Jeez. You began to copy
the drama you watched yesterday.

97
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,350
You're like an actor, Gi Man!

98
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,460
You're so cool.

99
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,560
I want to be an actor, Mommy.

100
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,830
That's not a job for everyone.

101
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,230
Why are you crouching there?

102
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,530
You got caught after sneaking in,
so you need to leave now.

103
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,270
Do you want to get
kicked out by Gi Chan?

104
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,400
I'll be back, Ji Ho.

105
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,870
- Don't go, Mommy!
- Goodness.

106
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,640
You're a good boy, Ji Ho.
Aren't you? There, there.

107
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,540
- Mommy!
- Goodness.

108
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,780
Mommy!

109
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,220
I want to be with my mommy.

110
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,680
Mommy!

111
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,790
- Don't cry.
- Mommy...

112
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,160
Let's eat something delicious.

113
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,090
I'm older than you,
so I'll buy you something good.

114
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,400
Let's eat.
Let's eat something good, Ji Ho.

115
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,900
Then, can we eat fried chicken?

116
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,610
Mommy, Ji Ho wants fried chicken.

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,940
Sure. You can have some.

118
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,880
Money, please.

119
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,920
Here. Read the directions carefully
to get to the place.

120
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,250
I'm friends with the owner,
and she knows you, too.

121
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,690
She'll give you some more
on the house.

122
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,990
So, what's the place called again?

123
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,790
Bo Ram's Fried Chicken.

124
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,630
Time to eat fried chicken!

125
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,830
It's within walking distance,
so he should be fine.

126
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,740
And turn left.

127
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,180
Fried chicken.

128
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,710
What's next? Hey.

129
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,680
Bo Ram's Fried Chicken. I found it!

130
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,350
What?

131
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,310
Gi Man has been gone for a while.
Why isn't he back yet?

132
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,470
When will he come back?

133
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,850
Does this mean
I can't have fried chicken today?

134
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,420
A prince like you
should learn to be patient.

135
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,850
Why don't you wash your hands
and do homework for the kindergarten...

136
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,690
before you eat the chicken?

137
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,830
You have to listen to me...

138
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,160
for good things to happen to you,

139
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,560
and you'll even get to see
your mommy.

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,230
Okay.

141
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,940
Darn it.

142
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,170
I'd lash him to teach a lesson
if he were my son,

143
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,780
but he's my grandson,
so I can't do that.

144
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,840
It's as if he's my boss.

145
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,480
She must be an angel.

146
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,580
She's so pretty.

147
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,150
What happened?
Where's the fried chicken?

148
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,560
Did you fail to find the place?

149
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,290
She's so pretty.

150
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,790
She's the prettiest.

151
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,900
Goodness, what's with you?

152
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,830
Forget it.

153
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,730
I'm glad you came home
without getting lost.

154
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,100
- I'm back.
- Hey.

155
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,370
My son.

156
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,340
I'm about to cross over
to the other side...

157
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,280
trying to babysit your son alone.

158
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,050
Se Ri even snuck in today,

159
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,350
so I became surprised
and had to kick her out.

160
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,520
We should hire a helper...

161
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,160
to look after the boy.

162
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,090
You know, like that tutor.

163
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,160
What do you think?

164
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,960
Do as you wish, Mom.

165
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,410
(Kang Mi Ran)

166
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,150
Who do you think you are?

167
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,620
How dare you utter this nonsense?

168
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,320
Why would my company go down?
It'll never fail!

169
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,960
Your company?

170
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,630
Yes, this is my company.

171
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,400
The late Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol
was my father.

172
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,170
I'll turn this
into the best company in the world.

173
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,440
Yes, right.

174
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,370
It's a present.

175
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,770
For me?

176
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,780
What are you doing?

177
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,020
Did you cry a river?

178
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,880
What are you talking about?
I said no.

179
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,950
I didn't cry!

180
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,090
Never mind, then.

181
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,090
What?

182
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,090
It wasn't Jae In's fault...

183
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,590
that I was that woman's son,

184
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,730
but I only got mad at her.

185
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,820
I owe you so many apologies.

186
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,890
If I get another chance,

187
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,400
I'll never let go of your hand.

188
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,330
Seung Woo is your son.

189
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,270
Please take care of him.

190
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,080
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

191
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,550
Please leave a message...

192
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,360
Gyu Cheol.

193
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,030
You took Seung Woo in,

194
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,830
and Ja Young raised him,

195
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,970
but I paid back
such kindness with evil.

196
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,370
I was blinded,
thinking I became a sinner...

197
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,940
to Seung Woo.

198
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,180
I should've trusted Jae In most
as her family,

199
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,750
but I was the one who cornered her,

200
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,920
and even Ja Young
lost her health and fell ill.

201
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,820
I should've protected them...

202
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,330
just as you protected Seung Woo.

203
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,500
Please don't forgive me.

205
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,540
Seung Woo.

206
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm sorry that I'm your mother.

207
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,990
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,660
What do you think you're doing?

209
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,100
Mi Ran.

210
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,070
You and I made
so many great memories here.

211
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,270
What...

212
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,370
were you going to do in this spot?

213
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,290
Why do you want to run away?

214
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,920
Avoiding making a decision
when you need it most isn't the answer.

215
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,730
You did that
when you left me without a word,

216
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,300
and even with your son, Seung Woo.

217
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,600
The whole truth is
finally out in the open,

218
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,270
but you're trying to flee.

219
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,840
How is that
a way to atone for your sin?

220
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,450
But I ruined everything.

221
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,780
You,

222
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,190
Gyu Cheol,

223
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,920
Ja Young,

224
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,660
Jae In, and even Seung Woo.

225
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,160
It's all my fault.

226
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,870
Only I was unaware
of how self-centered...

227
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,070
and cruel I truly am.

228
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:02,810
Nothing I do...

229
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,980
will be enough to pay for my sins.

230
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,450
You must right the wrongs.

231
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,090
You found out
things have gone wrong,

232
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,430
so you should think of a way
to fix it like an adult.

233
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,660
I'll do anything I can...

234
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,730
to right the wrongs
and bring justice to my family.

235
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,870
That's the best I can do for Do Hee,
who died an unfortunate death.

236
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,810
You also need to do
everything you possibly can.

237
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,280
Actually,

238
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,750
there's a voice file recorded
at the time of Do Hee's accident.

239
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,250
We aren't sure yet,

240
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,090
but Ms. Choi Ja Young...

241
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,890
may not be the culprit
who killed Do Hee.

242
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,030
What are you talking about?

243
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,870
Then, who is it?

244
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,940
Are you saying it's Seung Woo?

245
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,540
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

246
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,540
When they heard a witness
for Do Hee's accident reached out,

247
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,210
the two hid in secret
and watched us meet with him.

248
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,080
It's highly likely for Hwang Gi Chan
and Kang Se Ri to be the culprits.

249
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,290
Doesn't that make you angry?

250
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,030
You were deceived by those two.

251
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,690
Don't you want to get revenge?

252
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,100
The Mi Ran I knew...

253
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,070
would never sit around
and let them do this.

254
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,350
And about Seung Woo.

255
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,910
Don't say anything yet.

256
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,920
He just found out
who his mother was.

257
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,890
What if I showed up as his dad?

258
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,820
Both Seung Woo...

259
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,690
and I need more time at this moment.

260
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,930
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
Yes, you should be sorry.

262
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,370
I'm still not a big enough man...

263
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,780
to forgive you now.

264
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,360
She became much calmer.

265
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,290
Mom, may I see your phone?

266
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,930
My phone? Why?

267
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,230
Were you worried about me?

268
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,700
I wanted to install an app
in case of an emergency,

269
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,140
just like how you collapsed today.

270
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,910
(Beep in an Emergency)

271
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,150
When you arrive
at the emergency room,

272
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,720
it'll automatically show
your medical record...

273
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,490
to the doctors and let them find out
about your condition.

274
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,660
I've been worried about her.
That sounds like a useful tool.

275
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,630
You'd feel relieved
even when we aren't around her.

276
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,060
Yes.

277
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,630
Is that okay, Mom?

278
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,670
I'll update your medical note
from time to time.

279
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,040
Please do that if this will
make you feel more relieved.

280
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,860
This is my love for you.

281
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,400
I love you, honey.

282
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,170
Do you remember
what we had on our second date?

283
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,940
Stir-fried tripe?

284
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,370
Yes, that.

285
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,270
I'm not the one who's craving it.

286
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,080
You don't have to pretend
when you're with me.

287
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,510
When things are hard, just say so.

288
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,820
When you're in pain,
tell me you are.

289
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,020
I'm here for you.

290
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,920
We're family.

291
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,260
Don't pretend to be strong
when you're with me.

292
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,090
I hope you'll trust me
and depend on me...

293
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,630
just as I do with you.

294
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,960
I only had one dream.

295
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,670
You and Eun Ho,

296
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,170
you two were everything to me.

297
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,410
My only dream was
for us to have a happy life.

298
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,480
That was the only thing I wanted.

299
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,350
You must've been surprised
that I wanted to talk in private.

300
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,720
I had a favor to ask of you,
so I was about to ask you first.

301
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,790
That's great, then.
Please let me go first.

302
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,830
Actually, this is
about Director Kang Mi Ran.

303
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,100
We must've been on the same page.

304
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,000
I was going to bring her up, too.

305
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,170
What is it about?

306
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,710
It's my aunt, Director Kang Mi Ran.

307
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
I wanted to clear her
of the false accusation.

308
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,510
Can you give me a hand?

309
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,280
Don't you resent her?

310
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,750
She denied who you were...

311
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,450
and sided
with Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

312
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,560
Is that okay?

313
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,960
She's my family.

314
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,760
We've pretty much become estranged,

315
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,700
but she changed a lot after finding out
everything, unlike before.

316
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,600
If she had been the same
even after finding out,

317
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,110
I wouldn't have forgiven her
because she's family.

318
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,410
I would've only wanted revenge.

319
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,980
She's now aware of her mistakes,

320
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,150
so I think she deserves a chance.

321
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,690
You're a much bigger person
than I am, Jae In.

322
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,520
I understand what you mean.

323
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,500
Ms. Choi, I'm going out to work.

324
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,740
There's fresh rice
in the rice cooker,

325
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,310
and you'll find side dishes
and soup in the fridge.

326
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,120
Please don't forget
to keep your phone next to you.

327
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,860
Home. I must go home.

328
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,560
Director Do?

329
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,860
Why am I here?

330
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,970
Where am I?

331
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,950
Hey, it's Ms. Mi Sook.

332
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,280
Hello.

333
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,180
Hello, Mr. Do.

334
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,090
Hey, Bo Ram. You're here, too.

335
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,590
I don't know whose girl she is,
but she's very respectful.

336
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,260
Another bad day?

337
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,800
Yes.

338
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,100
I thought it'd be dangerous
if she stayed home alone.

339
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,500
Yu Gyeong offered to have her
in her business, so I came with her.

340
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,040
That's much better
than the worst happening to her.

341
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,180
Grandma, may I hang out
with Ms. Mi Sook?

342
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,310
Sure.

343
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,180
You can play with her over there.

344
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,750
Okay.

345
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,320
Come with me.

346
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,390
Okay. Sure.

347
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,590
I brought her here...

348
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,320
because she wanted to skip
kindergarten, and she looks excited.

349
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,200
Bo Ram adores Ms. Choi very much.

350
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,600
Mr. Kang Seung Woo!
Let's enjoy a delicious lunch...

351
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,610
What?
Did he already leave for lunch?

352
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,810
He's working outside.

353
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,450
I wasn't asking you.

354
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,820
I thought you were curious.

355
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,560
You know my family is in a miss
because of you, right?

356
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,220
Like mother, like daughter.

357
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,390
It's a mess, not a miss.

358
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,430
If you don't know what the word is,
just don't use it.

359
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,830
I knew what the word was.

360
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,200
I just forgot it for a second. Jeez.

361
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,010
Your family isn't in a mess yet.

362
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,040
It'll happen soon, though.

363
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,520
Don't you need to eat lunch?

364
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,490
Ms. Mi Sook,
let's get some ice cream.

365
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Okay.

366
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,190
Can you escort her safely?

367
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,030
Yes, I'll hold her hand tightly
when we're out there.

368
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,200
Ms. Mi Sook,
let's hold hands and go.

369
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,280
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

370
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,730
Wait, Yu Gyeong.
I need to take a breath.

371
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,900
Okay. I'm good now.

372
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,170
You wanted to say something.
Go ahead.

373
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,270
Wait!

374
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,770
Let me go first.

375
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:02,010
I don't care what you say.
I'll continue to like you.

376
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,550
You can't change that.
It's just how I feel.

377
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,920
If you're going to tell me...

378
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,050
to stop liking you at all,
then don't say it.

379
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,760
I don't want to hear it.

380
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,990
It's not just you.

381
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,830
I'm starting
to have feelings for you.

382
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,440
Did I just hear you right?

383
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,640
I always thought of you
as my friend's younger brother,

384
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,080
so I only recently began
to think of you as a man.

385
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,080
As you already know,

386
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,050
I've been divorced
for only a few months now.

387
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,560
So, it's a bit scary
to think of dating...

388
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,390
or liking someone.

389
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,600
So, you need some more time?

390
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,570
Why don't we see each other
for a month or two and try this out?

391
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,000
If we still like each other
after that,

392
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,810
we can officially be an item.

393
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,510
Okay. I know I'll still like you...

394
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,880
even after a month or two.

395
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,160
There was a call recording?

396
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,060
Yes.

397
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,460
May I take a listen, too?

398
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,030
It's hard to hear
with the noise in the file,

399
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,970
so my uncle got someone
to remove them.

400
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,700
It should be ready
either today or tomorrow.

401
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,240
Right. I found something, too.

402
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,220
This is...

403
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,690
You're right.

404
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,230
It's the other cuff link
Gi Chan had kept.

405
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,260
How did you find this?

406
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,800
I rummaged through the storage to
look for a lead on my dad's will...

407
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,540
and found it there.

408
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,610
He must've kept his old things...

409
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,480
in the storage when he moved
to Changpyeong-dong.

410
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,520
It may be hard to legally prove
this belongs to him,

411
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,190
but it's enough...

412
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,930
for us to be sure that he was there
at the time of the accident.

413
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,530
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

414
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,470
I just can't forgive both of them,

415
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,240
especially so
when I think of my mom.

416
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,670
She misunderstood Ms. Do Hee...

417
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,480
because of Se Ri's lies.

418
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,250
Se Ri sent my mom
a photo of Gi Chan in an affair...

419
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,020
without showing the woman's face.

420
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,050
Then, Se Ri gave the bracelet
in the photo to Ms. Do Hee,

421
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,560
took a picture of her,
sent it to my mom,

422
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,190
and set her up
as Gi Chan's mistress.

423
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,440
That means
she framed Do Hee intentionally.

424
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,440
Those fairy tales...

425
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,210
always say,
"And they lived happily ever after."

426
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,310
Then, it ends.

427
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,250
But I guess
real life isn't like that.

428
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,950
The princess has no idea,

429
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,350
but her mother is spiteful.

430
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,660
I would've done the same
if this was my daughter's business.

431
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,870
I was jealous of her,
but I began to feel bad.

432
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,840
I...

433
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,510
finally understood something
Do Hee once said clearly.

434
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,480
She must've known
about Hwang Gi Chan...

435
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,620
and Kang Se Ri's affair.

436
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,990
Gi Chan's attempt to coax...

437
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,720
and stop Ms. Do Hee
on the day of the accident...

438
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,460
might have been more than
covering up his corruption.

439
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,870
Those two...

440
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,110
may be more deeply involved
in Do Hee's death.

441
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,380
I hope the recording gets restored,

442
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,780
lifts the suspicions,
and clarifies everything.

443
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,850
It will happen.

444
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,030
Your tie...

445
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,100
is crooked.

446
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,840
Thanks.

447
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,140
Hold this.

448
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,240
May I?

449
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,230
All done.

450
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,100
Are you Designer L or Kang Jae In?

451
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,500
If you're Designer L,
then behave more properly.

452
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,240
I am both L and Kang Jae In,

453
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,270
and I've always been proper.

454
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,980
Why do you care about what I do?

455
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,580
Shall we?

456
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,870
They said it'd be done after a day or two.
Why haven't they called?

457
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,410
Do Hee.

458
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,780
I want your death
to no longer hold any injustice...

459
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,180
by exposing the entire truth,

460
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,050
so please help out your brother.

461
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:26,030
It's already time to go home.

462
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,630
- Let's go home, Do Yun.
- Okay.

463
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,330
Hello? You've reached Jung Oh Seong.

464
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,970
The file has been restored?

465
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,440
Yes, please send it over
to the e-mail address...

466
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,640
I left with you last time.

467
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:43,580
(Director Kim Do Yun)

468
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,750
Jae In, come to our office now.

469
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,560
Hey, Bo Ram.
Have you been waiting for me?

470
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,930
It began to rain,
so I had to get an umbrella.

471
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,930
Yes, I'm on my way home right now.

472
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,110
No. Director Hwang.

473
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,050
Hwang Gi Chan?

474
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,980
Please spare my life.

475
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,220
Please let me...

476
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,260
Pull yourself together.
Will you ruin everything like this?

477
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,660
Mommy?

478
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,800
Hello?

479
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,530
Hello?

480
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,570
Hwang Gi Chan...

481
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,070
and Kang Se Ri.

482
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,480
Those two were the real culprits.

483
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,030
(Queen's House)

484
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,970
Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

485
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,540
Those two were the real culprits.

486
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,340
Darn it! No!

487
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,780
Those cursed jerks.

488
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,850
It must've hurt so much.

489
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,280
Do Hee.

490
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,890
What brings you here?

491
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,390
You can eat this.

492
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,290
Are you two here to work or date?

493
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,730
It's hard to tell.

494
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,760
Gi Chan.

495
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,230
I'm doing my best
to control my feelings,

496
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,830
so don't start with me.

497
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,140
