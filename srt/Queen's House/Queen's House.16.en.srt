1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,080
(Episode 16)

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,210
(Family Physician Do Yu Gyeong)

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,900
You're here already.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,900
I'm sorry I'm late.

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:32,870
Let me catch my breath
before we leave to eat.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,050
Se Ri was worried
you'd be very distressed.

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,220
So, she suggested we get together
for a meal to lighten you up.

11
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,990
Thank you.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,960
Don't mention it.
You would've done the same for me.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,760
We're friends.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,400
Right. I always meant to give it to you,
but I kept forgetting.

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,110
What's wrong?

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,740
Nothing.
I thought your necklace was pretty.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,910
Really?

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,350
It goes with my earrings,

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,780
but I lost a piece.

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,780
It was a present from my husband,

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,150
so it made me sad.

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,520
I see.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,420
Where did you lose it?

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,320
I don't remember.

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,690
I must also be out of it these days.

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,130
So, what do you have for me?

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,860
Right.

28
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,030
I forgot to bring it again.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,840
It's nothing important.

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,190
Stop wasting your life...

31
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,490
and come to work starting tomorrow.

32
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Otherwise, I'll fire you.

33
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,790
And once you're at work,
come to my office at noon.

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,660
There's something I must tell you,

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,430
so come ready to listen
with a clear mind.

36
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,470
I'm coming in.

37
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,480
Dad.

38
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,750
Dad!

39
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,320
Dad!

40
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,790
Dad!

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,090
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

42
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,360
- Okay.
- Okay.

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,830
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,630
Are you okay, Jae In? Are you hurt?

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,970
No.

46
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,310
Seung Woo, how's Dad...

47
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,650
Aunt Mi Ran,
are we in the right room?

48
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,920
Dad... He's not here.

49
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,820
He had a heart attack,

50
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,230
so he passed away
even before he got here.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,500
What? That's impossible.
It can't be true.

52
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,270
I...

53
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,240
I saw him yesterday,
and he was completely fine.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,340
He can't suddenly...

55
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,110
This doesn't make sense. No.

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,710
Jae In.

57
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,080
It's Dad here.

58
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,680
It's him.

59
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,790
You're pregnant right now.
Don't do it.

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,860
I'm sure Father would understand.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,900
I'll only be able to believe it
only after I see him myself.

62
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,610
Jae In.

63
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,020
Dad.

64
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,460
It's me. Dad?

65
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,090
No, Dad...

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,530
Dad.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,270
You can't pass away like this.

68
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,970
No, Dad.

69
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,670
Dad, please wake up.

70
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,780
Please.

71
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,610
Please get up and say my name.

72
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,320
No, Dad.

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,190
No...

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,020
Dad...

75
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,130
Dad...

76
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,260
Okay. I'm home!

77
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,800
- Uncle Do Yun!
- Hello, my princess!

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,940
You're looking prettier
than this morning.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,340
Wash up, get changed, and come.
Let's eat dinner.

80
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,710
- Okay.
- Turn on the news.

81
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,980
YL Group's chairman...

82
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,850
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol has died.

83
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,590
He was taken to a hospital
after being found collapsed...

84
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,220
in his office.

85
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
However, the police stated
he had missed...

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,690
the critical time window to survive
and had already passed away.

87
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,000
They're still investigating
for the accurate reason of death.

88
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,530
I am the culprit's husband.

89
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,540
I sincerely apologize.

90
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,670
Bring my daughter back.

91
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,440
Bring my poor daughter back.

92
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,340
Bring her back!

93
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,040
Mr. Chairman!

94
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,250
I must've killed him.

95
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,550
He died because of me.

96
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,750
Hey, Bo Ram.

97
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,390
I'm thirsty, so can you bring me...

98
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,190
- a cup of ice-cold water?
- Okay.

99
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,460
- Thanks.
- Hey, okay. Let me give you a hand.

100
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,290
I'll go with you. Let's go.

101
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,760
When I went to the hospital
to confront the culprit,

102
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,130
I jumped on that man,

103
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,370
grabbed him by the collar,
and demanded that he bring Do Hee back.

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,040
I wasn't thinking straight
back then.

105
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,870
Come to think of it now,

106
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,580
his heart must've ached.

107
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,110
Someone by his side
helped him walk and called a doctor.

108
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,320
Goodness, I must've killed him.

109
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,550
No.

110
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,350
It wasn't your fault.

111
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,520
He collapsed at work,
so how would it be on you?

112
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,760
I heard
he always had that condition.

113
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,200
- Really?
- Yes.

114
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,500
You didn't do anything wrong.

115
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,470
Of course, you can confront him
after your girl's wrongful death.

116
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,470
And Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol
isn't free from responsibility.

117
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,410
He may be one of the people
who deserve to die.

118
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,780
Yes, okay. You're right.

119
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,520
Please don't feel guilty.

120
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,450
You didn't do anything wrong. Okay?

121
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,490
Okay.

122
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,320
- Uncle Do Yun.
- Hey.

123
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,690
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

124
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,100
Have a seat. Let's eat dinner.

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,260
Okay.

126
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,910
Last time, you said
Gi Chan was having an affair.

127
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,180
Me? No, I never said that.

128
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,050
You said it was still ongoing.

129
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Hey, pretend like
you never heard me.

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
No, you heard it wrong.

131
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,820
He's seeing my friend, right?
Kang Se Ri.

132
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,190
Yes.

133
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,090
My gosh. No.

134
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,090
Just pretend like you don't know.

135
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,290
My mom is
almost done getting rid of her.

136
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,600
Eun Ho's here. Be quiet.

137
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,770
- Uncle Gi Man, Aunt Yu Gyeong.
- Hey.

138
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,070
Where are we going?

139
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,670
We'll explain it to you
on our way there.

140
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,470
Goodness. That rich man...

141
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,140
probably only had the healthiest food
every single day.

142
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,650
Who cares if you own the world?
You can pass away overnight.

143
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,750
No one knows
what can happen to your life.

144
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,290
Hey, get changed.

145
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,600
You aren't going to a party.
What are you wearing?

146
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,130
And you, Mom.

147
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,300
I did my best to dress up
and show respect.

148
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,670
Don't be so ignorant.

149
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,510
Well, it's because
you've never been to a funeral...

150
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,070
for an affluent man like him.

151
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,940
You need to get educated.

152
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,510
It's not like you've been to one.

153
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,410
You always see affluent people
in movies and dramas,

154
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,150
and there's always a funeral scene.

155
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,320
I learned so much
from watching those.

156
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,690
Dramas and movies
all exaggerate everything.

157
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,460
- In real life...
- It's the same.

158
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,690
Don't you remember...

159
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,160
when the Queen of England died
2 to 3 years ago?

160
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,360
Everyone showed up in fancy...

161
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,960
and huge hats.

162
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,930
We're in Korea,
not the United Kingdom.

163
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,100
You look perfect.
You'll go today and show people...

164
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,040
- that you're wife material.
- Okay, Mom.

165
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,270
Good grief.

166
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,480
(The late Kang Gyu Cheol)

167
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,860
- Mommy.
- Hey.

168
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,260
Goodness, Jae In.

169
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,760
I'm sorry for your loss.

170
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,330
My gosh.

171
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,900
You look so worn out and frail.

172
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,470
Mom, you should
pay your respects first.

173
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,350
Eun Ho, you should
say goodbye to Grandpa, too.

174
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,120
Did Grandpa pass away?

175
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,960
Yes.

176
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,830
You can say goodbye
and bid him peace...

177
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,260
as he passes away.

178
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,670
You should light the incense
for all of us.

179
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,500
Father.

180
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,730
In the end, I won.

181
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,470
This is simply
survival of the fittest.

182
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,840
Do not resent me, and rest in peace.

183
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,580
I'm sorry, Father.

184
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,750
I should've been there by your side.

185
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,020
I should've paid more attention.

186
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,450
I'm so sorry, Father.

187
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,910
Hello, Yu Gyeong.

188
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,540
No, I came out to take a walk.

189
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,610
The news?

190
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,350
No, I haven't seen it.
Is something going on?

191
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,350
The chairman?

192
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,990
Yes, all right.

193
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,640
Do you feel unwell?

194
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,080
You look pale.

195
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,650
I just got a call
that someone I knew passed away.

196
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,220
He was someone I greatly admired.

197
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,350
Goodness, in that case,
you should go.

198
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,590
You can go. Don't worry about work.

199
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,060
Yes. Then, please excuse me.

200
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,540
My gosh. He looks really awful.

201
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,110
I guess he must've been
quite close to the deceased.

202
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,080
I wonder what Do Hee is doing
on the other side.

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,420
Do Hee.

204
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,120
Are you well?

205
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,560
Please be well.

206
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,460
This place has a good cook.

207
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,230
The meat is so soft and tender.
How delicious!

208
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,410
Gosh, I told you to take your time.
Were you that hungry?

209
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,510
Here.

210
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,280
Wait, why is that woman here?

211
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
She should be in prison.

212
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,020
Did she break out?

213
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,420
She must have been released temporarily.

214
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,020
What is that?

215
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,650
Mr. Kang passed away,
so she got released briefly.

216
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,080
You're a coward.

217
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,320
This was how you were going to die.

218
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,920
This was how far
you were going to live!!

219
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,590
What now?

220
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,960
You had to resolve what you did
before you died!

221
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,100
You can't die on me like this!

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,940
You broke my heart...

223
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,540
and deceived me.

224
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,840
You tortured me for life.

225
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,110
That means
you also had to live the same way!

226
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,010
Get out of that coffin now!

227
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,880
Come out now
and take responsibility!

228
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,420
Take responsibility!

229
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,350
- Mom.
- Come out!

230
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,590
People are watching!

231
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,060
Calm down, Mom.
You can stay with me.

232
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,160
How dare you touch me
with those disgusting hands?

233
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,330
Do not lay a finger on me.

234
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,170
Mom, it's me. Seung Woo.

235
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm your son.

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,140
Who's my son?

237
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,970
I never gave birth
to a son like you.

238
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,240
Mom, you need to stop.

239
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,550
Mom, what's wrong?

240
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,710
Pull it together.

241
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,520
It's me, Mom. Your son, Seung Woo.

242
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,890
Stop calling me your mother!

243
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
I do not want to hear this!

244
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,560
You were the one
who tortured me for life.

245
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,360
Do you get it?

246
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,830
Ja Young.

247
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,270
You're at a funeral.

248
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,640
Many people are watching,
so you need to stop.

249
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,600
Nothing scares me anymore, Mi Ran.

250
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,640
I don't care if people are watching.

251
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,740
What about Jae In?

252
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,610
Why won't you think of her?

253
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,880
Mom.

254
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,580
I don't know
what you're talking about.

255
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,220
Then, who am I?

256
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,920
Go ask the woman who gave you birth.

257
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,590
If you want to know who she is,

258
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,530
find your dead father and ask him.

259
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,400
Because I don't know.

260
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,600
Ja Young!

261
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,600
You're crossing the line.

262
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,210
Are you telling Seung Woo to die?

263
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,340
I couldn't care less
if he dies or not.

264
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,740
Mom, how can you not be my mom?

265
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,050
You're my mom.

266
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,550
I know how you raised me
with such care.

267
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,250
How am I not your son?

268
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,720
You even went to prison in my place.

269
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,960
Mom.

270
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,230
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

271
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,030
You must be mad because of me.

272
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,470
I'm so sorry, Mom.

273
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,830
Get your hand off me.

274
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,880
- That woman...
- Mom.

275
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,120
Don't you know your place?
How dare you act like the chief mourner?

276
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,890
Get out of here now.

277
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,360
Get lost.

278
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,530
The one who needs to leave now is...

279
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,260
you, Mom.

280
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,300
- What?
- We're at Dad's funeral.

281
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,570
Do you have any idea
how horrible you're acting?

282
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,110
Dad wouldn't want
to see you like this.

283
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,210
It'd be better if you weren't here.

284
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,050
I must have done a poor job
raising my child.

285
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,820
Every family has its own customs.

286
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,390
Does it make any sense
for you to ask me,

287
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,950
the deceased's wife...

288
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,220
and your birth mother, to leave?

289
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,330
Then, please do me a favor.

290
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,560
You can mourn him quietly.

291
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,330
Or if you want to disapprove of
and kick out every family member,

292
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,600
you can leave.

293
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,340
I agree with Jae In.

294
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,910
Stop making a scene...

295
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,440
and go
to the bereaved family's lounge...

296
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,180
or leave.

297
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,780
The choice is yours.

298
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,890
Aunt Mi Ran.

299
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,100
Seung Woo.

300
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,440
Did you know about this?

301
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,640
That I...

302
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,740
wasn't her son?

303
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,710
I only found out recently.

304
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,680
So, you knew.

305
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,120
Then, why didn't you tell me?

306
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,920
Because nothing changes.

307
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,130
You're my little brother,
no matter what anyone says.

308
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,200
That's an unchanging fact.

309
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,460
It's different.

310
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,730
Mom said
she didn't give birth to me.

311
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,240
So, how can I be
your younger brother?

312
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,740
Are we automatically not family
because we have different moms?

313
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,010
We're family.

314
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,840
Mom said...

315
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,450
she was tortured because of me.

316
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,320
She was unhappy because of me.

317
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,720
But to me, she was...

318
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,960
my only mom.

319
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,690
I'm sure she loved you.

320
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
She adored you so much.

321
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm sure...

322
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,140
it's just how much she resents Dad.

323
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,540
I think we all need some time.

324
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,110
I know this is hard,
but let's get through this. Please?

325
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,950
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,120
Seung Woo. Hey...

327
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,060
Do you feel unwell?

328
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,090
No, I'm fine.

329
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,160
I think I was too stressed out.

330
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,660
You should get some rest.

331
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,230
Were you unable to stop Seung Woo?

332
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,770
- No.
- Don't worry too much.

333
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,040
It was shocking for me, too.
It must be worse for him.

334
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,940
He'll come back once he calms down.

335
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,080
Where's my mom?

336
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,580
She wants to stay in the hall.

337
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,810
Gi Chan decided to leave.

338
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,780
You should go first.

339
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,220
I'm going out to get coffee.
You probably shouldn't have that,

340
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,120
so how about some juice?

341
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,490
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

342
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,500
Where are you?

343
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,100
Are you with Jae In?

344
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,070
I'm here at the funeral hall.

345
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,770
Yes, I should be here.
I'm her friend.

346
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,640
I'll call you back.

347
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,420
You were here.

348
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,720
I need to talk to you.

349
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,060
Stop glaring at me like that,
and talk to me. What is it?

350
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,860
Why are you here?

351
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,060
That's pretty hostile.

352
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,730
It's not like I'm banned from here.

353
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,730
I came to pay my respects
after hearing Jae In's dad passed away.

354
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,670
I'm her friend,
so isn't it only natural?

355
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,540
Natural?

356
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,810
Yes, it's natural.

357
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,670
Was that why you had an affair...

358
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,840
with her husband, Gi Chan?

359
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,240
Was that also natural?

360
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,180
Does your husband,
who gave you this, know...

361
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,820
you were having an affair
with your friend's husband?

362
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,160
You can stop there
if you want to give advice.

363
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,160
I don't want to fight you,

364
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,390
and this isn't for you to meddle in.

365
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,360
I didn't bring this up
only as Jae In's friend.

366
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,530
Jae In and Gi Chan are my family.

367
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,240
This isn't advice
but a warning as their family.

368
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,710
I heard my mother
already showered you with bones.

369
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,110
That's only the preview.

370
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,610
When the real thing begins,

371
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,380
my mother-in-law will
come at you with determination.

372
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,850
You won't make it out alive.

373
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,480
This is a piece of advice
I give you out of concern.

374
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,590
I get what you mean.

375
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,890
If you're done talking,
let's go inside.

376
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,590
You need to stop
before Jae In finds out.

377
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,260
And do not come to the funeral.

378
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,130
If you feel bad for her
and think of her as a friend,

379
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,660
you should do that.

380
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,370
At this point in time,
you don't deserve to meet...

381
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,040
both Jae In or her father.

382
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,010
Se Ri, I gave you my warning.

383
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,820
Did anything seem
out of the ordinary...

384
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,750
when you met with him one last time?

385
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,990
No, he was the same as usual.

386
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,890
What was the conversation about?

387
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,090
He had a heart attack,

388
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,200
so there was an opinion...

389
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,600
that he could've heard
something shocking.

390
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,970
It was just about business,
nothing special.

391
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,210
My father-in-law told
his secretaries to leave the area,

392
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,650
so there were no witnesses,

393
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,120
and there is no CCTV
in his office, either.

394
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,780
There's no hard evidence...

395
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,990
other than the fact
that I was in his office.

396
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,260
But it would be better
to be freed from the suspicion now.

397
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,700
As you know, he was stressed out
about our family affair recently.

398
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,330
The perpetrator deserves
all criticism,

399
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,340
but shouldn't we refrain
from blaming her family...

400
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,740
and holding them responsible?

401
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,840
I agree.

402
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,010
But the victim's family held a protest
in front of our office...

403
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,180
and even jumped on my father
to blackmail him, too.

404
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,310
So, he was sent
to the hospital a few times.

405
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,880
I see.

406
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,190
People only see articles
from the victim's side,

407
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,120
but we put up with everything
despite some discrepancies.

408
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,160
Then, something like this happened.

409
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,960
Please let me know
when everything is over.

410
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,370
You've been working so hard
since my mother-in-law's case.

411
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,240
I should thank you.

412
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,870
Let me invite you and your chief
to dinner sometime.

413
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,780
The police chief at your station...

414
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,310
had been a good friend of mine
since my days in the prosecution.

415
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,010
Goodness, I see.

416
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,420
Please leave me to it.

417
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,920
- Yes, please do that for us.
- Sure.

418
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,860
Goodness.

419
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,300
Gosh.

420
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,000
Darn it. The more I think about it,
the more furious I am.

421
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,470
I'm feeling hot.

422
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,170
What's wrong, Mom?

423
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,940
It's that crazy woman.

424
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,910
She dared to slap my son,

425
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,150
something even I wouldn't do.

426
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,020
I had to hold myself back
from wanting to pull her hair out.

427
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,390
You'd slap me anytime
and even kick me at times.

428
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,890
That family only looked fine
on the outside,

429
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,660
but in reality,
they were so dysfunctional. Jeez.

430
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,500
Wait, give me a second.

431
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,330
The chairman's position is
vacant right now.

432
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,470
If Mr. Kang had Seung Woo
out of wedlock...

433
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,500
- My goodness.
- Ouch.

434
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,070
Gi Chan may become the chairman!

435
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,810
How would that happen?

436
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,710
Jae In is around, and so is Eun Ho.

437
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,750
Gi Chan was the one
who slaved away with his in-laws.

438
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,250
It'd be great for me
if he got the position.

439
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,620
I can ask him to invest in...

440
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,120
Shut that mouth.

441
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,850
Don't ever say anything.

442
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,660
Stop thinking about ways
to ruin your brother's life,

443
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,390
and do your best
at your current business.

444
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,360
I agree with you, Mother.

445
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,240
Thanks for seeing her off.

446
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,850
- Did Bo Ram leave?
- Yes.

447
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,180
I stayed and watched the bus leave
for their excursion.

448
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,380
She was busy teasing her friends,
so she didn't even see me leaving.

449
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,550
Bo Ram will have so much fun today.

450
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,060
Controversy grows as some claim that
the death of YL Group's chairman,

451
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,590
Kang Gyu Cheol was caused...

452
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,600
by psychological pressure and stress
inflicted by the bereaved family...

453
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,030
of the victim
in the hit-and-run accident...

454
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,770
- caused by his wife, Choi Ja-young.
- How can the justice system...

455
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,200
- still favor the rich...
- According to Kang's side,

456
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,870
the bereaved family...

457
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,170
has allegedly placed
excessive blame on his family,

458
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,240
demanding accountability
from them as well.

459
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,780
Some said the bereaved family
has gone too far...

460
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,980
and may be using the situation
to pressure Kang's family...

461
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,250
for financial gain.

462
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,890
What is this? What now?

463
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,690
Do Yun.

464
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,390
What is he talking about?

465
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,860
Did the news say...

466
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,700
we killed the chairman
to get paid for Do Hee's death?

467
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,100
Mom, you can't let
your blood pressure shoot up.

468
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,200
Take a big breath.

469
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,500
I did yell at that man,

470
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,140
and yes, I felt bad for doing that.

471
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,170
But why are they saying
we wanted money instead?

472
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,040
How can Do Hee's life...

473
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,550
be converted
into any amount of money?

474
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,850
The media
doesn't always tell the truth.

475
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,120
Those people are cowardly and dirty
until the very end.

476
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,320
They're just haughty,

477
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,590
and they don't know
how scary the world is.

478
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,530
- I won't let them live.
- Uncle Oh Seong!

479
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,830
Goodness.

480
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,840
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

481
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,900
Have you reached Seung Woo?

482
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,010
He won't pick up.

483
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,780
I don't think he knows
today is the burial.

484
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,250
Your mom got her wish.

485
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,250
Don't you think this is too harsh?

486
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,620
We have to bury him
without the chief mourner.

487
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,150
I have nothing to say to you,
so move aside.

488
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,060
Move aside!

489
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,330
I want to talk to the punk
who spread false information...

490
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,390
and said my family killed
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol!

491
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,730
You people ruined...

492
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,670
the victim's family twice
by playing the media!

493
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,370
You're the real murderers
and the true evil!

494
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,210
You should go inside.
I'll talk to him.

495
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,910
Let go of me.

496
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,040
Come out!

497
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,880
Release him.

498
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,490
Don't you have
any manners or common sense?

499
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,890
This is a funeral hall.

500
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,730
YL Group was the one
that broke the common sense.

501
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,970
Do you really think
there's no one above you?

502
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,930
How dare you talk down to me...

503
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,940
as if you think I'm your underling?

504
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,810
What do you want?

505
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,140
Give me your business card.

506
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,280
I'll come and talk to you
after the funeral.

507
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,820
Are you hitting on me?

508
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,250
I have nothing to say to you.

509
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,990
Wait.

510
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,890
Were you the one
who talked nonsense to the reporters?

511
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,490
Then, that's a different story.

512
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,230
I guess
you didn't watch the morning news.

513
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,800
Choi Ja Young,
the wife of YL Group's chairman,

514
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,100
murdered Kim Do Hee,
an employee with YL Group.

515
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,140
Then, the news reported
that the chairman died...

516
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,370
of a heart attack...

517
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,680
due to the psychological pressure
from the bereaved family!

518
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,240
Were you behind that?

519
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,210
It was true that civic groups
protested every single day...

520
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,320
in front of our headquarters office
with those signs.

521
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,190
It may not be 100 percent
of the reason,

522
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,950
but it would've had an effect.

523
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,690
Are you serious?

524
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,290
My brother passed away.

525
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,000
Why would I lie?

526
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,370
It's not for any civic groups
to meddle with, so please go.

527
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,000
If you don't,
I will call the police.

528
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,670
My niece died!

529
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,010
The dead Kim Do Hee...

530
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,590
was my niece.

531
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,090
Did you see everything?

532
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,590
The dead cannot talk.

533
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,030
You can't do anything now.

534
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,270
Honey.

535
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,710
Hey, everything is ready.

536
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,480
Did you tell the media...

537
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,710
that the victim's family
caused my dad's death?

538
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,680
I didn't tell the media.
I told the detective.

539
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,520
Why did you say that?

540
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,520
The victim's family
didn't do anything wrong.

541
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,190
I was just sharing the fact.

542
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,490
They should confront Mother,
the actual perpetrator,

543
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,190
but they held a protest
at our office instead.

544
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,560
Haven't you considered
how stressful it must've been...

545
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,730
for Father?

546
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,790
I get what you mean, but...

547
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,960
Your father passed away.

548
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,600
Whose side are you on?

549
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,930
Don't be too nice for your own good.

550
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,290
Did something bad happen?

551
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
No, I just feel down.

552
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,570
Did you go to the funeral
two days ago?

553
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,740
Today must be the burial.

554
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,110
You should go.
You said you two were close.

555
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,980
You should be there with the deceased
in the final moment.

556
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,320
I didn't go to the funeral.

557
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,590
I'll put this in the kitchen.

558
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,530
That man
must have a story to tell, too.

559
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:02,300
Well, I guess
everyone has a story to tell.

560
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,570
Gosh, I'm so tired.

561
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,170
I'd end up dead
if I had to bury anyone twice.

562
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,940
Why was his grave
so high up in the mountain?

563
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,040
Gosh, what if I get knots
in my calves?

564
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,280
Why did I put on high heels?

565
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,850
Go and see who that is.

566
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,690
You can go. I'm tired.

567
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,990
Come on.

568
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,270
What? Hey, Mom.

569
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,670
What is it now?

570
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,540
It's...

571
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,110
How dare you come here?

572
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,080
Didn't you hear what I said?

573
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,380
Ms. Noh, he's your grandson.

574
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,490
Please meet him.

575
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,520
Ji Ho, she's your grandmother.

576
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,520
Hello, Grandma.

577
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,210
(Queen's House)

578
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,450
Mi Ran, you've never had any food
at a detention center, right?

579
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,980
You can't even imagine
a huge feast like this in there.

580
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,290
Aren't you worried about Seung Woo?

581
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,490
We can't reach him,

582
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,120
and we have no idea where he is
after he left the funeral hall.

583
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,720
Why should I be worried?

584
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,190
He's not my child.

585
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,330
How old are you?

586
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,660
I'm six years old.

587
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,400
No way. It began before the wedding?

588
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,970
And this.

589
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,970
Why are you giving me this?

590
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,810
If your father had been alive,

591
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,240
he would've given you this
to celebrate with you.

592
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,580
It suddenly came to me.

593
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,610
Celebrate?
