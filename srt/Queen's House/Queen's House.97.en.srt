00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,240
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,940
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,380
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,650
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan
blackmailed me...

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,420
into spying on Ms. Choi Ja Young
and Designer Kang Jae In.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,820
He told me to steal her designs,

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,490
but I told
Designer Kang Jae In everything...

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,060
and spied on
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan instead.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,900
I recorded him every time we met,

10
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,670
and everything I'm saying right now
is backed up by evidence.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,740
So I was the one being spied on
all along?

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,980
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan is behind
the fraud case...

13
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,190
and the false sexual assault accusation.

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,390
Well, I am...

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,600
a lawyer who has worked here
since Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol's day.

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,100
I was Ms. Choi Ja Young's lawyer
in her case,

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,440
but on Chairman Hwang's orders,

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,270
I swindled Ms. Choi Ja Young
out of her entire fortune...

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,440
and handed it all over to him.

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,010
- What? Hwang Gi Chan again?
- What? What is this?

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,880
That's crazy.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,690
I am the employee...

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,790
who wrongly accused
Director Kim Do Yun of sexual assault.

24
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,290
(Director Kim Do Yun)

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,860
Kang Jae In convinced me
to come forward today,

26
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,430
and the one who ordered me to frame
Kim Do Yun as a sex offender...

27
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,600
was also Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,680
There's also a video that's a lead
on Chairman Hwang's embezzlement.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,580
My name is Hwang Gi Man,

30
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,620
and I'm the older brother
of YL's chairman, Hwang Gi Chan.

31
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,490
I borrowed money from many people,
claiming it was for investments,

32
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,090
and most of that money...

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,730
was paid back by my younger brother,
Hwang Gi Chan.

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,670
But I doubt he had that kind of cash
lying around.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,000
I wonder if he dipped into
the company's funds.

36
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,210
Where did he get the money...

37
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,010
to keep paying off
his brother's massive debts?

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,880
Could it be that he dipped
into company funds?

39
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,450
The statements
in Hwang Gi Man's video expose...

40
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,550
were also true.

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,230
Regarding the establishment of
the overseas factory,

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,630
I had to resign over allegations
of a double contract.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,100
I'm sure you all remember
that incident.

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,040
The culprit is none other than
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

45
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,210
(YL Group
Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting)

46
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,510
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan used
H and K Company,

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,650
a partner company for
the overseas factory project,

48
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,080
to embezzle company funds
and create a slush fund,

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,890
and then he framed me for it.

50
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,660
H and K Company...

51
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,890
was involved as a partner...

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,830
in most of
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's projects,

53
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,100
and we've also secured evidence
of dirty money funneled through it.

54
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,970
Just knowing who Catherine is,
the CEO of H and K Company,

55
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,810
makes the picture clear.

56
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,750
Catherine is Chairman Hwang's
mistress-turned-wife,

57
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,210
Kang Se Ri.

58
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,020
That's not true!

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,450
I've had enough of these lies.
There's a limit to your slander!

60
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,160
Do you have any proof
that I'm Catherine?

61
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,790
You don't have any!

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Why not tell them, Secretary Yoon?
You're his right-hand man.

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,470
Catherine, CEO of H and K Company,
is indeed Kang Se Ri.

64
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,680
While I was working as secretary
to Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,

65
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,480
I overheard them discussing
H and K Company...

66
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,950
countless times.

67
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,650
I am a witness.

68
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,250
Even if I am Catherine,

69
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,830
that's not proof that Chairman Hwang
embezzled money via H and K Company!

70
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,860
H and K Company...

71
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,500
is a legitimate partner
of the YL Group!

72
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,770
Do you have the double contract?

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,430
If you're going to talk nonsense
about having seen it...

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Then have a look.

75
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,510
Proof of Chairman Hwang Gi Chan's
embezzlement via H and K Company,

76
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,180
the double contract.

77
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,420
I told you.

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,650
That I would find it,
no matter what.

79
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,660
The first to discover this truth
and launch an investigation...

80
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,470
was the victim
of the hit-and-run accident.

81
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,640
Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee.

82
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,940
My sister.

83
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,450
The one who killed my sister,
Do Hee, in that hit-and-run...

84
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,280
was that man, Hwang Gi Chan.

85
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,580
That's not true.

86
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,920
- Tell them it's not true, Honey!
- As the victim's family,

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,090
we've already secured and submitted
key evidence to the authorities,

88
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,060
and an investigation into
Hwang Gi Chan is now underway.

89
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,200
If you had concrete evidence,
he would've been arrested by now.

90
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,200
But that's not the case, is it?

91
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,140
The investigation is
a matter for the authorities.

92
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,740
Let's proceed with what
we're here to do.

93
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,510
Yes. In that case,

94
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,180
we will now vote on the motion
to dismiss Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

95
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,690
(YL Group
Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting)

96
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,930
As a result of the vote, the motion
to dismiss Chairman Hwang Gi Chan...

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,330
(Chairman Park Dong Heon)

98
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,570
has passed.

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,460
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,790
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

101
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,400
Your Jae In obsession blinded you.
And look! This is what it's come to.

102
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,300
I told you to be prepared for this!

103
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,740
I told you to do whatever it takes
not to lose this seat,

104
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,640
that you had to protect it!

105
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,410
Then what am I supposed to do?

106
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,780
You don't know?

107
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,310
Do whatever it takes to get it back!

108
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,450
- I guess it wasn't meant for me.
- It is yours!

109
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,390
It's our company!
The one we took over together!

110
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,090
I couldn't see it
when I was blinded.

111
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,160
But now that my desperation is gone,

112
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
everything is clear,
as if a fog has lifted.

113
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,500
Now I finally see everything.

114
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,770
I thought you kept telling me
to take over YL Group for my sake.

115
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,910
But it was all for you.

116
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,080
To satisfy your own greed.

117
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,910
You needed me in this position.

118
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,080
- You just needed me, Hwang Gi Chan.
- That's not true.

119
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,220
It's because I love you
that I want you to be at the top.

120
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,590
Why can't you understand how I feel?

121
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,960
- Stop it. It's already over.
- It's not over.

122
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,630
How can it be over?

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Think about Ji Ho! Your son, Ji Ho!

124
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,700
I'll take care of Ji Ho's future
on my own.

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,440
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

126
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,610
Right! I knew you'd have a plan.

127
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,180
There's no way you'd lose everything
just like this.

128
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,850
You can't,
especially for Ji Ho's sake.

129
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,150
I'm counting on you.

130
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,820
Get out.

131
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,890
Jae In, we finally did it.
This was all you.

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,300
You were a huge help too.

133
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,930
The double contract was
the smoking gun.

134
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,400
The credit goes to
Ms. Kim Do Hee, not me.

135
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,340
The old me would've just deleted it
without knowing what it was.

136
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,110
I feel like Ms. Kim
put her trust in me.

137
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,810
This was a group effort from you two
and everyone else.

138
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,650
Jae In.

139
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,320
While you prepare for the election
of the new chairman,

140
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,490
think about how you're going to lead
YL Group...

141
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,330
and just prepare yourself
for what's to come.

142
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,830
If Jae In can't be chair right away,
the post will be empty. What then?

143
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,770
We'll be in emergency management
for the time being.

144
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,470
Until the new chairman
is inaugurated,

145
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,980
I'll take full responsibility
and make sure no problems arise.

146
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,380
So don't worry about a thing
and just focus on your work.

147
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,350
Okay, I will.

148
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,850
I'm glad the motion to dismiss
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan passed.

149
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,290
I was worried,
but I'm relieved it went smoothly.

150
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,990
We've only clipped the wings
of Hwang Gi Chan and Kang Se Ri.

151
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,160
What comes next is
what's truly important.

152
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,730
To take them down completely,
H and K Company is still a problem.

153
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,370
That's right. Even with
H and K Company's slush fund,

154
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,970
those two will be able
to live comfortably.

155
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,310
We have to find a way to cut off
H and K Company's cash flow.

156
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,940
There must be a way.

157
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,620
I believe I may have found it.

158
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,460
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

159
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,190
You rushed out of town yesterday.
Did everything go well?

160
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,430
Yes.

161
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,300
Didn't you say you thought
you found a way?

162
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,510
Today, YL Group's chairman
Hwang Gi Chan has been dismissed.

163
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,740
Following a series of reputational risks
involving its owner,

164
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,510
and with Chairman Hwang named
a suspect in numerous crimes,

165
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,610
YL Group stated he could no longer
be trusted in his position.

166
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,920
The group called it
a drastic corporate measure.

167
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,660
What? Who do they think they are,
firing the chairman, the top dog?

168
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,930
Just one after another.
What is all this?

169
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,140
Gi Chan was fired as chairman.
As his secretary, I was fired too.

170
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,970
And apparently, our sister-in-law
was fired too.

171
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,710
They're a married couple,
so they're a package deal too.

172
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,480
You all came home jobless
the same day the chairman was fired?

173
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,550
They fire you, and you just take it?

174
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,090
You should've refused to leave!

175
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,050
- You should have held your ground!
- Holding our ground wouldn't work.

176
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,090
It would've just been pathetic.

177
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,500
Who cares if it gets ugly?
You think people in high places...

178
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,660
got there by playing nice?

179
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,430
Getting your hands dirty is nothing
if you want to keep your money.

180
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,710
Even if I'm not the chairman,
I'll provide for you and the family,

181
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:15,810
so don't worry.

182
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,580
Don't be like that.
Just go back there right now and...

183
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm back.

184
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,220
Should I leave and come back in?

185
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,920
No, it's fine. Get some rest.

186
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,090
Oh, I'm so frustrated! My gosh.

187
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,400
What am I going to do?

188
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,300
Oh, I'm just so frustrated.

189
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,010
I'm so glad your father...

190
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,740
can finally rest in peace.

191
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,820
Mom, just wait a little longer.

192
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,150
I'm going to get back everything
that Hwang and Kang Se Ri took.

193
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,760
Not just the company,
but the house and the gallery.

194
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,060
Jae In. I'm scared.

195
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,430
I'm terrified of what Kang Se Ri
might do to you.

196
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,900
If you get hurt like that too...

197
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,170
Like what?
Mom, what are you talking about?

198
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,410
It's nothing.
You don't need to know.

199
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,710
Did Kang Se Ri threaten you?
Did she threaten to kill me?

200
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,920
Mom, don't let her get to you.

201
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,190
I'm not going to die.
That will absolutely never happen.

202
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,060
Look at me now.
I got the company back on my own.

203
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,300
- But still...
- What did Kang Se Ri say to you?

204
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,570
How can I be careful
if I don't know what she said?

205
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,570
Hwang Gi Man getting hurt.

206
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,610
I saw it.

207
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,680
Him, lying at the bottom
of the stairs, covered in blood.

208
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,710
Kang Se Ri...

209
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,290
The accident Hwang Gi Man had
on the stairs...

210
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,990
was Kang Se Ri's doing?

211
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,960
Mom, tell me everything.

212
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
I'm hungry.

213
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,740
Jae In. When did you get here?

214
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,610
We should have dinner.
Let's eat together.

215
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,830
Oh Seong, what are you doing?
I said, don't bring her here again!

216
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Yun Hee.

217
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,910
We even registered our marriage.
We're legally a married couple now.

219
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,140
I cleaned out the small room for you
to use, and this is what you do?

220
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,910
Why ask if you'll do what you want?

221
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,050
You're married. Get your own place.

222
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,420
- Why did you move in here?
- It was my idea.

223
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,320
I wanted to be closer to you
and learn to run a household.

224
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,460
And I wanted to live together
as a family.

225
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,860
I also want to make up
for my past mistakes.

226
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,670
I don't want to hear it.
Just stop talking and leave.

227
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,870
Grandma, what's wrong?

228
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,850
I'll let it slide for today
since she's here.

229
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,720
But pack your bags
and get out tomorrow. Both of you.

230
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,090
Bo Ram.

231
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:53,460
It's nothing.
Come on, let's go to bed.

232
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,930
Okay.

233
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,230
Are you sure you're okay?

234
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,740
We could move out, as she suggested.

235
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,710
What are you talking about?
I said I'll stay till she approves.

236
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,950
This time, I'm going
to prove my sincerity to her.

237
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
So,

238
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,180
where's our room?

239
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,360
Goodness, all this registered mail?
What is all this?

240
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,870
From Kim Do Yun of DH Holdings
for false accusation,

241
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,400
assault, and a claim for damages?

242
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,240
Let me see.

243
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,040
Is this from YL Group too?

244
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,110
For the new business group...

245
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,920
and repayment of personal loans,

246
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,750
and a penalty fee
for damaging the group's reputation?

247
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,190
They're just after your money,
aren't they?

248
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,360
What's all the commotion
about this morning?

249
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,300
This wasn't planned overnight
to take you down.

250
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,910
They planned to send certifications,
the criminal complaint,

251
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,710
and even demand letters for payment.
They sent everything at once.

252
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,810
Watch your mouth.

253
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,520
It seems your hands are full.

254
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,990
I almost feel bad for just
going about my own business.

255
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,490
Not at all.
When will the gallery pieces sell?

256
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,670
I'll know after the appraisal.
I'll set a time with the buyer...

257
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,440
and get the ball rolling right away.
Well, then.

258
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,270
Oh, dear, what are we going to do?

259
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,810
What are we going to do?

260
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,410
The art money will cover us for now.
So don't worry.

261
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,550
Follow me.

262
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,350
Withdraw the entire slush fund
from the H and K Company account.

263
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,420
All of it?

264
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,530
They're already onto us.
If they start tracing the account,

265
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,960
the funds'll freeze, and we're done.
Even if we sell the art to fix it,

266
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,100
we still need money to live on.

267
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,800
It's all been withdrawn?

268
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,310
What did you do?
Catherine, it says you withdrew it.

269
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,510
- It wasn't me.
- What do you mean, it wasn't you?

270
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,250
It says right here the withdrawal
was made under your name, Catherine.

271
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,480
It must be some kind of error.

272
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,920
Yes, there has to be a mistake.

273
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,850
I'll check when the US banks open.

274
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,420
I can't confirm anything until then.

275
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,070
So we hit them with the complaint
and the works first thing?

276
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,900
Of course.
We at DH Holdings gave them our all.

277
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,210
The legal fees to handle all those
lawsuits alone will be astronomical.

278
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Good morning.

279
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,450
About the second round...
Did everything go okay?

280
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,920
Yes, I confirmed the deposit.

281
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,520
Please tell your sister
I said thank you.

282
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,930
I found Catherine.

283
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,100
So you're saying
you found the real Catherine?

284
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,270
Yes. My sister, Catherine.

285
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,570
I never imagined she was in Korea,

286
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,470
but she was here all along.

287
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,270
It looks like she was
in a serious accident.

288
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,580
She's been hospitalized
at a state-run facility,

289
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,050
and she's woken up.

290
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,150
I thought you two were separated
as children.

291
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,820
Are you sure it's your sister?

292
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,080
We did a DNA test.

293
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,750
She's my sister.

294
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,820
Congratulations.

295
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,830
You missed your sister so much.
I'm so glad you found her.

296
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,500
The key to cutting off
H and K Company's funding.

297
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,070
My sister holds the key.

298
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,510
If I can get power of attorney
from Catherine,

299
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,380
I should be able to take control of
H and K Company, right?

300
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,850
That's right.

301
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,620
Because Kang Se Ri is using the name
of your sister, Catherine.

302
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,620
All that Se Ri built as Catherine,
the real Catherine can take it all.

303
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,430
I'll have my lawyer
get on it right away.

304
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,270
It seems like you really are
my Lady Luck, Jae In.

305
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,270
After meeting you,
things worked out eight years ago,

306
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,840
and this time, I found my son,

307
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,480
and I was even able to find
my sister.

308
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,710
- Thank you.
- I hardly did anything.

309
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,980
I'm the lucky one
for meeting you, Teo.

310
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:50,190
But the assets were all accumulated
in your sister's name.

311
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,920
Are you sure you want to give it all
to me?

312
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,060
As long as it's used to punish
those terrible people,

313
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,030
I'm more than okay with it.

314
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,730
And to be precise,
it's YL Group's money, isn't it?

315
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,440
So we have
one last KO punch left, right?

316
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,280
That's right. Time for
our player to enter the ring.

317
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,780
I'm all in on you, Teo.

318
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,080
Me too.

319
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,760
And you, Director Kim Do Yun?
Are you not placing a bet?

320
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,600
Of course,
I'm betting on you too, Teo.

321
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,460
You almost hurt my feelings.

322
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,300
All right then,

323
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,340
let's step into the ring.

324
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,840
She's alive?

325
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,480
Why now, of all times?

326
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,580
What's going on? What did they say?

327
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,390
They say the real Catherine
is alive.

328
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,520
Catherine withdrew all the money.

329
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,220
What are you talking about?

330
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,790
Isn't your English name Catherine?

331
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,400
Don't tell me...

332
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,940
you've been using a stolen identity?

333
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,840
Is that it?

334
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,970
There must be some kind of mistake.

335
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,040
How could someone who's been gone
for over 20 years just...

336
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,450
Lee Teo?

337
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
Lee Teo?

338
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,350
What's that supposed to mean?

339
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,590
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan,
where are you?

340
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,230
What do you think you're doing?

341
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,410
That's what I'd like to ask you.
How could you deceive me?

342
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,510
Do you take me for a fool?

343
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,410
Chairman, I never would've expected
this from you.

344
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,110
How could you even think
of selling me forgeries?

345
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,220
Were you trying to tarnish
my reputation and my career?

346
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,650
Why don't you start by explaining
what on earth you're talking about?

347
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,250
What do you mean, forgeries?

348
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,390
The pieces you handed over to me,

349
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,590
they're all forgeries!

350
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,040
(Appraisal Report)

351
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,710
The paintings at JY Gallery he owns
are actually worth a fortune.

352
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,680
He heavily invested in paintings
to create a slush fund.

353
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,050
So now, what he will get back
won't be valuable paintings...

354
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,420
but worthless scraps of paper.

355
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,650
- What do we do?
- We have to switch them.

356
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,260
By swapping, you mean replacing them
with forgeries?

357
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,500
Yes.
We'll return them to the true owner.

358
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,230
No. They can't be forgeries.

359
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,870
I had appraisers confirm
their authenticity.

360
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,210
Hey, what's all the commotion?
I can't even take a nap.

361
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,580
I had the country's best appraisers
double-check this result for me.

362
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,280
I couldn't believe it myself.

363
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,060
If you are right, Chairman,
then everyone else here is lying.

364
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,230
Why not get them appraised yourself
to see if I'm lying?

365
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,500
That would be better, wouldn't it?

366
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,140
Appraisals this, double that...
What does any of it mean?

367
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,880
He's saying all the paintings
are fakes.

368
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,210
What?

369
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,620
My goodness.
What is all this nonsense?

370
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,750
What do you mean, fakes?

371
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,620
Are you telling me all my paintings
are fakes?

372
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,090
Are you saying these have no value,
just worthless scraps of paper?

373
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
Yes.

374
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,330
Are you an art dealer or what?
You're a con artist, aren't you?

375
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,930
After all that talk about selling
paintings worth millions of dollars.

376
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,970
There's having a bad eye for art,
and then there's this.

377
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,570
Mother, that's enough.

378
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,680
Darn it!
How can you stand there and take it?

379
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,010
There must be some kind of
misunderstanding.

380
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,780
All the pieces are authentic.
I even have the authenticity certificates.

381
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,020
Did it ever occur to you that
the certificates could be forgeries?

382
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,220
Regardless of whether they're real
or not, one thing is certain.

383
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,660
I can no longer sell the paintings
you entrusted to me, Chairman Hwang.

384
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,430
There's an issue of trust.

385
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,760
First, just give me some time.

386
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,600
I'll look into it myself.

387
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,480
Oh, my gosh. What is happening?
Oh, dear.

388
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,910
Oh, my head. Oh, dear.

389
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,850
Oh, my.

390
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,080
No, I just... Oh, dear.

391
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,970
I'm going to tear you to shreds.

392
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,810
Don't you dare think you'll die
a peaceful death.

393
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,040
You don't deserve to die like that.

394
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,610
I won't let you go that easily.

395
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,650
You're so confident
you know everything, aren't you?

396
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,090
You're probably convinced
you have it all figured out.

397
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,020
But is that really true?

398
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,090
That's just your delusion
and arrogance.

399
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,330
To me, the one who loved you,

400
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,800
to my family, and to my dad,

401
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,570
and to our Eun Ho!

402
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,930
Look at what you've done.

403
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,600
So you were just a piece of trash
all along.

404
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,470
I'm going to throw you in the trash
where you belong,

405
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,210
so you just wait.

406
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,840
H and K Company.
That was your doing, wasn't it?

407
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,710
Catherine is your sister, isn't she?

408
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,050
What are you talking about?

409
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,580
Catherine withdrew all the money
from my account!

410
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,220
Have you found Catherine?

411
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Have you?

412
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,050
- Where's Catherine? Where is she?
- Kang Se Ri.

413
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,390
If it's Catherine's account,
then it's her money.

414
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,930
How can you call it yours?

415
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,200
So it was your doing all along,
wasn't it?

416
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,570
Was that you
with the paintings, too?

417
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,400
Why on earth would you do all this?

418
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,010
Is this because of Kang Jae In?

419
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,740
What does Kang Jae In have to do
with me?

420
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,550
I'm suing you for fraudulently using
my sister's name,

421
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,780
so you'd better get yourself
an expensive lawyer.

422
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,720
What am I going to do?

423
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,190
What do I do? What am I going to do?

424
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,230
After all I've been through
to become Kang Jae In.

425
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,670
I can't let it all fall apart
like this.

426
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,370
Money. I need money.

427
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,180
That's it.

428
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,950
This house.

429
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,120
I know I put it on the market
for a quick sale,

430
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,250
but I didn't expect a buyer
to turn up so quickly.

431
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,720
It's a prime location, isn't it?

432
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,890
By the way, the buyer's rep
will be handling the contract.

433
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,660
The actual buyer
is currently living overseas.

434
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,230
You said the buyer is Anna Wang,
a Chinese-American, right?

435
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
That's right.

436
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,110
I hear she's an investor
with massive cash reserves.

437
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,680
(Number One Jackpot Real Estate Office)

438
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,180
(Cashier's check:
5.5 million dollars)

439
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,250
All right.

440
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,650
Gi Chan is all washed up now anyway.

441
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,220
Ji Ho and I need to survive
with this money, at the very least.

442
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,760
Ma'am, this check is a forgery.

443
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,800
It was never issued by our bank.

444
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
What?

445
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,300
My money.

446
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,710
(Daeyang Bank)

447
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,020
Give me my money!
My five million dollars!

448
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,090
Give it to me now! Right now!

449
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,000
What are you doing?
I owe you nothing. Why the scene?

450
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,170
Where is he?

451
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,800
I'm not talking about you!
There was someone else working here!

452
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,900
If you mean the part-timer,

453
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,170
he quit just a little while ago.
He said something came up.

454
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,040
No way. You're lying.

455
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,280
You think I don't know
you're all in on this scam together?

456
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,980
Don't accuse an innocent person.

457
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,750
Look, I don't know anything,
so just leave.

458
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,150
I'm not leaving
until I get my money back!

459
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,990
Go get my money!

460
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,390
I said, go get it right now!

461
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Good grief.

462
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,830
Then call the police!
Let's do this by the book!

463
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,430
I don't know the first thing
about this,

464
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,830
so let's do this by the book!

465
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,190
The sellers insist they're authentic
and have proof of authenticity,

466
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,530
so we'll have to compare them
to the originals.

467
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,870
This probably won't be resolved
anytime soon.

468
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,870
I think you'll need to find a place
to stay, like a hotel or somewhere.

469
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,440
Wouldn't that be easier
for both of us?

470
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,010
Fine.

471
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,910
But before that,
I have something to say.

472
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,460
(Petition for Paternity Confirmation
and Custody)

473
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,300
You're Ji Ho's...

474
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,370
So you knew Ji Ho wasn't
your biological son.

475
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,170
Then that makes things easier.

476
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
Yes.

477
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,440
Ji Ho is my son.

478
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,980
And I'm taking him with me.

479
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,290
However, since it seems
you've fallen on hard times,

480
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,690
if you'd like, as a token of thanks
for raising him all this time,

481
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,660
I am willing to offer you
financial support.

482
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
I don't need your support.

483
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,970
You may be his biological father,

484
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,400
but Ji Ho is my son.

485
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,770
I came to this house for one reason.

486
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,780
It was to see if my son, Ji Ho,
was in a good home...

487
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,550
and to make sure he was
growing up healthy.

488
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:26,720
If he was, I was planning to leave
without any fuss.

489
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,420
I'm well aware that you raised Ji Ho
as your own son,

490
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,860
and that the only father
he's ever known...

491
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,190
is you, Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

492
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,800
And yet, you still intend to tear
a father and son apart?

493
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,500
Haven't you seen Kang Se Ri
for who she really is by now?

494
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,570
Being raised by a woman like that,

495
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,410
do you think that's what's best
for Ji Ho?

496
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,710
If you truly love Ji Ho and have
his best interests at heart,

497
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,350
what's the right thing to do?

498
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,920
I'll give you a few days
if you need time to think,

499
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,030
but once we go to court,
I have no intention of backing down.

500
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,590
I've said my piece.

501
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Hwang Gi Chan.

502
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,480
What in the world do you really know
about Kang Se Ri?

503
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,430
What do you think you're doing here?

504
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,000
Who let you in?

505
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,270
I did.

506
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,500
None of you has even packed
your things.

507
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,900
What are you all still doing
in my house?

508
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,010
What are you talking about?
How is this your house? It's ours!

509
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,580
Noh Sook Ja,

510
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,150
I take it you didn't know
your daughter-in-law sold the house?

511
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,090
What?

512
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,260
- What are you talking about?
- No...

513
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,300
Now that we're all clear,
everyone get out of my house.

514
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,570
Wait...

515
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,870
Gi Chan, hurry up
and call Ji Ho's mother.

516
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,240
I'm going to lose my mind.

517
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,380
Do you really have to go this far?

518
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,810
This far?

519
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,250
Hwang Gi Chan, and just how far
did you go with what you did to me?

520
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,380
If you don't want to be dragged out,

521
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,450
get out of my house right now.

522
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,490
No way! Who says it's your house?
That contract is null and void!

523
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,430
Drag all of this trash
out of my house.

524
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,600
And every last one
of their belongings too!

525
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,080
(Queen's House)

526
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,420
Drag all of this trash
out of my house.

527
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,450
And every last one
of their belongings too!

528
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,090
The buyer's name is Kang Jae In?

529
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,260
Are you really not hiding
a single thing from me?

530
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,330
Nothing, I swear!

531
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,000
Whose son Ji Ho is...

532
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,230
Do I have to be the one to say it?

533
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,700
Is something wrong?

534
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,440
It's Hwang Gi Chan.
He has terminal stomach cancer.

535
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:11,510
A year left to live, at most.

536
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,880
Dad.

537
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,850
The house you left for me.

538
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,280
I've finally gotten it back.

539
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
