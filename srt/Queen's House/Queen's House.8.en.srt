1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,270
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,510
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,350
(Hello, Ms. Choi. It's me, Se Ri.
I'm sending you...)

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,360
(Mr. Hwang's pictures
just as you wanted.)

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,990
This should be enough to make her believe
I wasn't the other woman.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,400
Hey, Se Ri.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,500
Hey, Jae In.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,800
- Are you going out?
- Yes, I have a meeting outside.

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,810
You can go ahead
with that project as planned.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,840
You two can grab a quick cup of tea,

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,750
but it's still working hours,
so use your discretion.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,350
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,420
- Okay.
- Bye, then.

15
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,790
You said your husband had
an uneasy stomach.

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,090
Did he get better?

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,690
Stomach conditions are
very susceptible to stress, right?

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,760
He'd get better,
but then he'd relapse right away.

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,830
I can only be honest
about this with you,

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,400
but my mom has been playing
a huge role lately.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,170
It'd be hard for a woman like her
to grow to like him again.

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,610
Look what happened to me.

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,140
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,840
I gave her a reason, anyway.

25
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,220
Anyway, his stomach will
take a huge toll...

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,580
if he continues to get stressed out.

27
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,720
It'll damage his memories, too.

28
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,490
Do you want me to refer you
to an oriental doctor?

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,150
An oriental doctor?

30
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,290
My husband also has a weak stomach
whenever he's stressed out.

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,590
The doctor is famous
among Korean expats,

32
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,230
so I got referred
and got my husband some medicine,

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,030
and his condition really got better.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,600
It was just like what you see
when you water dry plants.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,700
He came back alive.

36
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,340
Gosh, but I can't travel
all the way to America...

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,970
No, the doctor is in Korea.

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,770
The doctor is so famous that
people have it delivered internationally.

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,140
I'm sure you can have the medicine
within the day if you go now.

40
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,150
Where's the clinic?

41
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,580
I sent you the address
and the contact information.

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,690
I should call the clinic for you.

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,960
Thank you.

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,690
I should go before it's too late.

45
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,790
Tell your husband
it was from your mother.

46
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,430
- What?
- People say a son-in-law...

47
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,460
needs love from his mother-in-law.

48
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,400
Men are simpler than you think,

49
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,930
so he'll believe you if you say so.

50
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,640
You're right.

51
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,010
It's great to have you nearby.
I can share these troubles with you.

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,040
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

53
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,310
Run along. You won't be able to
get it today if you're too late.

54
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,610
- All right. I'll call you.
- Okay.

55
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,450
- Bye.
- Bye.

56
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,790
She's so slow.

57
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,160
Hey, Yu Gyeong. It's me.

58
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,030
Have you been well?

59
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,740
I didn't see you last time
when we all met as couples.

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,940
I wanted to check in with you.

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,110
You know...

62
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,740
your father quit his job, right?

63
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,310
(Application for the Confirmation
of Divorce by Consent)

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,380
You need to divorce Jae In
immediately.

65
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,520
Why are you suddenly doing this?

66
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,160
How shameless.

67
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,460
Are you telling me to say
such a disgusting and vulgar thing?

68
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,950
What do you think you're doing?

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,180
How dare you
brazenly raise your voice at me?

70
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,890
Ms. Kim, let me apologize
on her behalf.

71
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,420
Do you feel that bad for her?

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,560
Have you any shame?

73
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,900
You should be ashamed right now,
not me.

74
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,430
You do not treat an employee like this
in this day and age.

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,500
This can snowball
if someone outside finds out.

76
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,300
It'll have
the worst impact on YL Group.

77
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,370
Do not let this get any bigger.
You need to apologize.

78
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,080
If you knew that,
why did you go out and sleep around?

79
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,140
Is that my mom?

80
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,910
You two need to apologize!

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,720
What are you talking about?

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,460
She mistook me
as your woman on the side.

83
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,890
Ms. Kim, are you dating me?

84
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,200
- I'm asking you!
- No.

85
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,370
I already told you
it wasn't the case.

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,940
Did you come here to corner me...

87
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,140
without any evidence
before you checked the facts...

88
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,170
to give me this?

89
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,610
Did you want
to pull me away from Jae In?

90
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,310
Does Father know about this?

91
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,280
Does Jae In know?

92
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,320
That is the evidence.

93
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,430
Have you been digging up my back?

94
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,200
And do you call this evidence?

95
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,100
Is it a crime to discuss business?

96
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,570
You sent pictures...

97
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,010
of you two in bed to Jae In
as if you wanted her to know.

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,410
Do not try to deny this.

99
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,510
Who did?

100
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,050
If she had seen it,
she wouldn't have sat around.

101
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,710
Of course, she didn't see it.

102
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,420
I didn't want her to get shocked,
so I deleted everything.

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,820
Do you want hard evidence?

104
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,560
It's this bracelet.

105
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,430
I saw a hand with this bracelet...

106
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,070
sitting on top of your bare chest
with my own two eyes!

107
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,440
How disgusting.

108
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,340
I do not want Jae In to see
something this sickening,

109
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,910
so divorce her immediately!

110
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,650
Let me make myself clear.

111
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,650
Ms. Kim and I are...

112
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,480
only colleagues at work,
nothing more, nothing less.

113
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,120
Stop acting unreasonably.

114
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,520
Unreasonably?

115
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,390
Did you just tell me
to stop acting unreasonably?

116
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,630
- You.
- Mom, we're at work.

117
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,530
What if Dad finds out?

118
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,800
I warned you and said...

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,430
you'd be tortured in this life
if what you said was a lie.

120
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,540
Just wait.

121
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,940
Mom, you have to go.

122
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,310
You must've met
with my mother-in-law.

123
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,050
You should've denied this
then and there.

124
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,880
Is this your way of blackmailing me?

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,850
I denied it to her.

126
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,920
But you forgot something.

127
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,960
I clearly know
I'm not involved in this with you,

128
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,730
but the charges are true for you.

129
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,230
Do you know
who gave me this bracelet?

130
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,100
Your woman on the side, Catherine.

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,540
You probably get why she went
out of her way to put it on my wrist.

132
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,010
Forget what you did at work.

133
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,040
I ended up getting framed
for something I didn't do.

134
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,280
Did you ask
if I were blackmailing you?

135
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,850
I'll start doing that now.

136
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,420
Confess everything you did wrong...

137
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,290
and have Ms. Choi apologize to me.

138
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,020
- Ms. Kim.
- Otherwise,

139
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,430
I'll publicize this to the company
and demand a public apology.

140
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,330
You have one day.

141
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,420
Where are you?

142
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,620
Are you sure she went out?

143
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,360
She just called and said
she'd go home straight from there.

144
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,360
Did you miss me that much?

145
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,630
What is this?

146
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,300
Why do you have the bracelet
I gave Ms. Kim?

147
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,500
She found out I was Catherine
and threatened me, so I gave it to her.

148
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,510
What pictures
did you send to my wife?

149
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,510
What pictures?
I never sent her any pictures.

150
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,010
Tell me the truth!

151
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,310
My mother-in-law is furious
because of this bracelet.

152
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,350
What pictures did you send her?

153
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,920
I don't know
what this is about Jae In.

154
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,390
Actually, I did send pictures
to your mother-in-law.

155
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,990
Did you take the pictures of me
in the meeting room with Ms. Kim?

156
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,160
Yes.

157
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,660
What about
when I was at the cafe with her?

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,530
No, there were pictures
from that day, too?

159
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,170
Yes, right. That man.

160
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,500
It looks like Jae In's mom is
digging up your back.

161
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,900
When I came to Korea,

162
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,570
she said you seemed to have another woman
and asked if Jae In knew.

163
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,740
I told her
Jae In didn't say anything...

164
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,780
and that she must've misunderstood.

165
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,750
When I said I'd start working here,

166
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,650
she told me to take pictures
of the women you were close to.

167
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,320
So, I took pictures of you
and Ms. Kim and sent them to her.

168
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,520
Can I believe you or not?

169
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,720
You should've told me if you knew
she had been digging up my back.

170
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,790
Jae In's mother is
way too particular.

171
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,430
I wasn't completely sure,

172
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,900
so I didn't want to say something
and make you concerned.

173
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,030
My mother-in-law is
telling me to get divorced,

174
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,540
and Ms. Kim is saying
she'll expose everything.

175
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,810
We can stop her.

176
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,240
And divorcing her?

177
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,840
How can she make you do that
without hard evidence?

178
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,210
You can find a chance
to talk to Jae In first.

179
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,180
Say your mother-in-law used fake evidence
to make you divorce her.

180
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,420
Then, Jae In will also believe
her mother plotted this.

181
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,390
Anyway, it seemed like
Jae In wanted to return to work.

182
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,820
Did you know?

183
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,660
I heard her
talking to Director Kang...

184
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,360
about handling some project.

185
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,860
You didn't know?

186
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,470
You poor thing.

187
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,170
You loved Jae In so much that
you moved in with your in-laws...

188
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,610
and worked your fingers to the bone,
yet you were still distrusted.

189
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,310
Jae In's mother didn't trust you,
so she tailed you.

190
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,310
You should've heard
about Jae In's work...

191
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,450
as a part of the family,
but you were left out.

192
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,880
You may have lived with them,

193
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,920
but they never thought of you
as their family.

194
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,550
They'll promise to make you one of them
and give you busywork,

195
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,960
only to make you divorce her later.

196
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,430
It's an attempt to give YL Group
to Jae In and Seung Woo.

197
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,860
In the end,
you weren't Jae In's family.

198
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,630
You were her servant and a farmhand.

199
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,940
Life must've been
very lonely for you.

200
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,350
- Ouch!
- You're just a thief.

201
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,690
I called you over to see
the finished decoration,

202
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,460
but you almost took
the money I prepared...

203
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,060
to give to the construction company
while I was in the restroom.

204
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,960
Hey, it still hurts
when you beat me with money.

205
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,730
Also, why should I care...

206
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,660
about the color
of this shabby restaurant?

207
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,230
All right, then.

208
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,600
I'll just beat you
until your eyes are colored black.

209
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,240
- Take this, you punk.
- Ouch. Whatever!

210
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,040
He's making me so mad.

211
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,110
Did she see everything?

212
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,580
Gosh, we could've been humiliated
even before we opened.

213
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,220
I threw in
another pack of radish pickles...

214
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,490
and some candy for your children.

215
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,820
What?

216
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,890
Thank you.

217
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,910
Come by more often.

218
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,440
Goodbye.

219
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,750
Goodness. My heart is racing.

220
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,550
Gosh, that almost killed me. Oh, my.

221
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,590
My gosh.
Should I run this place or not?

222
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,560
I already made my payment...

223
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,230
and redecorated the place, too.

224
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,030
What do I do?

225
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,270
It's been many years already.

226
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,070
She wouldn't recognize me, right?

227
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,240
Well, even if she did,

228
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,010
nothing will change.

229
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,180
All right. It's me, Noh Sook Ja.

230
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,250
Something like this
can't make me anxious.

231
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,890
I don't have to be scared.

232
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,330
Oh, my. Hello.

233
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,470
Are you opening a new business?

234
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
I run the fried chicken place
across the hall.

235
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,710
Let's be good friends.

236
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,510
What was that?

237
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,310
Why wouldn't she say anything?

238
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,620
It was on vibrate,
so I didn't notice.

239
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,560
I'm not at work. I got off early.

240
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,290
I got a bit hungry,
so I wanted to eat something.

241
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,900
Fried chicken.

242
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,460
You want to come here?

243
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,430
All right. I'll ask
for the address and send it over.

244
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,710
You said you'd send the address.

245
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,640
I didn't say I was coming here.

246
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,050
This isn't
the only fried chicken place around.

247
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,950
Never mind, then.

248
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,690
You love drumsticks, right?

249
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,690
You can have both.

250
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,660
Dad.

251
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,400
Did you get fired?

252
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,400
No, why would I get fired?

253
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,670
I resigned.

254
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,440
What was the reason?

255
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,580
You must've been fired for a reason.

256
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,510
Work wasn't fun anymore,

257
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,850
and I was quite tired and exhausted.

258
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,520
I resigned
because I felt overworked.

259
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,290
You were full of love
for your work until recently.

260
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,960
You even said you were still young
and going strong.

261
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,360
What's your plan now?

262
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,230
I plan to live well and prosper.

263
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,800
I'm still young,

264
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,300
and I can do anything.

265
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,540
What did you do
with your severance pay?

266
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,570
I hear there are
lots of scammers out there.

267
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,810
I'm not someone
who'd fall for a scam.

268
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,540
I'm preparing myself
to face my retirement,

269
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,380
so you should worry about yourself
instead of me.

270
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,350
I know you're going through a lot.

271
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,950
Gi Man felt bad for you.

272
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,420
But everything will work out.

273
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,220
Let's eat.

274
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,790
You should eat, too, Dad.

275
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,330
You can have a drumstick.

276
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,330
You can have this one, too.

277
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,600
Where's Mother?

278
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,270
She had a dinner thing.

279
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,640
What's this herbal tonic?

280
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,210
I went to get some for Gi Chan,
so I got some for Mother, too.

281
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,710
She can take one bag
every morning and evening.

282
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,810
Please give it to her.

283
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,650
Sure. Anyway, Jae In.
What about mine?

284
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,380
Do you have one for me?

285
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,290
Na Ra,
you're still in your twenties.

286
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,160
- You're here, Yu Gyeong.
- Hey.

287
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,890
Can we talk?

288
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,900
Director Do? Why?

289
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,530
That's why I'm asking you.

290
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,640
It only says he resigned on paper.

291
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,440
My dad would never quit
on his own accord.

292
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,270
What's the reason?

293
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,510
I just heard about this from you.

294
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,810
One second.

295
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,880
Yes, Mom?

296
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,120
I'll be home soon. Okay.

297
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,820
I'll look into it, too.

298
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,240
I have no idea
how to bring this up to your sister.

299
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,670
Mom, they both denied it.

300
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,170
Didn't you hear Ms. Kim?

301
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,780
And Gi Chan was furious, too.

302
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,640
Why won't you believe me?

303
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,050
Someone who has
Ms. Kim's attitude...

304
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,650
could never do something like that.

305
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,320
She always plays by the book.

306
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,050
Her mind is completely clean.

307
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,560
Her soul is so clear
that she looks old-fashioned.

308
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,920
Are you into her, too?

309
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,060
She must have a knack
for capturing men's hearts.

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,060
Mom, think about it.

311
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,500
You don't have those pictures
of him in bed, do you?

312
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,270
That means
you don't have any evidence.

313
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,440
- The bracelet...
- There can't be only one of them!

314
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,910
You don't have the pictures,

315
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,810
so you can't tell
if that was the right bracelet.

316
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,180
What if Gi Chan sues you?

317
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,210
I know a thing or two about the law,

318
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,320
and the Korean law is
centered around hard evidence.

319
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
You can't have your way
without the evidence.

320
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,650
If this goes wrong, it'll worsen
your relationship with Jae In.

321
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,790
Would she side with you or him?

322
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,290
I should've looked into it...

323
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,830
and found hard evidence first.

324
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,000
Mom, I'll look into it, too.

325
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,470
For now, calm down.

326
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,630
All right.

327
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,040
Let's keep it a secret
from Jae In for a while.

328
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,310
Don't say anything.

329
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,150
I'm back.

330
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,180
- I...
- Let me talk first.

331
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,990
I made...

332
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,350
a mistake today.

333
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,760
When I came home
and thought it through,

334
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,060
I realized
I must've misunderstood something.

335
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,230
If you really mean that,
please stop putting a tail on me...

336
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,070
or digging up my back.

337
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,770
It was rash of me.

338
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,570
You should get some rest.

339
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,250
Gi Chan, I trust you.

340
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,190
Don't say anything to Jae In.

341
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,860
Daddy!

342
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,160
Hey, Eun Ho.

343
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,860
Did you have a great day?

344
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,230
Yes, where's Mommy?

345
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,230
Eun Ho, Mommy's home.

346
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,530
Mommy!

347
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
I'm sorry
I couldn't come for you today.

348
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,400
You're home, too.

349
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,840
Hey.

350
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,810
What's going on?
You're home early, too.

351
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,110
Please don't make me talk.
I took a vow of silence.

352
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,740
I got lots to say but can't say it.

353
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,880
What's he saying?

354
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,650
Let me go and say hi to Grandma.

355
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,330
Make sure he doesn't notice.
Tread carefully.

356
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,630
Mom.

357
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,930
You're back.

358
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,370
Where have you been?

359
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,200
Here and there. I was a little busy.

360
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,810
You said
you had something important to say.

361
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,970
Did I?

362
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,040
It wasn't a big deal.

363
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,950
Grandpa!

364
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,010
Your dad must be here.

365
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,590
Hey, there. My dear Eun Ho.

366
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,750
- Eun Ho.
- Hey.

367
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,690
- Gosh.
- Mommy!

368
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,830
It's great to see
my entire family...

369
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,500
bustling here all at once.

370
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,960
He had a drink
at a dinner gathering.

371
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,200
I see.

372
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,630
- Let's go inside.
- All right.

373
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,370
Hey, my eldest daughter, Jae In.

374
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,370
I heard the news from your aunt.

375
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,640
I loved the intent.
It was a great idea.

376
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,480
Good luck with the project.

377
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,110
- I'll look forward to it.
- Okay.

378
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,420
Let's go to our room.

379
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,990
- Goodnight.
- Yes, goodnight.

380
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,960
- He must've had a few drinks.
- He did.

381
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,400
Right, honey.

382
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,530
Did Director Do quit his job?

383
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,170
Did he really resign?

384
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,340
Why did he suddenly do that?
Did something happen?

385
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,140
Do I have to report
everything that happens at work?

386
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,910
Well, it's not that. It's Yu Gyeong.

387
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,410
It was your father's decision.

388
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,950
It's related to work,
so don't ask me for the reason.

389
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,050
Anyway, are you returning to work?

390
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,420
What?

391
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,420
No.

392
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,230
I had this idea
and talked to my aunt about it,

393
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,730
and she must've liked it.

394
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,530
I thought we were a married couple.

395
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,000
You could've talked to me first
before your aunt.

396
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,140
Or did you keep me out of this
because I wasn't a Kang?

397
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,610
Honey.

398
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,380
It was just a simple event.

399
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,150
It wasn't anything important.

400
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,980
Forget it. That's enough.

401
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,380
I was just a bit sensitive.

402
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,550
I need to wash up.

403
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,090
I'm...

404
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,100
Did you ask Do Hee...

405
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,870
about what happened to her face?
She got slapped, right?

406
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,470
Nothing happened.

407
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,470
Really?

408
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,410
I was doing the laundry,

409
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,210
and her clothes were stained
with coffee or something.

410
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,580
Her outfit was a mess
when she came back with that face.

411
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,250
I'll ask her once again.

412
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,320
Don't worry about it.

413
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,120
Okay.

414
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,890
Mommy, do you like
strawberries or mangoes?

415
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,630
- Mommy.
- Yes?

416
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,530
Do you like strawberries or mangoes?

417
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,640
Well, what about you?

418
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,740
I like strawberries.

419
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,870
Then, I like strawberries, too.

420
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,240
Come on. You can't say that.

421
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,980
I like everything you like, Bo Ram.

422
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,120
Bo Ram,
your grandma wants to see you.

423
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,890
- Okay.
- You should go.

424
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,790
Did something happen at work today?

425
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,560
How did you know?

426
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,230
- Did someone come for you?
- No.

427
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,230
Mom said your clothes were stained.

428
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,300
So, something did happen.

429
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,840
What is it?

430
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,310
Let's say you tried to dig out
a jagged stone from the ground.

431
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,580
What would you do
if it turned out to be...

432
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,780
a huge rock?

433
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,850
People say
many drops will make a shower.

434
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,360
This is when
you make use of your older brother.

435
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,030
I'll help you, so tell me more.

436
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,960
It's so reassuring
to hear you say that.

437
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,930
Don't sit on this all by yourself.

438
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,900
You can tell me everything.

439
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,040
It's all over.

440
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,740
Everything will be over by tomorrow.

441
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,410
You won't have to worry anymore.

442
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,870
Do you mean that?

443
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,080
It'll all end by tomorrow?

444
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,380
Yes, everything will be over.

445
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,120
As you suggested,
I want to resign...

446
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,520
and start studying.

447
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,690
Good.

448
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,660
- Good?
- Good.

449
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,560
Gosh, Do Yun.
What should I study first?

450
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,760
- Jeez.
- Thanks.

451
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,840
My mom told me to give this to you.

452
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,810
It's good for your stomach.

453
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,780
She must've felt bad that
you didn't seem to eat well lately.

454
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,550
You don't have to lie to me.

455
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,880
You got this for me.

456
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,420
I saw you
walking in last night with this.

457
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,160
No, it really was from my mom.

458
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,590
I just brought it
because she told me to.

459
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,830
Come on. Drink it.

460
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,560
Here.

461
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,750
I'm sorry
for what my mom did yesterday.

462
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,310
I want to apologize on her behalf.

463
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,720
Thanks for the coffee.

464
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,020
Director Hwang is quite late.

465
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,230
He must have
lots of meetings outside.

466
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,800
Anyway, so you really
aren't dating him, are you?

467
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,970
Mr. Kang.

468
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
I already know.

469
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,610
But I had to check once more
to be more confident before my mom.

470
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,380
One moment.

471
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,020
Hey, what's up, man?
It's been a while.

472
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,450
Tonight? Where at?

473
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,860
Okay.

474
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,760
I know it's not easy,
but please pay some attention.

475
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,060
I appreciate your support.

476
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,860
Thank you for saying that.

477
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,200
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes, goodbye.

478
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,840
- Hey.
- Hey.

479
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

480
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,010
Was someone you know hospitalized?

481
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,210
No.

482
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,420
Dr. Kim.

483
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,120
Hey.

484
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,090
What? Yu Gyeong.

485
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,090
Are you two acquainted?

486
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,230
Yes, we're friends.

487
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,560
How do you two know each other?

488
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,330
He was the one who saved Eun Ho.

489
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,030
So, you two were friends?

490
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,600
Yu Gyeong and I
went to the university together.

491
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,140
I see. Then, you must be a doctor.

492
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,940
Yes, I'm a surgeon.

493
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,680
Mr. Yoon was looking for you.

494
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,980
It seemed urgent.

495
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,210
Okay.

496
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,250
It was nice to meet you.

497
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,320
I'll see you next time.

498
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,550
See you.

499
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,230
I was on my way to see you.

500
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,730
I don't know the details
about what happened to Mr. Do...

501
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,970
It's all in the past.

502
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,370
There's no reason
to talk about this at this point.

503
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
I have to go, too. Excuse me.

504
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,070
Bye.

505
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,090
(Bo Ram's Fried Chicken
CEO: Jung Yun Hee)

506
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,330
What? Did you say 100 orders
of fried chicken?

507
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,430
This isn't a prank call, is it?

508
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,800
You must be that young lady
at the crosswalk.

509
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,570
Goodness. Yes.

510
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,080
Yes, I'll deliver everything
by three o'clock tomorrow.

511
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,310
Yes.

512
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,510
Goodness, thank you.

513
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,620
My gosh. I can't believe this.

514
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:25,220
It's as if she's showing me support
with her money.

515
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,430
Wait, she wanted 100 fried chickens.

516
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,830
I have lots to prepare.

517
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,430
Goodness.

518
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,070
Yes, Director Hwang.

519
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,420
Who is...

520
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,420
this baby?

521
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,990
He's my son.

522
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,870
What about his mother?

523
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,300
Don't ask me anything.

524
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,910
But I can tell you
one thing for sure.

525
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,110
Nothing complicated will happen...

526
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,050
because of this baby.

527
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,750
Relax.

528
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,880
Is that all you have to say?

529
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,350
From now on, he is...

530
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,820
our son.

531
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,760
His name is Seung Woo.

532
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,560
I named him Kang Seung Woo.

533
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,630
I have to go back out
and finish up my work.

534
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:19,770
I'll be back.

535
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,600
How...

536
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,670
How can you do this to me?

537
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,570
Die.

538
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,840
Die!

539
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,110
Hey, Bo Ram.

540
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,350
Have you been waiting for me?

541
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,980
It began to rain,
so I had to get an umbrella.

542
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,820
Yes, I'm on my way home right now.

543
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,090
Dad.

544
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,960
I love you.

545
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:37,870
What happened?

546
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,210
No. Director Hwang.

547
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,610
Please spare my life.

548
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,110
Please let me...

549
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,420
Please let me live.

550
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,890
Pull yourself together.

551
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,460
Will you ruin everything like this?

552
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,730
Mommy? Hello?

553
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,900
(Mom)

554
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,960
Hello?

555
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,370
(Queen's House)

556
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:58,780
Change hands with me!

557
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,840
- It's ready.
- I got her.

558
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,780
Move aside. Two, shock.

559
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,650
- Give me 150 joules.
- Charged to 150 joules.

560
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,550
- Charged.
- Move aside. I got her.

561
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,220
Move back. One, two, shock.

562
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,220
She must've died.

563
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,860
What if she didn't?

564
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,060
What if she didn't die?

565
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,970
I need to go back and check.

566
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,540
No, it's too dangerous.

567
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,170
Mommy. Mommy?
