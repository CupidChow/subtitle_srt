(Episode 68)

5
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,700
How's Ji Ho?

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,600
He just fell asleep.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,470
You must be disappointed.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,110
I never got to live as his mom,

9
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,480
so Se Ri must feel like one to him.

10
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,790
For your unchanging love...

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,990
and my love for you.

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,560
I love you, honey.

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,900
Me, too. I love you.

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,910
Do you mean it?

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,840
If you do, bottoms up.

16
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,950
Are you pregnant, Jae In?

17
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,590
Pregnant? Are you?

18
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,230
Are you really?

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,230
I don't feel well.
May I tell you later?

20
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,600
What?

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,110
Hey.

22
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,450
Why aren't you eating?

23
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,480
I can eat at work.

24
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,890
Do you feel all right?
Do you have an upset stomach?

25
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,870
I didn't feel well yesterday,
so I took the test.

26
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,870
I was going to tell you
after seeing a doctor...

27
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,440
and confirming everything
in case you'd worry.

28
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,680
I have an appointment today.

29
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,320
Wait, but when did we...

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,690
I don't recall anything.

31
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,890
Do you really not remember?

32
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,290
It was the day we had wine.

33
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,700
Right. That day.

34
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,140
After I see the doctor...

35
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,360
What did she say?
Is she pregnant? Is she?

36
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,700
She booked an appointment
with a doctor today. Go with her.

37
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,230
Did you sleep with her?

38
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,030
Did you really?

39
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,340
We had a drink together,
and things just happened.

40
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,110
Gosh, my head hurts.

41
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,210
Are you out of your mind?

42
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,710
Don't you know
that she's your enemy?

43
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,010
What are you going to do,
now that she's pregnant?

44
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,580
Pregnant?

45
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,980
Who's pregnant?

46
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,320
Is Jae In pregnant?

47
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,490
Why won't you say anything?

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,830
Yes, it seems so.

49
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,030
How dare you get your hands on
a girl who's unwell?

50
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,370
You're worse than beasts.

51
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,040
Mom!

52
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,610
That's enough.

53
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,280
It wasn't his fault.
I wanted him first.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,310
I can't stand this anymore.

55
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,410
You need to know the facts.

56
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,750
Jae In, pull yourself together
and listen up.

57
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,990
You really need to stop.

58
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,550
I love this man.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,290
Jae In.

60
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,460
Mom, please.
I'm an adult, and we're married.

61
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,300
I don't think it's right for you
to meddle with us anymore.

62
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,430
You should be happy
for my pregnancy.

63
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,940
I know you worry about me,
but it's still disappointing.

64
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,900
Are you really...

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,110
Honey, you should go to work.

66
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,110
I'm sorry
for making a fuss this early.

67
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,240
It's all right.

68
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,680
I understand why she feels that way.

69
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,620
You don't have to see me off.
You should be careful.

70
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm leaving.

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,960
Goodbye, Mother.

72
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,140
Can she handle everything
when her memories return?

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,670
Jae In.

74
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,410
What am I supposed to do?

75
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,240
Mom.

76
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,610
Let's talk later.

77
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,420
I have
too much on my mind right now.

78
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,920
I'm sorry, Mom.

79
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,290
I had no other choice
at this point in time.

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,860
I'll tell you everything soon.

81
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,230
I heard you have
a doctor's appointment.

82
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,600
I'll go with you.

83
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,070
You want to come with me?

84
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,570
Yes, I'll go with you.

85
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,210
All right, Mother.

86
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,950
No, right? It can't be.

87
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,390
I don't know yet.

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,060
What do you mean, you don't know?

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,230
Did you really do
something like that with her?

90
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,100
Did you?

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,900
We'll talk later.

92
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,340
You said you two only shared a bed.

93
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,500
You said nothing more happened!

94
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,910
How can you do this in the same house
while Ji Ho and I were there?

95
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,710
How do you call yourself
my husband and his dad?

96
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,710
How can you do this to us?

97
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,680
I didn't want to say this
because I'd only be ridiculing myself,

98
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,750
but were we any different?

99
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,520
What?

100
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,420
I was drunk and out of my mind,
and it was a mistake.

101
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,660
So just wait.
It hasn't even been confirmed yet.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,400
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

103
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,370
I have to work. You need to go.

(Saechorok OB-GYN Clinic)

105
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,250
It's been two weeks
since you should've started your period,

106
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,050
you feel under the weather,
you're exhausted,

107
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,060
and the smell of food
makes you feel nauseated,

108
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,430
so you're highly likely
to be pregnant.

109
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,700
Wait a second.

110
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,470
You'll know if you run that thing,

111
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,440
ultrasonic, no, ultraviolet.
What are you waiting for?

112
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,210
It's not ultrasonic or ultraviolet.

113
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,770
It's an ultrasound, ma'am.

114
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,180
At this point, you can't see
the fetal sac through ultrasound.

115
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,550
I can only confirm it
after five weeks or so.

116
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,390
Right now, you can check
with the blood and urine test.

117
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,760
Would you like to do that?

118
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,860
Of course, we'll do that.
Do it right now. Make it quick.

119
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,430
She's excited and in a hurry
to see a grandchild.

120
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,440
I'll do the tests.

121
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,080
(Ultrasound Room)

122
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,110
Thanks.

(Test Result)

124
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,290
Congratulations. You're pregnant.

125
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,090
She's really pregnant?

126
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,690
Yes, she is.

127
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,660
Did you hear that, Mother?

128
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,130
I am pregnant.

129
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,400
My head hurts.

130
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,570
Gi Chan, you punk.
What are you going to do?

131
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,850
An OB-GYN clinic?

132
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,950
Yes, they'll never believe me
if I just say I'm pregnant.

133
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,690
They'll want to run a test,
so I have to get ahead of them.

134
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,590
Please do that for me.

135
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,490
Okay. My friend is a gynecologist.

136
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,960
I'll talk to her.
She'll help you with this.

137
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,670
You're in the early stage,
so stay away from strenuous activities.

138
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,900
You must be careful.

139
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,310
You should help your daughter
as a mother.

140
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,710
She's my mother-in-law,

141
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,410
but she feels like my own mother.

142
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,410
She's your mother-in-law?

143
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,720
It's nice to see you two.

144
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,200
Did you sleep well last night?

145
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,970
Well, it was the same.

146
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,370
You know... What was that?

147
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,310
About the meeting this week
with the board members.

148
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,740
Are we doing that in the showroom?

149
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,240
That's right.

150
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,280
Is work all you can talk about
when you see me?

151
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,850
I couldn't sleep well last night.

152
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,750
I guess I was the only one
excited about us.

153
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,090
You must be busy.
You should get to work.

154
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,270
You should catch a break.

155
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,710
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

156
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,550
How do people date these days?

157
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,280
Are you dating someone?

158
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,980
No.

159
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,790
I probably should
before I get even older,

160
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,560
but I've been away
from the dating world for too long.

161
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,430
I have no idea what to do.
Everything has faded away.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,660
I'm not too different from you.

163
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,300
You probably have a better idea
as someone who lived on land...

164
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,500
compared to this uncle,
who lived out in the vast sea.

165
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,740
So? Let me hear you out.

166
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,080
Dating may seem grandiose,

167
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,910
but it basically means
you share your life together.

168
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,650
It's just nice
to have someone there,

169
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,520
even in the most trivial part
of your life.

170
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,320
I knew you'd be better than me.

171
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,020
This is why people live on land.

172
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,030
Anyway, Uncle Oh Seong.
Are you really dating...

173
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,930
Hey. It's not your business.

174
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,200
Let's get to the actual business.

175
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,540
Honey.

176
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,650
Hey.

177
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,710
Did you see the doctor?

178
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,220
Yes, I went with Mother.

179
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,850
Honey, I am pregnant.

180
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,190
Aren't you happy, too?

181
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,860
Ji Ho is going to have
a younger sibling.

182
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,700
Congratulations.

183
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,800
Are you just saying that?

184
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
What?

185
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,540
We're at your work.
What if someone walks in?

186
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,610
I want a basket of flowers.

187
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,810
Bring one when you come home. Okay?

188
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,250
Okay.

189
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,690
Hey, Seung Woo.

190
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,960
You were here.

191
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,690
Yes, and Seung Woo,
you'll have a niece or a nephew.

192
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,600
Aren't you going to be happy for me?

193
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,700
Later.

194
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,000
I have to talk to the chairman.

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,170
Can you give us some privacy?

196
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,570
Is it about work?

197
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,540
Yes.

198
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,340
All right.
I was just about to leave.

199
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,080
I'll see you at home, honey.

200
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,980
Okay. Have a safe trip back home.

201
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,650
Or do you want to take my car?

202
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,450
No, I can go alone.

203
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

204
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,660
What do you think you're doing?

205
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,130
Don't you know
what her condition is like?

206
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,200
It's not your place to
meddle in this, my brother-in-law.

207
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,670
Did you call me your brother-in-law?

208
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,070
You must be absorbed in this play,
but you two are strangers now.

209
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,240
What now?
What will you do with my sister?

210
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,880
I'll take responsibility.
The kid did nothing wrong.

211
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,810
I can't believe this.

212
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,120
The kid isn't the problem.
She might lose her mind...

213
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
when she gets her memories back!

214
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,050
Don't you know that?

215
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,190
Don't put this on me.

216
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,560
Your sister wanted this more.

217
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,160
If anyone hurts her in any way,

218
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,330
I'm not going to let it pass,
no matter who it is.

219
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,570
I'm keeping my eyes on you,
so you better be careful.

220
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,010
Sure.
Keep your eyes on me all you want.

221
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,240
Seung Woo.

222
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,080
Hey.

223
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,080
You're still here.

224
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,980
I wanted to see Aunt Mi Ran, too.

225
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,450
Did the conversation go okay?

226
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,420
Yes.

227
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,430
Do you remember how I said
I'd keep you safe, Jae In?

228
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,530
- Do you remember that?
- Of course.

229
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,100
I was really moved to know
that you've become a decent adult...

230
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,730
who could protect me now.

231
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,100
I wasn't joking!

232
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,980
Jae In, why don't you...

233
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,580
reconsider your pregnancy?

234
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,520
You aren't well right now.

235
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,120
You should look after yourself,
and then...

236
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,650
I'm fine, Seung Woo.

237
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,490
The doctor also said I was fine.

238
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,460
This is driving me crazy.

239
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,560
Listen up.

240
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,230
I'm going to protect you,

241
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,700
and I'll do anything for you.

242
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,800
When life becomes tough,
painful, lonely, sad,

243
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,670
and even when you feel
the most miserable in the world,

244
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,380
I'll protect you.

245
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,580
I'll be on your side until the end.

246
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,380
I'm serious about this, Jae In.

247
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,690
It doesn't matter even if
it's about taking the company over.

248
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,390
I'll agree
with whatever you have to say,

249
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,660
no matter what happens.

250
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,790
This is not going to change
even after your memories return.

251
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,400
If you tell me to sign an agreement
and have it notarized, I'll do it.

252
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,470
I mean it, Jae In.

253
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,310
I'm dead serious.

254
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,470
I know.

255
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,110
I don't know
why you're so passionate,

256
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,450
but thank you, Seung Woo.

257
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,650
I'm never going to forget it.

258
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,020
How can I forget you?

259
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,960
Thank you.

260
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,300
Pregnant?

261
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,200
Jae In's pregnant?

262
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,100
I'm not completely sure yet,

263
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,840
but my family is in an uproar
because of her.

264
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,970
Watch what you say.

265
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,210
You should blame Gi Chan...

266
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,040
instead of Jae In.

267
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,880
She has no memories,
so she doesn't know anything.

268
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,620
He's the one who got into her bed.

269
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,220
Jae In kept tempting him,

270
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,250
and he had to pretend
like they were married.

271
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,890
I don't care what the reason is.
It's Chairman Hwang's fault.

272
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,220
Don't blame Jae In for this.

273
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,830
If she really is pregnant, she'll be
shocked when her memories return.

274
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,700
And it won't be easy
to raise the child alone.

275
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,300
You should persuade her.

276
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,230
Others may not know,

277
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:40,170
but you must understand
what that feels like.

278
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,940
What do you mean by that?

279
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,410
Aunt Mi Ran.

280
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,310
Hey, Se Ri.

281
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,850
I came to share good news,
but you must've heard it already.

282
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,120
Yes, but I heard
you didn't know for sure yet.

283
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,590
I do now.
I just went to see a doctor.

284
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,960
I wanted Gi Chan
to be the first to know.

285
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,430
He was so happy about it.

286
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,500
It felt so nice
to see his big smile.

287
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,240
I just remembered
that I had to do something.

288
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,540
Please excuse me.

289
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,410
Se Ri, you may be in a hurry,
but please be happy for me.

290
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,810
Won't you do that?

291
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,450
Congratulations. Bye.

292
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,390
Does your mother know?

293
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,960
Yes, my family all found out
in the morning.

294
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,130
Did she say anything?

295
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,770
You already know...

296
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,770
she doesn't approve of Gi Chan.

297
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,540
He's doing his best
to build up his trust,

298
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,170
but I guess it's not enough for her.

299
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,580
But she was happy for me.

300
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,750
Jae In.

301
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,680
I don't think I can do that.

302
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,650
Aunt Mi Ran.

303
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,290
I just don't want to lie.

304
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,260
I still think this is too early.

305
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,690
But after all, the choice is yours.

306
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,800
Give it a good thought, okay?

307
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,400
Okay. I'll do that.

308
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,540
What now?

309
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Jae In really is pregnant.

310
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,580
What are you going to do now?

311
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,980
Stop shouting at me.

312
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,690
I told you I was drunk
and out of my mind.

313
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,350
It was a mistake.

314
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,360
Are you saying
a mistake isn't considered a fault?

315
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,560
What I need to do is patch this up.

316
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,030
Then, abort it.

317
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,060
Convince her to abort it now!

318
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,530
Are you in your right mind?

319
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,470
Then what? Are you going to have it?

320
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,100
It's my child.

321
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,240
And if I think of Eun Ho,
I can't do that.

322
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,870
So what?

323
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,410
Are you going to keep two families?

324
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,450
What are you doing?

325
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,220
I'm going to tell Jae In...

326
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,390
that I'm your wife.

327
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,360
- Are you crazy?
- No, you're crazy.

328
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Come to your senses, Gi Chan!

329
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,700
I need some time.

330
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll convince Jae In
or do something else.

331
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,800
So, give me some time and wait.

332
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,870
I'm sorry.

333
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,970
Handle this quickly.

334
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,570
I can't be patient for long.

335
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,780
I can't do that yet.

336
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,780
If what Chairman Kang left
in that notebook is...

337
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,550
the lead to his slush fund,

338
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,580
I must keep Jae In by my side...

339
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,790
to get more information from her.

340
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,890
Why won't you say anything?

341
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,060
Is there another reason
why you must keep her here?

342
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,960
No, there isn't.

343
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,090
I understand how you feel,
and you can stop now.

344
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,820
Are you low on sugar?

345
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,020
I'm in need of sugar,
and my heart just dropped, too.

346
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,620
Doesn't it feel so unfair...

347
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,890
that life is
still as unpredictable as ever,

348
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,230
even after you become this age?

349
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,160
Did something happen?

350
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,870
My ex...
I mean, my daughter-in-law...

351
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,170
got pregnant.

352
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,540
Oh, my. You're going to have
another grandchild.

353
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,040
Isn't that good news?

354
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,680
Well, she's not his legal wife.

355
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,520
Well, she is his original wife.

356
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,990
Oh, my.

357
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,220
Actually, my son...

358
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,490
got remarried.

359
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,530
But he got
his other girl pregnant...

360
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,900
Oh, no.

361
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,110
You can't tell anyone, okay?

362
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,440
I can tell you these things
because it's you.

363
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,280
I recently experienced...

364
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,320
that life is unpredictable,
so I get you.

365
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,460
The insurance company said
I took out plans I never did,

366
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,890
and they even said
I received payment...

367
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,490
after the damage was done.

368
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,960
I don't know what's happening.

369
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,600
Is she feeling me out
because she knows something?

370
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,470
Or does she have no idea?

371
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,910
Oh, gosh.

372
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,080
Do you want more?

373
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,130
Hey. You're home.

374
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,170
Hey.

375
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,570
What's all this?

376
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,240
Baby goods.

377
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,270
I saw a store in passing,

378
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,570
so I had to get a few.

379
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,080
I got some health supplements
for our family while picking up mine...

380
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,380
as recommended by the gynecologist.

381
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,250
This is yours.

382
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,880
It's an antioxidant supplement.

383
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,190
You should have it every day
to stay more youthful.

384
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,120
One moment, please.

385
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,630
Here, Mother.

386
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,500
Right now?

387
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,440
Yes.

388
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,490
You have to take one
every single day, okay?

389
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,530
I'm too stressed out
and need to rest a little.

390
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,560
Wake me when dinner's ready.

391
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,130
The doctor said
you should be careful,

392
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,400
but it's worse for you
if you sit around and do nothing.

393
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,970
It's better for you to move.

394
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,740
All right. You should get some rest.

395
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,040
I'm making some beef bone soup.

396
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,940
I have to let it simmer for a while,
so I'll wake you up when it's ready.

397
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,540
Yes, I admit that...

398
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,470
I'm the one who has a crush on you.

399
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,870
Are we good?

400
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,210
But you don't have a girlfriend.

401
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,410
Do you?

402
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,650
I don't.

403
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,150
Then, you can start dating me.

404
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,350
You'll end up falling for me
as soon as you start doing that.

405
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,450
Ms. Hwang, the moment
you force your feelings on me,

406
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,820
it becomes an obsession,

407
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,060
and it can turn into a crime
called stalking.

408
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,690
Why are you so pessimistic?

409
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,700
What I'm doing right now is
showing you how cute I can be.

410
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,570
All I did was
share my feelings with you.

411
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,040
And you're partially responsible.

412
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,810
You helped me
and were considerate of me, too.

413
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,540
I get nervous when you're around,

414
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,310
feel a jolt in my heart,
and have butterflies in my stomach.

415
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,790
Did you feel the zap?

416
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,290
Yes.

417
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,660
So, when I have such feelings...

418
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,130
That means
you like the other person.

419
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Excuse me?

420
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,200
Are you listening?

421
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,250
You should have some.

422
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,660
How have you been lately?

423
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,830
What's there to share?

424
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,330
It's always the same.

425
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,800
I tried to look for it,
but I couldn't find it.

426
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,710
Or am I just too clumsy?

427
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,880
You should take your time
and look for it.

428
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,020
It really isn't here.

429
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,190
I remember leaving in a hurry...

430
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,330
when Kang Se Ri called.

431
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,160
And then,
I think I put it in my bag.

432
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,940
I think I saw something important...

433
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,510
in that notebook.

434
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,640
What could it have been?

435
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,650
I feel like
I've forgotten something important.

436
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,430
Fire!

437
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,930
Fire? Fire!

438
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,370
It's a fire!

439
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,070
Call 911 now. Call them!

440
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,540
Wait. My money. No!

441
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,640
- Where are you going?
- My money!

442
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,950
No, Mom!

443
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,210
I turned the heat off.

444
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,680
Honey...

445
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,690
Honey!

446
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,740
Mom, what were you thinking?

447
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,870
You should've checked
if you were simmering soup!

448
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,640
It really wasn't me!

449
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,580
I didn't do this. I didn't.

450
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,850
I said I was tired
and going to sleep.

451
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,520
Jae In said she'd wake me
when dinner was ready.

452
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,450
Tell him, Jae In.

453
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,520
My gynecologist said
I needed absolute rest,

454
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,690
so I was resting in my room.

455
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,500
You insisted on making dinner, so...

456
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,070
Never mind. Let's just say I did it.

457
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,400
I must've forgotten.

458
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,170
My gosh. She's blaming the innocent!

459
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,710
Jae In, tell him the truth.

460
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,450
Why are you lying?

461
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,710
I never said
I was going to make dinner!

462
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,180
I'm getting PTSD to think
there could've been another fire.

463
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,290
You should be careful, Mom.

464
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,690
Always be careful with fire.

465
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,190
Mom, I understand
this can happen at your age.

466
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,500
People become forgetful
when they get older.

467
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,570
It's nothing embarrassing,
but be careful from now on.

468
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,300
Good grief. I didn't do it!

469
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,140
It wasn't me!

470
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,910
I don't see Ji Ho anywhere.

471
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,480
It was his friend's birthday,
so he went to a birthday party.

472
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:29,210
His friend's mom will
drop him off when it ends.

473
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,150
People might see this and think...

474
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,150
you're really his mother, not me.

475
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,590
Is this for me?

476
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,490
What? Yes.

477
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,630
Congratulations on your pregnancy.

478
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,370
Thank you, honey.

479
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,000
I need to rest a little.

480
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,070
Yes, let's go upstairs and rest.

481
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,790
How come no one in this huge house
believes what I have to say?

482
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:18,060
It really wasn't me! It wasn't!

483
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,260
I believe you.

484
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,230
But I don't trust you.

485
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,830
You don't matter.

486
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,610
It looks too similar to that one.

487
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,190
This is why people say...

488
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,320
a guilty conscience
needs no accuser.

489
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
But it still doesn't feel right.

490
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,000
I don't care about staying youthful.

491
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,860
I need to know what this is
before I take it.

492
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,410
Right?

493
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,310
Yes, all right.

494
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,280
One moment, please.

495
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,550
What do you want?

496
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,510
You don't work as a doctor,
but you're still one, right?

497
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,820
Jae In gave me
this health supplement.

498
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,250
Tell me what this is.

499
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,330
You need to wait.
I must finish this important call.

500
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,230
Hello, I'm sorry. So...

501
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:38,470
What's she doing out there?
What's taking her so long?

502
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,350
Show me.

503
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,560
Are those health supplements?

504
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,190
No, they're sleeping pills.

505
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,500
Right? Isn't that so?

506
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,700
I knew it.

507
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,400
She's trying to do
what I did to her.

508
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,310
Have you been somewhere, Mother?

509
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,380
Have I been somewhere?

510
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,680
How dare you
try to give me sleeping pills?

511
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,590
Did you think I had no idea?

512
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,420
You remember everything.

513
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,590
Mother, what are you talking about?

514
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,430
You're confusing me.

515
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,660
You can fool everyone else,
but not me, you fraud.

516
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,670
Tell me the truth now.

517
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,830
You don't have amnesia.

518
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,540
I got you.

519
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,850
What is this? Darn it.

520
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,250
Are you crazy?

521
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,090
What took you so long?

522
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,060
What?

523
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,840
(Queen's House)

524
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,880
All of you have no idea!

525
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,810
She's the sleaziest girl
in the world!

526
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,950
Mother, you didn't do this, did you?

527
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,520
Goodness. This is so unfair.

528
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,430
Don't you know
that my wife is pregnant?

529
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,060
Your wife?

530
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,930
Can you tell Ms. Kang
that I miss her?

531
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,970
I'm not the one who's craving it.
