and backgrounds...)

(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,280
He cried,
made a scene, and insisted...

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,420
he had to go to the kindergarten,
so what could I do?

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,720
You won't find anyone home
even if you come.

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,720
Jae In also went out
to an engagement...

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,190
after she dropped Eun Ho off.

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,190
You can all come tomorrow
for dinner.

10
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,430
The chairman wanted to eat together.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,900
Ms. Noh, I must go to my gallery.

12
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,640
I can't stay on the phone for too long.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,770
Goodbye.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,680
She just won't hang up.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,650
These rich people are the stingiest.

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,260
All they have is money,

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,060
yet they don't want to waste
even a penny.

18
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,590
"Ms. Noh, I must go to my gallery."

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,700
"I can't stay on the phone
for too long."

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,970
Mom, that was so weird.

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,540
Stop that. It doesn't suit you.

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,970
Right. Did you ask Jae In's mom...

23
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,340
about my potential husband?

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,140
I need to talk to her in person.
I can't ask her that over the phone.

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,250
Mom, my first condition is that
he must be handsome. Okay?

26
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,480
Don't forget that.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,050
Good grief.
His looks won't go a long way.

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,720
Your first condition is money,
the second is money,

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,120
and the third is also money.
Money is the best.

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,890
Right? Money is the best.

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,090
- Mother.
- Be quiet.

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,700
I might really end up dead.

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,260
Please help me just this once.

34
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,530
Good grief. Shut that mouth.

35
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,470
My gosh.
Why aren't you going to the office?

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,470
How can your company do well...

37
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,510
if you're at home acting pathetic?

38
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,510
My business isn't the problem.
My life is at stake!

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,950
It's really the last time.

40
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,450
Please? Mother.

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,850
I'd rather invest my money
in a lost cause.

42
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,590
You're the eldest in the family,
yet you can't even compare to Gi Chan.

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,820
You might as well call him
your older brother.

44
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,390
Mom, he said he might really die.

45
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,430
Death doesn't come that easily.

46
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,360
How dare you threaten me?

47
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,600
Pay me back first before you die.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,450
All right.
So, how's Seung Woo doing?

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,810
He's doing well.

50
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,750
Do you mean that?

51
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,950
Or are you saying that
in case I'll worry?

52
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,130
A good punishment will do
that reckless kid some good,

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,400
but I can't go around
spanking a grown man.

Try to get him interested in work.

56
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,540
You already know
why I made him work for you.

57
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,540
Do your best to guide him.

58
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,640
Yes, sir.

59
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,820
This reminds me
of our high school days.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,920
Right?

61
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,860
I still remember when you two were
Kang Jae In A and Kang Jae In B.

62
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,560
Time flies.

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,530
You two still look the same.

64
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,170
No, you look even prettier.

65
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,370
You, too, Jae In.

66
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,940
I keep forgetting
that you changed your name.

67
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,770
I have to use it often
to make it stick,

68
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,710
but you live in America,
so I didn't get a chance.

69
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,740
You'll get to do it more often
from now on.

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,110
What?

71
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,480
Are you back for good?

72
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,950
Yes, I came back first.

73
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,620
I have to find a place to live,
and I have something to do, too.

74
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,090
My husband will also return
as soon as he sorts everything out.

75
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,360
Hey, that's wonderful.

76
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,960
Let's meet more often from now on.

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,560
Next time,
why don't we all meet as couples?

78
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,630
It'd be great
for our husbands to be friends.

79
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,500
I also want to know
what he looks like.

80
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,970
Did you want to know?

81
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,930
- Yes.
- Of course.

82
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,740
You went to America on a trip,

83
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,410
so we were really shocked
when we heard you were suddenly married.

84
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,740
Tell me about it.

85
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,740
If you had told us,
we would've come and celebrated.

86
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,240
That was awful.

87
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,510
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,120
Back then,
I wasn't in my right mind.

89
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,090
My man and I were
crazy about each other.

90
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,190
We were passionately in love.

91
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,720
Well, we still are.

92
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,330
Don't just show him off in words.
Do you have a picture?

93
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,660
Let us see how great he is.

94
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,760
Do you want to see him?

95
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,770
I want to,
but I don't have any pictures.

96
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,010
He doesn't like taking photos.
He says it feels awkward.

97
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,210
Gosh.

98
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,110
My husband is the same.

99
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,010
He dreads taking pictures.

100
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,750
He reluctantly takes one...

101
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,350
only when Eun Ho asks for a selfie.

102
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,050
Is Gi Man like that, too?

103
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,350
Well...

104
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,020
I don't know. There recently weren't
many occasions to take photos.

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,690
Jae In, do you still work?

106
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,330
You must hold a high position.

107
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,970
I took a year of maternity leave.

108
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
It'll end next month,

109
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,200
so I've been wondering
if I should quit.

110
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,110
Why? Because of Eun Ho?

111
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,280
He needs his mother at this age,

112
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,880
and I'm even more convinced
after recent events.

113
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,880
Did something happen to him?

114
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,680
What?

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,290
Well, yes. He was kidnapped.

116
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,090
Thankfully, he returned safely
without harm.

117
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,930
Really?

118
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,130
I'm glad he was fine.

119
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,330
I'm grateful for everything.

120
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,770
I never want to go through that
or even think about it again.

121
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,830
You're right.

122
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,140
You can always go back to work.

123
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,240
It's your family's company,
so you don't have to worry.

124
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,770
But I should start worrying.

125
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,280
What about you?

126
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,940
I've been looking for a job,
but it's not so easy.

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,350
I've been away from Korea for long,
so I don't have any connections.

128
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,520
I haven't heard back from anyone
even after sending out my portfolio.

129
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,550
But someone with your career
should be able to find something.

130
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,460
I'll ask around, too.

131
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,360
Really?

132
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,390
Then, I'd be so grateful.

133
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,430
It's my husband.

134
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,370
I see.

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,370
Yes, I'm eating lunch
with my friends.

137
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,310
I wanted to eat with you,
but I was a bit too late.

138
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,680
Are you disappointed?

139
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,350
You should eat lunch, too.
You must be hungry.

140
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,580
They seem so loving.

141
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,280

they're still hot about each other.

Come in.

148
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,050
Mr. Kang. Why did you open
all these files in this folder?

149
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,820
I had to look
for Balsan New Town's contract.

150
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,660
Hey, we talked on the phone.
Don't you remember?

151
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,030
I'm asking because you opened
other files, not just that one.

152
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,130
I didn't know what was what,
so I looked through them.

153
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,870
Did he not notice the fake contract?

154
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,480
What did you see,
and what were they about?

155
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,410
Tell me what you saw.

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,930
What?
Gi Chan, are you suspicious of me?

161
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,670
Do you think
I'm an industrial spy or something?

162

Hey, don't be so official.
You're scaring me.

163

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,520
I swear that I do not know anything.

178
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,070
He asked to check the contract
for the overseas factory development.

179
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,510
Are there any revisions?

180
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,950
I don't see any marks.

181
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,350
It's been reviewed already,

182
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,950
but he wanted to check again
for technical terms.

183
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,860
Did he say anything else?

184
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,120
No.

185
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,530
What was that contract I saw
on Director Hwang's laptop?

186
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,540
The company name is the same,

187
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,240
but the content is different.

188
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,640
- Hey.
- Goodbye.

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,380
- Come into the bus.
- Over here.

190
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,480
Hop in carefully.

191
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,350
- You've never been to a kids' cafe?
- No.

192
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,950
Is it fun?

193
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,120
No, I don't like it.

194
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,420
Why not?

195
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,060
We're in that awkward age.

196
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,330
When I want to play with older kids,

197
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,760
they shoo me away
and say I'm too young,

198
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,900
and younger babies are too immature.

199
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,470
Right. I see.

200
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,640
Eun Ho.

201
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,840
Mommy!

202
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,740
Give me your backpack. Okay.

203
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,780
- Mommy.
- Yes?

204
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,380
I'm not a baby anymore.

205
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,250
Why do you drop me off
and pick me up?

206
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,790
Because I feel less scared
when you're with me.

207
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,720
Can I do this for a few more days?

208
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,290
Okay.

209
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,390
Okay, then.

210
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,260
This is a promise sticker.

211
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,400
I'll keep you safe, Mommy.

212
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,370
Thank you so much.

213
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,970
This is nice.

214
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,740
You have gastritis.

215
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,440
Stay away from strong-tasting food
and alcohol for a while.

216
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,240
If you don't feel better,
come again next week.

217
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,480
Okay.

218
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,780
Goodbye.

219
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,250
Come in.

220
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,360
Snack delivery.

221
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,030
I got your favorites,
macarons and coffee.

222
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,240
Give me just five minutes.

223
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes, Doctor.

224
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,870
The macarons are delicious.
The coffee, too.

225
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,240
Where did you get them?

226
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,940
I stood in line at a famous bakery
and got these...

227
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,910
for Dr. Do Yu Gyeong.

228
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,720
I never thought about marrying,
but that almost changes...

229
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,850
whenever I see you two.

230
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,350
I'm jealous, Dr. Do.

231
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,290
Are you not dating?

232
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,490
These days, people need money...

233
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,790
to date and marry.

234
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,200
Do you invest in the stock market?
What about funds?

235
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,430
They're both huge these days.

236
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,960
I don't know much about it.

237
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,370
Right, you were a fund manager.

238
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,800
Can you tell me where to invest?

239
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,410
Ms. Kim,
if you want to invest in a fund,

240
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,970
you should find someone else.

241
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,680
We work together,
so it'll be okay if things go well,

242
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,780
but it'll be awkward
when it's bearish. Don't do it.

243
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,850
Yes, Doctor.

244
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,920
Don't you trust me?

245
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,320
She wanted to invest.
Why did you rain on my parade?

246
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,560
If it goes well, sure.
But what if it doesn't?

247
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,460
Who do you think she'll blame?

248
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,900
It's me, not you,

249
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,560
and I can't deal with that.

250
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,230
Why are you here?

251
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,110
If you want money, don't ask.
I said I didn't have any.

252
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,610
You've changed so much.

253
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,480
Back in the day,
you always agreed with everything I said.

254
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,750
It's been five minutes. Go.

255
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,960
If you're interested in funds, here.

256
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,700
It's not this number, so...

257
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,830
- Honey.
- Yes?

258
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,700
- I wanted to see you off.
- What?

259
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,940
Let's go.

260
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,070
- What? Okay.
- Goodbye.

261
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,410
They've been married for years,
but they're still so much in love.

262
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,010
They were
college sweethearts, right?

263
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,880
Apparently so.

264
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,020
I would die to meet
a romanticist like him.

265
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,690
My type is Dr. Kim Do Yun
in the surgery department.

266
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,960
Go.

267
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,970
Honey. Yu Gyeong.

268
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,740
You know men are
only made of pride, right?

269
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,170
But I'll throw away everything.

270
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,610
If you tell me to die,
I'll even pretend to die.

271
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,740
If you ask me to kneel,
I'll do that.

272
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,210
What are you doing?
Get up. What's with you?

273
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,610
I don't care
if it's only 100,000 dollars.

274
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,480
Can you find a way to borrow some?

275
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,080
You need to stop. I have no money.

276
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,870
Dr. Do.

277
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,840
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

278
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,200
I have to run to the restroom.

279
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,970
I'll go. I have to go. Bye.

280
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,480
She came for a checkup,
but she got lost.

281
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,450
Ma'am, she's the doctor
of family medicine.

282
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,720
- I see.
- You can go with her.

283
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,720
Let's go.

284
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,890
What?

285
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,890
He was a doctor here?

286
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,970
My goodness.

287
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,540
Yes, hello?

288
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,910
Yes, I've been doing my best
to find the money.

289
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,180
Please wait a little more...

290
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,820
Yes. All right. Goodbye.

291
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,020
Gosh.

292
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,660
(Director of Planning Hwang Gi Chan)

293
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,760
Come in.

294
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,100
I'm here, Gi Chan.

295
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,870
Why did you suddenly come
without calling me?

296
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,470
I was nearby, so I stopped by.

297
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,370
How's Eun Ho? Is he all right?

298
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,050
Say what you want to say.

299
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,480
What? Say what?

300
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,620
You came to say something,
didn't you?

301
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,890
Gosh, you still have
that prosecutor in you.

302
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,330
Gi Chan, if you have
any spare money...

303
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,390
Gi Man,
I already made myself clear...

304
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,800
and said I'd never make
any monetary transactions with you.

305
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,370
What are brothers for?

306
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,900
I just need it for a month.

307
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,100
Gi Chan, you know that
I set you up with Jae In, right?

308
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,740
If I had known
her family was so affluent,

309
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,470
I would've hit on her and...

310
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,910
I was just joking.

311
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,980
I don't think
I have to hear you out anymore.

312
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,650
You should go.

313
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,290
I'm busy.

314
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,860
Hello?

315
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,960
You caught the kidnappers?

316
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,870
Yes, all right.

317
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,810
What? They caught the kidnappers?

318
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,670
Yes.

319
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,740
I need to go and check.

320
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,840
Hey, you don't have to go.

321
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,310
You can't go and show your face.

322
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,680
There must be reporters
stationed there.

323
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,850
People will find out the grandson
of a huge corporation was kidnapped.

324
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,460
I'll go.

325
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,160
I saw their faces, too.

326
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,160
I'll figure out the situation
and call you, so get back to work.

327
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,900
You said you were busy.

328
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,260
What are brothers for?

329
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,500
Take advantage of me
in times like these.

330
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,840
(Changpyeong Police Station)

331
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,510
They were the kidnappers, right?

332
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,810
No. It wasn't them.

333
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,110
See? He says no.

334
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,380
Are you sure?

335
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,520
Well, they look similar,
but they aren't the ones.

336
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,960
I saw them right in front of me,
so I'd know when I saw them.

337
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,720
- I'm sure...
- I'm sure it's them.

338
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,360
Yes, I'm sure... What?

339
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,560
Hello, I appreciate your hard work.

340
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,900
I was asked to come as a witness.

341
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,070
They are...

342
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,970
the kidnappers. I'm sure.

343
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,070
What? No. You got them wrong.

344
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,510
It wasn't them.

345
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,480
I was the one who reported them,

346
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,710
so I'd know.

347
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,820
You're the man
who kicked me on that day,

348
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,050
thinking I was the kidnapper.

349
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,350
You probably
didn't get a good look at them.

350
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,590
Trust me. I know it.

351
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,730
Hey, he said it wasn't us.

352
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,830
Hey, be quiet.

353
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,330
I mean, mister. Tell him.

354
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,670
Are we the kidnappers?

355
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,910
He's never had ramyeon
or tteokbokki in his life.

356
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,080
He's never bought any clothes...

357
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,350
because someone brings them for him.

358
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,420
He's never been
to a kids' cafe, either.

359
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,150
I feel so bad for Eun Ho.

360
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
Goodness, that poor kid.

361
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,590
His situation must be awful
if he can't afford ramyeon or tteokbokki.

362
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,130
Bo Ram, you should
invite him home sometime.

363
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,700
I'll make something delicious.

364
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,530
There are people who stay away from
those on purpose for health reasons.

365
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,800
But she said
he gets clothes from charity, too.

366
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,540
I'm home.

367
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,140
Hey, you're late.

368
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,310
I had to go somewhere.

369
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,950
Have some fruit.

370
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,380
Okay. Let me get changed first.

371
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,650
- Okay.
- Roar.

372
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,220
Try this, too.

373
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,230
- Do Yun, I'm coming in.
- Okay.

374
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,270
- Here are yours.
- Hey.

375
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,040
Thanks.

376
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,780
Whose handkerchief is that?

377
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,910
It's obviously not yours.

378
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,050
Your girlfriend? Yes?

379
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,420
My gosh. No. Last time...

380
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,820
If I may answer your question,
no, I'm not dating.

381
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,590
Come on.
You need to start going on dates.

382
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,360
Don't you think
your standards are too high?

383
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,630
I'm tall,
so of course, my standards are high.

384
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,700
- What?
- See? Look.

385
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,600
- I'm standing much higher than you.
- Come on. You're so silly.

386
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,430
This is why
you can't find a girlfriend.

387
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,900
Stop worrying about me,
and find your own dates.

388
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,270
Bo Ram is all I need.

389
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,240
Mommy!

390
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,010
Uncle!

391
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,380
- What?
- Yes, what?

392
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,650
- There's my love.
- Go, now.

393
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,890
They caught the kidnappers?

394
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,120
Yes.

395
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,630
- Where are you going?
- The police station.

396
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,430
Even at the kindergarten,
only the director knew...

397
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,770
that Eun Ho was YL's grandson.

398
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,830
But that kidnapper knew that,

399
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,200
as well as my phone number and yours.

400
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,070
It means he lurked around us
and kept his eyes on us.

401
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,680
Or there may be an accomplice.

402
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,980
I need to know...

403
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,550
how he found out about Eun Ho
and how they kidnapped him.

404
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,220
The police will
investigate everything.

405
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,050
They'll call us
when they have the result, so let's wait.

406
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,690
If we keep going to the police station,
the media may find out.

407
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,470
I'll ask them to demand
the harshest punishment.

408
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,200
Of course, we will.

409
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,040
He messed with a child,
not an adult,

410
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,370
and of all children, my son.

411
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,610
I'll make sure he never spends
another day outside. Don't worry.

412
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,090
Where's Gi Man?

413
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,630
He's still asleep
after drinking too much last night.

414
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,770
All he ever does is drink
because he has no joy in life.

415
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,300
You should eat.
I have to go to work right away.

416
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,370
You don't have to come
to Gi Chan's place tonight.

417
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,410
Na Ra and I are going by ourselves,
and that's final.

418
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,450
People say a woman's life
depends on who she marries,

419
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,750
but it doesn't apply
just to women in this day and age.

420
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,220
A man must marry the right woman
to turn his life around.

421
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,550
Gi Man's life has been nothing but trouble
after he married you.

422
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,460
You two were married for ten years,
but you haven't had a kid, either.

423
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,560
Every stock item and fund
he invests in becomes nothing.

424
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,900
Look at Gi Chan.

425
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,730
He now has a healthy son,

426
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,130
and his business is thriving.

427
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,940
It's all because
Jae In is a lucky woman.

428
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,570
I feel so confident
whenever I think of Gi Chan,

429
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,670
but all of that goes away
whenever I see you two.

430
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,040
I lose all my spirit.

431
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,880
Have fun at Jae In's place tonight.

432
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,410
I'm leaving.

433
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,450
Look at that girl.

434
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
She won't even pretend
to listen to her mother-in-law.

435
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,150
Who cares if you're a doctor?

436
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,800
Good grief. You reek of alcohol.

437
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,730
Get up. You have to go to work.

438
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,300
Darn it.

439
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,930
Jeez.

440
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,740
Gosh.

441
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,870
What's this?

442
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,340
"Hwang Gi Man, it's not just you."

443
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,380
(Mr. Hong)

444
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,340
"I'll also pull out..."

445
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,710
"hearts, eyes, livers, and kidneys
from your family,"

446
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,380
"skin them,"

447
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,780
"and drain every drop of blood..."

448
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,290
My gosh. Give it back.
Why are you reading that?

449
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,850
Give it to me. Let me see it.

450
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,720
Gosh, my heart is racing so fast.

451
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,890
Who's the lunatic
that sent you that message?

452
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,800
Who was it?

453
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,200
Give me that.

454
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,770
Give it to me.

455
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,110
- No.
- Give it to me.

456
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,340
Hello?

457
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,080
I am Hwang Gi Man's mother.

458
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,650
- Give it to me. Stop that.
- Stop it.

459
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,880
Did you send that text message?

460
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,090
What now? You'll take our hearts?

461
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,520
You'll skin me? Hey.

462
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,260
Do you know who my second son is?

463
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,290
He used to be a prosecutor...

464
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,060
who took in criminals!

465
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,370
What? What now?

466
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,870
You're crazy.

467
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,570
Who are you calling a kidnapper?

468
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,340
What?

469
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,850
What is he saying?

470
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,250
You were Eun Ho's kidnapper?

471
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,490
Tell me the truth!

472
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,030
I'm sorry.

473
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,430
My goodness. My gosh. You're...

474
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,400
Hey, don't be so mean
to your friend.

475
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,710
I want to go to the restroom.

476
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,050
You need to go to the restroom?

477
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,950
Hey! Stop it!

478
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,780
Eun Ho.

479
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,650
Uncle Gi Man.

480
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,590
I was going to go...

481
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,390
to an amusement park with you,

482
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,390
but something suddenly came up,
so I have to go somewhere.

483
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,460
That's why my friends will go...

484
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,570
and play with you.

485
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,740
They'll buy you the toys
and snacks you want to eat.

486
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,340
What do you say?
Do you want to go with them?

487
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,080
Okay.

488
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,150
Eun Ho, can you promise
you won't tell anyone...

489
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,620
that we met today...

490
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,720
and went to an amusement park?

491
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,860
Not even to my mommy and daddy?

492
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,660
Why?

493
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,060
It's because...

494
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,530
I'll get in lots of trouble
if they find out...

495
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,960
I took you to an amusement park...

496
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,970
instead of letting you stay
at the kindergarten.

497
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,170
I made you play instead of study.

498
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,800
Do you want me to get in trouble?

499
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,310
Or do you want to go back...

500
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,640
to the kindergarten?

501
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,880
So, it's a promise. Okay?

502
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,050
Promise me.

503
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,350
- We promise with all our hearts
- We promise with all our hearts

504
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,690
And make a copy. Swoosh.

505
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,100
They reported this to the police.

506
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,370
Call her right now
and tell her that.

507
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Also, have the toy
delivered tonight.

508
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,670
Why did you report this
if you wanted to see him again?

509
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,540
What?

510
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,580
No, I didn't. I mean it.

511
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,520
Who is that? Is that the kidnapper?

512
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,190
Darn it.

513
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,640
- How dare you kidnap a child?
- Wait!

514
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,910
There must be a misunderstanding.
Those two over there.

515
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,540
Get him.

516
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,810
Get that guy.

517
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,810
- Those two are on the same side!
- Darn it.

518
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,610
Hit me now.

519
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,620
Hey, you!

520
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,930
Mom...

521
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,430
So, the two of them were
caught by the police,

522
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,730
and the boss or whatever
began to blackmail you?

523
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,470
Yes.

524
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,940
Does your wife know?

525
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,110
No.

526
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,440
Don't tell her.

527
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,550
If your father-in-law finds out,

528
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,580
Chairman Kang will
also find out right away.

529
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,480
She cannot find out.

530
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,090
Mom, can you let me borrow
some money?

531
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,320
I'm serious. They might kill me.

532
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,460
Don't go outside for a while.

533
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,930
Just stay cooped up inside.

534
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,830
We have to go
to Jae In's place for dinner.

535
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,730
Good grief.
Don't you have any shame?

536
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,270
How can you want to go there?

537
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,570
We got invited,
so it's our duty to be there.

538
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,110
If you knew what your duty was,
why did you kidnap your nephew?

539
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,970
You have zero shame.

540
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,710
My goodness. It's just my luck.

541
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,610
I can't believe I was happy...

542
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,280
after giving you birth.

543
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,550
It's not like
I can stash you back inside.

544
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,150
It would've been much better
if Gi Chan were the eldest.

545
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,360
I wouldn't have had so much stress.

546
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,430
Listen up.

547
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,430
Do not mention
what you did to Eun Ho...

548
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,300
until the day you die.

549
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,400
If you ruin this family,

550
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,870
you'll die in my hands
before the loan sharks get to you.

551
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,640
Remember that.

552
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,420
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

553
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,400
Let's eat dinner.

554
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,040
I made a reservation
at a classy Korean restaurant.

555
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,810
I'm sorry.

556
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,810
We found Eun Ho safely,

557
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,810
so my family and my in-laws are
meeting up to celebrate.

558
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,690
I didn't know this was a bribe.

559
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,760
I was happy, thinking it was a gift,
not something to entice me.

560
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,490
I know you're disappointed,

561
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,660
but I have no choice.

562
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,030
Finding Eun Ho is enough.
Why is that dinner so important?

563
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,000
Do you really want me to stay?

564
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,400
If you say so, I'll stay.

565
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,640
Forget it. Go.

566
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,210
I don't want you
to feel belittled by your in-laws.

567
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,150
But tomorrow,
I'll do everything as you say.

568
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,370
She's Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee,
Mr. Kang's direct superior.

569
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,610
It must be quite tough.

570
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,380
Seung Woo doesn't know much,

571
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,210
so it must be hard
to get him to do some work.

572
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,050
It's all right.
Mr. Kang may not be proficient yet,

573
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,920
but he's doing his best.

574
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,050
If he tries to slack off
or mess around,

575
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,720
don't mind me
and give him a good lesson.

576
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,660
Yes, sir.
I'll reprimand him properly...

577
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,160
to make sure
the business doesn't suffer.

578
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,770
That's an answer I like.

579
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,470
Thank you.

580
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,600
Then, keep up the good work.

581
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,370
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

582
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,490
We're done!

583
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,420
We're done!

584
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,090
Let's give it to Grandma...

585
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,460
- when she leaves.
- Okay!

586
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,830
This is for you.

587
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,600
It's a present from me.

588
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,640
You're my present, Eun Ho.

589
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,370
I'll enjoy this. Thank you.

590
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,180
Hey, that must be Grandma.

591
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,950
Grandma!

592
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,330
You're the eldest in the family,
yet you can't even compare to Gi Chan.

593
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,570
You might as well call him
your older brother.

594
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,840
Death doesn't come that easily.

595
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,740
How dare you threaten me?

596
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,980
Pay me back first before you die.

597
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,010
My goodness. It's just my luck.

598
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,910
I can't believe I was happy...

599
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,480
after giving you birth.

600
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,350
It would've been much better
if Gi Chan were the eldest.

601
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,420
If you ruin this family,

602
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,890
you'll die in my hands
before the loan sharks get to you.

603
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,560
Remember that.

604
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,850
It must've been very stressful,

605
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,880
but you can relax now.

606
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,250
Goodness. Yes, of course.

607
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,090
I feel so relieved
to see Eun Ho here with us,

608
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,160
and I already feel full
without eating.

609
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,530
Why didn't Gi Man
and Yu Gyeong come?

610
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,860
I thought you'd all come together.

611
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,630
Mom told them not...

612
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,370
They were both too busy.

613
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,200
Yu Gyeong has to see
too many patients,

614
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:15,670
and my eldest son is
busy as a bee with his business.

615
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,950
Hey, Ja Young. Hey, Jae In.

616
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,320
- Aunt.
- Mi Ran.

617
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,390
You didn't even call.
When did you return?

618
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,790
Don't you see my suitcase?

619
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,290
Just now.

620
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,960
We can catch up a little later.

621
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,060
There's another guest.

622
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,500
Why isn't he coming?

623
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,540
Eun Ho! Your uncle is here!

624
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,310
Hwang Eun Ho!

625
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,870
Your uncle is here!

626
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:54,940
- Goodness.
- Your uncle is here.

627
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,650
Gi Chan! Hey, Jae In.

628
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,820
Goodness, Mom!

629
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,520
I'm here, your pathetic eldest son!

630
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,760
Goodness.

631
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,410
(Queen's House)

632
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,010
I came here today...

633
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,910
to tell everyone something.

634
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,150
I have...

635
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,350
My dear nephew.

636
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,190
Do you remember Se Ri,
my friend who lives in America?

637
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,530
You met her at our wedding.
Do you remember her?

638
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,930
Is it Gi Chan?

639
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,500
Ja Young, you may find this upsetting,

640
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,470
but YL Group must be carried on
by one of the Kangs.
