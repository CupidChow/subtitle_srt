1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,910
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,310
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,050
(Episode 80)

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,320
That evil lady...

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,420
pushed me.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,790
Have you been watching
that soap opera again?

8
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,360
"In-Law's House," right?
Was it on that show?

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,370
No, I thought of it myself.

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,100
Maybe not.
Did I see it in the drama?

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,510
Was that the story?

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,910
That drama has so many plots,
so even I'm getting confused.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,980
Think about it.

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,550
I don't know. I can't remember.

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,220
Mommy, I met with an angel.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,390
What? There's no such thing.

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,830
She's the prettiest woman
in the world.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,400
I gave her my favorite thing.

19
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,530
Gosh, I'm feeling great.

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,330
He gives me a headache.

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,500
It doesn't matter
if he's in his right mind or not.

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,770
All he cares about is looks.

23
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,350
Mom. I told you
not to let her in this house!

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,020
She's here for an interview...

25
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,080
for the tutor job.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,420
She'll leave soon.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,860
How dare you come in here? Get out.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,300
I won't make excuses anymore.

29
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,200
I'll stop acting like your wife
if you don't want that.

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,740
But let me live as Ji Ho,

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,970
and at least allow me to raise him.

32
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,640
He's never lived away from me
ever since he was born.

33
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,210
He's not good with strangers,
so he'll have a tough time...

34
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:51,080
if he gets raised
by someone he doesn't know.

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,020
Not all tutors are
guaranteed to be good,

36
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,960
and as you know, not many people
can handle your mother.

37
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,120
I won't ask for more.

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,760
Just let me take care of Ji Ho...

39
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,630
so that he'll grow up properly.

40
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,700
How am I going to trust you?

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,370
There's nothing else
I'm hiding from you.

42
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,540
You know everything about me now.

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,300
There's no other way
for me to betray you.

44
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,740
From now on, I'll do my best...

45
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,840
to be helpful to you, Mother,
and the rest of the family. Please?

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,020
Honey, Ji Ho is your son,

47
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,990
and he didn't do anything wrong.

48
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,350
His mommy is
perfectly well and alive.

49
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,320
Isn't it too cruel
to stop him from seeing me?

50
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,240
Mommy!

51
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,970
Ji Ho.

52
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,070
You've grown again.

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,880
- Didn't you miss me?
- I did.

54
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,610
Daddy, are you, Mommy, and I
going to live together again?

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,750
Are we?

56
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,780
Yes, Ji Ho.

57
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,220
Mommy, he just said
we can live together again.

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,420
Aren't you happy, too?

59
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,460
Yes, I'm so thrilled.

60
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,830
I'm holding interviews anyway,

61
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,830
so shouldn't I meet the others
before making a decision?

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,330
She didn't even graduate
from a decent university.

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,100
But Ji Ho is happy.

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm doing this for him.

65
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,770
It must've been tough
for you to look after him,

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,880
so you can give her the job now.

67
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,030
I thought of visiting you at home,

68
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,800
but I wasn't sure how Ja Young would be,
so I asked you to come.

69
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,960
I see.

70
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,470
I'm deeply grateful
for how you looked after...

71
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,140
not only Ja Young, but also Jae In.

72
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,670
Thank you.

73
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,640
I didn't do that
to have you thank me.

74
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,720
The late chairman was
like my family.

75
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,320
I feel very ashamed
to hear that from you.

76
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,630
Honestly speaking,
I still don't understand...

77
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,290
why you did everything to Jae In.

78
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,960
I know.
I've been reflecting on it, too.

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,170
It couldn't have been enough,
but I apologized to Jae In, too.

80
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,970
Yes, Mr. Do.
She won't do that anymore.

81
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,640
I'm glad to hear that.

82
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,280
Jae In wants to stay
at your place with Ja Young,

83
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,520
but I thought it'd be better
if you hired a caretaker.

84
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,850
That way, it'll be easier
for you to look after her.

85
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,090
We're doing well thus far.

86
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,560
Jae In is doing a great job
at looking after her,

87
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,430
and Yu Gyeong and I are also there.

88
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,560
I'll consider it
when things become harder.

89
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,330
I want to look after her
as long as I possibly can.

90
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,140
But why don't we keep it quiet
from Seung Woo for a while?

91
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,310
All right. He'll be shocked
and even begin to blame himself.

92
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,210
I'm sure he will.

93
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:11,420
Mom often wants to see him,

94
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,120
so can I let her do that?

95
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,990
We should let them meet. Go ahead.

96
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,230
I wanted to see you today
to thank you...

97
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,960
and help you return to work.

98
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,270
Me?

99
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,300
You were falsely blamed,
so I thought I should right the wrong.

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,210
It's all right.
I like my current life.

101
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,810
Are you sure?

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,110
If I return, I won't get to spend
as much time with Yu Gyeong.

103
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,050
I prefer to spend time
with my daughter.

104
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,650
I want to live my life
instead of taking up a job.

105
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,260
You need my home address?

106
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,770
Jae In's mother is
staying there, right?

107
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,040
Yes.

108
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,370
I wanted to see her.

109
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,140
There's no need to worry.

110
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,010
I just wanted to meet her and chat.

111
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,310
By any chance, did you find out
about the truth of the accident?

112
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,520
Tell me the address.

113
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,730
Well, you two should talk.

114
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,370
I'll be outside.

115
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,810
I'm here.

116
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,720
Who are you?

117
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,950
Ja Young, I'll keep calling you
by your name.

118
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,560
Is that okay?

119
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,730
All right.

120
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,060
You can do that if you want to.

121
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,140
I despised you so much...

122
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,600
for something you didn't do.

123
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,670
I almost blamed the innocent.

124
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,010
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,850
I'm so sorry.

126
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,820
It must've been hard for you, too.

127
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,950
Nothing in life is easy.

128
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,160
No matter how tough things are,
we must stay strong and brave.

129
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,230
Yes, you're right.

130
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,760
Let's stay strong and overcome this.

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,800
I'll accept your apology.

132
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,300
Don't cry.

133
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,310
I don't like seeing men cry,

134
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,810
but it's also not great
to see women do that.

135
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,550
All right. I won't cry.

136
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,550
But I'll get my revenge,

137
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,790
including what they did to you.

138
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,290
Once I begin a fight, I never lose.

139
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,260
I've begun a war against them.

140
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,760
Speaking of which,

141
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,460
I'll show them a preview
of how frightening I can be.

142
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,070
Wait.

143
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,870
You need a weapon
when you go to war.

144
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,770
A weapon?

145
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,810
Goodness, I don't need that.

146
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,510
If you don't want a weapon,
you must gear up...

147
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,850
so that no one can touch you.

148
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,630
Ms. Kang Se Ri?

149
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,870
Hello.

150
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,400
I am Team Leader Kang Se Ri
of YL's Planning and Design Team.

151
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,080
I don't like taking business cards
that aren't worth keeping.

152
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,650
The director asked me
to pay extra attention...

153
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,320
that a VIP customer
would be visiting us,

154
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,250
and had me come here,
although I'm a team leader.

155
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,990
You're looking to redecorate
your entire house, right?

156
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,990
You're here to escort a VIP,

157
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,800
so you must have some taste.

158
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,400
Make some recommendations.

159
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,470
This is a new design...

160
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,540
What about this one right here?

161
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,010
This is also popular
among our customers.

162
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,350
Would you like to take a look?

163
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,090
This is the best color mix we have,
and feel the texture.

164
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,170
This is
one of our bestselling designs...

165
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,600
Ma'am, why don't you decide
the kind of style you like...

166
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,600
and return here?

167
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,510
Your ignorance, incompetence,

168
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,870
and awful taste were...

169
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,640
why you failed to recognize
what the customer wanted,

170
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,380
and you chose to blame me?

171
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,020
That wasn't what I meant.

172
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,050
I wanted to provide
better customer service, so...

173
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,590
Forget it.

174
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,960
What do people
who have extramarital affairs like?

175
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,560
Why do you suddenly ask?

176
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,500
I want to make sure
I don't pick anything they do.

177
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,170
It's disgusting.

178
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,370
I'm not sure.
I don't know what those people like.

179
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,540
Why not?

180
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,640
You had an affair, too.

181
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,440
What was that channel?

182
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,150
Exposé World? The YouTuber
who exposes people through videos.

183
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,350
I think I saw you there.

184
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,920
I knew it. It was you.

185
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,320
I don't want recommendations
from someone gross like you.

186
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,860
I'll ask for someone else.

187
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,670
I, Noh Sook Ja,
never take anything from people.

188
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,410
I'll make sure
I teach her a good lesson...

189
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,410
and prevent her
from saying something weird to Oh Seong.

190
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,750
Mr. Do Min Jun!

191
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,090
Bring me some salt!

192
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,090
Yun Hee.

193
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,160
How dare you
set your filthy foot in here?

194
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,670
Yun Hee, will you really
continue to be this rude?

195
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,970
My son wasn't the one
who did that to your daughter!

196
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,670
It was Choi Ja Young,
Jae In's mother!

197
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,570
Why are you blaming my innocent son?

198
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,740
It must've been Jae In.

199
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,680
She must've talked you
into believing her.

200
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,280
I don't want to associate
with a murderer's mother.

201
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,650
Get lost!

202
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,250
What did you just say?

203
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
I can't stand this anymore!

204
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,560
Ms. Jung, I got salt.

205
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,330
What?

206
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,960
Goodness! Stop it! Cut it out!

207
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,930
- Stop it!
- I curse you!

208
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,440
- Goodness.
- This is just my luck.

209
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,440
Let's go back inside.

210
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,010
My gosh!

211
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,880
Fine. You're no longer my friend!
We're over!

212
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,150
Good grief. No, this is great.

213
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,290
Oh Seong is old enough,

214
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,520
and she's not even his mother.

215
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,390
He can always
cut ties with his sister.

216
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,900
Goodness gracious.
Darn it. It's salty.

217
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,570
Isn't this the YouTuber
who exposes people?

218
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,300
You're right. It's Exposé World.

219
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,600
The YouTuber must keep finding
more and more things to expose.

220
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,410
Why do you keep going back
to watch videos...

221
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,940
filled with slander
and false information?

222
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,180
We're at work.

223
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,080
Stop idling, and let's get to work.

224
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,680
I was reading the announcement...

225
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,890
Exposé World made
in the community tab.

226
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,650
An announcement?

227
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,160
It's an announcement...

228
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,760
that your past will be exposed
at 2 p.m. in 2 days.

229
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,400
What's wrong with this crazy punk?

230
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,470
This is like premeditated murder.

231
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,970
I'd say this YouTuber is
a sniper just for her.

232
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,180
Bang.
The accuracy rate is 100 percent.

233
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,680
I should get some popcorn...

234
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,620
to enjoy some laughter,
thanks to you, Se Ri.

235
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,680
Let me thank you in advance.

236
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,820
You should've become a comedian
with that kind of talent.

237
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,660
You might have done better
than working as a designer.

238
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,590
Be quiet!

239
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,630
You're louder than her.

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,430
- Let's go to the meeting.
- Okay.

241
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,510
How much more time do you need?

242
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,090
I don't get why you couldn't find
some YouTuber to this day.

243
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,520
Has the Korean police
always been this incompetent?

244
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,160
That was over the line.

245
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,300
I know I take bribes from you,
but I'm still a detective.

246
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,030
I'm still a civil servant.

247
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,330
I can't ignore my job
just to look for a YouTuber.

248
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,640
And all detectives have specialties
according to departments.

249
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,270
There are detectives, investigators,

250
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,040
cyber investigators,
the traffic department, and more.

251
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,850
There's a limit to what I can find.

252
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,220
So what?
Are you saying you can't do it?

253
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,120
Instead of looking
for this anonymous YouTuber,

254
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,490
it'll be much faster to pick out
a few people you're suspicious of...

255
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,190
and keep an eye on them
around the clock.

256
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,630
It's easier to conduct
a targeted investigation.

257
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,400
I can't do this alone,

258
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,530
so is there anyone
who can take this up?

259
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,570
There's a guy, but he's in hiding.

260
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,240
Who is it?

261
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,610
Hong Man Su. Can you find him?

262
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,650
Finding that punk is
a piece of cake.

263
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,720
There's a princess
I fell in love with...

264
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,090
for the first time in my life,

265
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,760
and she's really pretty.

266
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,960
My old auntie was pretty, too.

267
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,600
Who was the auntie?

268
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
My eldest uncle's wife.

269
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,630
Who's your eldest uncle?

270
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,270
Gi Man, just tell me
about the princess.

271
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,210
Yes, right. The princess.

272
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,180
I gave her ice cream, too.

273
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,210
Do you think
she knows that I like her?

274
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,020
Did you tell her?

275
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,880
No, but I gave her ice cream,

276
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,250
my favorite one.

277
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,920
Gi Man, you should've said...

278
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,820
you liked her
when you gave it to her.

279
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,890
How can she know
if you don't tell her?

280
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,230
She doesn't know
if I don't tell her?

281
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,270
Do you know
what's on my mind right now?

282
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,510
No, what's on your mind?

283
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,180
Tell her that you love her.

284
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,910
So, she can't know
if I don't tell her!

285
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,590
Ji Ho. Did your uncle go out?

286
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,790
- Yes.
- Where did he go?

287
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,560
He went to confess his love
for the princess he likes.

288
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,100
He had been talking about
that pretty girl lately.

289
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,140
He must've gone out to see her.

290
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,810
Good grief. It'll be better
if he finds someone new...

291
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,780
instead of fixating on Yu Gyeong.

292
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,180
Who's going to look after
that stupid boy when I die?

293
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,750
If she seems nice,
I'll make her marry him first.

294
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,000
Why are you here again?

295
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,110
Hello, my name is Hwang Gi Man.

296
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,710
Please take this.

297
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,190
I like you, Princess.

298
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,920
No, I love you.

299
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,800
I want you to appear in my dreams
every single night.

300
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,200
Who's this princess?

301
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,980
Goodbye, lady. No, Princess.

302
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,710
I'll stop by next time.

303
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,750
Wait...

304
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,360
It took me exactly three hours.

305
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,770
He was hiding in a hotel room.

306
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,770
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry!

307
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,780
Did you think
what I said was a joke?

308
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,610
Do you have multiple lives?

309
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,950
Do you want to die?

310
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,480
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,280
I truly deserve to die.

312
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,080
I'll return all your money.

313
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,150
Please spare my life, Mr. Chairman.

314
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,930
I'll stay loyal to you for life,
no matter what happens!

315
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,270
And you better not side
with Se Ri again.

316
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,130
If I catch you working with her
behind my back again...

317
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,500
I'll never do that again.

318
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,270
I'll let you know right away
when she puts me up for a job.

319
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,310
Why don't you stop here?
We need him to do a job.

320
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,510
I'll do anything.

321
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,050
I'll do my best
as if my life depends on it, sir!

322
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,120
Get your boys to tail
everyone you find inside...

323
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,630
and find out everything they do.

324
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,400
Of course. Yes, sir!

325
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,100
Really? Are you serious?

326
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,840
I felt so infuriated
to think I was deceived all along.

327
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,680
I despised...

328
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,510
and cursed Mi Sook,
Jae In's mother, so much.

329
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,580
I said so many awful things
I can't even take back now.

330
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,320
I felt bad,

331
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,720
thinking I must've taken part
in her developing dementia.

332
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,160
I went to see her, apologized,
and undid the misunderstanding.

333
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,890
I'm glad you did that.

334
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,100
It must've been a rough day.

335
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,060
I don't know.

336
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,670
I feel much calmer now.

337
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,340
Do Hee's unjust death
hasn't been resolved yet,

338
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,300
but I somehow feel hopeful, too.

339
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,410
Of course. We'll have them punished.

340
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,880
Trust him, Yun Hee.

341
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,410
It's just as Uncle Oh Seong said.
Trust me.

342
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,780
I'll let Do Hee rest in peace.

343
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,620
All right.
Who else am I going to trust?

344
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,350
Yun Hee.

345
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,760
I just thought of a great idea.

346
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,960
It's a perfect plan.
Don't you think?

347
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,970
He's right. It sounds perfect.

348
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,770
What is it?

349
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,910
What's all this?

350
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,980
I got these recommended
for your condition,

351
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,020
so I ordered some.

352
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,360
You said you felt stiff
when you woke up in the morning.

353
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,700
I've been feeling stiff and numb
all around my body lately.

354
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,160
Anyway, who told you
to give these to me?

355
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,170
Ms. Jung of the fried chicken place.

356
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,900
Do you remember her?

357
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,710
Of course. I worked there yesterday.

358
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,540
Goodness, Ms. Jung.
She didn't have to do this.

359
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,100
You can start taking this
and looking after yourself.

360
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,600
Make sure you don't forget.

361
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,810
Excuse me.

362
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,550
Hello, Ms. Sook Ja.

363
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,210
What brings you here?

364
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,020
I came because I haven't been well.

365
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,750
How can I be all right?

366
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,730
I didn't know
your older sister was like that,

367
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,630
but how can she be
so vulgar with her language?

368
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,100
The more I thought about it,
the more frightened and scared I was,

369
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,940
so I couldn't sleep last night.

370
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,970
Did something happen?

371
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,840
You know that the chairman
of YL Group is my son, right?

372
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,410
Yes.

373
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,210
She kept saying the chairman was...

374
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,320
No, my precious son was...

375
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,720
a murderer,

376
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,250
although the actual murderer
was someone else.

377
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,760
She's a woman named Choi Ja Young.
You must've seen her.

378
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,330
That part-timer who used to work
at the fried chicken place.

379
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,400
She's the culprit.

380
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,970
I believe
that case is still under trial.

381
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,270
You may get sued for defamation
if you slander her as the culprit...

382
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,170
when you aren't sure yet,
so be careful.

383
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,570
Oh, my. Is that so?

384
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,380
Were you worried about me?

385
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,150
Gosh, Oh Seong.

386
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,150
I knew you and I had
a special connection.

387
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,130
You had a guest.
I'll come back later.

388
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,160
Wait.

389
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,660
If you're done talking,
please leave.

390
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,770
I'm not done yet.

391
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,010
I have to tell him
something important, so please go.

392
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,340
Why don't you say hello?

393
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,880
You know her, right?
Director Kang Mi Ran.

394
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,950
I do. She's my ex-in-law's family,

395
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
so I'm not so pleased to see her.

396
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,080
It's not just that.
It must be quite unpleasant,

397
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,220
and I feel the same way.
I don't want to see you.

398
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,020
Oh, my. Then, you can resign.

399
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,860
Don't you know
who the chairman of YL is?

400
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,600
My goodness. How indecent.

401
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,500
You need to get your hand off her.

402
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,510
I have to discuss something important
with my girlfriend.

403
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,110
Goodbye, Ms. Sook Ja.

404
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,850
Your girlfriend?

405
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,320
Whose girlfriend?

406
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,590
Your girlfriend, Oh Seong?

407
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,990
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

408
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,690
We've been dating,

409
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,890
and we're in love.

410
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,500
So, please stop having
feelings for me.

411
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,830
How can you...

412
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,940
How can you play with my feelings?

413
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,610
- Are you okay?
- What?

414
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,710
Did it hurt?

415
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,450
Yes, it stings a little.

416
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,580
She has a wicked slap.

417
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,620
Are you serious?

418
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,050
I thought we were dating.

419
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,760
They caught the culprit?

420
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,100
Is it really the YouTuber
behind Exposé World?

421
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,770
No, I'll go with you.
I'll be there now.

422
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,910
So, the person behind
Exposé World wasn't Jae In?

423
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,980
That YouTuber never posted anything
far from the truth.

424
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,320
Why would you sue them?

425
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,020
These are facts. You can't sue them
for spreading false information.

426
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,860
Also, you can't call this
defamation, either.

427
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,290
You have no reputation to uphold.

428
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,890
Don't be so sarcastic.

429
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,000
I might sue you for defamation, too.

430
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,730
Anyway, congratulations.

431
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,470
The YouTuber has been caught,

432
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,700
so they won't get to expose
your true nature.

433
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,070
You're a lucky girl. Good for you.

434
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,280
Right? I don't know
about everything else,

435
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,080
but I was born under the lucky star.

436
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,480
That will come to an end, though.

437
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,150
What will happen
when your luck runs out?

438
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,020
Don't look forward to it.
That'll never happen.

440
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,830

who spread that video?

441
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,080
Do Yu Gyeong?

442
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,390
Yu Gyeong?

443
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,820
It was you?

444
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,730
We found the same mask
the YouTuber had been using...

445
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,160
in her bag.

446
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,030
I also checked the app on her phone,

447
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,530
and she was logged in
as Exposé World.

448
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,170
It has to be her.

449
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,710
Do Yu Gyeong. Was it you?

450
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,340
Was it really you?

451
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,080
You used to show your inferiority complex
against Jae In,

452
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,010
and now your target is me?

453
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,580
Answer me! Was it you?

454
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
That's enough.

455
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,490
People are watching.

456
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,820
Did she confess?

457
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,960
As you can see,
she's choosing to remain silent.

458
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,290
She hasn't said a word
since she arrived here.

459
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,300
I'll make a request to YouTube,
confirm her account information,

460
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,670
and secure hard evidence.

461
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,740
But this is an international app,
so it'll take a while.

462
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,810
I just talked
to the attorney, Mr. Do.

463
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,280
The attorney will go
to the police station...

464
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,450
and pick Yu Gyeong up now.

465
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,750
You don't have to worry.

466
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,060
She'll be freed right away.

467
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,590
All right. See you tonight.

468
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,460
What is this about?

469
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,330
The police station?

470
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,030
Where's Yu Gyeong right now?

471
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,570
She's at the police station.

472
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,040
What?

473
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,970
Calm down.
Let me explain everything.

474
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,450
Honey.

475
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,550
We should have a drink
to celebrate an occasion like this.

476
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,950
What's the occasion?

477
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,750
You already know.

478
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,960
We caught the YouTuber,

479
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,990
so no one will
make your life miserable again.

480
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,060
But you're still here.

481
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,830
Honey.

482
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,870
I wouldn't have been exposed
if it hadn't been for you.

483
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,040
Stop making me feel tired and leave.

484
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,790
I didn't expect DH Holdings
to hold an investment meeting...

485
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,160
for the fourth quarter
with YL Group.

486
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,390
You have been
rather distant from us lately.

487
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,500
I wouldn't do that.

488
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,200
As long as DH Holdings is
here as our investor,

489
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,530
I'll always do what I must.

490
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,870
You speak as if
our investment contract...

491
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,870
will expire soon.

492
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,510
I feel framed.

493
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,620
But why don't we take a look
at the presentation we prepared...

494
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,480

Welcome to Exposé World.

I'm deeply glad you're back...

of the worst scumbag.

502
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,210
As I previously announced,

503
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,880
I'm here to expose the mistress
of YL's chairman, Hwang Gi Chan,

504
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,890
Kang Se Ri, and share everything...

505
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,490
there is to know about this woman.

506
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,620
Shut up!

507
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Her mother worked
as a housekeeper for the YL family.

508
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,400
She wanted her daughter to live
a great life just like YL's girl,

509
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,900
so she also named her Kang Jae In.

510
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,040
However, all she ever did
was hit on men as a student.

511
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,610
Then, she'd threaten them
and tell them she was a minor...

512
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,870
to extort money from them.

513
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,380
That's not all.

514
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,910
She pretended to be
the real Kang Jae In of YL Group...

515
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,780
and assumed her identity.

516
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,680
She continued to use her identity
and caused trouble...

517
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,550
until the real Kang Jae In's mother
caught her.

518
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,590
No, this is wrong!

519
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:54,790

locked up at the mental hospital,

528
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,360
I signed the agreement...

529
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,560
to keep her there,
knowing it was illegal.

530
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,660
I do not deserve to work
as a doctor of family medicine.

531
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,130
Do you really believe
you are worthy to be the chairman?

532
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,000
It's impossible to claim
that he's worthy after this.

533
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,140
Isn't that so,
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan?

534
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,410
Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol
had left a slush fund?

535
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,680
Gi Chan,
how can you not tell me anything...

536
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,750
about the slush fund?

537
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,520
Stop talking nonsense and get lost.

538
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,590
