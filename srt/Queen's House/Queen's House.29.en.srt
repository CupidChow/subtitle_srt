1
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:21,585
Bo Ram, let's eat dinner.

2
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,215
- Ms. Kang, look at this. - Yes?

3
00:00:24,515 --> 00:00:25,755
She's my mommy.

4
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:43,275
Isn't my mommy pretty?

5
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:48,375
Ms. Kang?

6
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,075
What?

7
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,385
Hey, that must be Grandma.

8
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:03,655
What?

9
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:05,895
Little Grandpa!

10
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:08,325
You're home.

11
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:10,765
Yes, I'm home.

12
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,405
You're back.

13
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:17,905
You look so pale.

14
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:19,035
Do you feel unwell?

15
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:22,005
No, I should go to my room.

16
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,655
Something smells delicious.

17
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,925
Ms. Kang made dinner.

18
00:01:35,185 --> 00:01:39,055
- Then, shall we have a taste? - Shall we?

19
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:40,265
- Okay. - Let's go.

20
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:54,145
- It's still hot. - It's hot.

21
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,845
- Wait, let me get just one bite. - Wait.

22
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:58,545
Stop it. You're going to eat it all.

23
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:01,285
- Just one bite. - No, you can't.

24
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:02,845
You're going to eat it all.

25
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,455
I stayed here for too long.

26
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,425
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:25,905
Just let me leave.

28
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,445
There must be a reason why you're suddenly doing this.

29
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,015
I can't stay here.

30
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:36,815
You already know...

31
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:39,255
all about your sister,

32
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,585
Ms. Kim Do Hee.

33
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:45,355
How can I shamelessly stick around at your place?

34
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,325
I can't stay.

35
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,265
You already knew who I was.

36
00:02:54,705 --> 00:02:56,305
Why did you save me from reporters...

37
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,875
when my mom was hospitalized?

38
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:02,005
Then, you got me out of the mental institution,

39
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:04,545
and you saved me many times even after that.

40
00:03:06,215 --> 00:03:07,685
Why did you help me?

41
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,855
What if it wasn't to help you?

42
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:13,855
I'm not that kind.

43
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,355
You took me the wrong way.

44
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,725
I wanted you to be miserable.

45
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,535
- Then, why... - I wanted you to feel...

46
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,835
as much pain as my family, the pain of losing...

47
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,605
the dearest person to you.

48
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,405
I wanted you to feel the same way.

49
00:03:36,745 --> 00:03:38,345
I thought that was how I could get revenge...

50
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:40,815
against your mother.

51
00:03:43,715 --> 00:03:45,385
I thought I'd be happy when it happened,

52
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,095
but I realized I was nothing but another monster,

53
00:03:52,795 --> 00:03:53,965
just like your mother.

54
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:01,465
I never once hoped your son would die.

55
00:04:02,535 --> 00:04:03,675
I know.

56
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,405
It wasn't your fault.

57
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:09,745
What do you want me to do?

58
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,875
What can I do...

59
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,385
to get your forgiveness?

60
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:19,115
I've put it off.

61
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,355
I've put it off for now.

62
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:28,025
I'm not even sure if forgiving you is...

63
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:32,095
even possible for me.

64
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,505
Don't run away...

65
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:44,115
and stick around here until I decide.

66
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,015
But how can I face Ms. Jung?

67
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,145
What about Bo Ram?

68
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:53,525
I can't do that.

69
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:58,595
What if that's your punishment?

70
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:12,205
Jae In.

71
00:05:15,845 --> 00:05:18,215
She must've felt burdened to stay here.

72
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,715
There's no pressure.

73
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,655
We're just making one more serving of food for every meal.

74
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,125
Why did you try to leave after making that delicious dinner?

75
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,355
I would've gone around looking for you...

76
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,895
if you left like this.

77
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:39,235
Don't tell my family who you are.

78
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,475
You're crying again.

79
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:47,845
I told you to brace yourself.

80
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:49,675
Ms. Kang!

81
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,415
Where have you been?

82
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,615
I didn't see you anywhere, so I kept looking for you.

83
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:00,925
I'm sorry, Bo Ram.

84
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:04,425
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:18,835
She accepted the investment offer without a hint of doubt?

86
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,645
She must've been desperate.

87
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:25,015
I was entrusted to invest her entire fortune into the company.

88
00:06:25,215 --> 00:06:26,415
Should I proceed as planned?

89
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,685
Make sure you move discreetly so that Choi Ja Young...

90
00:06:29,685 --> 00:06:30,955
never finds out about this.

91
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:32,615
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:33,755
Good work.

93
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:35,585
You may leave now. I'll stay in touch.

94
00:06:35,725 --> 00:06:37,025
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

95
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:43,635
Say what you have to say, and then leave.

96
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:46,295
I get that you're heartbroken,

97
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:48,205
and I also felt really bad.

98
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:50,135
I want to do whatever I can to help you feel better,

99
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:52,435
but I don't know what to do.

100
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:56,205
Why won't you think of Ji Ho?

101
00:06:56,705 --> 00:06:58,345
He kept asking if we had a fight...

102
00:06:58,345 --> 00:06:59,715
and began to walk on eggshells around us.

103
00:07:00,515 --> 00:07:02,715
If you show him at least a quarter of your concern for Eun Ho...

104
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:07,555
What did I do so wrong?

105
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:10,955
You sent Eun Ho to his room on Ji Ho's birthday!

106
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:14,625
He couldn't have left if you didn't send him away.

107
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:16,965
So, why are you taking this out on me?

108
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,865
Shouldn't you be mad at Jae In?

109
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:21,635
So, why did you let her mother get released?

110
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:25,335
I really don't understand what you're thinking.

111
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:27,075
What's going on?

112
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:29,405
I have my plans.

113
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,645
- Do I have to explain everything? - Sure.

114
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:33,715
I'm sure you have a plan.

115
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:35,415
I'll wait.

116
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:38,015
But don't leave me lonely for too long.

117
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:40,685
I may leave with Ji Ho.

118
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:55,365
What did your father say? Why do you keep blaming me?

119
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:00,175
I didn't make him take up that part-time job.

120
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,105
I told you again and again that I found out much later...

121
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:05,045
and stayed quiet because he asked me to.

122
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:07,345
If you were that worried about him,

123
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:09,345
why didn't you visit him more often?

124
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:12,785
Do you know how hard it is for me to face him?

125
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:15,385
I'm too embarrassed about you.

126
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,355
My self-worth and pride have both fallen.

127
00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:19,355
I make you embarrassed?

128
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:20,965
I see.

129
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:23,125
Are you embarrassed because I'm unemployed?

130
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,295
No, it's not that.

131
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:27,135
Did you think it was pathetic that I worked for my mom?

132
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,405
I wasn't the one who refused to take up a blue-collar job...

133
00:08:29,405 --> 00:08:31,505
just because you once had a white-collar job.

134
00:08:31,835 --> 00:08:33,235
It was you.

135
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,045
Stop playing around with words.

136
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:36,305
Why do I make you embarrassed?

137
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:37,975
Give me a good reason!

138
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:40,175
Don't you feel embarrassed to face Gi Chan?

139
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:43,045
Are you saying I'm pathetic and incompetent as an older brother?

140
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:46,085
Are you comparing me to him?

141
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:48,555
I have lots of things to say in that aspect.

142
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:50,355
It's the same for me.

143
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,695
If I had known...

144
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:53,795
Jae In's family was much more affluent than yours,

145
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,665
I wouldn't have married you.

146
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,865
I would've hit on Jae In.

147
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,435
That's not all.

148
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,265
You can't even have kids.

149
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,405
You're the worst.

150
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,975
There are some things you should never say out loud.

151
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:10,775
So, why did you start this?

152
00:09:10,915 --> 00:09:12,175
It would've been fine if you hadn't.

153
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:16,315
How did you turn into a completely different person?

154
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,255
You weren't the only one who got betrayed.

155
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,425
I was betrayed, too.

156
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:26,955
All I need is one big break.

157
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:30,665
Just wait. I know I can be a bigger shot than Gi Chan.

158
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:31,895
I can be even richer.

159
00:09:32,365 --> 00:09:34,205
As soon as I make enough seed money...

160
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,635
Why? Will you kidnap Ji Ho this time?

161
00:09:37,605 --> 00:09:39,575
What is this nonsense?

162
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:42,845
Dad already knows that you kidnapped Eun Ho.

163
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:44,815
Did you tell him?

164
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:47,015
Why would I embarrass myself?

165
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:54,425
What?

166
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:58,925
Se Ri, I need water.

167
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:03,865
Na Ra, why are you totally hammered?

168
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:05,635
I don't need that.

169
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:08,835
Se Ri, I'd like to order.

170
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:10,035
Water, please.

171
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:12,135
What?

172
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,245
Where's Se Ri?

173
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:17,875
Se Ri, I need water.

174
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:20,645
Give her water.

175
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:21,715
Gosh.

176
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:25,355
Hey! Stand straight.

177
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:29,125
A girl like you shouldn't get that drunk!

178
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,525
Hey, no!

179
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,895
Gosh. I need water.

180
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:48,005
So, Gi Man was the one who kidnapped Eun Ho?

181
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:51,015
How interesting.

182
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,385
I missed Eun Ho to death...

183
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:00,655
after he passed away.

184
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,425
I wanted to hold him in my arms...

185
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:05,355
and touch him.

186
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:07,625
It drove me crazy.

187
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:12,465
And selfishly enough, I thought only I felt that way.

188
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:15,005
But Ms. Do Hee,

189
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:17,835
your mother must've felt the same when she lost you.

190
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:21,505
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,775
I'm so sorry.

192
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:29,045
Just as your brother said, if this is my punishment,

193
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:30,915
I'll receive it gladly.

194
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:33,655
I can never make up for your vacancy,

195
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:38,295
but I'll do my best for your mother and Bo Ram.

196
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:42,825
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:46,835
I'm so sorry, Ms. Do Hee.

198
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:05,915
Do Hee.

199
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,085
What should I have done?

200
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,655
Don't you think she was punished enough?

201
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:18,935
Her father died, her son died,

202
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:20,735
and she lost her family's business.

203
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,605
She was barely holding on,

204
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,135
as if she could die any minute.

205
00:12:28,675 --> 00:12:29,875
Kicking her out of this place...

206
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:32,315
seemed like I'd be cornering her into death.

207
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,455
But still, should I have looked the other way?

208
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,485
I hate myself...

209
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:44,895
for worrying about...

210
00:12:46,755 --> 00:12:47,965
that woman.

211
00:12:56,105 --> 00:12:57,165
What do you think?

212
00:12:57,835 --> 00:13:00,175
It's a little bland. It can use a bit more salt.

213
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,445
Okay.

214
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:04,945
Are you going to work?

215
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:06,615
You should eat breakfast.

216
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:09,445
She got up early...

217
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,455
and made everything, including soup and side dishes.

218
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,055
Do Hee used to do the same, saying I worked too hard.

219
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:19,195
I'm saying it feels less empty to have Jae In here with us.

220
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:20,525
Do you want breakfast?

221
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:25,235
Okay. I want a huge serving.

222
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:28,305
Can we talk for a second?

223
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:34,445
You should go. I'll do the rest.

224
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:35,975
Okay.

225
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:42,885
You'll go to the hospital today to meet the hit-and-run driver, right?

226
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,615
Can I do that?

227
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,385
What do you mean?

228
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,085
You said that something seemed suspicious.

229
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:50,585
Then, you should go.

230
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:53,195
I felt too ashamed.

231
00:13:53,595 --> 00:13:54,895
Can I really do that?

232
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:56,525
Of course, you should.

233
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,195
Do Hee's thing is unrelated to Eun Ho's accident.

234
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:03,035
You should find out the truth behind his accident.

235
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:06,535
I looked into it and found out he really was terminally ill.

236
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:09,275
Let me know if you need my help.

237
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:11,975
I want to meet him and try persuading him.

238
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:14,285
I'll do my best, and if that still doesn't work,

239
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:15,715
I'll ask you for help.

240
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,485
Okay.

241
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:23,385
It's me, Attorney Seo.

242
00:14:23,825 --> 00:14:25,395
Why is it so hard to reach you?

243
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,495
You're overseas?

244
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,565
You left to get the business listed on NASDAQ?

245
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,165
Call me as soon as you return.

246
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:39,735
Just wait, Jae In.

247
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,845
I'll show you how I get revenge on Gi Chan.

248
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,305
What do you think you're doing?

249
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:14,275
- You're not going anywhere. - Ouch!

250
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:17,545
That's my hair. My hair! It hurts!

251
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:25,155
I've been wondering who kept adding more garbage to our trash bags.

252
00:15:25,485 --> 00:15:27,255
It was you, neighbor?

253
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:31,855
Well, there was a lot of space left,

254
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,425
so I thought it was a waste.

255
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:35,225
If we fill it up to the brim,

256
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,865
it'll do you, me, everyone,

257
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:38,465
and their mom some good.

258
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:43,735
Anyway, I was just doing good work for our environment and country.

259
00:15:44,975 --> 00:15:48,705
Why would you do that with my trash bags?

260
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,675
I've already seen the bag getting popped many times.

261
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:53,715
Wait.

262
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:56,915
You used to throw away trash in my trash can in the old days.

263
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:01,425
See? Do you still not remember who I am?

264
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:06,155
What's going on, Yun Hee?

265
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:09,565
- Goodness. - Hey, yes. I finally remember...

266
00:16:09,565 --> 00:16:11,935
everything completely.

267
00:16:12,835 --> 00:16:15,105
We had a great run when we lived in the same place.

268
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:19,635
I guess we're meant to be neighbors.

269
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,345
How did we end up next to each other again?

270
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,525
This world is such a small place.

271
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:38,525
So, she lived next door when you lived in that shabby town?

272
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,995
I was going to feign ignorance as much as I could,

273
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:42,825
but she has such a nasty character.

274
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,535
Just let it go. It's not even a big deal.

275
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:46,995
This wasn't the first time!

276
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,165
Anyway, how do you know her?

277
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:52,405
I've run into her a couple of times.

278
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,905
Anyway, you told me to come and talk to you.

279
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:56,905
Yes, right!

280
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,545
That's Do Hee's bankbook.

281
00:17:03,045 --> 00:17:04,815
I went to the bank to close her account,

282
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,285
but I saw that YL Group sent a payment a few months ago.

283
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:10,025
It said it was her severance pay,

284
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,295
but don't you think that's too much?

285
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,165
I'll look into it.

286
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,965
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

287
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:25,135
Come in.

288
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:35,645
Have a seat.

289
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,815
- Would you like some tea? - No, thank you.

290
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:51,635
If you're going to play smart,

291
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,635
you should've done it in a good way. What is this?

292
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:55,005
Severance pay?

293
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,535
It was paid as Ms. Kim Do Hee's severance pay.

294
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:01,645
Do you always give this much to a mere assistant manager?

295
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:04,675
There's a welfare department within the company,

296
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:06,675
and it probably added some condolence money.

297
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:10,215
Is that...

298
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:12,755
really all?

299
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,225
And I personally added more as a token of condolence.

300
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:18,825
Why would you do that?

301
00:18:20,495 --> 00:18:23,565
Have you ever shared a word with Do Hee at work?

302
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:26,695
You don't even know who she is. Why did you give us this money?

303
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:30,405
You said she was your niece.

304
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,945
I can show that much thought to my acquaintance's family.

305
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:42,185
I didn't know we were close enough...

306
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:45,455
to exchange condolence money.

307
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:49,455
All I remember is utter betrayal,

308
00:18:50,785 --> 00:18:52,695
yet you call me your acquaintance?

309
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:56,525
If you were displeased about that,

310
00:18:57,165 --> 00:18:59,595
then let's call it something Chairman Kang would've done.

311
00:19:00,495 --> 00:19:01,865
If he had been still with us,

312
00:19:02,335 --> 00:19:04,305
he would've given you the money in any way possible.

313
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:06,675
I already know...

314
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,705
his best move is quietly silencing people with money.

315
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:11,875
So, you want to silence us with your brother's money?

316
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:14,585
That doesn't work in this day and age.

317
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,515
Do not humiliate the deceased like that.

318
00:19:17,285 --> 00:19:18,855
I'll sue you for defamation.

319
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:21,155
If you want to take it to court...

320
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:23,985
and go out of your way to find out...

321
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,755
which one of us is more morally corrupt, go ahead.

322
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,325
I also want to find out how that'll end.

323
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:33,735
I don't see any reason to continue this discussion.

324
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:35,005
You should leave.

325
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,335
I should've cut to the chase.

326
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:40,705
Let me keep it short.

327
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:44,675
Give me the bank account number. I'll return everything.

328
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:46,675
The company already processed everything.

329
00:19:47,415 --> 00:19:49,145
Let's not do this over something in the past.

330
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:51,185
How dare you call this something in the past?

331
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:54,655
My family...

332
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:58,525
still hasn't been freed...

333
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:01,665
from the pain and sorrow.

334
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:05,065
Everything is still going on!

335
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:08,235
We didn't give you permission...

336
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:11,475
to consider everything as something in the past!

337
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:13,475
Are you all right?

338
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:17,105
I get it, so you should go.

339
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:18,345
What do you get?

340
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:22,915
I just heard you talk about us like we were a joke.

341
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:25,855
Apologize right now!

342
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:26,955
Who do you think you are?

343
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:29,125
How dare you yell at her?

344
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:33,695
Stay out of this.

345
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:34,865
You need to go and do your job.

346
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,265
Many corporations these days...

347
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:39,695
always put customers first in their management...

348
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,465
and are busy bringing up new talent.

349
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:42,865
So, here's a piece of advice.

350
00:20:43,305 --> 00:20:45,035
I guarantee that YL Group will...

351
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:47,205
go bankrupt very soon...

352
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,475
due to ineffective management and failing leadership,

353
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:51,145
falling into a sense of supremacy.

354
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:53,445
Otherwise, I'll eat my hat.

355
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:56,915
Who do you think you are?

356
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:59,415
How dare you utter this nonsense?

357
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:02,085
Why would my company go down? It'll never fail!

358
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:03,755
Your company?

359
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,955
Mr. Kang, you need to leave.

360
00:21:06,025 --> 00:21:08,795
Yes, this is my company.

361
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,665
The late Chairman Kang Gyu Cheol was my father.

362
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:14,565
I'll turn this into the best company in the world.

363
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:19,105
Why did you laugh?

364
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,705
What's so funny?

365
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,675
Do you think I can't do it?

366
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,775
I'll make sure...

367
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:27,715
you eat your hat, so just wait.

368
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:30,745
All right. Let's find out which one of us will eat his hat.

369
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:32,985
Hey, it's a bet.

370
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:34,385
You can't take it back.

371
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:41,995
Send me the bank account number.

372
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:45,035
Otherwise, I'll throw it in cash all around your company's lobby.

373
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:46,865
And when I say I'll do it, I do it.

374
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:54,945
Why did you come in and blow this up?

375
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,905
How can I just stand around after hearing him say that?

376
00:21:57,345 --> 00:21:58,575
Who is that man?

377
00:21:58,845 --> 00:22:00,515
What money is he returning?

378
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:02,445
It's not your concern. You should go and do your job.

379
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:03,645
Aunt Mi Ran!

380
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:04,815
Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo!

381
00:22:05,855 --> 00:22:06,985
We're at work.

382
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,235
Young Woong.

383
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:27,575
Have fun playing a ball game with Mommy.

384
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:28,975
- Okay, Daddy. - Okay.

385
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:30,675
Let's go.

386
00:22:35,545 --> 00:22:37,485
You don't have to mind me. Just go.

387
00:22:38,015 --> 00:22:39,285
He's waiting.

388
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,235
I heard you couldn't drink a drop of alcohol.

389
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:54,395
So, why did you...

390
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:57,505
do that to my son after getting drunk?

391
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:59,205
Why?

392
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,405
You're hiding something, right?

393
00:23:03,345 --> 00:23:05,215
I shared everything with the police.

394
00:23:05,715 --> 00:23:08,845
I have nothing more to say, so please leave.

395
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:14,415
I'll come back tomorrow.

396
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:31,165
Honey, look at Young Woong.

397
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,705
Say hi to Daddy.

398
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,975
That must've been shocking. Are you okay?

399
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:10,205
Young Woong!

400
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:12,415
Goodness, are you okay?

401
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:13,715
Are you all right?

402
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:14,985
- Yes. - My gosh.

403
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:16,315
Thank you.

404
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:18,655
Thank you. Thank you so much.

405
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:24,825
Thank you.

406
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:31,295
My husband gave this to me the night before the accident...

407
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:33,435
and told me to use it after he died.

408
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:39,305
Honey, she saved Young Woong without even thinking.

409
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:40,735
You saw everything, too.

410
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:44,005
And we should also show some basic human decency.

411
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:48,815
Do you want to be a shameful father to our son?

412
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:51,815
You shouldn't commit more crimes for his sake, honey.

413
00:24:53,255 --> 00:24:55,755
Tell Ms. Kang everything. Okay?

414
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:03,495
Someone made me do it.

415
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:07,165
- Who was it? - Mr. Hong.

416
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:09,335
It was a man named Hong Man Su.

417
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:13,375
I took out a private loan from him,

418
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:15,475
and he offered to write it off...

419
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:17,975
and pay me more money on top of that.

420
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,445
I wanted my family...

421
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,615
to live a better life after my death,

422
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:25,715
so I accepted it.

423
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:29,255
Why would anyone make you kill an innocent boy?

424
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:32,055
No, it wasn't the boy.

425
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:34,625
It was you.

426
00:25:36,795 --> 00:25:38,065
What are you talking about?

427
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:40,465
I was told to kill you.

428
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:43,365
But...

429
00:25:44,505 --> 00:25:46,605
I didn't know that boy would run out.

430
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:53,015
I really didn't want to do that...

431
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:56,785
to your son.

432
00:25:57,585 --> 00:25:58,685
I'm sorry.

433
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:01,185
I'm so sorry.

434
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:10,595
It may be belated,

435
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:14,195
but you must share the truth with the police.

436
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:16,305
Please...

437
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:19,075
let Eun Ho rest in peace...

438
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,575
without any injustice.

439
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:23,705
Please.

440
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,145
I'll state the truth...

441
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,715
and gladly accept my punishment.

442
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:34,885
I'm so sorry.

443
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:44,695
I got some adhesive bandages.

444
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:00,115
Right here.

445
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,835
I was just about to leave.

446
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:25,375
Why did you want to see me?

447
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:28,175
Let's eat dinner with Ji Ho.

448
00:27:29,175 --> 00:27:30,345
So, you aren't mad anymore?

449
00:27:30,745 --> 00:27:31,915
I'm doing my best.

450
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:34,045
I don't want Ji Ho to walk on eggshells.

451
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,645
I'll do my best, too.

452
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:38,555
Thank you.

453
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:40,715
Let's go.

454
00:27:42,585 --> 00:27:43,685
One moment.

455
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,265
Hello?

456
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:50,365
The police station?

457
00:27:50,995 --> 00:27:52,765
The culprit said I put him up for it,

458
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:53,765
so I got arrested.

459
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:58,005
Do not say a word until I get there.

460
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,845
Don't answer any questions the detectives ask. Okay?

461
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:04,445
What's going on?

462
00:28:07,915 --> 00:28:09,615
Hello, Detective Baek. It's me.

463
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,415
I have a favor to ask you.

464
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:23,625
Gosh, this feels nice.

465
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:26,265
Goodness. This is so comfy.

466
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:32,535
Hey, it's rather firm, yet so comfortable.

467
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:35,145
Your back health is important.

468
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:39,315
I knew it. I felt so relaxed...

469
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:40,675
even after a short nap here.

470
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:44,085
I got a bad back after working out in the sea for so long.

471
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:46,215
You should take the bed.

472
00:28:46,315 --> 00:28:47,485
I'll sleep on the floor.

473
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:50,085
No, I can't do that to you.

474
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:52,225
Your back needs to feel good for you to sleep well.

475
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:54,865
Uncle Oh Seong, a healthy back is important to men.

476
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:56,065
You should take good care of yourself.

477
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,295
Thanks.

478
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,265
Gosh, I'll always get a good sleep from now on.

479
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:04,935
It's great to have a doctor as a nephew.

480
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:07,075
You're even considerate of your uncle's back health.

481
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:09,775
- Man. - Get a good rest.

482
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:10,845
Okay.

483
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:13,045
Gosh, this feels so good. Oh, my back.

484
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:15,345
"The man said hello,"

485
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:17,815
"and the sweet little girl went her way..."

486
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:20,855
Bo Ram, I'm going to check on Grandma.

487
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:22,385
Have fun with Ms. Kang.

488
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,425
- Okay. - You should go.

489
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:25,895
Okay.

490
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:31,635
"At times, when he gets mad..."

491
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,035
Hello?

492
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:38,475
He was caught?

493
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,505
Yes, okay.

494
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:45,615
Bo Ram, something urgent came up, so I need to go out.

495
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,585
I have to go to the police station.

496
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:49,815
Could you keep an eye on Bo Ram?

497
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:52,055
The police station? Why?

498
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:57,985
Little Grandpa, please make the story fun for me.

499
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:01,355
Yes, okay. What were you reading?

500
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,495
- Let's start fresh. - "Hello."

501
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:06,595
(Call 112 to report criminal activities.)

502
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:10,805
Sorry!

503
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:17,745
Chairman Hwang Gi Chan.

504
00:30:19,745 --> 00:30:20,815
I won't see you off.

505
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:22,285
Thanks for your hard work.

506
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:23,715
Let's grab a drink with the police commissioner soon.

507
00:30:23,815 --> 00:30:25,585
Goodness, let's do that.

508
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:29,485
Man Su, live a good life.

509
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:32,955
Yes, sir.

510
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:35,565
Someone made me do it.

511
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:37,665
It was a man named Hong Man Su.

512
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:41,495
I was told to kill you.

513
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:43,705
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

514
00:30:47,205 --> 00:30:48,705
You saved my life.

515
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:50,145
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

516
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:57,515
You have my loyalty.

517
00:30:58,245 --> 00:30:59,315
Watch what you say.

518
00:30:59,515 --> 00:31:00,715
We're at a police station.

519
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:49,765
(Queen's House)

520
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,165
Hwang Gi Chan.

521
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:53,675
I hoped you wouldn't be that low.

522
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:58,815
Ms. Choi, I'm here because your long-term stay wasn't paid.

523
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:02,285
Don't make a huge scene over a delay in that small payment.

524
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:07,715
This woman, Kang Jae In, is very persistent.

525
00:32:08,255 --> 00:32:09,525
He's not even her husband,

526
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:11,485
but she's doing her best to keep him alive.

527
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:13,295
What?

528
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:14,795
What's going on?

529
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:16,425
I've been looking into Do Hee's whereabouts...

530
00:32:16,425 --> 00:32:18,125
on the day of her accident.

531
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:20,135
Doesn't that seem odd?
