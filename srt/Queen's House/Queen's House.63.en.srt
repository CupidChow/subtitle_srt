(Episode 63)

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,820
Where's Ms. Kang Jae In?

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,220
She got discharged.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,060
She left with her husband.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Have you been well?

10
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,680
Na Ra?

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,780
It's you, right?

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,520
Do you not remember me?

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,190
You look quite different.

14
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,460
Is it because I'm seeing you
for the first time since high school?

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,860
She got a lot of surgery done.

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,470
Nothing on her face is organic.

17
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,100
Gi Man! Plastic surgery only works
on people who are already pretty.

18
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,300
That's enough.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,280
Welcome back, Jae In.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,140
Congratulations
on getting discharged.

21
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,550
Thank you, Mother.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,950
Thank you for keeping my house safe.

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
What?

24
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,560
He told me everything
on our way here.

25
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,360
My dad passed away,

26
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,390
and I was in the hospital
for such a long time,

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,990
so I heard my mom had been
staying abroad in shock.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,860
And Aunt Mi Ran and Seung Woo
moved out together, right?

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,600
I was worried about my house
after hearing that,

30
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,870
but I was relieved when he said
you had been looking after it.

31
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,870
Thank you, Mother.

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,810
Sure. That's the least I can do.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,420
Jae In.

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,960
Se Ri, is that you?

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,660
Yes, it's me.

36
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,900
Congratulations on your discharge.

37
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,370
My goodness.
Don't you live in America?

38
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,370
I've returned a while ago.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,700
Ji Ho, say hello to your mommy.

40
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,810
Hi, Mommy.

41
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,950
Mommy?

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,650
Me?

43
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,490
Yes.

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,820
It was going to be a surprise gift,
but I missed my chance.

45
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,290
You thought you lost the baby
in the accident, right?

46
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,460
But you didn't.

47
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,540
Listen up, Ji Ho.

48
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,610
Some lady will visit us here soon.

49
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,840
You've met her once before,

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,050
and she'll live with us for a while.

51
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,520
But she was very sick,

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,650
so she might think you're her son
when she sees you.

53
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,460
But I'm your son.

54
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,590
Yes, you're my son.

55
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,500
But that poor lady is sick.

56
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,430
Don't you want to help
people who are in need?

57
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,070
Then, can you call her mommy?

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,940
If you do,
she'll feel much better...

59
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,010
and get well soon. Okay?

60
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,590
Your name is Ji Ho?

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,600
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,770
Mommy's sorry
for not recognizing you, Ji Ho.

63
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,640
Come here.

64
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,510
Ji Ho.

65
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,150
Mommy's sorry.

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,590
I'm sorry for not recognizing you.

67
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,590
My boy.

68
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,830
Ji Ho.

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,260
Ji Ho.

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,510
My Ji Ho.

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,750
Ji Ho.

72
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,150
Can I tag along for a tour?

73
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,990
Yes, of course.

74
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,390
What's wrong?

75
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,000
Everything is different
from my memories.

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,530
Did you redecorate?

77
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,030
What?

78
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,670
Yes, it seemed outdated,
so I had it changed.

79
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,440
What's wrong?

80
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,480
It seems too gaudy and flashy.

81
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,550
Our bedroom should be relaxing...

82
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,280
to add psychological comfort.

83
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,850
It would've been better
if it were simple with subtle elegance.

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,420
You said you'd study
interior design. Did you not?

85
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,090
What?
Well, I've been busy with work.

86
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,760
Se Ri, it must be your first time
coming into this room.

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,430
What do you think?
Isn't it a bit tacky?

88
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,700
Everyone has different tastes.

89
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,370
He must've gone out of style
while I was away.

90
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,380
Honey, let's go to Ji Ho's room.

91
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,810
I want to see his room, too.

92
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,190
What do you think
about Eun Ho's room?

93
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,360
Eun Ho?

94
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,460
Who's Eun Ho?

95
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,470
I thought his name was Ji Ho.

96
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,270
His name is Ji Ho.
She must've been confused.

97
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,980
Do you not like this room, either?

98
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,550
It's not that. It was heartbreaking
to think he grew up...

99
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,120
without his mom.

100
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,390
I'm so happy to know
death didn't come our way.

101
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,730
Yes, I'm very glad you're alive.

102
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,330
Not me. I mean our son.

103
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,800
What would I have done if he died?

104
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,240
I don't even want to imagine that.

105
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,080
I'm so glad
you were here for our son.

106
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,970
Why is it so hot in here?

107
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,470
Even the air conditioning is on.

108
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,140
(Managing Director Kang Mi Ran)

109
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,270
You're in menopause.

110
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,710
The hormonal change
may give you hot flashes...

111
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,010
and make you sweaty.

112
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,420
This is good for menopause.
It's my present.

113
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,460
Did I just hear you right?

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,600
Jae In is alive,

115
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,370
but her memories stop
before Eun Ho was born?

116
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,500
It's hard to believe, right?

117
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,740
I couldn't believe it, either,
but when I saw her,

118
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,210
I realized it was true.

119
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,780
I should tell Mom...

120
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,520
I should tell her mom, right?

121
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,750
She'll be greatly shocked
to hear about Jae In.

122
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,920
On top of that, if she finds out...

123
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,030
she's living at Gi Chan's home
in that condition...

124
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,060
She'll go there and make a scene,

125
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,500
although Jae In needs time
to get better.

126
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,570
Let's keep an eye on her condition
and see how it goes.

127
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,310
Anyway, why did you bring
this suitcase?

128
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,220
I already know she was betrayed...

129
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,890
by Kang Se Ri and Gi Chan,

130
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,390
so I couldn't leave her there alone.

131
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,790
I want to move in and stay with her.

132
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,660
When I saw that she only remembered
I was her real brother,

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,370
I almost hoped
her memories wouldn't return,

134
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,570
that she'd live her life
without painful memories.

135
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,810
I even had such a thought.

136
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,180
Don't I sound evil?

137
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,080
Don't say that.

138
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,350
I know better than you do
that you depend on her...

139
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,520
and adore her so much.

140
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,420
I won't let her
handle anything alone.

141
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,390
I never want to lose her again.

142
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,760
Seung Woo.

143
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,930
Jae In, I'm here.

144
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,470
I'm going to stay here, too.

145
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,600
Really?

146
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,370
I should be here
now that you've returned.

147
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,740
Isn't it only natural?
It's our home.

148
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,840
I'll protect you from now on,

149
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,950
so don't worry about anything.

150
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,950
Protect me from what?

151
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,880
My husband
and mother-in-law are all here.

152
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,750
But it feels reassuring
to hear you say that.

153
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,990
Thanks.

154
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,730
Honey, you heard him right?

155
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,660
Seung Woo will move in.

156
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,430
Sure. Welcome, Seung Woo.

157
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,900
Thanks, my brother-in-law.

158
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,740
Hello, Ms. Noh, the in-law lady.

159
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,610
Lady?

160
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,680
It's either Ms. Noh or the in-law.
What's with the word lady?

161
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,510
Oh, my gosh!

162
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,080
What brings you here, Seung Woo?

163
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,580
Where's my room?

164
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,250
- Hey, Gi Man.
- Yes?

165
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
You need to share your room
with Seung Woo.

166
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,330
No, it'll be too uncomfortable.

167
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,860
We don't have any more rooms.

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,660
Okay, fine.

169
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,500
It's such a sad time
for non-homeowners.

170
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,270
I'm buying a house
the moment I make some money.

171
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,270
I need to talk to you, Gi Man.

172
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,140
Why? What is it now?

173
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,310
- Let me show you where it is.
- Okay.

174
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,260
Darn it. My home
suddenly turned into a dorm.

175
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,490
This is just my luck.

176
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,200
Mom, isn't Seung Woo so hot?

177
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
You're giving me a headache.

178
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,600
Things are already complicated,
so stop talking nonsense.

179
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,180
What is it? What?

180
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,420
You wanted to talk, so talk.

181
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,620
I heard you demanded
two million dollars.

182
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,160
Yes, I did. So what?

183
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,960
So what?
Did you just say, "So what?"

184
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,460
I heard everything, too.

185
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,200
I know Se Ri
tried to take Jae In's...

186
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,600
Shut your mouth.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,230
Let go of me.

188
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,170
Don't be so cheeky
with your older brother.

189
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,170
Act like an older brother first.

190
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,480
Listen up to what I'm about to say.

191
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,450
The choice is yours.

192
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,980
Two million dollars?
You aren't getting that.

193
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,580
So, go ahead and blabber your nonsense
if you want to.

194
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,250
Are you serious?

195
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,360
Yes, but I'll report you
as a kidnapper.

196
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,960
Not only did you kidnap my son,

197
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
but you blackmailed me
after staging everything.

198
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,900
You'll get at least five years
and at most, a life sentence.

199
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,040
And I'll do whatever I can
to stop you from hiring an attorney.

200
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,510
You can rot in prison
for the rest of your life in regret.

201
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,710
So?

202
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,710
The choice is yours.

203
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,490
Hello, Detective Baek? It's me.

204
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,730
I'd like to file a report.

205
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,600
Gi Chan! Hang up the phone. Please.

206
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,060
Please hang up.

207
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,470
I'll call you again.

208
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,510
I don't need two million dollars.
It was a joke.

209
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,270
I didn't hear anything about Jae In.

210
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,880
I won't say a word. I mean it.

211
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,250
So, please let me off this once.

212
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,350
Remember.

213
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,950
I won't let you get away with it
the moment you bring it up.

214
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,750
And don't mention Eun Ho.

215
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,600
"A princess from a nearby country
found the fallen prince."

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,730
"The prince woke up and said,"

217
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,830
"'You must've saved me.'"

218
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,770
Uncle Do Yun, "Little Mermaid"
always makes me sad.

219
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,140
Little Mermaid was the one
who saved the prince,

220
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,310
but he mistook everything...

221
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,810
and fell in love
with another princess.

222
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,850
The prince can't remember
Little Mermaid...

223
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,090
or that she saved him.

224
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,520
But still.

225
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,990
Little Mermaid loved the prince,

226
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,460
so she gave up her voice
and became human. It's awful.

227
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,160
It is.

228
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,260
The prince was too awful.

229
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,370
Wake up, Jae In!

230
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,250
Who are you?

231
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,650
Honey. I'm sorry.

232
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,060
I vowed never to lose
anyone dear to me again.

233
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm sorry I can't protect you.

234
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm sorry, Jae In.

235
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,950
Daddy.

236
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm sleepy.

237
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,120
All right.

238
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,090
I'll put you to sleep.

239
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,790
Mommy, can you read
a storybook for me?

240
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,130
Ji Ho has met her often
since his younger days,

241
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,830
so he sometimes calls her mommy.

242
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,470
Yes, don't take it the wrong way.

243
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,970
He must be mistaken
because I play with him often.

244
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,870
He called me his mommy.

245
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,780
She's right. You should understand.

246
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,510
That little boy
must've missed his mommy so much.

247
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm tired, so I'm going to sleep.

248
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,290
Goodnight, Jae In.

249
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,820
I'm leaving, too.

250
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,590
Are you tired, Seung Woo?
Do you want a cup of milk?

251
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,330
Ji Ho, Mommy will...

252
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm sorry.
I do that from time to time.

253
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,570
I'll read you a storybook.

254
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,730
No, I'll do it.

255
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,970
It's late, so you should go home.

256
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,470
Didn't I tell you?

257
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,410
I'm staying here for a while.

258
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,610
At my house?

259
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,740
You're wrong, Jae In.

260
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,010
It's not your house. It's mine.

261
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,650
I stayed here
whenever I came to Korea.

262
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,850
She said
she didn't have family in Korea.

263
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,590
She's your best friend,

264
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,190
so I thought
you would've invited her here.

265
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm glad you did that.

266
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,700
Let me put him to sleep.

267
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,470
- Okay.
- Let's go, Ji Ho.

268
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
All right.

269
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,210
Then, are you staying
in the guest bedroom?

270
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,310
No, I'm staying with Ji Ho.

271
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,240
I felt at ease
after staying with him for a while.

272
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,350
I didn't know.

273
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,020
Ji Ho will want to see me,
so I'll go upstairs.

274
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,120
What? I'll go with you.

275
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,890
- I'll put him to sleep.
- Wait.

276
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,820
I should do that from now on.
I'm his mother.

277
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,490
Hey, Gi Chan will put him to sleep,

278
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,430
so you don't have to mind him
and get some rest.

279
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,530
All right. I'll do that.

280
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,600
I'll go upstairs.

281
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,770
Hey, why don't you spend the night
in the master bedroom with me?

282
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,100
Sorry?

283
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,610
We've reunited after eight years,
so we have some catching up to do.

284
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,610
I was worried
you'd feel unwell again.

285
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,050
You can sleep in my room, Jae In.
Doesn't it sound great?

286
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,580
You don't have to worry about me.

287
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,820
Gi Chan is here.

288
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,890
See? He came for me.

289
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,430
I have a lot of catching up
to do with him, too.

290
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,260
I want to hear
all about the life I missed,

291
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,730
and I especially want to know...

292
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,700
everything about
how Ji Ho was brought up.

293
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,670
Don't you feel the same way?

294
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,670
Of course.

295
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,910
But one thing, Mother.

296
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,950
You always used courteous language
and showed me respect.

297
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,950
Why do you keep talking down to me?

298
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,290
It sounds so vulgar, strange,

299
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,690
and scary.

300
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,990
What? Vulgar?

301
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,200
She must be mad, honey.

302
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,270
She just feels awkward
to talk to you again...

303
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,430
after a long time.

304
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,370
From now on, she'll treat you
as she always has.

305
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,910
Right, Mom?

306
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,610
Yes, sure.

307
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,010
Gi Chan must've put Ji Ho to sleep,
so you should get some rest.

308
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,850
Yes, Mother.

309
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,820
Goodnight, Se Ri.

310
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,950
- Let's go, honey.
- Okay.

311
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,930
Darn it. I've been
walking on eggshells all day.

312
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,130
My legs are shaking.

313
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,470
The way she acts does show
she must've lost her mind.

314
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,310
Gosh, I'm so worried.

315
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,610
Did you make it
to the Changpyeong-dong house?

316
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,350
I want to stop you one last time,

317
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,350
but no, right?

318
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
All right. Instead,

319
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,230
feel free to leave
whenever you feel uneasy.

320
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,260
There are many other ways
to help Jae In.

321
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,700
Okay. Goodnight, Seung Woo.

322
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,610
I didn't expect to see you here.

323
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,810
I'll take my usual drink.

324
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,780
This isn't good for you.

325
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,950
You aren't in good condition yet.

326
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,020
I hear menopausal symptoms...

327
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,330
can get worse after just one drink.

328
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,590
Then, you probably shouldn't drink.

329
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,500
No, it feels unfair,
so I'm going to drink even more.

330
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,340
I even developed insomnia.

331
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,510
I always need a handkerchief, too.
I keep breaking out in a cold sweat.

332
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,540
And my face randomly gets flushed.

333
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,480
I already felt miserable enough,

334
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,680
but I became angrier
with my wounded pride...

335
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,320
because I have
no control over my body.

336
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,560
Women have to deal with so much.

337
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,560
So what if I deal with it?

338
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,200
I'm getting older,

339
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,500
and there's no one
who'll think of me as a woman.

340
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,870
Why do you think you aren't a woman?

341
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,170
You don't have to pity me...

342
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,410
or console me.

343
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,450
I'm not someone who comforts people
with shallow and meaningless words.

344
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,780
Back then and even now,
you've always been...

345
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,390
a woman to me.

346
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,260
Jae In.

347
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,760
Over here.

348
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,370
I'm here.

349
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,570
Jae In! I'm here.

350
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,380
Jae In is still alive?

351
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,610
So, she has amnesia?

352
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,880
Yes, she only has memories
from eight years ago.

353
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,590
She can't remember anything
after that period.

354
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,560
She's at Changpyeong-dong, now,

355
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,000
and I'm not sure
if I should tell Ms. Choi...

356
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,360
about this.

357
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,430
She'll probably run over to her
as soon as she hears this,

358
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,500
which will make Jae In confused.

359
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,800
What should I do?

360
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,070
You can't stay quiet forever.

361
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,210
Why don't you meet Jae In first?

362
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,620
I'll do that.

363
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,530
Honey.

364
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,760
Jae In.

365
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,620
You seem as if
you've been waiting for her return.

366
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,750
I told you to move out for a while.
What do you think you're doing?

367
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,690
Why should I?

368
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,090
This is my home and Ji Ho's home.

369
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,760
Why should I leave?

370
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,600
Why should I be treated
like I were a stranger?

371
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,070
Be quiet. What if she wakes up?

372
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,930
I don't care.

373
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,840
I'm not doing this
just to save myself.

374
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,270
I'm trying to save all of us.

375
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,010
Why won't you think this through?

376
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,640
When she gets her memories back,

377
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,650
she'll meet that detective
and try to uncover the truth...

378
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,210
behind Chairman Kang's death.

379
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,680
Don't you know
how dangerous that'll be?

380
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,320
I do.
That's why I'm putting up with this.

381
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,290
Are you sure
she really lost her memories?

382
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,520
What if she's putting on a show?

383
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,130
I told you many times already.

384
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,360
She was examined at the hospital,
and I saw the result myself.

385
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,600
Fine, let's say
she lost her memories.

386
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,700
How long will you keep her around?

387
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,230
Until her memories return?

388
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,370
What if it doesn't?
What will you do then?

389
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,510
I'll ask for a divorce.

390
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,610
The first time was hard,
but never the second time.

391
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,980
Do you mean it?

392
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,950
I do.

393
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,320
Keep an eye on her and see
if she gets her memories back.

394
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,450
I'll go before she wakes up.

395
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,460
Jae In. I need to see it
with my own eyes.

396
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,430
Come and eat breakfast!

397
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,040
I'm not as good as Yu Gyeong,
but I tried cooking.

398
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,970
I don't know if it's any good.

399
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,480
It's such a solid home-cooked meal.

400
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,340
How long has it been, Mom?

401
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,810
Enjoy, Na Ra.

402
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,980
Why won't you eat, Mother?

403
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,560
You love meat.

404
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,200
What if
she's trying to poison us all?

405
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,610
We won't all get
food poisoning, right?

406
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,780
Food that looks good
always tastes good, too.

407
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,780
- Ouch.
- You'll get fat. Don't eat that.

408
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,450
Hey.

409
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,230
You made this, right?

410
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,860
You should eat slowly, Mother.

411
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,560
Try this, honey.

412
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,260
It's been eight years
since I cooked for you.

413
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,730
Yes.

414
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,030
Here. You should have some.

415
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,740
Thanks.

416
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,140
I have to get ready for work.

417
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,350
I have to go
and be at a meeting, too.

418
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,490
Please excuse me for a second.

419
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,700
You don't have to see me off.
You can stay.

420
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,500
Honey, one moment.

421
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,410
Your tie is crooked.

422
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,610
All done. Have a great day.

423
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,120
Bye.

424
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,530
Hey, did you see that?

425
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,260
He must feel shy.

426
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
You shouldn't do that
when your family is around.

427
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,330
Do you think so?

428
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,340
I kissed him whenever he left
before I was hospitalized.

429
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,340
It's nice to be back.

430
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,510
I have to go to work, too.

431
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,080
Actually, I work
as a designer at YL Group.

432
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,810
You do?

433
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,520
So, you don't live
in America anymore?

434
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,390
I did, but I returned for good.

435
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,090
I haven't found a place,
so I've been crashing here.

436
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,590
I see.

437
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,060
Then, we can meet
every single day now.

438
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,290
It'll be fun to get together
with Yu Gyeong, too.

439
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,830
Yes, that sounds fun.

440
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,470
I look forward to it. Bye.

441
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,810
Here.

442
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,710
Gosh. Thanks, Gi Man.

443
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,210
Jae In, about Yu Gyeong.

444
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,210
My wife.

445
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,590
Yes, Gi Chan told me...

446
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,560
about your divorce.

447
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,220
What happened?

448
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,330
Do you really not remember?
Nothing at all?

449
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,460
No, I'm sorry.

450
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,130
No, you don't have to apologize.

451
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,040
You know I was
deeply in love with her, right?

452
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,670
Of course.

453
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,210
I still remember how you pursued her
passionately back in university.

454
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,480
Can you meet and persuade her?

455
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,910
Tell her that
I couldn't get over her,

456
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,220
lost all my appetite,
and only want her back.

457
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,860
She's a doctor, so you can even say
she should save me...

458
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,190
and give me another chance.

459
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,590
She might listen to you.

460
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,860
I'll talk to her,

461
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,670
but it's not my position
to force her to do anything.

462
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,540
I'll talk to her...

463
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,670
and hear her out.

464
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,550
It's...

465
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,120
really you, right, Jae In?

466
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,720
Yes. It's me, Yu Gyeong.

467
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
I could've gone to your office
at the hospital.

468
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,720
Did I call you out on a busy day?

469
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,200
I quit my job.

470
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,000
Why?

471
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,010
I heard you divorced Gi Man.

472
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,810
Are these two related?

473
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,150
It's embarrassing to say this,

474
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,590
but he'd turn into a different man
whenever he got drunk...

475
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,560
and began to beat me.

476
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,930
I used my dad...

477
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,230
and what people would think
as an excuse to put up with him,

478
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
but he also lied
about his infertility.

479
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,110
I thought I had the problem,

480
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,980
so I took a leave
from the hospital...

481
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,180
and tried to do my best
to have a child.

482
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,650
I fell into a burnout
after everything was over.

483
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,120
My dad opened a new business
and told me to run it,

484
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,390
so I've been doing that
and taking a break.

485
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,390
I'm glad you did that, Yu Gyeong.

486
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,500
Everything you decided on is
the correct path.

487
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,540
I'm on your side.

488
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,810
Thanks.

489
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,710
You're still the same,

490
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,040
no matter what your timeline is.

491
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,720
I'm so glad.

492
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,390
My huge place is full of those bums,

493
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,590
so I had nowhere to be
as the landlord and had to leave.

494
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,160
This is ridiculous.

495
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,100
My gosh.

496
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,830
Darn it!

497
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,570
What did you say?

498
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,380
You're Noh Sook Ja, right?
May I have your autograph?

499
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,780
Well, you asked for it,
so I'll give you one.

500
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,220
Anyway, you cursed me out
as soon as you saw me.

501
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,290
Why do you need my autograph?

502
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,460
What do you mean?
It's the "Darn It Song."

503
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,730
It's the biggest hit
on social media right now.

504
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,660
The "Darn It Song?"

505
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,200
Darn it

506
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,900
Darn it

507
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,580
Darn it

508
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,880
My gosh. What is this?

509
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,780
I remember how Gi Man said
something about putting music in...

510
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,480
when he edited this or whatever.

511
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,850
Look at the view count.
One, two, three, four, five...

512
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,460
My goodness.

513
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,660
- Here.
- My gosh!

514
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,600
What are you counting?

515
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,500
I'm going to be super...
What's that word?

516
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,930
Yes, a superstar.

517
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,170
I'm going to be a superstar!

518
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,840
A star?

519
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,210
Are you entering
a trot audition show?

520
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,810
This is why you need to learn
from Jelly Z kids...

521
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,210
if you want to live young.

522
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,850
Participating in an audition show
isn't the only way to become a star.

523
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,790
You have to do YouTube
and TikTok like Jelly Z kids.

524
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,460
It's not Jelly Z. It's Gen Z.

525
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,990
Generation Z, right?

526
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,230
I guess you knew that much.

527
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,300
I don't watch a lot of TV,
but I always watch the news.

528
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,870
Anyway, people can finally see
what I'm truly made of,

529
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,740
so just wait.
If I get to hold a fan meeting,

530
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,210
I'll do it here.

531
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,480
My gosh.

532
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,810
(Bucket List: Travel with wife,
to our honeymoon destination?)

533
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,630
(Review exhibition hall
remodelling proposals)

534
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,930
(Must improve the layout and lighting)

535
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,750
Hello?

536
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,020
Hello, it's me, Kang Se Ri.

537
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,590
I called to congratulate you.

538
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,220
There's no reason
for you to do that. Goodbye.

539
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,130
Did you know
that Jae In is still alive?

540
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,400
You thought she was dead,
but she's still alive.

541
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,130
Shouldn't I congratulate you
for that?

542
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,530
Do not dare bring up
my daughter's name.

543
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,970
Kang Jae In is alive.

544
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,540
If you don't believe me,
go to Changpyeong-dong and find out.

545
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,310
See what your daughter is doing...

546
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,240
at my home and in my room!

547
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,610
Jae In is alive?

548
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,120
She is?

549
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,480
(Queen's House)

550
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,920
She has amnesia?

551
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,120
Don't be ridiculous.

552
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,290
I understand that
the situation seems absurd.

553
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,660
What was he thinking
when he brought her home?

554
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,190
This might be better.

555
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,660
I'll go to that house, too.

556
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,790
I'll protect Jae In.
You don't have to worry.

557
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,130
You don't stand a chance.

558
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,560
Choi Ja Young came to our place.

559
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,030
Isn't that good news?

560
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,470
It's a chance to find out
if Jae In is...

561
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,970
really suffering from amnesia.

562
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,900
Jae In is in a den of wicked jerks.

563
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,970
I don't know what will happen
if I leave her there.

564
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,110
You're stifling me right now,

565
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,410
not Jae In, who lost her memories.

566
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,080
I need you to stay still!
