1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children and adolescents were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,950
(Episode 71)

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,670
Why? Are you scared
I might kill you, too?

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,880
Get your hands off me.

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,510
Listen up to what I have to say
if you don't want to die.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,620
You didn't see anything.

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,120
If you tell anyone
about what you saw here,

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,390
you'll end up like this, too.

11
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,060
No, never mind.

12
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,860
It's your daughter, Kang Jae In.

13
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,930
The moment you open your mouth,

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,100
I'll do the same to her!

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,210
Do as I say
if you want to save your daughter.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,640
Do you understand?

17
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,450
Do you think I won't do it?

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,620
You just saw what I did.

19
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,960
Answer me!

20
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,130
Are you going to talk?

21
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,270
I made myself clear.

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,240
If you don't do as I say,

23
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,280
I'll kill Jae In.

24
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,870
Why are you so surprised?

25
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,340
I heard you went to work,
but you suddenly showed up.

26
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,010
I thought you left.

27
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,810
I came back to get something.

28
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,650
Have you been outside?

29
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,350
I came back to get something, too.

30
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,690
Is something going on?

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,660
No, it's just hot outside.

32
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,960
You should go before you're late.

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,600
Aren't you going to go upstairs?

34
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,030
I am. I should. Bye.

35
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,160
That idiotic punk...

36
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,360
dared to threaten me
only to end up like that.

37
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,330
Gi Man, you brought that
on yourself.

38
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,830
Hey, lady.
What do you think you're doing?

39
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,100
You have to pay for that first.

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,770
Hey, didn't you hear me?

41
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,830
You need to pay me
for that ice cream.

42
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,840
You can't run away like this.

43
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,370
You need to pay!

44
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,280
Do you want to end up
at the police station?

45
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,210
I can't believe this.

46
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,610
How much does she owe?

47
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,210
I'll pay.

48
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,620
It's two dollars.

49
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,120
Do you know her?

50
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,190
Consider yourself lucky. Darn it.

51
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,090
Thank you.

52
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,070
Where are you going?

53
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,640
Do you know your way home?

54
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,240
Home?

55
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,510
Home. Where's my home?

56
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,550
This is why it's better not to know.

57
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,220
Come with me.

58
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,730
Where have you been?
Your phone was turned off,

59
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,740
so my dad was worried sick.

60
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,340
Where's your phone?

61
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,040
I have it.

62
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,110
Here.

63
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,840
I think the battery's dead.
The power's off.

64
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,810
Where did you see her?

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,750
She was wandering the streets.

66
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,420
Let's go home.

67
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,920
You should go and get some rest.

68
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,320
Does Jae In know
about her condition?

69
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,360
Yes, she found out recently.

70
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,130
She must've been shocked.

71
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,800
She was.

72
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,470
Ms. Choi was
such an unyielding woman,

73
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,100
so Jae In cried a lot.

74
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,180
Excuse me,
where's my daughter, Jae In?

75
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,410
I want to see her.

76
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,020
Yes, I'm not in the office
right now,

77
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,250
so I'll call you back
after checking the schedule.

78
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,890
Goodbye.

79
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,850
Director Kang and I are...

80
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,150
seeing each other.

81
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,790
How did that happen?
You two had no connection.

82
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,260
It's a long story.

83
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,470
We once dated when we were younger.

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,940
Wait, my mom would
sometimes mention your first love.

85
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,640
Was she Director Kang Mi Ran?

86
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,750
I had gone out to the sea
after she left me coldly.

87
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,750
But time and feelings...

88
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,790
pulled their trick,

89
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,260
and we ended up like this.

90
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,130
Don't say anything to Yun Hee.

91
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,500
This doesn't change
that she's one of the YL family.

92
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,240
It keeps bothering me, too.

93
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,740
It's not like
we'll get married at this age,

94
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,110
so I don't want to blow this up.
Please help me out.

95
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,780
All right.

96
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,320
DH Holdings continues
to nitpick over everything,

97
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,890
so I can't run my meetings!

98
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,360
They keep wanting to conduct
due diligence and reviews.

99
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,900
I can't let them continue
to push me around like this.

100
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,100
Not only do I need to find
a new investor,

101
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,770
but what I need more is...

102
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,040
that slush fund.

103
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,380
I combed through my home,

104
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,950
but I still haven't found
anything out of the ordinary.

105
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:03,250
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

106
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,260
Jae In had written this down, too.

107
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,900
She also had the box
of articles he left behind,

108
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,430
so she must've seen
that notebook, too.

109
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,470
That means...

110
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,940
she must know something
about the slush fund.

111
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,670
I have to get to it first...

112
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,410
before she gets her memories back.

113
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,680
If I can't do that,
I need to humor and coax her...

114
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,920
into giving me a lead.

115
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,260
How's Ms. Choi?

116
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,990
She fell asleep.

117
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,370
Something must've left her stunned,

118
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,870
but she wouldn't tell me.

119
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,770
Let's wait and see
if she gets better.

120
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,410
I'm glad you brought her home.
You should get some rest, too.

121
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,810
Sure. And you, Dad.

122
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,850
Hey, Seung Woo.

123
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,550
I'm sorry. I left work early
and came home already.

124
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,490
You're coming near my place?

125
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,030
Aren't you tired?

126
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,560
Why did you come here
instead of going home?

127
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,360
I was exhausted,

128
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
but seeing you made me feel better.

129
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,840
- Seung Woo.
- Yu Gyeong.

130
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,910
You can go first.

131
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,280
Should I start dating?

132
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,920
That sounds wonderful.

133
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,250
You're still young,
and you should date at that age.

134
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,020
Is there someone you like?

135
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,260
What about you?

136
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,020
What?

137
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,630
Well, I mean,

138
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,400
do you want to start dating...

139
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,970
or get into a relationship?

140
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,070
I'm not in that kind of situation.

141
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,570
Why not? What about your situation?

142
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,810
After all, I'm your first love,
a guy with the highest standards.

143
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,280
You sent me a love letter
through Jae In back in middle school.

144
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,880
Do you remember that?

145
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,220
Of course, I do.

146
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,160
You sent it back to me
through Jae In.

147
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,060
She was too nice,
so she kept it with her,

148
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,490
but I caught her.

149
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,260
I must've been immature, too.

150
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,970
That was a cruel way
of turning you down.

151
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,740
Sorry.

152
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,740
This time,

153
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,410
will you accept me?

154
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,610
Can I like you?

155
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,250
My heart races so fast
like it'll burst when I'm with you,

156
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,090
and I like that.

157
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,260
I feel like I can be myself
when I'm with you.

158
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,830
Please stop, Seung Woo.
At this point, I can't...

159
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,600
You can tell me later, Yu Gyeong.

160
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,870
At least take some time
to think about it.

161
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,210
I'm not asking
for an immediate answer.

162
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,180
You can think about it
and give me an answer next time.

163
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,110
Okay?

164
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,790
Dinner's ready. Please come.

165
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,220
When did you get here?

166
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,890
I went out to work,
but it ended early, so I came home.

167
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,460
I don't know what got into her,
but she offered to make dinner.

168
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,470
She must've felt bad
about crashing at our place.

169
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,070
Thank you, Se Ri.

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,300
It's the least I can do.
You don't have to thank me.

171
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,970
Those sly girls.

172
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,010
You two are the same.

173
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,450
Hello?

174
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,080
What?

175
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
Who are you?
Why are you looking for Gi Man?

176
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,990
The police station?

177
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,630
Hello?

178
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,680
No, Gi Man!

179
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,510
Wake up, Gi Man! Gi Man!

180
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,450
He was left unattended for a while
after the accident,

181
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,350
so his condition was dire.

182
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,950
We had no choice
but to get consent over the phone.

183
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,520
Did the surgery go well?

184
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,890
We did our best,
but we can't guarantee anything.

185
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,660
We'll keep an eye on him
for a day or two.

186
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,600
Goodness, Gi Man. I'm here.

187
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,510
Your mom's here.

188
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,110
Please wake up.

189
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,240
Wake up, will you?

190
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,880
Gi Man...

191
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
Calm down, Mom.

192
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,920
Goodness, Gi Chan.
What will happen to your brother?

193
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,490
What if he dies?

194
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,190
I can't go on if that happens.

195
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,630
He may have been a fool,
but he's your brother.

196
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,030
Please save him, Gi Chan!

197
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,200
No...

198
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,710
All right.

199
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,340
Thank you for your hard work.

200
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,350
Goodbye.

201
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,750
What did the police say?

202
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,150
They'll investigate some more,

203
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,050
but there are no CCTVs in the area.

204
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,990
They think he just fell.

205
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,720
The stairs he fell down from
are rather steep,

206
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,830
so these accidents
would break out from time to time.

207
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,930
It's been hours,

208
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,230
but he won't wake up
or move an inch.

209
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,300
What if he really...

210
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,500
You shouldn't get
a bad idea, Mother.

211
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,470
I know he'll wake up.

212
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,480
I'll stay here. You two need to go.

213
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,010
I'll stay.

214
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,110
You should go home with Mom.

215
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,150
No.

216
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,650
We're in bad luck
because that girl came home.

217
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,150
Mom.

218
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,260
You're at fault
for siding with her, too.

219
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,630
What if she did this to him?

220
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,160
You need to stop.

221
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,730
She was at work all day.

222
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,060
How could she have done this?

223
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,530
I shouldn't have woken up.

224
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,270
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,540
You don't have to apologize.

226
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,170
Then, we'll go.

227
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:30,870
We're sorry for leaving.

228
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,580
Let's go.

229
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,450
Gi Man. You have to wake up.

230
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,790
You can hear me, right?

231
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,360
Your life here may have been awful,
but it's always better to live.

232
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,600
What will happen to Gi Man?

233
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,500
He can't die like this.

234
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,970
Don't cry.

235
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,140
Gi Man...

236
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,980
may be a bit of a bluff, a show,

237
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,120
and an awful drunk,

238
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,350
but he always listened to me.

239
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,850
He was a great brother.

240
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,920
Na Ra, if he was a bluff, a show,
and an awful drunk,

241
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
then he was a bad person.

242
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,360
He should've lived a good life.

243
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,770
That isn't something for you to say.

244
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,070
People may hear that
and think you lived a good life.

245
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,340
And aren't you worried about him?

246
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,470
I thought he was your family.

247
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,340
You're right. Aren't you worried?

248
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,310
Worrying about him
won't make him better.

249
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,250
Let's leave it up to fate.

250
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,590
Gi Chan, how's Gi Man? Is he okay?

251
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,890
The doctors will
keep an eye on him for a day or two.

252
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,130
What if he never wakes up?

253
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,100
Don't worry.

254
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,700
He'll be fine.

255
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,570
I already made myself clear...

256
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,080
and said I'd never make
any monetary transactions with you.

257
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,380
What are brothers for?

258
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,880
I just need it for a month.

259
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,980
I don't think I have to
hear you out anymore. You should go.

260
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,880
I'm busy.

261
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,320
Hey, Gi Chan.
Let me take a seat, too.

262
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,460
I need to get your good vibes. Ouch.

263
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,090
Don't bring your bad luck today.

264
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,730
- You crazy punk!
- Oh, no!

265
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,860
Stop blaming me
for your incompetence and indecency.

266
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,370
Leave.

267
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,270
Leave now before I get the guard
to drag you out.

268
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,440
- Let's go.
- Hey, you punk.

269
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,010
You were the worst
to both Eun Ho and Jae In, too.

270
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,910
Jae In was always so good to you!

271
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,010
Do you think
you'll live a good life...

272
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,140
after making
that kind woman miserable?

273
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,650
You're shameless.

274
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,280
Shut your mouth.

275
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,850
Let go of me.

276
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,720
Don't be so cheeky
with your older brother.

277
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,490
Act like an older brother first.

278
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,820
Listen up to what I'm about to say.

279
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,730
The choice is yours.

280
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,330
Two million dollars?
You aren't getting that.

281
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,130
So, go ahead and blabber
your nonsense if you want to.

282
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,110
I brought some tea.

283
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,050
Have some while it's hot.

284
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,690
It must've been shocking.

285
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,390
No, I'm fine.

286
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,830
You don't have to pretend
when you're with me.

287
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,570
When things are hard, just say so.

288
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,740
When you're in pain,
tell me you are.

289
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,040
I'm here for you.

290
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,410
We're family.

291
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,250
Don't pretend to be strong
when you're with me.

292
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,450
I hope you'll trust me
and depend on me...

293
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,050
just as I do with you.

294
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,690
Honestly speaking,

295
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,030
I never treated Gi Man
like an older brother.

296
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,660
He always got himself in trouble...

297
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,100
and humiliated our family,
so I resented him so much.

298
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,870
But I didn't want
something bad to happen to him.

299
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,580
I know.
Mother may not know, but I do.

300
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,040
You were fond of your brother.

301
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,820
Will he be okay?

302
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,980
Of course.

303
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,350
I know he'll wake up.

304
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,590
I'm so glad you're here with me.

305
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,840
Thank you, honey.

306
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,530
His family is troubled
because of Hwang Gi Man's accident.

307
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,700
Have you found any leads
on the late chairman's last will?

308
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,570
No.

309
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,400
It must be hidden
somewhere in the house,

310
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,740
but I can't find it.

311
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,540
I should look some more.

312
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,140
Be careful.

313
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,550
Hwang Gi Chan may not be
in his right mind because of his brother,

314
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,180
but Kang Se Ri is around, too.

315
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,850
I have to get rid of her first...

316
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,190
to start looking safely.

317
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,820
Have you thought of a way?

318
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,660
Of course.

319
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,430
I'll pay her back
for everything she did to me.

320
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,370
She'll learn
how scary it is to be betrayed.

321
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,570
Remember that
these people are more evil...

322
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,910
than you think.

323
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,750
There was a bug
planted in our office.

324
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,150
Someone must've overheard...

325
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,920
my uncle would set up a meeting
with a detective for you...

326
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,790
and pretended to be a detective
to lure you out for that accident.

327
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,230
It must've been
either Hwang Gi Chan...

328
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,960
or Kang Se Ri.

329
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,410
I kept the pen recorder
with the chairman's final will...

330
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,670
safely at home.

331
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,580
I edited parts of the audio...

332
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,210
and sent it to Hwang Gi Chan
while you were hospitalized.

333
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm sorry for doing that
without asking.

334
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,890
I wanted him...

335
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,020
to feel anxious in fear.

336
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,260
You did that for me.

337
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,060
Good one.

338
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,800
Please keep the pen recorder
a little longer.

339
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,730
Don't worry.

340
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,670
Let me know when you need it.

341
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,480
If he turned a tough corner,
is his life no longer in danger?

342
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,710
You've done well, Mom.

343
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,050
Leave him with the caretaker
and get some rest.

344
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,550
You don't have
to worry about him anymore.

345
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,650
All right. Goodbye.

346
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,030
It sounds like great news.
What did she say?

347
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,490
Did Gi Man wake up?

348
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,190
Not yet.

349
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,760
He's still on a respirator,

350
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,370
but he'll wake up.

351
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,340
What are you doing here, Se Ri?

352
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,240
I had to report something
on business.

353
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,410
You're doing that yourself?

354
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,880
Why would a mere team leader
report directly to him?

355
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,620
She's in charge of a project,
so I called her to check on it.

356
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm done asking, Ms. Kang.

357
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,490
Good luck.

358
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,030
Sure.

359
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,800
I'm sorry for acting sensitive.

360
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,610
I guess that photo with the bracelet
is still haunting me.

361
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,780
I just got a call from Mom.

362
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,610
Gi Man turned a tough corner.

363
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,350
I'm so glad.
I have a meeting outside,

364
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,250
so I should stop by on my way there.

365
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,520
I told my mom
to go home and get some rest.

366
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,720
We hired a caretaker,
so you can stop by later.

367
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,260
All right.

368
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,860
What are you doing?

369
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,530
I was worried
about my brother-in-law.

370
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,060
Why are you here?

371
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,670
That doesn't sound right.

372
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:19,540
He's my brother-in-law, not yours.

373
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,570
Why are you worried about him?

374
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,310
Did you also hurt your head
while losing your memories?

375
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,610
Or did you actually
lose your memories?

376
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,420
Se Ri, what are you suspicious of?

377
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,420
I should be suspicious of you.

378
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,760
Don't you think so?

379
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,990
It seemed odd.

380
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,990
You should be demanding a divorce
instead of coming here...

381
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:46,700
if you think your husband is
having an affair.

382
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,370
Why are you in such peace?

383
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:52,970
Let me tell you this.

384
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,940
Gi Chan is having an affair with me.

385
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,310
He's my husband.

386
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,980
So, split up with him immediately.

387
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,750
I'm letting you know
because I worry about you.

388
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,930
Se Ri came here
worried about Hwang Gi Man?

389
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:37,310
- I'm home.
- I'm home, too, Mother.

390
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,650
How can you want to go to work...

391
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,890
while your brother-in-law is
in the hospital?

392
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,390
I'm sorry...

393
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,390
Go upstairs and get some rest.

394
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,630
- Okay.
- Go.

395
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,600
You're home, honey.

396
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,570
I told you to watch what you say.

397
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,170
I saw her going upstairs.

398
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,040
How many times do I have to say
that her memories are back?

399
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,970
How can you refuse to believe me
after all I did for you?

400
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,140
Yes, honey. This time, she's right.

401
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,580
She also seems suspicious to me.

402
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,650
If she really had her memories
as you suggested,

403
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,380
then how could she get pregnant
with my kid?

404
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,990
What's wrong, honey?

405
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,840
Did you...

406
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,440
marry Se Ri?

407
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,280
Did you have an affair with her
and marry her, too?

408
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,010
Did you? Is this true?

409
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,150
Goodness.

410
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,090
What's going on?

411
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,490
What's...

412
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,590
What do you think you're doing?

413
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,700
Did you sleep with my husband?

414
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,270
You said you were
having an affair with him!

415
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,110
You already know,
so stop putting on a show.

416
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,910
You know you two are divorced,

417
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,940
and they're married.

418
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,080
You even came to their wedding
and made a scene.

419
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,210
What is this nonsense?

420
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,480
Mom!

421
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,020
No. It can't be.

422
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,660
Honey.

423
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,760
- Honey.
- Honey. I need to see a doctor.

424
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,330
Are you okay, honey?

425
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,830
- Honey.
- Honey.

426
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,060
Honey!

427
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,400
You need to calm down.

428
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,540
Let go of me. I'm going home.

429
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,710
A miscarriage needs
just as much care as childbirth.

430
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,840
How can I do that
after my child died?

431
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,680
I don't deserve to lie here.

432
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,150
I'm going home.

433
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,920
Jae In! Are you okay?

434
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Yes.

435
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,260
I said I wouldn't let you live
if you hurt her in any way!

436
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,660
You need to stop, Seung Woo!

437
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,960
Things are already hard enough,

438
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,270
so don't add to this.

439
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,870
Keep it a secret
from my family for a while.

440
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,440
Can you do that?

441
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,980
Okay.

442
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,030
You need to lie down first.

443
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,830
Get out.

444
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,270
Get out of this room.

445
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,200
Honey.

446
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,170
I can't share a room with a man...

447
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,570
who's having an affair
with my friend.

448
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,240
I was suspicious
after that photo with the bracelet,

449
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,510
but I tried to forget it.

450
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,240
And now, my child died,

451
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,310
and you and Se Ri are the murderers!

452
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,220
Ms. Kang and I aren't
in that kind of relationship.

453
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,020
Let me tell you this.

454
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
Gi Chan is having an affair with me.

455
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,260
He's my husband.

456
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,900
So, split up with him immediately.

457
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,200
I'm letting you know
because I worry about you.

458
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,880
She said this to me
when I went to the hospital...

459
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,780
to see Gi Man.

460
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,410
She said you were her husband.

461
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,520
I still tried to ignore her. But...

462
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,250
the moment I saw
the photos in this room...

463
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,820
Are you...

464
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,430
married to Se Ri?

465
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,660
That woman is behind everything.

466
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,930
She kept trying to seduce me
while you were in bed.

467
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,200
But I promise you that
I didn't do anything to betray you.

468
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,770
She's not in her right mind.

469
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,080
I only put up with her
because you recently woke up...

470
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,150
and she was your friend,
but I can't do this anymore.

471
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,050
I can't let her
keep calling me her husband...

472
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,680
in her delusion.

473
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:43,750
So, this isn't true?

474
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,460
You aren't married to Se Ri?

475
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,990
No.

476
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,330
She's deluded into thinking
I'm her husband.

477
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,930
That means she is mentally unwell.

478
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,730
Shouldn't she get treated?

479
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,000
Her condition will worsen
if she doesn't do anything.

480
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,440
I don't know.

481
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,110
Honey, don't believe Ms. Kang,
no matter what she says.

482
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,980
Just trust me. Will you do that?

483
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,320
I'll trust you.

484
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,390
But honey, I'm scared.

485
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,620
What if she begins to insist
Ji Ho is her son, too?

486
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,030
I'm afraid
she'll do something weird.

487
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,590
That won't happen.

488
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,030
This time, I won't let that happen.

489
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,510
What have you done?

490
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,350
Didn't you do enough damage
when you killed Eun Ho?

491
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,780
This is irrelevant to Eun Ho's case.

492
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,450
Isn't it better that
she lost her baby like this?

493
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,460
Things would've been complicated
if she had that kid.

494
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,260
How dare you talk like that
after killing my kid?

495
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,460
I warned you
not to do anything anymore.

496
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,400
It's Jae In's fault
for not taking care of herself.

497
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,970
How is this on me?

498
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,700
Why did you put those photos out?

499
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,440
I didn't do that!

500
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,700
Pull yourself together, Gi Chan.

501
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,870
I'm your wife, not Jae In!

502
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,380
My patience has run thin.
I can't do this anymore.

503
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,210
If you can't get rid of her,

504
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,450
I will.

505
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,550
I'll show her the evidence,
including our marriage registration,

506
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,420
and end this nonsense
as soon as the day breaks.

507
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,990
Don't try to stop me.

508
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,510
Take her away.

509
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Let go. Let go of me!

510
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,110
Let go!

511
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,250
Honey.

512
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,220
Hey! Let go of me!

513
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,760
Kang Jae In, it was you, right?

514
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,190
Tell them to let go of me!

515
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,590
Tell them!

516
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,830
Se Ri, I didn't know
you became delusional...

517
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,200
and began to have feelings
for my husband.

518
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,300
It's a disorder
to fall into that kind of delusion.

519
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,870
Please get treated
and come back in good condition.

520
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,750
Your husband did this.

521
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,350
Try getting a taste
of your own medicine.

522
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,120
Kang Jae In.

523
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,020
Honey, she got her memories back.
Honey!

524
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,930
I feel so bad for her, honey.

525
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,130
I don't want to wake my family,

526
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,430
so please take her quietly.

527
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,870
Honey!

528
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,240
Gi Chan!

529
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,500
Let go of me!

530
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,810
Let go!

531
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,310
Honey! Gi Chan!

532
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:55,750
Gi Chan!

533
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,560
(Queen's House)

534
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,530
Jae In doesn't have amnesia.

535
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,570
She's fooling you!

536
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,070
I've been deceived by you
enough times.

537
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,840
This is why people say
a family needs a good woman...

538
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,270
to marry into their family.

539
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,140
Technically, the Hwangs were ruined
when you married into the family.

540
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,880
Did you just insult me?

541
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,650
He'll try to contact China, too.
Can we let this continue?

542
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,490
We'll become something...

543
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,620
he can't keep or let go of.

544
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
This toy must be your treasure.

545
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,090
Yes, Eun Ho gave it to me.

546
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,260
Eun Ho?

547
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,330
