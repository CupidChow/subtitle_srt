- Okay! - Okay!

73
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,539
Today's matches...

74
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,380
are divided into Part 1 and Part 2.

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,310
Part One is a track meet.

(Part 1: Track Meet)

77
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:54,651
Part Two is a talent show.

78

It's like a real track meet.

79
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,289
There's something that's a must in a team competition.

80

It's the grand prize.

81

(Excited)

82
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,859

Return to your seats.

95
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,689
Whoever knows the dance, go to the front.

96
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,560
We're at a disadvantage due to the lack of members.

97
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,129
If you don't know the dance, hide behind...

98
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,031
- GROOVE, then come out. - Okay.

99
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,330

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,180
- Kim Gi Joong! - Gi Joong, the Korean King.

368
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:03,250
Kenta.

369
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,551
- Kenta! - Let's go!

370
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,691
Park Ju Won.

371
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,321
Park Ju Won!

372
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,160
And lastly, Jang Kyung Ho.

373
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:16,730
- Kyung Ho! - Gosh!

374
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,330
What do we do?

375
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,800
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

376
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:23,431
(Gulping)

377
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,071
- They feel so reliable. - They look strong.

378
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,141
TEAM GROOVE looks strong. What do we do?

379
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:31,231
These are the players who will compete from TEAM BEAT.

380
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:32,680
Jin Ziming.

381
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,710
(Jin Ziming)

382
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:37,649
- Let's go! - The physical king is here.

383
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,879
(Jin Ziming provokes them.)

384
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,951
He's so tall.

385
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,520
(The tallest in Universe League)

386
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,250
Okay.

387
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:48,291
I'm 184cm, but...

388
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,661
Keum Jin Ho.

389
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:52,499
Nam Do Yoon.

390
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,499
(Nam Do Yoon)

391
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Kairi.

392
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,270
Let's go!

393
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:01,841
- I'm scared. - Me too.

394
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,071
Gosh, hold on. Let's go, TEAM RHYTHM!

395
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,779
(We will have the sweetest thighs in Universe League!)

396
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,780
I'm curious who will have the strongest thighs in Universe League.

397
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,721
- We have Steven as well. - Let's go!

398
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,490
The 1st match for Round 1...

399
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,790
will be between Steven and Kenta.

400
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,759
(TEAM RHYTHM's Steven versus TEAM GROOVE's Kenta)

401
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,390
It's the main match right away.

402
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,330
- We're at the final match already. - What?

403
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:27,091
- What? - It's intense from the first match.

404
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,770
It starts now.

405
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:34,139
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

406
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,740
(Universe League's tough guy)

407
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,310
I'm a fighter.

408
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,740
(Direct fighter, Steven)

409
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:45,551
(He started out as the First Love Changer.)

410
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,951
(However, )

411
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:53,091
(his body was the total opposite of his innocent face.)

412
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,661
(The First Love Changer Kenta turns evil.)

413
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,060
Let's go!

414
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:01,359
- Good luck! - Steven!

415
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,230
- Good luck! - Steven!

416
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,000
- Good luck, Kenta! - Let's go!

417
00:17:08,141 --> 00:17:09,610
(Making the first move)

418
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,871
There we go.

419
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:12,479
(Steven starts out strong.)

420
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,539
- Gosh. - Gosh.

421
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,911
(Steven starts out strong.)

422
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,309
(Kenta won't lose to him.)

423
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,670
They both rolled up their sleeves.

424
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,351
Gosh, those muscular guys.

425
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,760
The toughest guys.

426
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:28,190
You can do this! Good luck!

427
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:29,806
(Fighter Steven versus Evil First Love Kenta)

428
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,830
(Pressing)

429
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,371
(His thighs feel strong.)

430
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:38,330
Go!

431
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:41,970
- Let's go, Toyota Kenta! - Let's go, Steven!

432
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:44,240
- Don't give up. - Let's go, Steven!

433
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:47,141
Steven versus Kenta. Kenta versus Steven.

434
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,411
Let's go, Steven!

435
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,881
In 1, 2...

436
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,851
(Kenta applies pressure from the start.)

437
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,860
(His ears turn red as he uses all of his strength.)

438
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,059
You have to close his knees!

439
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,260
(Steven is shaking too.)

440
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,259
- You can do it. - Let's go!

441
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,360
(However, Steven's knees won't close.)

442
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,259
(A neck-and-neck battle of strength)

443
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,900
- He's going to make it. - You can do it!

444
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:11,770
Close them! You have to!

445
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,569
- You can do it. - Let's go!

446
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,670
(Steven's knees won't get closer.)

447
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,111
Kenta!

448
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,810
(Is he laughing?)

449
00:18:21,111 --> 00:18:22,880
- Steven! - Steven!

450
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:24,710
- Let's go! - Five,

451
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:26,451
- four... - Steven!

452
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,121
I'm a fighter.

453
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,151
(Flexing)

454
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,390
- Three, two... - Let's go, Steven!

455
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:33,519
(He's opening up his knees!)

456
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,121
- Let's go! - Two...

457
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:36,631
Go, Kenta!

458
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,161
One.

459
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,329
It's over.

460
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,701
(The match ends.)

461
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:42,700
It's over.

462
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,101
(Steven wins.)

463
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:49,711
(Kenta's face has turned red from all the straining.)

464
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:52,279
Steven takes the win.

465
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,080
(Steven wins the first match.)

466
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,920
(Glorious return)

467
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,221
Steven!

468
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,020
(You're so impressive!)

469
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,691
This is the next match. It's Zhang Shuaibo...

470
00:19:06,191 --> 00:19:08,730
versus Nam Do Yoon.

471
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,960
(This player is...)

472
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,559
- This is a great matchup. - This is Zhang Shuaibo.

473
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,530
He's a teacher of sexiness.

474
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,101
- The Sexy Master. - No.

475
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,970
No!

476
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:23,010
(His body reacts to sexiness first.)

477
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:26,480
(Unrivaled lethal charms)

478
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:30,151
(His sexy charisma upgrades day by day.)

479
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:34,520
(Universe League's Sexy Master, Zhang Shuaibo)

480
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:38,520
(And I am Nam Do Yoon!)

481
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,489
(With his ridiculous dancing, )

482
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,330
(Do Yoon got rejected.)

483
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,559
(You have to stick out your chest more than your belly.)

484
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,931
(Like this?)

485
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,069
(You won't be able to find any athleticism...)

486
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,671
(from Fighting Boy Nam Do Yoon.)

487
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,510
Do Yoon!

488
00:19:56,511 --> 00:19:57,711
(Why are you here?)

489
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,610
(The two players who don't seem to have any athleticism compete.)

490
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,951
(Feeling awkward)

491
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,279
(These 2 are filmed together for the 1st time.)

492
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,440
This is a funny scene that has never been seen before.

493
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:09,001
It's funny and refreshing to see.

494
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,290
This is a matchup...

495
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,059
that I have never imagined.

496
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,560
Who will become the winner?

497
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,559
What's going through their minds?

498
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,330
(It's really hard to predict this match.)

499
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:23,930
(If Do Yoon's knees touch, Zhang Shuaibo wins.)

500
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,141
In 1, 2...

501
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,171
The chair is getting pushed!

502
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,780
(Zhang Shuaibo gets surprised.)

503
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:36,251
- What's going on? - Gosh.

504
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,079
(Do Yoon uses his strength from the start.)

505
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,480
- What? - He's getting pushed back.

506
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,691
(The members of his team are surprised as well.)

507
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Gosh, Do Yoon!

508
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,519
Why is Do Yoon so strong?

509
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,266
(Do Yoon endures his attack with amazing strength.)

510
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,029
- Nam Do Yoon! - Nam Do Yoon!

511
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,270
(He's straining with his face.)

512
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,101
(TEAM GROOVE members are surprised too.)

513
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,371
(He's in a lonely battle while showing just the top of his head.)

514
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:02,440
- Zhang Shuaibo! - Zhang Shuaibo!

515
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,641
(Good luck, Zhang Shuaibo!)

516
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,070
The countdown will begin.

517
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,740
Five, four...

518
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,211
- Four, three, - Four, three,

519
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,610
- two... - two...

520
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:11,850
(He uses all his might with his veins popping out.)

521
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:13,651
(Go, Zhang Shuaibo!)

522
00:21:13,951 --> 00:21:15,691
- Three, two, - Let's go!

523
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,190
One.

524
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:18,960
(The match ends.)

525
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,221
Nam Do Yoon manages to endure the attack until the end.

526
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:22,730
Congratulations.

527
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,601
- He's strong. - That was amazing.

528
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,130
(He looks lost.)

529
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:30,171
Congratulations.

530
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:35,140
(An unbelievable result)

531
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:36,171
Oh, my gosh.

532
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,611
(The Fighting Boy has an unexpected charm.)

533
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:42,950
- You did a great job, Do Yoon! - Great job, Do Yoon!

534
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:45,681
(Nam Do Yoon moves up to Round 2.)

535
00:21:45,921 --> 00:21:48,620
(Disappointed)

536
00:21:48,621 --> 00:21:49,921
This is the next match.

537
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,589
It's Jang Kyung Ho versus Keum Jin Ho.

538
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,789
(TEAM GROOVE's Jang Kyung Ho versus TEAM BEAT's Keum Jin Ho)

539
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,229
- Let's go, Kyung Ho. - Sorry?

540
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,229
(It's me?)

541
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,260
Jin Ho.

542
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,430
- Jin Ho. - Okay.

543
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:04,829
(Looking confident)

544
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,070
Don't worry.

545
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,101
Kyung Ho looks really strong.

546
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:10,440
- Don't worry. - Let's go!

547
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:12,286
- This is a big match. - Here's another big match.

548
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,009
- Keum Jin Ho! - Kyung Ho!

549
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,010
(An intense war of nerves between the two players)

550
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,810
Jang Kyung Ho!

551
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:24,191
(A battle of the leaders with their teams' pride on the line)

552
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:30,730
(He showed his great athleticism with difficult poses.)

553
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,601
(Showing off his wild charms)

554
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:37,270
(The leader with a great body, Jang Kyung Ho)

555
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,141
Here comes the chili powder.

556
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:41,800
- RHYTHM! - Who are we?

557
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,010
(Hold on. It's either kimchi jjigae or seaweed soup.)

558
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,280
(The master of bringing down others)

559
00:22:48,411 --> 00:22:50,881
(The leader with great words, Keum Jin Ho)

560
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:53,091
- It's time to reveal my true self. - Kyung Ho.

561
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,550
(Confident)

562
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,120
We'll begin.

563
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:58,221
(If Kyung Ho's knees touch, Jin Ho wins.)

564
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:01,391
In 1, 2...

565
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,471
(Jin Ho lets out a cry of pain from the start.)

566
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:12,799
(Opening wide)

567
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,871
Hold on.

568
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,110
(His legs open wide instead.)

569
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:19,809
- I heard a bone crack. - No!

570
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,380
Hold on. No!

571
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:23,580
(Feeling embarrassed)

572
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:26,350
Gosh. I heard a bone crack.

573
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:27,421
(Are you okay?)

574
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,050
Get out.

575
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,390
(Covering their mouths)

576
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:32,890
My pants were slippery.

577
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:34,020
(Laughing)

578
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:35,890
Please make him look better!

579
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,089
(Please make him look better!)

580
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,161
Please!

581
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:39,431
(How can his legs open wide at once like that?)

582
00:23:39,432 --> 00:23:40,500
Boom!

583
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,131
- That was amazing. - He did really well.

584
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,670
He was eliminated the fastest.

585
00:23:45,671 --> 00:23:47,170
(Kyung Ho wins with the fastest record.)

586
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:48,299
My pants...

587
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,171
My pants were slippery.

588
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:52,780
Here's the next match.

589
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,579
It's JL versus Park Ju Won.

590
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,556
(TEAM RHYTHM's JL versus TEAM GROOVE's Park Ju Won)

591
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,680
- Let's go! - Let's go, Ju Won!

592
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:02,589
(The former teammates meet in a battle they can't back out of.)

593
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,221
Let's go!

594
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:06,691
- Let's go for it. - Let's go!

595
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,861
Ju Won, if you let me win,

596
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,730
- I'll treat you to good food. - Okay.

597
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,059
No.

598
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,201
I'll treat you to something even tastier, Ju Won.

599
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,670
(Don't fall for it!)

600
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:23,069
(JL versus Park Ju Won who were former teammates)

601
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,010
Yesterday's colleague has become today's enemy.

602
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:28,309
- What's this in Korean? - Name tag.

603
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,480
Name tag.

604
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:31,079
- Name. - Tag.

605
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
Tag.

606
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:34,120
- Name card. - Right.

607
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:35,380
You're no fun.

608
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:36,790
- No! - No fun.

609
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:38,320
I'm really funny.

610
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:43,131
(They shared a similar sense of humor.)

611
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:45,230
(Best buddies)

612
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:47,730
Here's a cat.

613
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,200
(The two were always together.)

614
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,240
Good luck.

615
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,470
Great job, JL.

616
00:24:58,471 --> 00:24:59,540
(Full of affection)

617
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,539
- Let's go! - Let's go!

618
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,327
(There's no going easy on each other in a game.)

619
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:05,451
- Great. - Great.

620
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:08,181
In 1, 2...

621
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:12,660
(It's a tight match from the start.)

622
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:13,721
He's enduring it.

623
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:15,059
There you go!

624
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,890
- Let's go, Ju Won! - He's enduring it. More, Ju Won!

625
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,730
- Let's go! - You can do it!

626
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,400
Let's go, JL!

627
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:22,600
- JL! - JL!

628
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,300
- JL! - JL!

629
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,700
(Fully secure)

630
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:28,471
- JL! - JL!

631
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,040
- Gosh! - You can really do it!

632
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:32,539
- Let's go! - You can do it, Ju Won!

633
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,381
- JL! - You can do it, Ju Won!

634
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,079
- All right. Five, - A little more.

635
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,410
- four... - Please!

636
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,579
You can really do it!

637
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,220
(Wriggling)

638
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:43,650
You can do it, Ju Won!

639
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:45,621
- Ju Won! - Please, Ju Won!

640
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,961
Three, two, one.

641
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,631
One.

642
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,101
(Looking relaxed)

643
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,601
(The match ends.)

644
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:58,030
- One. - Please, Ju Won!

645
00:25:58,901 --> 00:26:00,370
(It was a great fight although he lost!)

646
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:02,411
I'm sorry, Ju Won!

647
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,009
- I'm sorry, Ju Won! - JL even made a heart.

648
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,039
JL!

649
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,739
(Beastly strength hidden behind the sweet heart)

650
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,810
What was that?

651
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,350
(Upset)

652
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:16,490
The players that have made it to Round Two are...

653
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,089
Steven, Nam Do Yoon, Jang Kyung Ho,

654
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,090
Li Zhinuo, JL, and Kim Gi Joong.

655
00:26:23,391 --> 00:26:26,800
The 1st match of Round 2 will be between Steven and Nam Do Yoon.

656
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:27,961
Please step forward!

657
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,770
Gosh, let's go.

658
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,029
(A jump of confidence)

659
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,570
- Steven! - Let's go!

660
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:34,940
Steven!

661
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:36,809
(Just trust me.)

662
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,871
I don't think I can beat him.

663
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,739
It's okay.

664
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,579
- It's okay. You can do it. - Do Yoon!

665
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,779
Your name tag.

666
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,211
The only hope of TEAM BEAT.

667
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:47,150
Is he the only one left from TEAM BEAT?

668
00:26:47,151 --> 00:26:48,650
Is Do Yoon the only one left from TEAM BEAT?

669
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:50,351
- Is he the only one left? - Yes.

670
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,489
Right. It's because he lost in just 0.1 seconds.

671
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,519
(Feeling embarrassed)

672
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,861
The older ones have done nothing.

673
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,529
We're out if I lose, right?

674
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,466
(The only hope of TEAM BEAT feels a lot on his shoulders.)

675
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,760
Gosh, Steven.

676
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,310
It's a battle between the guy who goes to the gym every day...

677
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,940
and the guy who goes to school every day.

678
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:11,310
(Fighter Steven versus Fighting Boy Nam Do Yoon)

679
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,860
You can beat him, right, Do Yoon?

680
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I'll try.

681
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:15,711
(Feeling intimidated)

682
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,580
(Will he be able to beat him?)

683
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,880
(Australian fighter, Steven)

684
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:21,950
I feel nervous.

685
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:23,621
(Korean high school student, Nam Do Yoon)

686
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:26,089
(If Steven's knees touch, )

687
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,461
(Do Yoon wins.)

688
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:32,860
In 1, 2...

689
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,029
(His knees touch right at the start, )

690
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,671
(and the match ends.)

691
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,901
(Relaxed)

692
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,170
(Who is this guy?)

693
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:46,479
It's over?

694
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,540
It's over.

695
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,880
(It's over?)

696
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:51,810
- What? - What?

697
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:54,121
- Who are you? - Nice one!

698
00:27:54,951 --> 00:27:55,951
(A result no one expected)

699
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:58,191
- Do Yoon! - Nice one!

700
00:27:58,691 --> 00:28:00,090
You're great at this.

701
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:02,190
Take a seat and get some rest.

702
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:03,489
- Take a seat and get some rest. - Take a seat.

703
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,259
- I'll give you a massage. - Get some rest.

704
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,600
- Give him a massage. - Get some rest.

705
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:08,601
Oh, my gosh.

706
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,201
Gosh.

707
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,769
Gosh, he was really strong.

708
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,940
(The back of the disappointed loser)

709
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:16,809
Nam Do Yoon is the winner of this match.

710
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,779
(Do Yoon unexpectedly takes the win!)

711
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,810
Next up is JL and Kim Gi Joong.

712
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,411
His legs are double my legs!

713
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:27,049
Let's go!

714
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,979
You got this. Don't worry. You got three picks.

715
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,191
- You can do it. - Let's go, JL!

716
00:28:31,391 --> 00:28:33,320
In 1, 2...

717
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:36,060
- Gosh! - Gosh!

718
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,030
(JL, if you are the man with 3 picks, )

719
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,170
(I am Kim Gi Joong, the man who has served in the Korean army.)

720
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:46,200
You can do it.

721
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:49,641
(Show us the strength of the one who served in the army!)

722
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,240
(Close)

723
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,509
Gosh! He's enduring it!

724
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,711
Hold the chair.

725
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,979
(A strong will to win)

726
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,621
Three, two, one. It's over.

727
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,191
(Crazy Gi Joong takes the win as the one who served in the army.)

728
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,631
(He's scary.)

729
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:14,661
In 1, 2...

730
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:16,700
They touched. Three,

731
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:20,400
two, one. It's over.

732
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:22,400
Jang Kyung Ho!

733
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:23,569
(Somebody fix my legs.)

734
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,870
(Li Zhinuo gets destroyed.)

735
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:28,640
Nam Do Yoon, Jang Kyung Ho, and Kim Gi Joong...

736
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,411
move on to Round Three.

737
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,049
The next match will be between...

738
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,580
members of TEAM GROOVE.

739
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:37,089
We've got family trouble.

740
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,150
(The family trouble starts.)

741
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:40,860
(The scary ones are going against each other.)

742
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:44,161
Kim Gi Joong and Jang Kyung Ho, please come forward.

743
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,390
- Let's go. - Let's go.

744
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:46,900
(It's time to decide on the one with the strongest thighs...)

745
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:47,960
(in TEAM GROOVE.)

746
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:48,961
Go!

747
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,101
This is really hard to predict.

748
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,377
It's really hard to predict the winner of this matchup.

749
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:57,117
(Is it Crazy Gi Joong who has served in the army...)

750
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:59,941
(or the beastly leader, Jang Kyung Ho?)

751
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,750
(Who will have the strongest thighs in TEAM GROOVE?)

752
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,010
They are the strongest ones.

753
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:05,110
(Strength versus strength)

754
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:07,721
You both should do your best.

755
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,651
- Are you ready? - Yes.

756
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,320
Who will be the strongest one on TEAM GROOVE?

757
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,060
Gi Joong looked really sturdy.

758
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:18,990
In 1, 2...

759
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,600
In 1, 2...

760
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:23,770
(Shaking)

761
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,570
Two...

762
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,040
(Looking modest)

763
00:30:36,181 --> 00:30:38,810
Hold on.

764
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,519
(You must do your best in battle.)

765
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,290
(He releases his craziness.)

766
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:47,259
- In 1, 2... It's over. - Hold on.

767
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,089
Kim Gi Joong takes the win.

768
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,890
(Crazy Gi Joong is merciless even against his own teammate.)

769
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,391
He must be really strong.

770
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,161
He must be really strong.

771
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:56,770
Gosh.

772
00:30:57,901 --> 00:30:59,539
I heard a bone break.

773
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,769
Are you okay?

774
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:03,411
- I don't think I can dance. - I'm sorry.

775
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,039
Gi Joong must be really strong.

776
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,180
Right.

777
00:31:07,181 --> 00:31:09,381
Here's the last match.

778
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:10,910
This one will be really exciting.

779
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,479
(Excited)

780
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,080
It's Kim Gi Joong.

781
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:16,020
And Nam Do Yoon!

782
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:17,390
Good luck.

783
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:18,950
(Nam Do Yoon, the unexpected ray of hope)

784
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:20,019
Let's fight!

785
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,690
- I'll come back after my win! - Let's do this!

786
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:24,131
- Let's have a team dinner! - Let's go!

787
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,300
(The man who is always serious when it comes to battle)

788
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:33,471
(He is determined just to win.)

789
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:36,540
(Craziness)

790
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:40,711
(The Discharged Boy made it to the final with his tenacity.)

791
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,580
(He showed his strength right from the start.)

792
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,979
Gosh!

793
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:54,060
(Fighting Boy comfortably made it to the finals.)

794
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,259
- Let's go! - Let's go!

795
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Good luck!

796
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,360
In 1, 2...

797
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:02,161
(Energetic Nam Do Yoon versus Crazy Gi Joong)

798
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:05,974
(This is making us breathless.)

799
00:32:07,573 --> 00:32:09,643
- Gosh! - Gosh!

800
00:32:10,474 --> 00:32:12,072
- What? - Gosh!

801
00:32:12,073 --> 00:32:14,343
(What's going on?)

802
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:16,444
What's going on?

803
00:32:16,445 --> 00:32:19,613
(Is there a big twist?)

804
00:32:19,914 --> 00:32:21,923
- Gosh, that's amazing! - Gosh!

805
00:32:21,924 --> 00:32:23,044
(What on earth is going on?)

806
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,622
(Nam Do Yoon wins easily!)

807
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:28,052
- It's over. - Do Yoon!

808
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:29,322
Great job!

809
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,223
- Gosh. - Give him a massage.

810
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:32,833
Give him a massage.

811
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:37,464
(Gi Joong is surprised.)

812
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:42,643
(This is the power of a Korean high school student.)

813
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:45,003
He's really good at this.

814
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,564
- That's amazing. - He's really strong.

815
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:49,244
Let's have a team dinner!

816
00:32:50,043 --> 00:32:53,013
(Current score)

817
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,983
In 1, 2, 3!

818
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:56,854
Let's go, TEAM BEAT!

819
00:32:58,224 --> 00:32:59,294
Gosh.

820
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:03,724
In this game, we can check the team's chemistry.

821
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,894
It's called Between the Cheeks.

822
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:07,463
"Between the Cheeks."

823
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:09,603
(Like this)

824
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:12,704
In pairs, they must run with an object between the cheeks.

825
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,874
The team to return first...

826
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:17,974
after passing the halfway point wins.

827
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:20,313
(Between the cheeks)

828
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:23,514
The winner gets three points.

829
00:33:24,414 --> 00:33:27,482
Kwon Hee Jun. Park Han.

830
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:29,223
- Kenta. - We've won.

831
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:31,323
What now? Should we win again or not?

832
00:33:32,423 --> 00:33:33,423
Let's just win again.

833
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:36,153
I better think about whether we should win again after this.

834
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:39,962
Right away like this? Or...

835
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:41,934
(We will win this time.)

836
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:46,002
All right. What to place between the cheeks...

837
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:47,374
is important.

838
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:49,104
Please bring in the boxes.

839
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:52,173
(Boxes?)

840
00:33:52,514 --> 00:33:53,874
Oh, no.

841
00:33:54,673 --> 00:33:56,584
(Ten boxes of different sizes)

842
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:58,543
(What are those?)

843
00:33:58,544 --> 00:33:59,814
It's smaller than I expected.

844
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:02,184
The sizes are different.

845
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:05,023
Hold on. Isn't the smaller the better?

846
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:06,993
No. It should be big.

847
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:08,022
The big one could be a doll.

848
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:10,423
Exactly. We need a big one. No doubt.

849
00:34:10,863 --> 00:34:12,563
- The guys will... - Something is moving.

850
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:14,462
- Do we pick 1? - We pick 1...

851
00:34:14,463 --> 00:34:15,664
and open it when they come.

852
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:17,362
- Which one? - The green box.

853
00:34:17,363 --> 00:34:18,363
(Something is moving.)

854
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:20,233
The box is moving.

855
00:34:20,434 --> 00:34:21,434
What?

856
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,543
- What? - What?

857
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:24,973
- What? - Why can't it stay still?

858
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:26,720
- The box is moving. - What's wrong with it?

859
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:27,744
(Focused)

860
00:34:27,943 --> 00:34:29,342
The box is alive.

861
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:31,813
- The box is moving. - The box is alive.

862
00:34:31,814 --> 00:34:32,814
The box is...

863
00:34:33,514 --> 00:34:35,482
- It's scary. - The box is moving.

864
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:36,483
(What's this? It's scary.)

865
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:37,883
I hope it's seafood.

866
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:41,423
I heard a small octopus was prepared.

867
00:34:41,753 --> 00:34:43,863
Let's see which team will pick the cactus.

868
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:50,104
Your objects will be picked at random.

869
00:34:51,003 --> 00:34:54,034
One from each team is to come up and pick one.

870
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:56,243
You should hurry. Shouldn't you hurry?

871
00:34:56,244 --> 00:34:58,373
(Running)

872
00:34:58,374 --> 00:35:00,314
- That one... - This should do.

873
00:35:01,314 --> 00:35:03,044
- This one? - Let's take it.

874
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:04,744
- This one. - Okay.

875
00:35:08,014 --> 00:35:09,653
- Here. - What?

876
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:13,053
(Flopping)

877
00:35:13,593 --> 00:35:15,794
(The sound and movement are very alive.)

878
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:17,923
(Why did they choose this box?)

879
00:35:18,894 --> 00:35:20,493
(When everyone was startled by the living box)

880
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:21,793
Go straight, and then...

881
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:23,003
let's get into it.

882
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:24,733
(And so they chose the living box.)

883
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:25,934
- Is it okay? - If it's big...

884
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:30,442
Everyone. Don't you want to know what's inside your box?

885
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:31,443
We do!

886
00:35:31,744 --> 00:35:33,112
A tail. A shark tail.

887
00:35:33,113 --> 00:35:34,474
(Revealing them to you first)

888
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:36,584
(What's inside the boxes is...)

889
00:35:37,014 --> 00:35:39,252
(Colored paper, broccoli, hair roller, squishy, squishy, )

890
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,890
(soft toy, mandarin orange, acupressure ball)

891
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:42,922
(What's inside the living box is...)

892
00:35:42,923 --> 00:35:44,523
(a fish doll.)

893
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:45,823
(But it moves.)

894
00:35:45,824 --> 00:35:47,753
(Flopping)

895
00:35:48,053 --> 00:35:50,522
(Already nervous to the maximum)

896
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,564
All right. Shall we start the race?

897
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,732
TEAM RHYTHM, make some noise!

898
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,764
- Good luck! - Good luck!

899
00:35:58,003 --> 00:35:59,104
Let's go!

900
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:00,903
Ready.

901
00:36:01,474 --> 00:36:03,442
- One, - No!

902
00:36:03,443 --> 00:36:04,443
Two!

903
00:36:04,444 --> 00:36:05,514
(Which team will win?)

904
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:08,673
What is it?

905
00:36:08,674 --> 00:36:09,683
(Keum Jin Ho and Nam Do Yoon)

906
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:10,712
(Hair roller)

907
00:36:10,713 --> 00:36:11,713
(Kenta and Seo Jeong Woo)

908
00:36:11,714 --> 00:36:12,853
(Colored paper)

909
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:13,854
(Ayumu and Daisuke)

910
00:36:13,854 --> 00:36:14,854
(Broccoli)

911
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:16,552
- Go. - Hurry.

912
00:36:16,553 --> 00:36:18,124
(TEAM BEAT sets out first.)

913
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:19,692
- It hurts. - BEAT's doing well.

914
00:36:19,693 --> 00:36:21,322
- Let's go. They dropped it. - Oh, no.

915
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:22,823
- No! - Hold on.

916
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:24,564
(The colored paper is much easier.)

917
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:26,232
It stings.

918
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:27,493
Hey!

919
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:28,494
(Move it!)

920
00:36:28,495 --> 00:36:30,002
Nice!

921
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,563
- They dropped it. - It stings.

922
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,303
- What? Kick it. - It stings so much.

923
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:35,643
What? Hurry!

924
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:36,943
Nice, Ayumu!

925
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,272
- Hurry. - Let's go.

926
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:40,343
- Okay. - Go.

927
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:42,913
Next team. Let's go.

928
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:44,213
Those two are kissing.

929
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:46,513
(Between the lips and not between the cheeks?)

930
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:47,612
(JL and Zen Zen)

931
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:49,724
(Mandarin orange)

932
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,124
(Amazed)

933
00:36:51,124 --> 00:36:52,124
(Kairi and Li Zhiwei)

934
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,493
(Acupressure ball)

935
00:36:54,494 --> 00:36:57,322
TEAM BEAT is currently in third place.

936
00:36:57,323 --> 00:36:59,092
- TEAM GROOVE has tripped. - Hurry.

937
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:00,093
Go.

938
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,333
- TEAM RHYTHM... - Go.

939
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,703
- BEAT! - Go!

940
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:06,502
(The current ranking is TEAM GROOVE, TEAM BEAT, and TEAM RHYTHM.)

941
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:07,933
The last players.

942
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,002
(Kwon Hee Jun and Park Ju Won)

943
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:10,873
(Squishy)

944
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:12,149
- The last players. - What is this?

945
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:16,084
(Kim Hyo Tae and Yuito have the same squishy.)

946
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:17,113
Here they go!

947
00:37:17,114 --> 00:37:20,014
(Nice, TEAM BEAT.)

948
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:21,653
(TEAM RHYTHM's Group 2 has arrived.)

949
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,623
(Chih En and Zhang Shuaibo: A fish doll)

950
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:27,093
(A flopping fish doll)

951
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:28,963
(Startled together)

952
00:37:30,064 --> 00:37:32,294
(We're out of time.)

953
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:34,363
(They're fast.)

954
00:37:34,363 --> 00:37:35,363
Look at their speed.

955
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,604
- Good luck! - RHYTHM!

956
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:39,003
TEAM RHYTHM...

957
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:41,403
- RHYTHM! - TEAM RHYTHM is really fast.

958
00:37:41,903 --> 00:37:43,743
- First place? - Let's go!

959
00:37:43,744 --> 00:37:44,874
(Keep running!)

960
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:48,573
Will they come in first place?

961
00:37:49,613 --> 00:37:52,752
(TEAM RHYTHM's unexpected win)

962
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:54,814
- Good job! - Well done!

963
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,184
What's with them?

964
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:01,323
(He just met eyes with the fish.)

965
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:04,922
(Thanks to the terrifying fish doll, TEAM RHYTHM has won 3 points!)

966
00:38:04,923 --> 00:38:08,534
(Current score)

967
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:11,533
- Universe Holiday. - One, two.

968
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:14,073
- Let's go! - Let's go!

969
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:18,272
This upcoming game is called Find the Liar.

970
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:19,973
(Universe League's third game: Find the Liar)

971
00:38:19,974 --> 00:38:21,644
Find the liar.

972
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:23,684
One team will be acting.

973
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:28,213
The two other teams must find the liar.

974
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:32,394
You must track down the one player who is acting differently.

975
00:38:32,923 --> 00:38:36,663
(If 4 are drinking normal sikhye, 1 is drinking salted sikhye)

976
00:38:36,664 --> 00:38:38,663
The two other teams, excluding the liar team,

977
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:40,863
can ask unlimited questions.

978
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:43,462
That's right. Find the liar, and you get one point.

979
00:38:43,463 --> 00:38:45,433
(The team to find the liar gets 1 point.)

980
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:48,873
If you fail to find the liar, the liar team gets the point.

981
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,173
(The liar team gets 2 points.)

982
00:38:50,503 --> 00:38:51,503
It's not easy.

983
00:38:52,573 --> 00:38:56,212
My team, TEAM RHYTHM, will be up first.

984
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:58,584
- Yes, let's go! - Let's go.

985
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:00,354
- Let's go! - I'm excited.

986
00:39:01,514 --> 00:39:03,724
(Round 1: Liar Team, TEAM RHYTHM)

987
00:39:04,284 --> 00:39:06,994
(The 5 boxes are identical on the outside.)

988
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:10,462
(4 boxes are filled with heavy papers.)

989
00:39:10,463 --> 00:39:12,894
(1 box is empty.)

990
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:16,962
(Find the one holding the empty box.)

991
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:18,264
Now then, shall we start?

992
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:20,433
Pull up the cover. Let's go.

993
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:22,503
(The cover goes up to hide the liar.)

994
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:24,273
- Thanks. - What?

995
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:26,244
Sir.

996
00:39:28,044 --> 00:39:30,443
I don't think Zhang Shuaibo will be able to lift it.

997
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:32,112
He'll have the lightest box.

998
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:33,354
Since he's the most brazen.

999
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:38,123
(Zhang Shuaibo is a pro at being sly and cute.)

1000
00:39:38,124 --> 00:39:41,123
You're right. But I think Zhang Shuaibo will make it obvious.

1001
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:43,763
From what I see, he'll put up with it.

1002
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:45,299
(A fine line between being cute and acting)

1003
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:46,962
I think he's good at acting.

1004
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:47,993
Look.

1005
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:48,994
Honestly...

1006
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:52,103
Isn't it better for Daisuke to hold the lightest box?

1007
00:39:52,104 --> 00:39:54,433
No, that'll be too obvious.

1008
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:57,072
- I'll hold the heavy box. - He'll do it.

1009
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:58,643
- Then you should take it. - You should...

1010
00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:01,072
But that'll be obvious too.

1011
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:02,443
- Really? - How about...

1012
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:06,053
- I'm curious. - What's going on over there?

1013
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:08,612
It must be heavier than expected. Their discussion is dragging on.

1014
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:10,060
(The opposing teams are dying to know.)

1015
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:11,822
(Meanwhile, the liar team is ready!)

1016
00:40:11,823 --> 00:40:13,553
Please put it down. We're ready.

1017
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:18,994
(The cover is finally going down.)

1018
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:21,764
(Out of the five boxes that look identical, )

1019
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,333
(the two teams must find the liar holding an empty box.)

1020
00:40:24,334 --> 00:40:25,604
Shuaibo is...

1021
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:28,133
(You can't tell, right?)

1022
00:40:28,503 --> 00:40:32,873
(The boxes don't look any different to the naked eye.)

1023
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:35,744
(This one's tough.)

1024
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,713
(Smiling)

1025
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:41,112
Zhang Shuaibo.

1026
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:42,284
(It's light.)

1027
00:40:42,883 --> 00:40:46,753
(His cuteness grabs attention.)

1028
00:40:47,124 --> 00:40:49,293
I want everyone to hold it with one hand.

1029
00:40:49,294 --> 00:40:50,294
- With 1 hand. - Hold it with 1 hand.

1030
00:40:50,295 --> 00:40:52,633
- One hand. - One hand.

1031
00:40:53,764 --> 00:40:54,764
- No. - What...

1032
00:40:54,765 --> 00:40:56,064
- Will it spill out? - One hand.

1033
00:40:56,834 --> 00:41:01,334
(Steven slowly lets one of his hands go.)

1034
00:41:01,573 --> 00:41:03,974
(That's smart.)

1035
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:07,272
- With one hand. - One hand? Just let it hang?

1036
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:08,393
(JL holds it with one hand.)

1037
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:11,183
- I think it's JL. - Nice.

1038
00:41:11,184 --> 00:41:12,482
- There's no recoil. - One liar.

1039
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:13,803
That's how it is when it's heavy.

1040
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:14,914
I think it's JL.

1041
00:41:15,284 --> 00:41:17,954
(When JL released one of his hands, )

1042
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:21,124
(the box followed without any recoil.)

1043
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:25,294
(Is JL holding the empty box?)

1044
00:41:25,494 --> 00:41:26,692
With only one hand.

1045
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:27,994
(At that moment, )

1046
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:31,564
(Zhang Shuaibo holds it up easily with one hand.)

1047
00:41:32,003 --> 00:41:33,573
(Is it Zhang Shuaibo?)

1048
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,902
I think it's Zhang Shuaibo. How can he hold it with one hand?

1049
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:38,183
(An Yul suspects Zhang Shuaibo.)

1050
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:40,112
It's not Daisuke for sure.

1051
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:41,773
- Daisuke. - It's not him.

1052
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:45,613
(His arm is trembling.)

1053
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,522
(Daisuke's arm is trembling severely.)

1054
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:53,153
- Daisuke. Okay. - Daisuke.

1055
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:54,744
- Daisuke. Okay. - How cute.

1056
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:57,822
Can't you hold it up with one hand?

1057
00:41:57,823 --> 00:41:58,823
Hold it up with one hand.

1058
00:41:59,294 --> 00:42:00,294
(Mission 2: Hold the box above the shoulder)

1059
00:42:00,295 --> 00:42:01,333
Hold it up.

1060
00:42:01,334 --> 00:42:02,433
(Mission 2: Hold the box above the shoulder)

1061
00:42:02,434 --> 00:42:03,462
With one hand?

1062
00:42:03,463 --> 00:42:10,203
(Holding the box above the shoulder is hard if the box is heavy.)

1063
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:13,113
(Trembling)

1064
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:16,014
(Does JL have a heavy box?)

1065
00:42:16,843 --> 00:42:17,943
I think it's JL.

1066
00:42:18,814 --> 00:42:20,383
I bet it's JL.

1067
00:42:20,483 --> 00:42:22,482
- No. - No, it's not JL.

1068
00:42:22,483 --> 00:42:25,382
- It's not JL. - Look at how the box is shaking.

1069
00:42:25,383 --> 00:42:26,794
When he's holding it up,

1070
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:29,423
JL is shaking the box.

1071
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:33,133
(Attentive)

1072
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:35,534
Can you do this for us?

1073
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:38,333
- Can you do this for us? - That?

1074
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:39,373
(The mission has become a lot harder.)

1075
00:42:39,374 --> 00:42:40,673
Can you do this?

1076
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:43,204
Seriously.

1077
00:42:43,205 --> 00:42:45,273
(JL's arm is trembling more.)

1078
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,643
Seriously.

1079
00:42:46,644 --> 00:42:48,573
(It's super confusing!)

1080
00:42:49,144 --> 00:42:53,883
(Is it real muscle pain, or is he acting hard?)

1081
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:56,883
(When JL has difficulty holding the box, )

1082
00:42:57,483 --> 00:43:01,423
(Steven holds it up so easily.)

1083
00:43:02,153 --> 00:43:06,093
(Zhang Shuaibo, who's not athletic, holds it up easily!)

1084
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,733
(Who is it?)

1085
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:11,903
(Confused)

1086
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:14,874
(Out of the three, )

1087
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:18,374
(who's the real liar holding an empty box?)

1088
00:43:19,343 --> 00:43:20,744
The liar we choose is...

1089
00:43:21,744 --> 00:43:22,744
JL.

1090
00:43:22,745 --> 00:43:24,382
(TEAM GROOVE selects JL as the liar.)

1091
00:43:24,383 --> 00:43:25,442
JL.

1092
00:43:25,443 --> 00:43:27,713
(TEAM GROOVE selects JL as the liar.)

1093
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:29,084
Aren't they idiots?

1094
00:43:30,253 --> 00:43:32,183
- Go ahead. - Give it a shot. Who is it?

1095
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:33,853
Do they want to be in third place that badly?

1096
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:34,894
- Go ahead. - Okay.

1097
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:38,422
The liar TEAM BEAT chooses is Zhang Shuaibo.

1098
00:43:38,423 --> 00:43:40,462
(TEAM BEAT selects Zhang Shuaibo as the liar.)

1099
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:41,494
What?

1100
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:43,164
- Really? - For real?

1101
00:43:44,434 --> 00:43:47,373
(The two teams chose different liars.)

1102
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,104
Will the two players...

1103
00:43:49,644 --> 00:43:51,003
open your boxes, please?

1104
00:43:51,204 --> 00:43:53,144
- Open. - Open.

1105
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:56,514
- It's JL without a doubt. - JL.

1106
00:43:57,883 --> 00:43:59,883
(No, it's Zhang Shuaibo.)

1107
00:44:00,613 --> 00:44:03,184
TEAM RHYTHM's liar is...

1108
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:07,994
JL.

1109
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,493
JL.

1110
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:11,893
(The liar has been caught.)

1111
00:44:11,894 --> 00:44:14,363
- Nice. - Yes.

1112
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:16,362
(JL's box is empty.)

1113
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,303
- I was confused in the middle. - That was mean.

1114
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:20,072
(Zhang Shuaibo's surprising acting)

1115
00:44:20,073 --> 00:44:21,803
The papers must've been heavy.

1116
00:44:22,374 --> 00:44:23,772
- It's okay. They won one point. - Don't worry.

1117
00:44:23,773 --> 00:44:26,414
- It's okay. - They only just won one point.

1118
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:27,873
It's a four-point difference.

1119
00:44:28,343 --> 00:44:29,413
(TEAM GROOVE, who got the liar right, )

1120
00:44:29,414 --> 00:44:31,283
It's okay. You fooled me.

1121
00:44:31,284 --> 00:44:33,514
(and TEAM RHYTHM, who fooled a team, get 1 point each.)

1122
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,724
TEAM GROOVE will take up the challenge this time.

1123
00:44:38,383 --> 00:44:39,454
We can do it.

1124
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:41,494
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1125
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:44,264
Is this for real?

1126
00:44:44,664 --> 00:44:45,822
(Laughing)

1127
00:44:45,823 --> 00:44:47,233
It's higher than expected.

1128
00:44:47,794 --> 00:44:50,704
(TEAM GROOVE's liar item seems extraordinary.)

1129
00:44:51,503 --> 00:44:52,564
Shall we try it on?

1130
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:54,333
Let's try it on.

1131
00:44:54,334 --> 00:44:55,633
(High heels?)

1132
00:44:56,044 --> 00:44:57,373
(For the first time in 21 years)

1133
00:44:57,374 --> 00:44:59,713
- Let's try it on first. - It doesn't fit.

1134
00:45:00,113 --> 00:45:01,443
- Really? - It doesn't?

1135
00:45:02,814 --> 00:45:03,882
(Jeong Woo tries it on.)

1136
00:45:03,883 --> 00:45:06,454
What? This is crazy. How do we wear it?

1137
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:07,854
Do we just...

1138
00:45:07,855 --> 00:45:08,954
(Shocked)

1139
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:10,523
It's seriously uncomfortable.

1140
00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:14,494
Park Han is already at it. He's trying to fool us already.

1141
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:16,724
(Sticking out)

1142
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:20,232
Jeong Woo is suddenly too tall. That's impossible even on tiptoes.

1143
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:21,493
He's like Jin Ziming right now.

1144
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:22,854
(Universe League's tallest player)

1145
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:24,763
(The heels must be at least 20cm.)

1146
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,933
Are you ready? Get ready to stand up.

1147
00:45:26,934 --> 00:45:28,373
(They must find the one without heels on.)

1148
00:45:28,374 --> 00:45:30,103
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

1149
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:33,014
(Can TEAM GROOVE fool both teams?)

1150
00:45:33,374 --> 00:45:34,943
- Gosh. - Hold on.

1151
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:37,612
Give me a minute.

1152
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:40,414
(Seo Jeong Woo is in danger from the start.)

1153
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:42,413
(Watching attentively)

1154
00:45:42,414 --> 00:45:43,483
Oh, my.

1155
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:46,294
- Over there... - I heard the heels click.

1156
00:45:47,423 --> 00:45:49,823
(Is Jeong Woo staggering because he's wearing high heels?)

1157
00:45:54,264 --> 00:45:56,133
(Finding them strange)

1158
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:58,834
Can each of you take turns jumping?

1159
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:01,594
- I'm afraid we can't jump alone. - We can't jump one at a time.

1160
00:46:01,773 --> 00:46:02,943
How about two at a time?

1161
00:46:03,573 --> 00:46:04,744
- Two at a time? - Yes.

1162
00:46:05,343 --> 00:46:06,374
You two, go ahead.

1163
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:08,514
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1164
00:46:10,544 --> 00:46:11,982
(They don't jump as a pair.)

1165
00:46:11,983 --> 00:46:13,813
(An unexpected sole behavior)

1166
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:15,253
- Kenta. - Excuse me?

1167
00:46:15,613 --> 00:46:17,253
Kenta's not good at Korean.

1168
00:46:17,523 --> 00:46:19,043
- I'm sorry. - I'm not good at Korean.

1169
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,064
Kenta. Please jump by yourself.

1170
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:25,893
- Kenta? - I'm not good at Japanese.

1171
00:46:25,894 --> 00:46:27,394
- Really? - Tell him in Korean.

1172
00:46:28,564 --> 00:46:29,764
I'm not good at Japanese.

1173
00:46:31,863 --> 00:46:33,033
What does that mean?

1174
00:46:33,034 --> 00:46:34,704
(Confused like the shaking camera)

1175
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:37,373
(Nice one, Kenta!)

1176
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:39,773
- That was great! - Kenta!

1177
00:46:40,443 --> 00:46:41,443
(Smiling)

1178
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:42,443
Kenta.

1179
00:46:42,914 --> 00:46:45,184
Can the three of you jump, please?

1180
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:46,882
One, two, three.

1181
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:47,914
(Jumping)

1182
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:49,923
Hold on.

1183
00:46:50,023 --> 00:46:52,653
Wait. I heard it. Dae Yun is wearing it for sure.

1184
00:46:52,923 --> 00:46:54,423
I heard him make a mistake.

1185
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,494
(Acting calm)

1186
00:46:57,923 --> 00:46:59,494
(Using his hawk eyes)

1187
00:47:00,294 --> 00:47:01,334
Stand on one foot.

1188
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:03,663
- One foot? - On one foot?

1189
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:05,934
Can you do it? Can we hold onto the cover?

1190
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:07,773
One, two, three.

1191
00:47:07,874 --> 00:47:10,044
(Barely making it)

1192
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:13,072
Is that so?

1193
00:47:13,073 --> 00:47:14,273
(In danger)

1194
00:47:15,443 --> 00:47:16,443
Kenta.

1195
00:47:18,314 --> 00:47:21,383
(Using his hawk eyes again)

1196
00:47:21,914 --> 00:47:22,953
I think it's Gangdong.

1197
00:47:22,954 --> 00:47:24,584
Yes, it might be Gangdong.

1198
00:47:25,523 --> 00:47:28,653
(Watching closely)

1199
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:32,693
(Gangdong, and not Kenta who was staggering?)

1200
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,993
- Please spin once. - Yes, do that.

1201
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:35,994
(Find the Liar mission 2)

1202
00:47:35,995 --> 00:47:37,064
Spin.

1203
00:47:37,764 --> 00:47:38,802
Don't grab onto me.

1204
00:47:38,803 --> 00:47:41,834
(A big mess)

1205
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:45,143
(Gangdong is quite calm alone.)

1206
00:47:45,144 --> 00:47:46,413
The guys might catch a glimpse of it.

1207
00:47:46,414 --> 00:47:47,654
(Gangdong is quite calm alone.)

1208
00:47:47,843 --> 00:47:49,474
(He's got a hunch.)

1209
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:51,943
Come here.

1210
00:47:51,944 --> 00:47:53,013
(Gather around.)

1211
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:54,354
Gangdong.

1212
00:47:54,854 --> 00:47:56,684
Gangdong's height kept changing.

1213
00:47:58,224 --> 00:48:02,252
(Did Gangdong's height change because he was on tiptoes?)

1214
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:04,994
Everyone is using Gangdong to support themselves.

1215
00:48:06,193 --> 00:48:07,233
That's it.

1216
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:10,434
(Kenta kept grabbing Gangdong's shoulder when staggering.)

1217
00:48:10,764 --> 00:48:13,934
(A valid guess)

1218
00:48:14,303 --> 00:48:15,334
I know who it is.

1219
00:48:16,544 --> 00:48:19,544
- Yeo Gangdong. - We were just talking about him.

1220
00:48:20,144 --> 00:48:24,983
(Is the liar Yeo Gangdong?)

1221
00:48:25,314 --> 00:48:26,853
We choose...

1222
00:48:26,854 --> 00:48:28,513
(TEAM RHYTHM chooses...)

1223
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:29,583
Gangdong.

1224
00:48:29,584 --> 00:48:32,523
(TEAM RHYTHM chooses Yeo Gangdong.)

1225
00:48:32,724 --> 00:48:33,993
Yeo Gangdong?

1226
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,192
(Smiling)

1227
00:48:35,193 --> 00:48:38,264
TEAM BEAT also chooses Yeo Gangdong.

1228
00:48:38,994 --> 00:48:40,863
(Both teams chose me?)

1229
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:43,003
Okay. Please open the cover.

1230
00:48:44,164 --> 00:48:49,573
(Is Yeo Gangdong the liar not wearing high heels?)

1231
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:58,343
(Yeo Gangdong walks out wearing high heels.)

1232
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:00,613
How come?

1233
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:02,814
How come?

1234
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:06,124
What?

1235
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:09,522
(TEAM GROOVE's liar is...)

1236
00:49:09,523 --> 00:49:11,263
(Seo Jeong Woo!)

1237
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:12,293
Jeong Woo!

1238
00:49:12,294 --> 00:49:15,434
(He wasn't even on the list of suspects.)

1239
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:17,903
It was Jeong Woo.

1240
00:49:19,903 --> 00:49:23,544
(This player is still shocked.)

1241
00:49:23,974 --> 00:49:25,002
This is GROOVE.

1242
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,483
(Jeong Woo's acting fooled everyone.)

1243
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:28,112
(In Round 2, TEAM GROOVE earned 2 points!)

1244
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:30,943
- Cool! - Scream!

1245
00:49:31,144 --> 00:49:32,442
GROOVE is cool!

1246
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:34,953
(Round 3: Liar Team, TEAM BEAT)

1247
00:49:34,954 --> 00:49:37,423
- Who will drink it? - The colors are identical.

1248
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:38,724
Nobody can tell.

1249
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:40,954
How about selecting it randomly for fun?

1250
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,164
(4 apple juices of the same product)

1251
00:49:44,794 --> 00:49:48,794
(1 vinegar apple juice with 9 parts apple vinegar and 1 part juice)

1252
00:49:49,463 --> 00:49:51,132
(The one drinking vinegar apple juice must be found.)

1253
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:53,173
- This one is apple juice. - Do we not know either?

1254
00:49:53,204 --> 00:49:54,373
Do we not know either?

1255
00:49:54,374 --> 00:49:55,974
(Which one is mixed with vinegar?)

1256
00:49:56,173 --> 00:49:57,474
Is it this one?

1257
00:49:58,244 --> 00:49:59,273
(Sniffing)

1258
00:50:01,144 --> 00:50:02,873
- No. - Then...

1259
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,743
(It's a penalty for the one fooling others too.)

1260
00:50:04,744 --> 00:50:06,553
I hate it.

1261
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:07,684
I smell vinegar.

1262
00:50:08,954 --> 00:50:10,022
I can smell it from over here.

1263
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:11,684
(The smell of vinegar has spread.)

1264
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:14,323
We should decide who will drink it.

1265
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:17,692
- I'm allergic to liquid. - I...

1266
00:50:17,693 --> 00:50:18,763
- I'll be honest. - Okay.

1267
00:50:18,764 --> 00:50:19,994
(Revealing this round's liar)

1268
00:50:20,463 --> 00:50:23,164
Do Yoon drinking the vinegar apple juice...

1269
00:50:23,934 --> 00:50:24,963
is a bit predictable.

1270
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:27,474
Keum Jin Ho is the least expected player to drink it.

1271
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,302
- How come? - It's obvious.

1272
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:31,442
- Why? - Personality-wise,

1273
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:33,172
you'd ask An Yul to do it,

1274
00:50:33,173 --> 00:50:34,712
- What? - and he'd do it.

1275
00:50:34,713 --> 00:50:35,974
(Recommending Keum Jin Ho)

1276
00:50:36,383 --> 00:50:39,063
Nobody will find out if Keum Jin Ho drinks the vinegar apple juice.

1277
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:41,613
I'm fine with it.

1278
00:50:42,014 --> 00:50:43,823
- Then you do it. - Go ahead.

1279
00:50:44,454 --> 00:50:46,454
- Thank you. - Okay.

1280
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:51,323
(Will they be able to fool the opposing teams?)

1281
00:50:51,794 --> 00:50:52,794
Please open it.

1282
00:50:52,795 --> 00:50:53,934
(Opening the cover)

1283
00:50:54,664 --> 00:50:56,834
(For real?)

1284
00:50:57,534 --> 00:51:00,732
(TEAM BEAT covered the juice color with their sleeves.)

1285
00:51:00,733 --> 00:51:02,204
So you'll even cover up the color?

1286
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:04,473
- What's with that? - That's unfair.

1287
00:51:04,474 --> 00:51:05,772
(A cheap trick to win)

1288
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:08,273
Can each of you drink one at a time?

1289
00:51:08,673 --> 00:51:10,842
- Must I start? - Yes.

1290
00:51:10,843 --> 00:51:12,882
- Each of you. - Please take a sip.

1291
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:13,923
(Hurry up and take a sip.)

1292
00:51:14,713 --> 00:51:15,752
(Recalling his child actor days)

1293
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:16,783
Seriously.

1294
00:51:16,784 --> 00:51:17,854
(Starting to act)

1295
00:51:18,823 --> 00:51:22,423
(Drinking the apple juice as if it were vinegar)

1296
00:51:24,693 --> 00:51:25,724
What is this?

1297
00:51:26,794 --> 00:51:27,794
(Laughing)

1298
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:28,862
He's acting.

1299
00:51:28,863 --> 00:51:29,863
That's acting.

1300
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:31,403
As expected from an actor.

1301
00:51:31,903 --> 00:51:32,962
I'm drinking next.

1302
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:36,133
(Next is Keum Jin Ho with vinegar apple juice)

1303
00:51:36,644 --> 00:51:37,644
Is there water?

1304
00:51:38,644 --> 00:51:39,673
Sir?

1305
00:51:40,414 --> 00:51:41,414
I mean it.

1306
00:51:41,415 --> 00:51:42,815
Do Yoon. You're overdoing it a bit.

1307
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:45,744
- It's too much. - That's too much, not even a bit.

1308
00:51:46,613 --> 00:51:47,652
I mean it.

1309
00:51:47,653 --> 00:51:49,184
(Endless excessive acting)

1310
00:51:49,823 --> 00:51:50,954
(Drinking)

1311
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:52,284
It's not a bit.

1312
00:51:53,454 --> 00:51:54,454
Gosh.

1313
00:51:55,823 --> 00:51:56,823
It's Jin Ho.

1314
00:51:56,824 --> 00:51:59,423
(Suspecting right away)

1315
00:52:00,064 --> 00:52:02,232
(The intensity of the vinegar shocks his frontal lobe.)

1316
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:03,233
This is...

1317
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:06,802
(It's leaving him speechless.)

1318
00:52:06,803 --> 00:52:07,833
But really...

1319
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,942
- I'm only watching, but... - I can smell the vinegar.

1320
00:52:09,943 --> 00:52:11,743
(The vinegar smell is coming from somewhere.)

1321
00:52:11,773 --> 00:52:12,773
An Yul. Let's go.

1322
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:13,773
(Next is An Yul.)

1323
00:52:13,774 --> 00:52:14,813
Do I really drink it?

1324
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:16,414
(Acting)

1325
00:52:17,184 --> 00:52:18,983
(Tilting)

1326
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:20,652
(How did Do Yoon act again?)

1327
00:52:20,653 --> 00:52:21,713
My heart is racing.

1328
00:52:22,784 --> 00:52:23,982
(Acting will all his might)

1329
00:52:23,983 --> 00:52:25,053
Right?

1330
00:52:25,753 --> 00:52:27,693
(Trembling)

1331
00:52:28,593 --> 00:52:29,593
He's about to throw up.

1332
00:52:29,594 --> 00:52:31,522
(He's about to throw up.)

1333
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,163
Yul must be trying it for the first time in his life.

1334
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:38,034
(Acting as if it were his first ever taste of the intense vinegar)

1335
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:40,703
- Next. - My eyes are tearing up.

1336
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:42,184
(The already teary Woong Ki is next.)

1337
00:52:42,334 --> 00:52:44,173
You can cry after drinking it first.

1338
00:52:46,273 --> 00:52:49,374
(Are you a thinker, Steven?)

1339
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:53,454
(The hurt feeler takes a sip of the juice.)

1340
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:58,284
(Acting as if it's vinegar as much as possible)

1341
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:01,453
(Is he leaving his position?)

1342
00:53:01,454 --> 00:53:03,494
I heard him drinking the apple juice.

1343
00:53:04,294 --> 00:53:06,263
Hyo Tae, you're next.

1344
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:07,333
(Let me see.)

1345
00:53:07,334 --> 00:53:08,994
Drink up without covering it.

1346
00:53:09,863 --> 00:53:13,474
(He's nervous to actually put on an act.)

1347
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:15,172
(This is vinegar.)

1348
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:16,173
He drank it.

1349
00:53:17,044 --> 00:53:18,173
(Squinting)

1350
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:20,943
(What was that?)

1351
00:53:21,673 --> 00:53:22,873
(Did they fall for it?)

1352
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:24,213
I don't think it's his.

1353
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:26,013
- I can't tell. - Hyo Tae, you're next.

1354
00:53:26,014 --> 00:53:28,814
Hurry. We don't have all day.

1355
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:30,723
(The two teams can't tell at all.)

1356
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:32,123
- Have them gargle... - This is tough.

1357
00:53:32,124 --> 00:53:34,053
And drink from another cup.

1358
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:37,522
Can you gargle first and then drink it?

1359
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:39,862
(Can you gargle first and then drink it?)

1360
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:40,933
(He can't believe what he's hearing.)

1361
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:42,993
- Gargle. - Like this.

1362
00:53:42,994 --> 00:53:44,003
(Gargling)

1363
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:45,303
You want us to gargle?

1364
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:49,104
(I have to rinse my mouth with this vinegar?)

1365
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:51,403
(I feel bad for you.)

1366
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:54,014
Sure. We should do it, I guess.

1367
00:53:54,874 --> 00:53:55,974
Seriously?

1368
00:53:56,474 --> 00:53:58,882
- Hurry up. - Oh, no.

1369
00:53:58,883 --> 00:54:00,284
One, two, three.

1370
00:54:00,753 --> 00:54:02,883
(Sucking)

1371
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:07,493
(Gargling)

1372
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,522
(Choking)

1373
00:54:08,523 --> 00:54:09,553
(Coughing)

1374
00:54:09,994 --> 00:54:13,064
(They forget about the game and laugh at the sight.)

1375
00:54:13,794 --> 00:54:16,863
(It's more painful for those watching.)

1376
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:20,302
(The leader sacrifices himself for the team.)

1377
00:54:20,303 --> 00:54:21,943
(Is this the weight of being the leader?)

1378
00:54:22,104 --> 00:54:23,273
An Yul didn't drink his.

1379
00:54:24,104 --> 00:54:25,203
Neither did Hyo Tae.

1380
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:26,302
(The two with apple juice didn't drink theirs...)

1381
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,374
(as part of the act.)

1382
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,314
(If only I could give them an earful about this.)

1383
00:54:31,613 --> 00:54:33,552
This is tough. I really can't tell.

1384
00:54:33,553 --> 00:54:35,013
(Leader Keum has both teams puzzled.)

1385
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:37,553
I can't tell. Are you sure one of them drank vinegar?

1386
00:54:38,383 --> 00:54:40,052
The liar we chose is...

1387
00:54:40,053 --> 00:54:41,693
(They make their decision while puzzled.)

1388
00:54:41,923 --> 00:54:43,022
Kim Hyo Tae.

1389
00:54:43,023 --> 00:54:44,793
(TEAM GROOVE chooses Kim Hyo Tae.)

1390
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:46,123
(They fell for it.)

1391
00:54:46,124 --> 00:54:47,132
Okay.

1392
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:50,463
For TEAM RHYTHM, we think it's...

1393
00:54:51,003 --> 00:54:52,834
Right? An Yul.

1394
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:55,302
(They chose the 2 people that didn't gargle.)

1395
00:54:55,303 --> 00:54:57,343
(Putting on a convincing act until the last second)

1396
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,043
I can't believe you had the youngest member...

1397
00:54:59,044 --> 00:55:00,573
take on this cruel task.

1398
00:55:00,773 --> 00:55:03,313
(You think?)

1399
00:55:03,314 --> 00:55:05,613
Let us reveal the answer.

1400
00:55:06,443 --> 00:55:09,213
One, two, three.

1401
00:55:09,914 --> 00:55:12,422
(Gulping)

1402
00:55:12,423 --> 00:55:14,323
(Not saying a word)

1403
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:15,653
I can't drink it.

1404
00:55:17,863 --> 00:55:18,963
I can't drink it.

1405
00:55:20,034 --> 00:55:21,894
- Who was it? - What?

1406
00:55:22,564 --> 00:55:24,533
- Was it Jin Ho? - Jin Ho?

1407
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,564
(It was Jin Ho?)

1408
00:55:26,874 --> 00:55:28,103
- Go, Jin Ho! - It's tasty.

1409
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:29,172
Nice!

1410
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:31,543
(After hardship follows a score.)

1411
00:55:31,544 --> 00:55:33,643
- I can't believe it. - Jin Ho had the vinegar.

1412
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:34,773
Nice!

1413
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:37,212
- Nice! - Good job.

1414
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:38,813
Nicely done, guys.

1415
00:55:38,814 --> 00:55:42,383
(Current score)

1416
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:44,223
In 1, 2, 3.

1417
00:55:44,224 --> 00:55:46,454
- It's time to GROOVE. - It's time to GROOVE.

1418
00:55:47,593 --> 00:55:49,093
The next event...

1419
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:52,764
will test your teamwork and fitness level.

1420
00:55:52,894 --> 00:55:54,963
It's Group Jump Rope.

1421
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:56,433
(Universe League's fourth game: Group Jump Rope)

1422
00:55:56,434 --> 00:55:57,434
Let's go!

1423
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:02,272
We will start counting after every member...

1424
00:56:02,273 --> 00:56:03,604
has begun jumping rope.

1425
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:07,573
The team that jumps the most will win.

1426
00:56:07,974 --> 00:56:10,983
You will be competing for five points.

1427
00:56:11,144 --> 00:56:12,683
- No way. - Five points?

1428
00:56:12,684 --> 00:56:13,784
- Go, team! - What?

1429
00:56:14,314 --> 00:56:17,252
- We need to win. - We really need this win.

1430
00:56:17,253 --> 00:56:19,022
- Five points? - Let's get it.

1431
00:56:19,023 --> 00:56:21,794
It's worth a lot of points, so do your best.

1432
00:56:21,894 --> 00:56:23,124
We must win.

1433
00:56:23,494 --> 00:56:27,934
Then, we'll start with TEAM RHYTHM.

1434
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:29,834
- Go, team! - You've got this.

1435
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:32,263
- Right. - Let's go.

1436
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,473
You will get to practice first,

1437
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,744
but all you'll get are two attempts.

1438
00:56:37,403 --> 00:56:38,443
Check the center.

1439
00:56:38,874 --> 00:56:40,743
Move back a little.

1440
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:42,672
- Zhang Shuaibo. - Because he's tall.

1441
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:45,383
- Right. you should go 3rd. - Yes, 3rd.

1442
00:56:45,814 --> 00:56:48,084
- In the back? - You're too tall,

1443
00:56:48,684 --> 00:56:50,044
so you should stand in the middle.

1444
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:52,584
Since I'm really short,

1445
00:56:52,624 --> 00:56:54,022
- What? - we should go...

1446
00:56:54,023 --> 00:56:55,353
like this.

1447
00:56:55,354 --> 00:56:56,839
(Daisuke lines them up in the order of height.)

1448
00:56:56,863 --> 00:56:58,863
I'll get in there first.

1449
00:56:59,423 --> 00:57:01,192
- Go ahead. - Go.

1450
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:02,633
(TEAM RHYTHM's first practice round)

1451
00:57:03,834 --> 00:57:05,333
Look ahead. That's it.

1452
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,603
- Look straight ahead. - One, two.

1453
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:12,572
(The first jumpers start jumping at a steady pace.)

1454
00:57:12,573 --> 00:57:14,474
Three, four.

1455
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:17,713
Four, five, six.

1456
00:57:18,244 --> 00:57:19,284
(Flinching)

1457
00:57:20,584 --> 00:57:21,753
(Screaming)

1458
00:57:22,553 --> 00:57:23,823
(Screaming)

1459
00:57:24,084 --> 00:57:25,124
You go first.

1460
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:29,823
(James confesses. "Jumping rope is the scariest.")

1461
00:57:32,794 --> 00:57:34,963
- Hurry. - Daisuke!

1462
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:37,833
(They fail their 1st practice round...)

1463
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:39,033
(without being able to start counting.)

1464
00:57:39,034 --> 00:57:40,233
What was that?

1465
00:57:42,204 --> 00:57:44,502
- This is bad. - Okay.

1466
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:45,572
I'll try again.

1467
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:47,573
- Let's... - This is also a practice round.

1468
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:48,813
Okay.

1469
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:50,294
(TEAM RHYTHM's second practice round)

1470
00:57:52,014 --> 00:57:54,552
- It's too fast. - Can you slow it down?

1471
00:57:54,553 --> 00:57:56,922
(Steven and Xie Yuxin slow it down a bit.)

1472
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:58,353
One.

1473
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:00,953
- Okay. - One, two,

1474
00:58:00,954 --> 00:58:03,224
- three, four. - Hold on.

1475
00:58:03,923 --> 00:58:05,623
- Four, five. - Hold on.

1476
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:07,063
- Move back a little. - Five.

1477
00:58:07,064 --> 00:58:09,034
- Five, six. - Move back a little.

1478
00:58:09,233 --> 00:58:11,764
- Move back a little. - Six, seven.

1479
00:58:19,443 --> 00:58:20,573
Okay. Change.

1480
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:21,913
Me!

1481
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:23,843
- Change. - I want to try.

1482
00:58:24,483 --> 00:58:25,843
Trade!

1483
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:27,982
- Me! - Change.

1484
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:29,383
I want to try.

1485
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:32,853
(Switching players from James to Li Zhinuo)

1486
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:34,552
- In James' place, - I want to try.

1487
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,453
Li Zhinuo will jump instead.

1488
00:58:36,454 --> 00:58:37,494
It's a trade.

1489
00:58:37,823 --> 00:58:40,693
You'll be doing it for real this time around.

1490
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:42,263
Okay. Here we go.

1491
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:43,264
(TEAM RHYTHM plays for real this time.)

1492
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:45,862
TEAM RHYTHM, your jump begins.

1493
00:58:45,863 --> 00:58:46,903
Let's go!

1494
00:58:51,673 --> 00:58:52,704
Stop.

1495
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:58,914
(They make it safely to the 3rd jumper.)

1496
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,284
(New player Li Zhinuo also makes it in.)

1497
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:06,584
(Move forward.)

1498
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:08,692
Move forward.

1499
00:59:08,693 --> 00:59:10,523
- One, two, - One, two,

1500
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:13,663
- three, four, five. - Daisuke, you're off beat.

1501
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:15,334
Daisuke, move a little bit back.

1502
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:22,704
(Daisuke jumps half a beat faster than the others.)

1503
00:59:24,204 --> 00:59:27,813
Six, seven, eight,

1504
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,873
- nine, ten. - Nine, ten.

1505
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:31,382
- We just need to find the rhythm. - Eleven.

1506
00:59:31,383 --> 00:59:34,853
- Twelve, thirteen, fourteen, - Twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

1507
00:59:34,854 --> 00:59:38,353
- fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, - fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,

1508
00:59:38,354 --> 00:59:41,893
- eighteen, nineteen, twenty, - How are they this good at it?

1509
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:44,192
- twenty-one, twenty-two, - twenty-one, twenty-two,

1510
00:59:44,193 --> 00:59:45,293
- twenty-three, - twenty-three,

1511
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:47,692
- twenty-four, twenty-five, - twenty-four, twenty-five,

1512
00:59:47,693 --> 00:59:48,893
- twenty-six, - twenty-six,

1513
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:51,163
- twenty-seven, twenty-eight, - twenty-seven, twenty-eight,

1514
00:59:51,164 --> 00:59:52,263
- twenty-nine, - twenty-nine,

1515
00:59:52,264 --> 00:59:54,703
- thirty, thirty-one, - My arms hurt!

1516
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:56,833
- thirty-two, thirty-three, - Daisuke!

1517
00:59:56,834 --> 00:59:58,002
- Daisuke! - thirty-four,

1518
00:59:58,003 --> 01:00:00,413
- thirty-five, thirty-six, - I'm exhausted!

1519
01:00:00,414 --> 01:00:03,313
Thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine...

1520
01:00:03,314 --> 01:00:05,644
Daisuke!

1521
01:00:06,343 --> 01:00:07,513
(The game ends...)

1522
01:00:07,514 --> 01:00:10,482
(with the exhausted Daisuke losing his beat.)

1523
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:12,982
Daisuke!

1524
01:00:12,983 --> 01:00:14,923
- I'm so sorry. - Good job. You got 39.

1525
01:00:15,224 --> 01:00:16,963
(What a bummer.)

1526
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:20,264
- Good job! - I'm exhausted.

1527
01:00:22,034 --> 01:00:23,763
My arm!

1528
01:00:23,764 --> 01:00:24,979
(Meanwhile, the rope turner is in a crisis.)

1529
01:00:25,003 --> 01:00:26,034
My arm.

1530
01:00:27,334 --> 01:00:29,603
(I can't lift my arm.)

1531
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:31,104
My arm's killing me.

1532
01:00:33,744 --> 01:00:34,772
How many did they get?

1533
01:00:34,773 --> 01:00:35,873
- Thirty-nine. - Thirty-nine?

1534
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:37,212
- That's a lot. - Thirty-nine?

1535
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:39,683
- They did great. - Do we need 40 to beat them?

1536
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:42,814
- Yes, at least 45. - TEAM GROOVE will only get 15.

1537
01:00:43,553 --> 01:00:45,752
Next up is TEAM GROOVE.

1538
01:00:45,753 --> 01:00:48,923
- Go, TEAM GROOVE! - Go, TEAM GROOVE!

1539
01:00:49,753 --> 01:00:52,063
(Kyung Ho puts on gloves to turn the ropes.)

1540
01:00:52,064 --> 01:00:54,093
The glove is all sweaty.

1541
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:56,834
(The one who sweated is embarrassed.)

1542
01:00:58,164 --> 01:00:59,502
The gloves are awfully warm.

1543
01:00:59,503 --> 01:01:00,810
(The warmth of the gloves isn't appealing.)

1544
01:01:00,834 --> 01:01:03,173
If you don't have the stamina, join in last.

1545
01:01:03,943 --> 01:01:05,703
- Should I go first? - Sure. It doesn't matter.

1546
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,573
- I'll go 2nd. - I'll go 3rd.

1547
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:08,814
- Go last. - Okay.

1548
01:01:09,144 --> 01:01:11,743
Aim the rope for the red mark here.

1549
01:01:11,744 --> 01:01:14,313
Keep your arm out straight and make big circles.

1550
01:01:14,314 --> 01:01:16,052
We'd appreciate you hitting the ground hard.

1551
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:17,723
- Should we speed it up a bit? - Yes.

1552
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:20,693
- One and two. - One and two.

1553
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:23,423
- Good. We have it all planned out. - Two.

1554
01:01:24,193 --> 01:01:25,193
And go.

1555
01:01:25,194 --> 01:01:26,764
(TEAM GROOVE's first practice round)

1556
01:01:27,334 --> 01:01:29,193
Now.

1557
01:01:30,733 --> 01:01:34,203
(They begin at a steady pace.)

1558
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:35,233
Now.

1559
01:01:41,914 --> 01:01:45,583
- One, two, three... - Okay, stop!

1560
01:01:45,584 --> 01:01:47,784
- Okay, we're good. - Okay.

1561
01:01:48,053 --> 01:01:49,513
- That was great. - Okay.

1562
01:01:49,514 --> 01:01:51,283
- Okay. Good. - I'm liking what I saw.

1563
01:01:51,284 --> 01:01:52,624
- Okay. - Nice.

1564
01:01:52,823 --> 01:01:53,863
Are you doing it for real?

1565
01:01:54,354 --> 01:01:55,752
- Yes. - We're on.

1566
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,224
- Let's go! - TEAM GROOVE.

1567
01:01:58,363 --> 01:01:59,522
I'm scared.

1568
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:02,894
Will they be able to beat TEAM RHYTHM's score of 39?

1569
01:02:03,434 --> 01:02:04,632
They won't.

1570
01:02:04,633 --> 01:02:05,753
(They won't beat our score.)

1571
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:08,533
- Let's go! - You're doing it for real.

1572
01:02:08,534 --> 01:02:09,672
And go.

1573
01:02:09,673 --> 01:02:11,233
(TEAM GROOVE plays for real this time.)

1574
01:02:15,613 --> 01:02:18,284
(They join in smoothly yet again.)

1575
01:02:26,053 --> 01:02:29,152
- One, two, three, - One, two, three,

1576
01:02:29,153 --> 01:02:32,422
- four, five, six, - four, five, six,

1577
01:02:32,423 --> 01:02:35,893
- seven, eight, nine, - seven, eight, nine,

1578
01:02:35,894 --> 01:02:38,163
- ten, eleven, - Nice. Just like that.

1579
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:41,272
- twelve, thirteen, fourteen. - Go, Koo Han Seo!

1580
01:02:41,273 --> 01:02:43,374
- Fifteen. - Sixteen.

1581
01:02:43,604 --> 01:02:46,673
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,

1582
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:49,112
- twenty, twenty-one, - Oh, no.

1583
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:51,313
- twenty-two, twenty-three, - Please.

1584
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:53,313
- twenty-four, twenty-five, - Twenty-four, twenty-five,

1585
01:02:53,314 --> 01:02:54,482
- twenty-six, - twenty-six,

1586
01:02:54,483 --> 01:02:56,583
- twenty-seven, twenty-eight, - twenty-seven, twenty-eight,

1587
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:57,683
- twenty-nine, - twenty-nine,

1588
01:02:57,684 --> 01:02:59,983
- thirty, thirty-one... - That's enough. Thirty-one,

1589
01:03:00,354 --> 01:03:01,752
(Not even 10 remain until 39)

1590
01:03:01,753 --> 01:03:03,223
- Oh, no. - That's enough.

1591
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:05,322
- Thirty-one, thirty-two, - Stop!

1592
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,233
- thirty-three, thirty-four, - Stop.

1593
01:03:07,334 --> 01:03:09,410
- thirty-five, thirty-six, - Thirty-five, thirty-six,

1594
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:10,834
- thirty-seven... - thirty-seven...

1595
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:14,773
(Will they beat TEAM RHYTHM's score of 39?)

1596
01:03:19,398 --> 01:03:21,505
- Thirty-seven, thirty-eight, - Thirty-seven, thirty-eight,

1597
01:03:21,529 --> 01:03:23,739
- thirty-nine, forty. - thirty-nine, forty.

1598
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:25,068
- Forty-one. - Forty-one.

1599
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:27,009
- Thirty-nine, forty. - Thirty-nine, forty.

1600
01:03:28,168 --> 01:03:30,207
- Forty-two, forty-three, - No way.

1601
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,009
Forty-four, forty-five.

1602
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,707
- Forty! - Okay.

1603
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:36,378
- Forty-two, forty-three, - Forty-three,

1604
01:03:36,478 --> 01:03:38,518

1606
01:03:40,788 --> 01:03:42,819
forty-eight, forty-nine,

1607
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,187
- fifty. - Hold on.

1608
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:46,159
- Fifty-one, fifty-two. - Fifty-one, fifty-two.

1609
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:47,787
(There's someone else who has gone pale.)

1610
01:03:47,788 --> 01:03:48,798
- Fifty, - Hold on.

1611
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,158
- fifty-one, - Dae Yun, keep going!

1612
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,969
Fifty-two, fifty-three,

1613
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:53,227
- fifty-four, - That's enough!

1614
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:55,167
- fifty-five, fifty-six, - Enough!

1615
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:56,238
Fifty-seven,

1616
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:57,397
- Don't stop. - fifty-eight,

1617
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,268
- fifty-nine, sixty, - I'm exhausted!

1618
01:03:59,668 --> 01:04:03,909
- sixty-one, sixty-two... - Ten more!

1619
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:07,508
- You jumped the rope 61 times. - Goodness.

1620
01:04:07,509 --> 01:04:09,549
- Good job, guys. - Nicely done.

1621
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:11,417
- Great job. - Let's go!

1622
01:04:11,418 --> 01:04:12,989
- Nice. - You all did great.

1623
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:15,518
My gosh.

1624
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,088
(TEAM RHYTHM is pushed to 2nd place with a gap of 22 jumps.)

1625
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:18,429
They're really good at this.

1626
01:04:19,489 --> 01:04:20,489
TEAM BEAT. What now?

1627
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:23,099
We'll do 100.

1628
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,969
- We'll do 100. - For now...

1629
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,798
Just keep a steady pace.

1630
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,638
Stop at exactly 62. I'll drop the rope.

1631
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,139
- Let's do this! - Sixty-two!

1632
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:33,969
Five, six, seven, eight.

1633
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:35,937
One and two and...

1634
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:37,678
- three and four and... - Three and four and...

1635
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,048
- five and six and... - five and six and...

1636
01:04:40,049 --> 01:04:41,778
- seven and eight and... - seven and eight and...

1637
01:04:41,779 --> 01:04:43,517
(They're in their own world.)

1638
01:04:43,518 --> 01:04:45,348
- Three and four and... - Three and four and...

1639
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:46,389
five and six and...

1640
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:48,418
Five, six, seven, eight.

1641
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,287
And two and three and...

1642
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:53,727
- Look at Do Yoon. - four.

1643
01:04:53,728 --> 01:04:55,298
- Five and... - Do Yoon?

1644
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:56,798
- Six and... - Do Yoon?

1645
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:57,929
Something's off.

1646
01:04:59,168 --> 01:05:01,327
- And three and four... - Good.

1647
01:05:01,328 --> 01:05:03,568
- No, wait. - Do Yoon, hold on.

1648
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:06,638
- Do Yoon, wait. - Six and...

1649
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:08,008
- Do Yoon? - Do Yoon?

1650
01:05:08,009 --> 01:05:09,369
How am I supposed to jump to that?

1651
01:05:09,938 --> 01:05:11,877
- Do Yoon? - Hold on.

1652
01:05:11,878 --> 01:05:13,678
(We can hear the frustration of TEAM BEAT.)

1653
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:15,618
How can I jump when the rope is wiggling around?

1654
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:16,778
Move your body as well.

1655
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:19,489
- Yes, like that. - Because you were doing this...

1656
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:24,819
You must move your body too.

1657
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:26,658
- Right. - Yes, like that.

1658
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:27,958
(Like this?)

1659
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:30,898
Move your body like so.

1660
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:32,497
Something's not right.

1661
01:05:32,498 --> 01:05:33,897
(Something's off.)

1662
01:05:33,898 --> 01:05:34,898
The rope is going like this.

1663
01:05:34,899 --> 01:05:36,469
(The rope is wobbly.)

1664
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:38,469
Here. Just look.

1665
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:43,009
It's like this. Move your body like so.

1666
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,208
I mean...

1667
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:46,329
(Maybe I should just do it.)

1668
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:47,707
- Move your body. - That's right.

1669
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:48,719
- Good. - Got it.

1670
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,577
- Let me try. - Yes, do so.

1671
01:05:51,578 --> 01:05:53,017
(The tallest player, Jin Ziming, at 194cm joins the game.)

1672
01:05:53,018 --> 01:05:56,019
(Switching players from Nam Do Yoon to Jin Ziming)

1673
01:05:56,219 --> 01:05:58,088
Okay, let's practice.

1674
01:05:58,089 --> 01:05:59,489
(TEAM BEAT's second practice round)

1675
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:02,099
Jin Ziming, can you...

1676
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:06,429
Wait. Jin Ziming, you must pull the rope.

1677
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:07,668
Okay.

1678
01:06:07,669 --> 01:06:09,629
- This is good. - This isn't okay. Pull the rope.

1679
01:06:10,038 --> 01:06:13,108
(He says "Okay" to everything.)

1680
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:14,589
- You didn't understand me. - "Okay."

1681
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:15,777
- You didn't understand me. - "Okay."

1682
01:06:15,778 --> 01:06:16,985
(The language barrier caused confusion.)

1683
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:18,278
Okay, keep it tight.

1684
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:22,648
Keep it tight. That's it.

1685
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:24,648
(Will TEAM BEAT be able to jump enough times?)

1686
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:25,747
Keep it tight.

1687
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,689
(TEAM BEAT plays for real.)

1688
01:06:29,818 --> 01:06:32,089
(They turn the rope better thanks to all the practice.)

1689
01:06:32,988 --> 01:06:35,099
One, two, three.

1690
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:41,327
(TEAM BEAT jumps into the game at lightning speed.)

1691
01:06:41,328 --> 01:06:43,038
- Three, four. - They're so fast.

1692
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,469
Two, three, four.

1693
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:50,238
(His legs get caught.)

1694
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:55,448
Five. His legs got caught.

1695
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:58,248
- Congratulations! - No way.

1696
01:06:59,318 --> 01:07:00,848
(I had a bad feeling about this.)

1697
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:03,588
- Game over. - TEAM BEAT lost.

1698
01:07:03,589 --> 01:07:05,388
TEAM BEAT lost.

1699
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:06,457
(TEAM BEAT jumped the rope 0 times.)

1700
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:09,599
TEAM GROOVE wins five points.

1701
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,268
(Current score)

1702
01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:17,367
(Things are heating up on the Universe League Holiday.)

1703
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:20,667
How is it, guys? Are you enjoying the Universe Holiday?

1704
01:07:20,668 --> 01:07:22,608
- Yes! - Yes!

1705
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:24,108
(They're enjoying the holiday special.)

1706
01:07:24,109 --> 01:07:25,309
It's a holiday!

1707
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:28,878
It's hot in here, thanks to your burning passion.

1708
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:33,617
However, the track meet only has one event left.

1709
01:07:33,618 --> 01:07:35,359
- No! - No way.

1710
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:37,589
- This is crazy. - Already?

1711
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:40,458
What do you think is the highlight of a track meet?

1712
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:42,599
Is it A, a relay?

1713
01:07:42,899 --> 01:07:44,828
Or B, Cha Woong Ki?

1714
01:07:45,498 --> 01:07:47,028
- B. - B.

1715
01:07:47,469 --> 01:07:49,038
(My babies, I expected no less.)

1716
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:51,398
- A. - It's A.

1717
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:55,139
Unfortunately, TEAM GROOVE won't be competing in the relay.

1718
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:59,208
(TEAM GROOVE won't be competing in the relay?)

1719
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:02,448
We'll enjoy the game between TEAM BEAT and TEAM RHYTHM.

1720
01:08:02,549 --> 01:08:04,519
Woong Ki should never be given authority again.

1721
01:08:05,189 --> 01:08:06,719
- He's a tyrant. - I know.

1722
01:08:06,948 --> 01:08:07,948
This is tyranny.

1723
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,987
Since it's the last game,

1724
01:08:09,988 --> 01:08:13,828
the winning team will win a whopping ten points.

1725
01:08:14,059 --> 01:08:15,428
(10 points?)

1726
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:16,958
- Ten. - Ten?

1727
01:08:17,799 --> 01:08:18,868
We need to win this.

1728
01:08:19,168 --> 01:08:22,068
(Current score)

1729
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:24,189
That means there's a chance to come from behind.

1730
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,008
We'll widen the gap even more.

1731
01:08:26,009 --> 01:08:28,009
We must win this no matter what.

1732
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:29,478
We'll win the competition by winning this event.

1733
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:30,479
Exactly.

1734
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:32,719
- We must win this. - If we win this, it'll be over.

1735
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:33,979
Got it, Yul?

1736
01:08:34,549 --> 01:08:35,578
- Yes. - Good.

1737
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:39,719
We'll win this event and come out on top.

1738
01:08:40,318 --> 01:08:41,649
Are you ready to run?

1739
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:43,458
- Yes! - Yes!

1740
01:08:44,059 --> 01:08:47,889
The runners for TEAM RHYTHM are JL,

1741
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,359
Li Zhinuo, Kim Dong Yun,

1742
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:52,828
and Zen Zen.

1743
01:08:53,799 --> 01:08:55,198
Bring it on!

1744
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:56,898
Kim Zen Zen, you...

1745
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,468
(Teasing)

1746
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:01,068
I, Steven, will also compete.

1747
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,978
- Steven! - Go, Steven.

1748
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:06,308
(Steven, I believe in you!)

1749
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,009
(Put your faith in me.)

1750
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,608
We can definitely beat TEAM RHYTHM.

1751
01:09:10,979 --> 01:09:12,089
- Right? - Yes.

1752
01:09:13,488 --> 01:09:15,488
TEAM GROOVE's runners are Koo Han Seo,

1753
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:17,689
Bae Jae Ho,

1754
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:19,859
Kenta,

1755
01:09:20,658 --> 01:09:22,998
Kwon Hee Jun, and Kim Joo Hyoung.

1756
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,298
(TEAM GROOVE, secure 1st place!)

1757
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:28,099
Running for TEAM BEAT are Nam Do Yoon,

1758
01:09:29,568 --> 01:09:30,568
Kairi,

1759
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:34,038
Yuito, Kim Hyo Tae,

1760
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:36,839
and An Yul who failed at jumping with zero jumps.

1761
01:09:37,278 --> 01:09:38,848
(Embarrassed)

1762
01:09:38,849 --> 01:09:40,048
You did well.

1763
01:09:40,049 --> 01:09:41,979
The legend of zero jumps.

1764
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:44,979
An Yul? Okay, that's good.

1765
01:09:45,318 --> 01:09:46,987
We won, guys. An Yul is running for them.

1766
01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:48,149
- We won. - He's the legend.

1767
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:50,588
If your name was called, please step out...

1768
01:09:50,589 --> 01:09:52,827
- and get ready. - Win ten points for TEAM RHYTHM.

1769
01:09:52,828 --> 01:09:53,858
(The runners step out while being cheered on.)

1770
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:55,128
- Look at that. - Go, guys!

1771
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:56,229
You've got this.

1772
01:09:59,068 --> 01:10:00,198
- Let's go! - Go, team.

1773
01:10:00,628 --> 01:10:02,139
(The legend with 0 jumps is timid.)

1774
01:10:02,339 --> 01:10:03,899
- Get ready. - Hit me hard on the back.

1775
01:10:04,538 --> 01:10:05,737
(Smacking)

1776
01:10:05,738 --> 01:10:07,469
(Fully recharged)

1777
01:10:07,868 --> 01:10:10,228
(The fast runners of each team are gathered for the relay.)

1778
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:13,009
Since this is the last event that's worth ten points,

1779
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:15,447
we should hear how determined they are.

1780
01:10:15,448 --> 01:10:16,448
Of course.

1781
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:17,918
Steven of TEAM RHYTHM.

1782
01:10:18,578 --> 01:10:20,448
Show us your determination.

1783
01:10:21,349 --> 01:10:25,328
Right. We'll win first place, which only makes sense,

1784
01:10:25,828 --> 01:10:27,229
and take the ten points.

1785
01:10:29,028 --> 01:10:30,898
(Mac screeches.)

1786
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:31,899
(Intimidating others with his loud voice)

1787
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:32,899
RHYTHM.

1788
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:36,799
We'll continue our winning streak and come out as champions.

1789
01:10:37,068 --> 01:10:38,538
- Nicely said. - Yes!

1790
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:40,367
Get them, Bae-Ken-Kim-Kwon-Koo.

1791
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:41,808
- Bae-Ken-Kim-Kwon-Koo. - Bae!

1792
01:10:41,809 --> 01:10:45,309
We need to win at least this for TEAM BEAT to save face.

1793
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:48,077
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1794
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,078
We've got this.

1795
01:10:49,179 --> 01:10:50,419
He always lifts up our spirits.

1796
01:10:51,078 --> 01:10:52,118
Attention!

1797
01:10:52,889 --> 01:10:56,518
(1st runner for TEAM RHYTHM, Steven)

1798
01:10:56,519 --> 01:11:01,188
(1st runner for TEAM GROOVE, Bae Jae Ho)

1799
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:04,728
(1st runner for TEAM BEAT, Nam Do Yoon)

1800
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:06,968
(It's just the 3 of them, but they cheer hard.)

1801
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:09,197
Guys, please remember that safety always comes first.

1802
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:11,469
Do Yoon, stay safe, but then aim to win.

1803
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:12,668
I'll aim to win...

1804
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:14,067
and watch myself when needed.

1805
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:15,338
(Winning comes 1st. Safety, 2nd.)

1806
01:11:15,339 --> 01:11:17,939
- Jae Ho, you shouldn't lose. - Don't you dare lose.

1807
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:19,948
Steven!

1808
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,918
(Universe League track meet: The last event, the relay)

1809
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:28,287
(Who will win the relay event?)

1810
01:11:28,288 --> 01:11:29,958
(Tense)

1811
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:31,219
Ready.

1812
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:33,859
Ready.

1813
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:36,298
(Go!)

1814
01:11:36,299 --> 01:11:37,429
Let's go!

1815
01:11:39,998 --> 01:11:44,237
(Do Yoon takes the lead early on.)

1816
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:46,238
- Go, Do Yoon! - Nam Do Yoon!

1817
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:48,508
(Looking good, Do Yoon.)

1818
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:51,609
- Bae! - Go, Bae!

1819
01:11:53,278 --> 01:11:55,917
(Jae Ho and Steven overtook Do Yoon by securing the inside course.)

1820
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:57,048
- Okay! - Yes!

1821
01:11:57,049 --> 01:12:00,118
- Okay, Bae Jae Ho! - Bae Jae Ho, you're so good!

1822
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,617
(You're doing great!)

1823
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,417
(Beware of Pterodactyl Mac)

1824
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:05,457
(Run!)

1825
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,128
Nam Do Yoon!

1826
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,598
(Steven and Do Yoon chase Jae Ho fiercely.)

1827
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:14,599
(An all-out sprint to take the lead)

1828
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,269
(Clenching his teeth)

1829
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:19,309
(The second runner waits for the baton.)

1830
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:26,378
(TEAM GROOVE passes the baton first.)

1831
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:29,117
(Oh, my goodness)

1832
01:12:29,118 --> 01:12:30,918
- No! - No!

1833
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:33,488
(What's going on?)

1834
01:12:36,389 --> 01:12:39,389
(Kenta fell as soon as he was handed the baton.)

1835
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:46,268
(But Kenta gets up immediately and runs.)

1836
01:12:46,269 --> 01:12:48,429
- Kenta! - Kenta!

1837
01:12:49,868 --> 01:12:54,668
(While Kenta fell, Yuito overtook him.)

1838
01:12:55,778 --> 01:12:57,238
(Oh, my.)

1839
01:12:57,839 --> 01:13:01,348
(JL is chasing right behind him.)

1840
01:13:01,349 --> 01:13:02,747
(TEAM RHYTHM, run!)

1841
01:13:02,748 --> 01:13:03,748
JL!

1842
01:13:04,578 --> 01:13:07,948
(Currently, 1st: TEAM BEAT, 2nd: TEAM RHYTHM, 3rd: TEAM GROOVE)

1843
01:13:08,958 --> 01:13:11,218
- Wait. - Run.

1844
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:12,428
(Hurry up.)

1845
01:13:12,429 --> 01:13:13,458
(No!)

1846
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,398
(Oh, my gosh!)

1847
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:17,839
(When the gap was gradually closing)

1848
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:23,099
(JL fell down as he couldn't keep up with his own speed.)

1849
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:30,578
(JL gets up immediately and runs again.)

1850
01:13:30,878 --> 01:13:31,878
It's okay!

1851
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:33,548
- JL! - JL!

1852
01:13:33,549 --> 01:13:36,378
(JL, you're amazing!)

1853
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,578
Oh, my.

1854
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:41,817
(Meanwhile, Kenta lost his baton after colliding with JL.)

1855
01:13:41,818 --> 01:13:43,719
Oh, no!

1856
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:47,389
(Oh, no. Kenta!)

1857
01:13:47,859 --> 01:13:48,928
- Oh, no! - No.

1858
01:13:48,929 --> 01:13:50,259
(Devastated)

1859
01:13:51,759 --> 01:13:52,828
Yul!

1860
01:13:52,969 --> 01:13:54,228
(Handing off the baton to Yul quickly)

1861
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:55,939
- Yul! - Run!

1862
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:58,939
(Running as fast as he can to secure 1st place)

1863
01:14:00,509 --> 01:14:03,277
(2nd runner hands the baton to the 3rd runner)

1864
01:14:03,278 --> 01:14:06,248
(TEAM RHYTHM and TEAM GROOVE run rapidly as well.)

1865
01:14:06,948 --> 01:14:09,518
(The gap with 1st place widened significantly.)

1866
01:14:09,519 --> 01:14:12,148
(He seems relaxed unlike when he was jumping rope.)

1867
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:14,917
(Are we finishing as 1st?)

1868
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:17,118
- An Yul! - An Yul!

1869
01:14:18,189 --> 01:14:20,388
(Zen Zen is here.)

1870
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:21,788
(Screaming)

1871
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:25,399
(Zen Zen chases while shouting.)

1872
01:14:26,868 --> 01:14:28,098
Kim Zen Zen!

1873
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:29,139
(Screaming)

1874
01:14:29,868 --> 01:14:30,868
My goodness!

1875
01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:33,469
(Zen Zen is chasing An Yul fiercely.)

1876
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,078
(TEAM BEAT's 4th runner starts running.)

1877
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,578
(TEAM RHYTHM hands the baton shortly after.)

1878
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:44,978
(Chasing after TEAM BEAT)

1879
01:14:44,979 --> 01:14:47,918
(TEAM GROOVE also runs to chase them.)

1880
01:14:48,389 --> 01:14:50,157
(Kim Hyo Tae is still securing his lead.)

1881
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:51,218
Kim Hyo Tae!

1882
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:54,559
(Kim Dong Yun is chasing right behind him like crazy.)

1883
01:14:54,759 --> 01:14:57,259
- Nice! He's fast! - TEAM RHYTHM.

1884
01:14:57,828 --> 01:15:00,197
They're close to the final runner!

1885
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:02,968
- Hyo Tae! - Hyo Tae!

1886
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:05,367
- Kairi! - Kairi!

1887
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:06,438
Li Zhinuo!

1888
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:08,237
(Now, the result depends on the final runner.)

1889
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:09,277
Koo Han Seo!

1890
01:15:09,278 --> 01:15:11,118
(Now, the result depends on the final runner.)

1891
01:15:12,948 --> 01:15:16,317
(The final runners are sprinting.)

1892
01:15:16,318 --> 01:15:18,848
(Li Zhinuo is chasing with great speed.)

1893
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:21,348
Li Zhinuo, let's go!

1894
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:23,458
- Li Zhinuo! - Li Zhinuo!

1895
01:15:24,618 --> 01:15:26,428
(The 3rd runner, Koo Han Seo, is fighting a lonely battle.)

1896
01:15:26,429 --> 01:15:28,759
- Han Seo! - Let's go!

1897
01:15:29,429 --> 01:15:31,598
(Kairi turns on his booster mode.)

1898
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:32,969
Kairi!

1899
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:39,068
(1st: TEAM BEAT)

1900
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:40,708
(2nd: TEAM RHYTHM)

1901
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,609
(3rd: TEAM GROOVE)

1902
01:15:44,509 --> 01:15:48,348
(TEAM BEAT wins 10 points.)

1903
01:15:48,349 --> 01:15:49,349
(My babies are the best.)

1904
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:50,418
RHYTHM. No.

1905
01:15:50,878 --> 01:15:52,348
(Well done, TEAM BEAT.)

1906
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:53,947
Good.

1907
01:15:53,948 --> 01:15:55,117
(Thanks for your efforts.)

1908
01:15:55,118 --> 01:15:56,558
- We don't need to... - We don't.

1909
01:15:56,559 --> 01:15:58,388
You did well.

1910
01:15:58,389 --> 01:16:00,157
(We did well too.)

1911
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:01,228
Well done.

1912
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:02,229
(Thumbs-up)

1913
01:16:02,328 --> 01:16:03,359
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1914
01:16:04,429 --> 01:16:06,627
- Well done! - It's a bummer.

1915
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:07,828
We were close. We did well.

1916
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:09,698
It's okay.

1917
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:10,768
(Everyone competed amazingly in the final match.)

1918
01:16:10,769 --> 01:16:12,339
- It was fun. - It's okay.

1919
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:15,678
TEAM BEAT won 10 points!

1920
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:16,738
Congratulations!

1921
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:22,678
(Current score)

1922
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:25,278
TEAM BEAT, please come on out.

1923
01:16:25,578 --> 01:16:26,888
Please come on out.

1924
01:16:26,889 --> 01:16:28,218
(TEAM BEAT is the final winner of the Universe Holiday track meet.)

1925
01:16:28,219 --> 01:16:31,059
- Congratulations! - I envy you.

1926
01:16:31,389 --> 01:16:32,958
Enjoy a lot of...

1927
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:35,528
delicious food with your team!

1928
01:16:36,698 --> 01:16:39,768
(Thanks to Universe League Holiday)

1929
01:16:39,769 --> 01:16:43,167
(Universe League)

1930
01:16:43,168 --> 01:16:48,339
(After the joyful track meet, they gathered for the talent show.)

1931
01:16:48,939 --> 01:16:50,537
Hello!

1932
01:16:50,538 --> 01:16:52,208
(Surprise appearance)

1933
01:16:53,378 --> 01:16:56,118
- Kim Dong Yun! - Park Ju Won!

1934
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:57,849
Nam Do Yoon!

1935
01:16:58,149 --> 01:17:00,349
(They're cute.)

1936
01:17:00,589 --> 01:17:03,787
- Welcome to the Universe Holiday! - Holiday!

1937
01:17:03,788 --> 01:17:05,117
(Excited)

1938
01:17:05,118 --> 01:17:06,589
It's Baby Tiger!

1939
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,957
I'll be the host of Part Two, the talent show.

1940
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,698
I'm Kim Dong Yun of TEAM RHYTHM, the Maltese that doesn't hold back.

1941
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:14,599
I'm Park Ju Won of TEAM GROOVE, the Baby Tiger.

1942
01:17:14,828 --> 01:17:18,167
I'm Nam Do Yoon of TEAM BEAT.

1943
01:17:18,168 --> 01:17:21,639
(They're cute.)

1944
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:24,679
This talent show is unrelated to the teams.

1945
01:17:25,109 --> 01:17:27,078
They're new units formed by members...

1946
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:29,278
who wanted to come together.

1947
01:17:30,378 --> 01:17:33,149
To the unit that wins the talent show,

1948
01:17:33,589 --> 01:17:34,988
there's a special prize.

1949
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:37,958
- You're curious, right? - Yes!

1950
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:39,288
It's...

1951
01:17:39,589 --> 01:17:41,429
a clothing exchange voucher.

1952
01:17:42,089 --> 01:17:44,358
(Yes!)

1953
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:46,697
- Clothes? Garment? - Yes. Garment.

1954
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:49,469
How are we going to choose the first-place team?

1955
01:17:50,368 --> 01:17:53,309
Players will vote manually.

1956
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:54,939
Oh, a vote.

1957
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,109
Are you confident about winning?

1958
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:02,678
(Of course!)

1959
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:05,048
Now, let's officially...

1960
01:18:05,049 --> 01:18:07,118
- start the talent show. - Let's go!

1961
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:10,019
- Are you ready? - Are you ready?

1962
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,658
For the first stage of Universe Holiday,

1963
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:20,269
a unit with a unique presence is getting ready.

1964
01:18:20,698 --> 01:18:22,128
Please come to the stage!

1965
01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:23,537
(Song number: 49665, "Love Sick")

1966
01:18:23,538 --> 01:18:25,339
(Girls, gather around. We have arrived.)

1967
01:18:25,908 --> 01:18:29,068
The men who fell in love this winter are coming.

1968
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:31,509
Living and dying for love.

1969
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:33,447
- L. - D.

1970
01:18:33,448 --> 01:18:34,778
- L. - M.

1971
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:36,229
- We're LDLM. - We're LDLM.

1972
01:18:37,818 --> 01:18:40,589
(I can only give love to you.)

1973
01:18:40,889 --> 01:18:42,788
(How do I look?)

1974
01:18:43,089 --> 01:18:44,117
(Speechless)

1975
01:18:44,118 --> 01:18:45,828
Give me a heart!

1976
01:18:46,028 --> 01:18:48,127
Everyone, have you been in love?

1977
01:18:48,128 --> 01:18:49,798
(Crazy Gi Joong, who's crazy in love, is here.)

1978
01:18:49,799 --> 01:18:51,359
Gi Joong, I love you!

1979
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:52,698
Is that so?

1980
01:18:53,099 --> 01:18:54,828
Everyone here...

1981
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:57,599
will be sick in love with us.

1982
01:18:58,868 --> 01:19:00,148
(I don't know what love is yet.)

1983
01:19:00,339 --> 01:19:02,538
- You're cool! - Sing while thinking of me!

1984
01:19:02,778 --> 01:19:05,407
- Keum Jin Ho, let's get married! - Gi Joong, I love you.

1985

(Keum Jin Ho, Kim Joo Hyoung)

1988
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:12,718
Isn't there supposed to be someone who does ballet?

1989
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,399
(From the intro, it brings back memories.)

1990
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:15,917
(How will the stage of the four men, who invite a confession, be?)

1991
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:18,157
- Look at their hands. - They're sorrowful.

1992
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:20,688
(How will the stage of the four men, who invite a confession, be?)

1993
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:21,758
(Crazy Gi Joong, Precious Jin Ho, )

1994
01:19:21,759 --> 01:19:23,359
(Sorrowful Joo Hyoung, Powerful Hee Jun)

1995
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:30,038
From the start?

1996
01:19:32,469 --> 01:19:34,938
(Sorrowful Joo Hyoung's nostalgic thigh brushing)

1997
01:19:34,939 --> 01:19:36,037
(I can't watch this.)

1998
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:37,109
No.

1999
01:19:56,799 --> 01:19:57,858
It's coming!

2000
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:58,929
(They're coming!)

2001
01:20:01,929 --> 01:20:02,969
It's coming!

2002
01:20:04,969 --> 01:20:06,838
(Firing hearts)

2003
01:20:06,839 --> 01:20:09,538
(The audience is stirred by the sexy choreography.)

2004
01:20:18,649 --> 01:20:19,729
My goodness, what was that?

2005
01:20:21,748 --> 01:20:25,157
(Precious Jin Ho embodies the piano melody through gestures.)

2006
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:28,859
(Mesmerized by Jin Ho)

2007
01:20:30,128 --> 01:20:32,769
- I love you! - Oh, my goodness.

2008
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:34,599
(I can't watch this.)

2009
01:20:35,599 --> 01:20:37,959
(Without minding the laughter, they display rich emotions.)

2010
01:20:38,738 --> 01:20:39,809
What's that?

2011
01:20:41,969 --> 01:20:44,008
(The 2nd verse is on its way.)

2012
01:20:44,009 --> 01:20:45,238
(Bridge skip)

2013
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:52,348
All of a sudden?

2014
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:55,149
(Why are they going that far?)

2015
01:20:55,549 --> 01:20:58,118
(Bursting into laughter)

2016
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:01,199
(Sorrowful Joo Hyoung successfully pulled off emotions and vocals.)

2017
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:04,698
(The continued love begging from the three men)

2018
01:21:06,868 --> 01:21:08,429
(Did you have to leave me?)

2019
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:16,479
(The desperate cry of the four men longing for love.)

2020
01:21:26,389 --> 01:21:30,259
(He's focused so much on his emotions that the lyrics are wrong.)

2021
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:40,799
(It's Gi Joong's part, but why are you more excited?)

2022
01:21:41,568 --> 01:21:45,099
(Four men's love confession made everyone immersed.)

2023
01:21:45,469 --> 01:21:48,737
(I'm suffering in tears)

2024
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:50,809
(Like this)

2025
01:21:51,309 --> 01:21:52,309
My goodness.

2026
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:54,907
(Sexy provocation)

2027
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:56,278
Oh, my goodness.

2028
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:57,577
My goodness.

2029
01:21:57,578 --> 01:21:59,918
- Yes! - This is love!

2030
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:01,318
I love you.

2031
01:22:01,719 --> 01:22:03,458
- I love you, everyone. - I love you.

2032
01:22:04,059 --> 01:22:07,429
Please give a round of applause to the four people who performed well.

2033
01:22:07,559 --> 01:22:08,689
- You're the best! - Yes!

2034
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,858
- Thanks for your efforts. - Thank you.

2035
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,898
- I love you. - Thanks for your efforts.

01:22:12,899 --> 01:22:14,598
- I love you! - I love you.

2037
01:22:14,599 --> 01:22:15,729
I love you.

2038
01:22:15,998 --> 01:22:17,238
(This is for my fans.)

2039
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:19,538
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

2040
01:22:19,868 --> 01:22:21,367
Our stage is over.

2041
01:22:21,368 --> 01:22:22,468
You're cool.

2042
01:22:22,469 --> 01:22:23,589
(I'm perfect until the end.)

2043
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,277
This is a new unit that you can never see...

2044
01:22:26,278 --> 01:22:29,008
unless it's the Universe League Holiday.

2045
01:22:29,009 --> 01:22:30,218
What is it?

2046
01:22:30,219 --> 01:22:32,048
Let's invite them to the stage.

2047
01:22:32,049 --> 01:22:33,987
(Song number: 35774, "All For You," From enemies to friends?)

2048
01:22:33,988 --> 01:22:35,018
Two, three!

2049
01:22:35,019 --> 01:22:36,287
- Hello! - Hello!

2050
01:22:36,288 --> 01:22:37,888
- I'm Cha Woong Ki. - I'm Zhang Shuaibo.

2051
01:22:37,889 --> 01:22:40,759
- We're Team Feel Special. - We're Team Feel Special.

2052
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:43,429
- Special! - I can't believe I'm seeing this.

2053
01:22:43,628 --> 01:22:46,098
I'm onstage with Zhang Shuaibo...

2054
01:22:46,099 --> 01:22:47,668
after more than a year.

2055
01:22:48,299 --> 01:22:49,798
- My gosh. - I think so.

2056
01:22:49,799 --> 01:22:52,268
Even while preparing for the stage together,

2057
01:22:52,269 --> 01:22:56,008
I think I felt a lot of new emotions.

2058
01:22:56,009 --> 01:22:57,509
From enemies to friends!

2059
01:22:58,809 --> 01:23:00,179
(Excited)

2060
01:23:02,509 --> 01:23:04,649
- Zhang Shuaibo! - Cha Woong Ki, you can do this!

2061
01:23:06,049 --> 01:23:12,189
("All For You" by Cha Woong Ki and Zhang Shuaibo)

2062
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:32,309
(Glancing)

2063
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,908
He's looking at the lyrics.

2064
01:23:35,809 --> 01:23:38,918
(10 minutes ago, he was making his own cheat notes.)

2065
01:23:47,059 --> 01:23:48,828
(His eyes are fixed.)

2066
01:23:49,328 --> 01:23:51,657
What's that?

2067
01:23:51,658 --> 01:23:53,168
(Laughing)

2068
01:23:55,368 --> 01:23:56,568
He's staring so obviously.

2069
01:23:58,568 --> 01:24:00,738
- He wrote the lyrics there. - You're cute!

2070
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,538
He's a genius.

2071
01:24:16,219 --> 01:24:17,759
(Looking at the next lyrics)

2072
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:23,759
(Glancing)

2073
01:24:25,498 --> 01:24:26,528
(Glancing again)

2074
01:24:53,429 --> 01:24:56,559
(I'll only look at you forever)

2075
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:16,178
(To be happy)

2076
01:25:16,179 --> 01:25:17,248
(Surprised)

2077
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:20,148
My goodness!

2078
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:21,988
(He's so good.)

2079
01:25:29,089 --> 01:25:30,859
(He's so good.)

2080
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,839
(I will become the one just for you)

2081
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:42,538
(You're the best.)

2082
01:25:49,618 --> 01:25:52,718
(Even if I were to be reborn)

2083
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:57,818
(I would only look at you forever)

2084
01:26:02,889 --> 01:26:04,898
- They're gorgeous. - I love you!

2085
01:26:04,899 --> 01:26:05,929
Good!

2086
01:26:08,528 --> 01:26:09,899
The next unit is...

2087
01:26:10,068 --> 01:26:13,609
made up of handsome representatives from various countries.

2088
01:26:13,839 --> 01:26:15,938
- My goodness. - Please hurry to the stage.

2089
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:18,009
(A self-claimed handsome man is here.)

2090
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:20,378
(Woong Ki are you going onstage again?)

2091
01:26:20,578 --> 01:26:22,609
Woong Ki, hurry and come here!

2092
01:26:23,519 --> 01:26:25,148
(Woong Ki, it's my turn.)

2093
01:26:25,149 --> 01:26:26,218
Woong Ki.

2094
01:26:26,219 --> 01:26:27,219
(It wasn't my turn?)

2095
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,987
- Marshmallows. - You're handsome.

2096
01:26:30,988 --> 01:26:32,019
You all stand out.

2097
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:34,428
(Song number: 85595, "White")

2098
01:26:34,429 --> 01:26:35,558
(I welcome you all to the handsome feast.)

2099
01:26:35,559 --> 01:26:36,928
It's already so interesting.

2100
01:26:36,929 --> 01:26:38,228
They're really good-looking.

2101
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:39,558
(A handsome person next to a handsome person)

2102
01:26:39,559 --> 01:26:40,628
Steven is the best.

2103
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:42,628
How is his face so small?

2104
01:26:42,969 --> 01:26:45,939
Hello, we own a handsome restaurant at Universe League.

2105
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:48,338
We're a three-star Michelin restaurant. I'm Seo Jeong Woo.

2106
01:26:48,339 --> 01:26:50,577
- I'm Chih En. - I'm Steven.

2107
01:26:50,578 --> 01:26:51,639
I'm Kenta.

2108

They're good-looking.

2112
01:26:58,119 --> 01:26:59,148
(I agree that they're a restaurant with handsome faces.)

2113
01:26:59,149 --> 01:27:02,849
- We'll sing "White" by Fin.K.L, - Oh, my goodness.

2114
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:06,627
- Oh, my. - but the remake by Paul Kim.

2115
01:27:06,628 --> 01:27:07,658
- I see. - I see.

2116
01:27:07,929 --> 01:27:09,858
- I want to see it! - Let's see their performance.

2117
01:27:09,859 --> 01:27:11,599
What if they melt our hearts?

2118
01:27:12,929 --> 01:27:16,299
("White" by Seo Jeong Woo, Chih En, Steven, Kenta)

2119
01:27:18,738 --> 01:27:20,537
- Oh, my goodness! - Yes!

2120
01:27:20,538 --> 01:27:22,618

(Australian Fox Steven holding a rose)

2122
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:26,278
Baby, give me that!

2123
01:27:27,649 --> 01:27:28,848
My goodness.

2124
01:27:28,849 --> 01:27:31,449
(Seo Jeong Woo, who will give you a warm hug like the spring sun)

2125
01:27:32,378 --> 01:27:34,018
- Yes! - What's that?

2126
01:27:34,019 --> 01:27:36,165
(Kenta, our 1st love from Japan who came with the 1st snow)

2127
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:37,259
It's snowing.

2128
01:28:04,778 --> 01:28:06,618
Seo Jeong Woo is cute.

2129
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:19,428
What's going on?

2130
01:28:19,429 --> 01:28:21,868
(Giving a big reaction)

2131

(About you)

2135
01:29:00,939 --> 01:29:03,378

01:44:04,009 --> 01:44:05,108
Please come onto the stage.

2318
01:44:05,109 --> 01:44:06,109
(Song number: 89168, "Jjiniya")

2319
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:08,178
(A trot prince from Thailand?)

2320
01:44:08,179 --> 01:44:09,309
- Goodness. - Hi.

2321
01:44:10,009 --> 01:44:12,317
- Hi. - Hi.

2322
01:44:12,318 --> 01:44:14,888
- Zen Zen... - Zen Zen is out of this world.

2323
01:44:14,889 --> 01:44:16,747
But it looks good on him.

2324
01:44:16,748 --> 01:44:18,535
(The Thailand Prince pulls off the Korean costume well.)

2325
01:44:18,559 --> 01:44:19,889
Please introduce yourselves.

2326
01:44:20,288 --> 01:44:23,359
- We're really cute... - Really cute...

2327
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:25,498
- and really lovely. - and really lovely.

2328
01:44:25,729 --> 01:44:26,827
- Jjin. - Jjin.

2329
01:44:26,828 --> 01:44:28,028
- Jjin. - Jjin.

2330
01:44:28,198 --> 01:44:31,168
- We're Team "Jjiniya." - We're Team "Jjiniya."

2331
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:33,639
(Let's go, trot boys!)

2332
01:44:35,708 --> 01:44:37,139
(We're ready.)

2333
01:44:38,679 --> 01:44:39,707
Zen Zen.

2334
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:41,388
(Zen Zen's vibe is unique from the start.)

2335
01:44:43,009 --> 01:44:44,118
(Dancing)

2336
01:44:44,649 --> 01:44:45,778
(It's fun.)

2337
01:44:46,219 --> 01:44:47,349
(Dancing)

2338
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:52,019
(Equipped with Korean swag)

2339
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:08,707
(Peekaboo from Zen Zen)

2340
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:09,738
Zen Zen.

2341
01:45:16,049 --> 01:45:17,309
Why are they this good?

2342
01:45:17,778 --> 01:45:19,179
They're super good.

2343
01:45:21,549 --> 01:45:24,019
(Unable to wake up from the Thailand Prince's vibe)

2344
01:45:28,229 --> 01:45:30,128
(Look closely. This is Thai trot.)

2345
01:45:30,929 --> 01:45:33,158
- Zen Zen! - Zen Zen!

2346
01:45:35,668 --> 01:45:37,668
That's incredible.

2347
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:39,698
My goodness.

2348
01:45:43,139 --> 01:45:44,639
(The bending by the Thai Prince)

2349
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:46,638
How does he know how to do that?

2350
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:48,109
(I taught him.)

2351
01:45:49,748 --> 01:45:51,478
(Dancing)

2352
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:52,649
They're amazing.

2353
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:55,918
(Being drawn to MC Dong Yun's charms)

2354
01:46:06,198 --> 01:46:07,359
"Jjiniya!"

2355
01:46:09,128 --> 01:46:11,339
(Nobody can hold back from Korean swagger.)

2356
01:46:13,498 --> 01:46:15,037
(The real original trot prince has appeared.)

2357
01:46:15,038 --> 01:46:16,969
Together!

2358
01:46:18,509 --> 01:46:21,149
(He is indeed the extremely introverted Park Han.)

2359
01:46:22,908 --> 01:46:24,917
(Walking like a woodpecker)

2360
01:46:24,918 --> 01:46:26,918
(Chih En is confused.)

2361
01:46:27,448 --> 01:46:28,948
(Another woodpecker performance)

2362
01:46:29,818 --> 01:46:30,818
Clap!

2363
01:46:30,819 --> 01:46:32,218
(How exciting!)

2364
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:33,318
Clap!

2365
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:36,288
(The global participants become one with trot.)

2366
01:46:36,729 --> 01:46:37,729
Zen Zen!

2367
01:46:40,128 --> 01:46:41,527
(This is what I'm talking about!)

2368
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:42,528
Unit 502!

2369
01:46:43,068 --> 01:46:45,268
(The original trot prince's dance moves are different.)

2370
01:46:53,378 --> 01:46:55,109
(This is a real flower, Touched)

2371
01:46:58,179 --> 01:46:59,179
(You)

2372
01:46:59,549 --> 01:47:00,789
I expected no less from An Yul.

2373
01:47:07,389 --> 01:47:11,559
(The charm of trot knows no border.)

2374
01:47:11,859 --> 01:47:13,528
(Daisuke loves trot.)

2375
01:47:16,668 --> 01:47:17,899
(Come here.)

2376
01:47:18,498 --> 01:47:20,198
(Pulse)

2377
01:47:24,439 --> 01:47:25,538
Together!

2378
01:47:26,278 --> 01:47:29,009
(Jjin)

2379
01:47:29,349 --> 01:47:31,377
It's for real

2380
01:47:31,378 --> 01:47:32,549
(I'm Zen.)

2381
01:47:36,918 --> 01:47:39,219
(For the fans)

2382
01:47:41,759 --> 01:47:44,559
(Settling on Gi Joong's head)

2383
01:47:46,929 --> 01:47:49,168
(I will fall in love)

2384
01:47:49,799 --> 01:47:50,968
(Take Zen's hat too!)

2385
01:47:50,969 --> 01:47:53,968
(For real)

2386
01:47:53,969 --> 01:47:55,568
(For real)

2387
01:47:56,068 --> 01:48:01,408
(I will fall in love)

2388
01:48:02,979 --> 01:48:05,118
(Bring up the mood!)

2389
01:48:05,818 --> 01:48:07,417
(Applauding nonstop)

2390
01:48:07,418 --> 01:48:08,488
Amazing!

2391
01:48:08,948 --> 01:48:11,059
- He's so cute! - I love you!

2392
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:13,718
I love you, Zen Zen.

2393
01:48:13,719 --> 01:48:15,039
(The next-generation trot prince)

2394
01:48:17,229 --> 01:48:18,498
I love you!

2395
01:48:19,059 --> 01:48:21,368
- For real, everyone. - That was hilarious.

2396
01:48:21,969 --> 01:48:23,197
Check Zen Zen's nationality.

2397
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:25,268
(Zen Zen's new charm filled everyone with amazement.)

2398
01:48:25,269 --> 01:48:26,868
They were incredible.

2399
01:48:27,139 --> 01:48:30,009
Let's vote to find out which team...

2400
01:48:30,109 --> 01:48:33,208
will get first place and win the clothing voucher.

2401
01:48:33,309 --> 01:48:36,278
- Can we not vote for our team? - No.

2402
01:48:36,849 --> 01:48:38,418
(Which team should I vote for?)

2403
01:48:38,878 --> 01:48:40,118
This was the most entertaining.

2404
01:48:40,649 --> 01:48:41,988
I want to vote for two teams.

2405
01:48:42,818 --> 01:48:45,389
- I want to vote for multiple teams. - I know, right?

2406
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:49,929
(Voting with deliberation)

2407
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:52,259
We have the result.

2408
01:48:52,799 --> 01:48:55,099
Universe Holiday's talent show.

2409
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:56,889
The unit in first place is...

2410
01:48:57,368 --> 01:48:58,399
"All For You!"

2411
01:48:59,269 --> 01:49:00,738
(Drumroll)

2412
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:04,938
(Each moment was a highlight of cuteness.)

2413
01:49:04,939 --> 01:49:09,109
("Candy" by Mattang)

2414
01:49:09,649 --> 01:49:14,948
(From start to end, it was a pleasure to the ears.)

2415
01:49:16,389 --> 01:49:20,617
(A vocal strength show by the main vocalist duo)

2416
01:49:20,618 --> 01:49:23,729
("The Little Prince" by Park Han and JL)

2417
01:49:24,229 --> 01:49:27,457
(Surprising the scene with their awesome stage presence)

2418
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:30,429
("Jjiniya" by the Youngests)

2419
01:49:31,538 --> 01:49:32,538
"Candy!"

2420
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:33,567
"Candy!"

2421
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,638
(Is it us?)

2422
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:35,639
Is it?

2423
01:49:35,939 --> 01:49:37,738
(Ju Won is being mean.)

2424
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:40,277
- No! - Which team is it?

2425
01:49:40,278 --> 01:49:41,448
(Laughing)

2426
01:49:41,809 --> 01:49:43,179
I'll announce the team for real.

2427
01:49:43,748 --> 01:49:44,748
The unit in first place is...

2428
01:49:44,749 --> 01:49:45,979
Drumroll.

2429
01:49:46,588 --> 01:49:49,116
"Jjiniya." Congratulations!

2430
01:49:49,117 --> 01:49:51,127
- "Jjiniya." Congratulations! - Really?

2431
01:49:51,128 --> 01:49:52,156
(We're in 1st place!)

2432
01:49:52,157 --> 01:49:53,728
For real.

2433
01:49:54,827 --> 01:49:55,827
Congratulations.

2434
01:49:55,928 --> 01:49:57,628
Good job, Yul!

2435
01:49:58,667 --> 01:49:59,927
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

2436
01:49:59,928 --> 01:50:01,967
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

2437
01:50:01,968 --> 01:50:03,374
(The Youngests beat all the others.)

2438
01:50:03,398 --> 01:50:05,767
(Congratulating)

2439
01:50:05,768 --> 01:50:07,577
Everyone. Did you have fun?

2440
01:50:07,678 --> 01:50:09,137
- Yes! - Yes!

2441
01:50:09,138 --> 01:50:10,437
Unfortunately, it's time...

2442
01:50:10,438 --> 01:50:12,576
- to return to our practice rooms. - No!

2443
01:50:12,577 --> 01:50:15,478
(Let's have more fun!)

2444
01:50:20,287 --> 01:50:22,388
(A few days later)

2445
01:50:25,157 --> 01:50:27,696
(TEAM GROOVE's director and players have gathered.)

2446
01:50:27,697 --> 01:50:31,327
There might be some who can't perform...

2447
01:50:32,197 --> 01:50:34,467
in this round. But it's not fixed yet.

2448
01:50:34,468 --> 01:50:37,138
Keep in mind the whole team might change.

2449
01:50:37,638 --> 01:50:38,737
- Okay? - Okay.

2450
01:50:42,737 --> 01:50:44,047
Jeong Woo. Do you know the first verse?

2451
01:50:44,048 --> 01:50:45,478
Yes, I do.

2452
01:50:45,808 --> 01:50:47,978
Try it. I am you

2453
01:50:48,518 --> 01:50:49,746
- The key. - I

2454
01:50:49,747 --> 01:50:51,588
I am you

2455
01:50:51,947 --> 01:50:53,267
Try it with your hand right here.

2456
01:50:53,718 --> 01:50:55,517
I am you

2457
01:50:55,518 --> 01:50:56,994
(The high notes made him lose confidence.)

2458
01:50:57,018 --> 01:50:58,557
I am you

2459
01:50:58,558 --> 01:51:01,058
No. The key is too high.

2460
01:51:01,157 --> 01:51:02,857
It's too high for you.

2461
01:51:03,968 --> 01:51:05,667
It's slightly high for me.

2462
01:51:07,438 --> 01:51:08,897
- Try your part, Hee Jun. - Okay.

2463
01:51:08,898 --> 01:51:10,237
(Next is Hee Jun's part.)

2464
01:51:10,607 --> 01:51:14,008
(Getting more anxious he might not be able to perform onstage)

2465
01:51:15,107 --> 01:51:17,307
My heart flutters when our eyes meet

2466
01:51:17,308 --> 01:51:19,848
I hope time stops right now

2467
01:51:20,207 --> 01:51:22,776
(Focused)

2468
01:51:22,777 --> 01:51:25,987
Share the vibe together, but it's all right

2469
01:51:26,888 --> 01:51:28,116
- Gi Joong. - Yes.

2470
01:51:28,117 --> 01:51:29,156
(The test continues.)

2471
01:51:29,157 --> 01:51:35,526
You and I fill the colors in time

2472
01:51:35,527 --> 01:51:38,968
(The players get shaken up by even the smallest mistake.)

2473
01:51:40,798 --> 01:51:42,298
- Ju Won. - Yes.

2474
01:51:43,338 --> 01:51:45,367
(The first test after joining TEAM GROOVE)

2475
01:51:46,638 --> 01:51:49,076
It's a relief I have you

2476
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:52,247
Start and go with all my might again

2477
01:51:52,447 --> 01:51:53,447
Okay.

2478
01:51:53,777 --> 01:51:55,048
- Thank you. - Right.

2479
01:51:57,077 --> 01:51:58,148
Do you practice...

2480
01:52:00,048 --> 01:52:01,057
breathing?

2481
01:52:01,058 --> 01:52:02,088
- Yes. - Yes.

2482
01:52:03,417 --> 01:52:04,787
But it doesn't feel like it.

2483
01:52:05,588 --> 01:52:07,157
Have you loosened up?

2484
01:52:07,928 --> 01:52:10,057
- No. - Because you won first place twice?

2485
01:52:10,058 --> 01:52:12,827
Have you loosened up from winning two small performances?

2486
01:52:14,737 --> 01:52:17,807
(Only a heavy silence remains from the harsh criticism.)

2487
01:52:17,808 --> 01:52:19,707
Singing is the most important in my team.

2488
01:52:20,338 --> 01:52:23,037
You must win this competition to debut.

2489
01:52:24,107 --> 01:52:25,678
With how things are right now,

2490
01:52:26,478 --> 01:52:29,317
you can't win. You can't at this rate.

2491
01:52:31,447 --> 01:52:33,617
What are you trying to prove through this challenge?

2492
01:52:34,718 --> 01:52:36,357
I'm going to change everything up.

2493
01:52:40,388 --> 01:52:41,457
Come down, Jeong Woo.

2494
01:52:43,827 --> 01:52:45,026
(The director's decision only to win)

2495
01:52:45,027 --> 01:52:47,066
You must be much more desperate...

2496
01:52:47,067 --> 01:52:48,138
