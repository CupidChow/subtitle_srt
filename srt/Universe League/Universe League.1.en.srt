1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,104
A world where the winner takes all.

2
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:09,804
(A world where the winner takes all)

3
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:11,914
But it is not sports.

4
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,144
It is Universe League.

5
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:20,214
(Universe League)

6
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:25,695
Forty-two players enter the
fierce battle for their debut.

7
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,375
RHYTHM.

8
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:40,234
GROOVE.

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:41,945
BEAT.

10
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,744
Three teams are competing
for the one and only Prism Cup.

11
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,114
Who will be winning the Prism Cup?

12
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,645
Winning the glory and the chance to debut.

13
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:01,494
A boy who dreamed of becoming an actor...

14
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:09,734
has a new dream of becoming an idol.

15
00:01:14,504 --> 00:01:16,405
I may have started late compared to others.

16
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,314
(Seo Jeong Woo)

17
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:24,185
But I will show you a
better me than yesterday.

18
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,594
My first audition in Korea.

19
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:44,805
And failure.

20
00:01:48,944 --> 00:01:49,944
But...

21
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:54,415
for the precious people
who have waited for me,

22
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:57,984
I will...

23
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,254
take up a new challenge again.

24
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:08,495
I will prove that not giving up is winning.

25
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,205
Before I came to Korea,

26
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:23,444
I worked part-time all
night long to fulfill my dream.

27
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:27,145
Though it was a tough life,

28
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:32,284
I endured it by imagining myself onstage.

29
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,425
Right now,

30
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:39,895
I am standing before that very dream.

31
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:45,235
My dream of debuting.
I will make it come true.

32
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,973
From a small stage back
home in the Philippines,

33
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,533
with dreams bigger than ever,

34
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:56,544
I made my way to Korea, the heart of K-pop.

35
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,244
Standing on that glittering stage.

36
00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,585
Just imagining it makes my heart race.

37
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,585
I'm ready to take on the world.

38
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:08,455
This is my destiny. And I'm going to shine.

39
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:16,694
Two auditions. One debut.

40
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:21,164
But I still have a lot to show.

41
00:03:22,504 --> 00:03:24,435
Cha Woong Ki, the guy who doesn't give up.

42
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,705
Universe League. I will make it mine.

43
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,644
I admire K-pop.

44
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:39,955
Daisuke, 14 years old, from Okinawa.

45
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:45,594
My exciting first challenge in K-pop.

46
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:53,264
But I will prove that my skills
are more mature than my age.

47
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,044
It doesn't matter who my opponent is.

48
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:14,954
Whichever team I am
in, I will lead it to victory.

49
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:19,894
Please look forward to me
shining the most onstage.

50
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:30,105
Afraid of the survival show?

51
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:33,375
Heck no.

52
00:04:34,805 --> 00:04:36,574
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

53
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:39,274
Watch me climb to the top of this game.

54
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,714
My time starts now.

55
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:45,785
I'm going all in.

56
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,984
The first step toward debut.

57
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:51,824
The first step toward debut.

58
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,495
It starts now.

59
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,035
It really starts now.

60
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,645
I've never stood onstage before.

61
00:05:02,764 --> 00:05:05,735
I will show myself, Park Han, to the world.

62
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,374
(A fierce battle of the boys)

63
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,444
I will start with a bang.

64
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:13,045
This is a survival show.
I'm not here to goof around.

65
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:16,344
I don’t care if the Universe League...

66
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:18,654
shortens my lifespan by years.

67
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:20,915
I’ve staked everything on this show.

68
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:27,953
- Great job! - You did an amazing job!

69
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:30,063
- It was meaningful!
- Be proud of yourself!

70
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,464
You did well!

71
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:35,264
(Universe League is really cruel.)

72
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:40,004
Boys' dream match, Universe League.

73
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:42,444
Are you ready?

74
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,714

debut as a global K-pop idol.

75

106
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,254

Here's the first player.

108
00:07:43,225 --> 00:07:46,935
(The player's introduction clip is played.)

109
00:07:47,694 --> 00:07:48,703
Come on.

110
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:51,475
(Who is the first player?)

111
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:53,935
Steven.

112
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,975
(Steven)

113
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,745

114
00:08:00,975 --> 00:08:04,245
(Entering confidently)

115
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,614
Yes, sir.

116
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,253
My eyes are my strong suit.

117
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,024
I will charm everyone with my eyes.

118
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,153
I'm ready.

119
00:08:12,154 --> 00:08:13,625
(Steven, Nickname: Australian Fox)

120
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,995
Nice.

121
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:20,394
Steven, please make your way to the bench.

122
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,034
(Steven sits at the player's seat.)

123
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,134
Okay, good.

124
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:28,805
We should meet our next player. Let's go.

125
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:32,644

127
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,414
Seo Jeong Woo.

128
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:40,883
(Seo Jeong Woo, Nickname: Spring Sunshine)

129
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:44,455
Hi. I'm Seo Jeong Woo, the Spring Sunshine.

130
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:48,865
Many have told me my
smile is bright and pretty,

131
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:50,195
hence the nickname.

132
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,095
(A sunshine-like smile
that will melt away the cold)

133
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:57,235
Yes, nice.

134
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:01,475
Gosh, he's really handsome.

135
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:05,114
(Shooting a heart)

136
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:06,475
(Winking as a bonus)

137
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,944
(Frozen as is)

138
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:11,913
You can put your arms down.

139
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:12,914
- Okay. - All right.

140
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,824
- Please head to the bench.
- Okay, thank you.

141
00:09:15,825 --> 00:09:17,225
Thank you for the heart.

142
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,325

143
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:24,595
(Feeling awkward)

144
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:27,634
Let's meet the next player.

145
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:31,304

146
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,104
Daisuke.

00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:36,403
(Daisuke, Nickname: Chocoball)

148
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:40,875
Hi. I'm Daisuke, 14 years old, from Japan.

149
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,914
I like dancing and singing.

150
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:48,085
The feisty boy, Daisuke, races.

151
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,985
I will do my best.

152
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:54,594
Cute.

153
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,793
(Who wants Daisuke's heart?)

154
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:56,825
(I found you!)

155
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:59,065
(Here.)

156
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,565
(Turning)

157
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:03,864
(Leaving coolly after shooting a heart)

158
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:05,804
Okay, please head to the bench.

159
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:07,304
He's adorable.

160
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:09,704
(Stiff)

161
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:12,115
I was quite nervous.

162
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,544
- Are you okay? - Yes.

163
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,914
Okay.

164
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:16,914
(Tense)

165
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,254
Here's the next player. Let's go.

166
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,253
JL.

167
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,753
(The next player appears.)

168
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:26,754
Come on.

169
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:28,494
(A cute charm, )

170
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:29,964
(along with chicness)

171
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:31,424
A chic guy. Nice.

172
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:35,835
JL? He controlled his expressions well...

173
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:38,375
and stood out the most.

174
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,605
Hi. I'm JL from the Philippines.

175
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,875
Even though I debuted
as an idol in the Philippines,

176
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:50,614
I'm really a huge fan of K-pop...

177
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,184
and survival shows specifically.

178
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:55,284
This is a chance that...

179
00:10:55,725 --> 00:10:57,955
we never know if it will come back or not.

180
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:01,054
It's really true. I'm here,
and I'm seeing all of these.

181
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:02,764
I'm in total bliss.

182
00:11:03,794 --> 00:11:05,564
(A ceremony of happiness)

183
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:06,835
(Startled)

184
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:08,614
Why are you being self-conscious?

185
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:12,604
Thank you.

186
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,605
(That's amazing.)

187
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:16,375
(As expected from the
world-class MC, Jay Park)

188
00:11:17,445 --> 00:11:19,044
- Hi. - Hi.

189
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:20,144
Hi.

190
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:21,783
(JL is seated.)

191
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,314
Let's meet the next player.

192
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,183
(The next global players appear.)

193
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,314
Sirin.

194
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:27,984
(Sirin, Nickname: Thai Ice Boy)

195
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:28,985
He's cool.

196
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:31,524
- Cool. - Yes, sir. Good job.

197
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,625
Zen Zen.

198
00:11:34,455 --> 00:11:35,465
(Catch my heart!)

199
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:36,664
(He got it.)

200
00:11:36,894 --> 00:11:38,835
- Eito. - Eito's cool.

201
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:41,903
Xie Yuxin.

202
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:44,605
He looks like Jaehyun from BOYNEXTDOOR.

203
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,334
Jin Ziming.

204
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:48,975
(The tallest with extraordinary
leg length appears.)

205
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:51,003
He's super tall.

206
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:52,144
(Tall)

207
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:54,374
His proportion is out of this world.

208
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,895
If only I could live with that height.

209
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:58,884
We've got players from all over the world.

210
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,384
Let's meet the next player.

211
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,253
- Who is it? - Who will it be?

212
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,524
- Who? - Who is it?

213
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,154
(Amazed)

214
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:10,394
(Who is the player that
made everyone cheer?)

215
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:11,893
Kenta.

216
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:13,793
(Kenta, Nickname: The
First Love from Japan)

217
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,705
I'm Toyota Kenta from Japan.

218
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:19,375
My nickname is The First Love from Japan.

219
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:22,605
I still lack skills.

220
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:25,575
But I promise to improve
until the league is over...

221
00:12:25,674 --> 00:12:28,715
and debut, so keep watching me.

222
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:29,945
I'll do my best.

223
00:12:33,815 --> 00:12:35,824
He was incredibly good-looking.

224
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:39,225
I couldn't stop admiring his beauty.

225
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:43,224
(After Kenta, the first love
who charmed everyone, )

226
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:46,294
(the next player walks in powerfully.)

227
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:48,934
(Focused)

228
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:50,424
I recognized him right away.

229
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,304
He was in another audition show.

230
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,735
I was surprised.

231
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:57,075
(The player recognized by players appears.)

232
00:12:57,774 --> 00:12:59,543
Cha Woong Ki.

233
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:00,643
(Cha Woong Ki Nickname: Survival Addict)

234
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:03,715
His presence is really captivating.

235
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:08,183
Hi. I'm Cha Woong Ki born in 2002.

236
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:09,625
I was a member of TO1,

237
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:13,855
a group that debuted in 2020.

238
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,995
I was in several survival shows.

239
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:20,694
To make this my final audition show,

240
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,404
I came to Universe League.

241
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:24,105
How cool!

242
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:28,975
Is that an autograph?

243
00:13:29,774 --> 00:13:30,975
Nice acting.

244
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:32,945
Cute.

245
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,315
I like how confident you are.

246
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:40,013
Here's the next player.

247
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:42,085
(The players continue to come onstage.)

248
00:13:42,384 --> 00:13:44,355
Zhang Shuaibo.

249
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:51,423
He's cool.

250
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,464
(Zhang Shuaibo)

251
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,834
- Let's go! - The Asian Prince.

252
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:54,865
Asian Prince.

253
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:58,874
(I'm the Asian Prince.)

254
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,075
Hi. My name is Zhang Shuaibo.

255
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:03,475
I feel nervous.

256
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,075
Slightly nervous.

257
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,913
I last participated in a competition...

258
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:11,715
with many people a while
ago. So it's making me nervous.

259
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:12,985
But I'm still happy.

260
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,754
Hi. I'm Zhang Shuaibo.

261
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:19,495
This is the second time I have
come to Korea to achieve my dream.

262
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,624
It took a lot of courage
for me to come here.

263
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,033
But since I'm here,

264
00:14:26,034 --> 00:14:28,134
I will debut this time.

265
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,105
I will do my best.

266
00:14:32,804 --> 00:14:33,804
He's cool.

267
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:37,004
(Overflowing with cuteness)

268
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:39,975
Zhang Shuaibo and I
were on the same team...

269
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:42,013
in a different audition show.

270
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,344
Seeing him made me really happy.

271
00:14:43,345 --> 00:14:44,345
Hi.

272
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,615
Okay. Let's meet our next player.

273
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:53,694
(The next player appears.)

274
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,825
He's stunning.

275
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:58,565
Jang Kyung Ho!

276
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:00,564
- He's cool. - The one with charisma.

277
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,865
Hello. I am Jang Kyung Ho.

278
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:05,163
I made my debut with a group called TOO.

279
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:07,303
(He made his debut with a
group called TOO in 2020.)

280
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:09,704
Our group came to an end last year.

281
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:10,951
(The group disbanded
after 3 years of his debut.)

282
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,875
It was at the start of the group.

283
00:15:13,644 --> 00:15:14,945
That was when...

284
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:17,845
I felt...

285
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:23,725
the worst of what I could experience...

286
00:15:24,054 --> 00:15:25,293
("Group TOO's Management Conflict
Gets Serious With Trademark Rights")

287
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:26,354
("TOO's Trademark War Leads
to New Group Name, TO1")

288
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:29,024
There were issues between companies.

289
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,134
Members left, and new members came in.

290
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:34,975
There were many things that
happened within the group as well.

291
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:38,875
I felt very anxious
while being in the group.

292
00:15:40,235 --> 00:15:42,975
I was in a group called TO1.

293
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,704
I then left the group.

294
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:46,585
(Woong Ki and Kyung Ho
were in the same group.)

295
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:49,215
We always had bad results.

296
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:52,354
I could tell with the results that we get.

297
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:54,284
"We worked this hard,"

298
00:15:54,585 --> 00:15:57,284
"but these are the only results we get."

299
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:59,344
I had these thoughts
since the start of my debut.

300
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:02,023
I felt anxious staying still.

301
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:04,064
(I felt anxious staying still.)

302
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:06,794
I felt anxious before I fell
asleep and when I woke up.

303
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:11,974
I felt anxious while getting
my hair and makeup done.

304
00:16:11,975 --> 00:16:15,504
I had to perform, but I
teared up out of anxiety.

305
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:19,714
I started doing this at a young age.

306
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:21,221
(He felt anxious about his
unclear future at a young age.)

307
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,684
I think that was why...

308
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,783
I always had that in mind.

309
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,284
(He chose to leave the group.)

310
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:31,053
I am hoping for things to go well...

311
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:33,355
with this opportunity.

312
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:37,125
I have those thoughts and worries.

313
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:39,994
- Hello. - Hello.

314
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:41,163
Hello.

315
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,634
- Hello. - Hello.

316
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:49,404
Was there anyone that
you knew out of the players?

317
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:53,815
There is one that I do know.

318
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:57,284
But I don't think I have to talk about him.

319
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:58,584
I'll make no comment about him.

320
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:00,214
(I'll make no comment about him.)

321
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:02,554
We just naturally got distant.

322
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,784
(We just naturally got distant.)

323
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:06,394
I wouldn't say we were on bad terms.

324
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:09,924
But there is no one that I
could say that I'm close to.

325
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:11,955
I don't even have anyone's number.

326
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,903
A member of your former group...

327
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:18,264
- Yes. - appeared in front of you.

328
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,474
What did you think about that?

329
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:21,605
Well...

330
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,495
"I guess he wants to
be a part of this as well."

331
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,575
Right.

332
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,024
That was all I had in mind.

333
00:17:30,144 --> 00:17:33,285
(What happened between the two of them?)

334
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,884
Time to meet the next player. Let's go.

335
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:37,654
An Yul!

336
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:39,794
He was born in 2010?

337
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:40,795
(The cute youngest born in 2010 appears.)

338
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:43,064
- He was born in 2010? - Oh, my gosh!

339
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:46,035
- You're 14, right? - I was born in 2009.

340
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,964
- He Junjin! - He's so cute.

341
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,335
Hiroto! Tough guy!

342
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,075
- Sexy! - Kwon Hee Jun.

343
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:57,144
- Gosh. - He's handsome.

344
00:17:57,404 --> 00:18:00,144
There must be something on
his lips. Did you just have a meal?

345
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,883
Nam Do Yoon!

346
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,913
(Nam Do Yoon, Nickname:
3-second Jung Hae In)

347
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:07,284
Check out his confidence.

348
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:08,514
(The so-called 3-second
Jung Hae In appears.)

349
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:09,585
He's an actor.

350
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:13,924
Hello. I'm 17-year-old Nam Do Yoon.

351
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,865
My nickname is Three-second Jung Hae In.

352
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,764
When I was in elementary
school, I starred in "D.P." briefly.

353
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,265
I was Jung Hae In's child actor.

354
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:24,663
I resemble him when I'm seen briefly.

355
00:18:24,664 --> 00:18:26,974
The nickname holds that meaning as well.

356
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,143
From being a child actor, I
developed a new dream...

357
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,474
of becoming an idol star.

358
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,774
I still lack a lot right now,

359
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,015
but It would be great if you
could show me your support.

360
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:39,484
Is there a secret move that you prepared?

361
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,324
Something like showing off my looks?

362
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:44,124
Like this.

363
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,854
(How do I look, everyone?)

364
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:46,924
Something like this.

365
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:51,163
(He checks his looks as if
the camera were a mirror.)

366
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,193
(Awkward)

367
00:18:52,194 --> 00:18:54,564
- One strand of your hair... - Sorry?

368
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:55,565
Is sticking out.

369
00:18:55,566 --> 00:18:56,834
- Right. - There you go.

370
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,664
- Thank you. - He's so cute.

371
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:00,933
Hello.

372
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,243
(The clumsy Nam Do Yoon enters as well!)

373
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,775
It's the last player, everyone!

374
00:19:04,505 --> 00:19:06,443
- It's the last player.
- It's the last player.

375
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:08,244
- There's one person left.
- Who could it be?

376
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:10,144
Let's meet the last player!

377
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,254
- Let's go! - He must look amazing...

378
00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:14,384
to be the last person.

379
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:20,255
(The last player finally appears
with everyone's attention.)

380
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,295
Chih En!

381
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,394
(Chih En)

382
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:28,733
You look great!

383
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,065
(He appears with a great presence.)

384
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,575
- You look amazing! - He looks amazing.

385
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,744
Gosh!

386
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,244
Gosh, he's so handsome.

387
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:42,545
That guy was so handsome.

388
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:47,454
He looked so handsome, and he stood out.

389
00:19:48,615 --> 00:19:51,024
(Save in my heart)

390
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:54,125
Hello. I'm 19-year-old Chih En.

391
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,525
(Smiling)

392
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:57,923
I will do my best in all the missions...

393
00:19:57,924 --> 00:20:01,795
and make sure to come in first place.

394
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,934
I love you!

395
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:08,703
Thank you.

396
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:09,704
(Shy)

397
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:10,775
My heart is pounding.

398
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,874
(With Chih En as the last player, )

399
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,584
(all 42 players have entered.)

400
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:20,555
Boys' dream match, Universe
League. Are you ready?

401
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:22,784
(Universe League)

402
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:24,824
Welcome to Universe League,

403
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:26,825
all 42 players.

404
00:20:27,224 --> 00:20:29,364
(Welcome!)

405
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:30,393
Good luck, everyone.

406
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:32,393
(Welcome!)

407
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,134
I will tell you how...

408
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:36,933
you can make your debut
through Universe League.

409
00:20:36,934 --> 00:20:38,703
- Gosh. - Gosh. Right away?

410
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,633
- I feel nervous, all of a sudden.
- I'm scared.

411
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:41,703
(The way to make their debut
through Universe League)

412
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,243
In Universe League, there's RHYTHM,

413
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,775
(RHYTHM)

414
00:20:46,474 --> 00:20:47,514
GROOVE,

415
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:49,884
(GROOVE)

416
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,213
and BEAT.

417
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:53,015
(BEAT)

418
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:54,983
You will split into these three teams...

419
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:56,104
and compete with each other.

420
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:58,125
The winning team...

421
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:00,554
will lift up the Prism Cup...

422
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,963
and have the honor of making their debut.

423
00:21:02,964 --> 00:21:04,370
(The winning team will win
the Prism Cup and debut.)

424
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:06,134
The rule sounded exciting.

425
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:08,795
It really felt like a sports match.

426
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:12,335
The whole team has to
survive for me to survive.

427
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,775
My team must win. I'm confident.

428
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:16,944
I'm confident.

429
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:19,515
The Prism Cup? It's mine.

430
00:21:20,974 --> 00:21:21,974
Prism.

431
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:25,714
- Prism. - Prism.

432
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:33,923
P, R, I, S, M.

433
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:36,224
There are five stages
that you must go through.

434
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,663
- What? - I feel nervous.

435
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,733
(The winning team is
decided after 5 stages.)

436
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,734
- There are five of them. - Five times?

437
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,304
There are five stages
that you must go through...

438
00:21:44,305 --> 00:21:46,374
to lift the Prism Cup.

439
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,051
(The winning team is
decided after 5 stages.)

440
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,174
Today, the first stage will begin...

441
00:21:50,474 --> 00:21:52,444
with the P.

442
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,413
It's Pick.

443
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,045
(The first stage, Pick)

444
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,914
- Gosh. - I feel nervous.

445
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,285
Do we choose our teams?

446
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:04,525
With the pick of the directors,

447
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:07,524
your teams will be decided.

448
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:10,894
(Their teams will be
decided by the directors.)

449
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,664
- The directors will choose us. - Right.

450
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:15,565
- Gosh. - I feel nervous.

451
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:17,464
The players who don't get picked...

452
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:22,544
will be on the verge of elimination.

453
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,074
(They are unable to be in the
league if they don't get picked.)

454
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:26,514
- No way. - This is scary.

455
00:22:26,515 --> 00:22:28,351
(They are unable to be in the
league if they don't get picked.)

456
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:29,714
All right.

457
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:32,683
I will introduce to you the directors...

458
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,615
who will be picking you into their teams.

459
00:22:35,384 --> 00:22:36,454
First,

460
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,094
it's TEAM BEAT!

461
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:41,124
(TEAM BEAT's director)

462
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:42,154
Drop the beat!

463
00:22:43,025 --> 00:22:44,424
- Push the beat! - Let's get it!

464
00:22:51,365 --> 00:22:52,403
He's amazing.

465

(GOT7's main dancer)

466
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,643
(and solo artist)

467
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:57,775
He can do it all.

468
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:02,845
(YUGYEOM)

469
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,744

00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:11,384
(Another director of TEAM BEAT)

472
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:15,594
He's so cool.

473
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:18,125
(Hit K-pop producer of BTS, TXT, and IU)

474
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:21,133
(EL CAPITXN)

475
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:23,604

high-quality performances,

476
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:24,634
YUGYEOM.

477
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:27,835
K-pop hit song producer, EL CAPITXN.

478
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,045
(Where are they?)

479
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,644
(A great reaction)

480
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:40,914
Give it up for TEAM BEAT!

481
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,255
They look amazing.

482
00:23:43,684 --> 00:23:45,424
You're amazing!

483
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,894
Hello, everyone.

484
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:49,464
I'm TEAM BEAT's director, YUGYEOM.

485
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,365
- I'm EL CAPITXN.
- It's great to see you all.

486
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:53,595
It's great to see you.

487
00:23:54,664 --> 00:23:57,464
I was so surprised when
Director EL CAPITXN appeared.

488
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:00,075
He's a really hot producer these days.

489
00:24:01,035 --> 00:24:03,875
("eight" by IU)

490
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:06,274

(The hottest producer these
days of various hit songs)

493
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:14,285
A team with a producer?

494
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:16,924
I thought it was a very precious merit.

495
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,423
YUGYEOM is an experienced idol star...

496
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,765
who has tried many different things.

497
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:26,535
I thought that he would
be able to lead us very well.

498
00:24:26,894 --> 00:24:29,864
I'm really enjoying
YUGYEOM's songs these days.

499
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,865
I want to impress him...

500
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,005
and really join TEAM BEAT.

501
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:37,775

502
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:41,115
I will introduce the
directors of the next team.

The ones who are taking over global stages,

510
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:09,174
NCT's global unit, WayV.

511
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,144
- Gosh. - Hello!

512
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:16,443
(This is amazing.)

513
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:17,515
This is touching.

514
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:20,384
- Hello, this is WayV.
- Hello, this is WayV.

515
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:22,884
- Awesome! - Gosh!

516
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,525

Awesome!

521
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:41,203
It's a super dream come true for me.

522
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:43,544
It's because TEN...

523
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:46,015
is one of my role models in dancing.

524
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:50,484
The performances that WayV showed us...

525
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:52,614
were incredible.

526
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:57,423
I think practicing under them
will be a good experience for me.

527
00:25:57,424 --> 00:25:59,424
That is why I really want
to get into TEAM RHYTHM.

528
00:25:59,924 --> 00:26:02,865

529

00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,345
is known to be an outstanding vocalist.

546
00:26:59,454 --> 00:27:03,125
I thought it would be great
to learn how to sing from him.

547
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,653
I had the heart of wanting to...

548
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:08,324
have my vocal skills trained by him.

549
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:11,365
I want to get a good scolding by Chang Sub.

550
00:27:11,494 --> 00:27:12,494
Based on singing.

551
00:27:13,664 --> 00:27:16,134
(Specialized in vocals)

552
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,434
(While being specialized
in different areas, )

553
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:22,575
(the directors of the three
teams gathered together.)

554
00:27:22,904 --> 00:27:26,473
I'm really curious to see
which players will get picked...

555
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:27,744
by the directors.

556
00:27:28,045 --> 00:27:29,943
The first stage of Prism, Pick.

557
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:32,914
The teams will be decided through a draft.

558
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:34,714
A draft?

559
00:27:35,555 --> 00:27:36,855
What's a draft?

560
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:40,423
The selection of rookie
players is called a draft.

561
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:42,154
- I see. - A draft.

562
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,795
(Draft)

563
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:48,634
The 42 players have been
split into 7 groups of 6...

564
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:51,964
and have prepared a performance.

565
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:54,804
(Universe League rule: The
directors will watch the performance...)

566
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:58,443
(and will select a starting
player with the First Pick...)

567
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,474
(after a 60-second discussion.)

568
00:28:00,775 --> 00:28:05,944
A team will consist of 7 starting
players, 1 from each group.

569
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:09,883
The players who do not get
picked will head to the bench...

570
00:28:09,884 --> 00:28:12,755
and be on the verge of elimination.

571
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:14,625
(Shocked)

572
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:15,893
Really?

573
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,164
- Gosh. - Okay.

574
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:20,834
- No way. - Just 21 players...

575
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:21,933
- will make it.
- That's half of the players.

576
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,733
The other 21 players won't get picked.

577
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:26,934
It was intense from the start.

578
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:29,473
Right. This was a survival.

579
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,943
I wasn't here to goof around.

580
00:28:30,944 --> 00:28:34,515
We were matched up against
each other in such a cruel way.

581
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:38,143
I lived just for this dream.

582
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:40,213
I thought that I could never lose...

583
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:42,384
and that I should find my way up.

584
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:45,454
I don't want to lose my
place as a starting player.

585
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,594
Whatever I am asked to do,

586
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,724
I am ready to work hard
for it with confidence.

587
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:52,764
Is there a main position...

588
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:55,434
that the directors consider
to be important in a team?

589
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:57,604
(Curious)

590
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:00,004
I think the vibes of the
players are the most important.

591
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,834
It's the same for me
and my other members...

592
00:29:01,835 --> 00:29:03,874
when it comes to singing or dancing.

593
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,973
There's always room for us to improve.

594
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:07,973
As it's something that can be improved,

595
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:10,483
I believe the charms of
a player are important.

596
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:13,514
You're talking about the
traits of becoming a star, right?

597
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:15,614
- That's right. Yes, sir. - Okay.

598
00:29:15,615 --> 00:29:16,624
(That's me.)

599
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:19,024
I will focus on the basics.

600
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:20,154
- The basics. - The basics.

601
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,594
The basics and their eagerness.

602
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,025
- The eagerness is important.
- I will focus on them. Right.

603
00:29:25,694 --> 00:29:27,834
I will look for their potential,

604
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:31,565
and as they will be dancing together,

605
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:34,473
I want to focus on their
synergy and chemistry.

606
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:38,903
I will look out for their
eyes of persistence.

607
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:40,544
I will find the ones...

608
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,244
who have what it takes
to work hard until the end.

609
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:47,183
The directors all have a certain
direction in their standards.

610
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:50,954
However, there is another important
rule that the directors must know.

611
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:55,324
If the First Pick is made
for the same player,

612
00:29:55,325 --> 00:29:56,364
(If the First Pick is made
for the same player, )

613
00:29:56,365 --> 00:30:00,193
the player will get the
right to select the team.

614
00:30:00,194 --> 00:30:02,595
(the player will get the
right to select the team.)

615
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:06,304
(If the First Pick overlaps, )

616
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,574
(there is a chance of losing that player.)

617
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:13,345
Both the directors and players
must be focused for this draft.

618
00:30:14,474 --> 00:30:16,545
Things are just about to start.

619
00:30:16,845 --> 00:30:20,855
I do believe that I am talented.

620
00:30:21,015 --> 00:30:23,754
I will do my best to get picked...

621
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,254
and mesmerize the directors.

622
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:28,394
I will do my best. Let's go!

623
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:30,463
(Coming soon)

624
00:30:30,464 --> 00:30:32,324
(The 1st Pick of the 3 teams is revealed.)

625
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:33,885
(I think we will have the same player.)

626
00:30:34,394 --> 00:30:36,511
(I think we have the same
player as they're all laughing.)

627
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:40,133
(A fierce competition
to recruit their players)

628
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:42,845
(We will show you everything
from SM Entertainment.)

629
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:44,743
(An intense draft)

630
00:30:44,744 --> 00:30:46,575
(How will things end up?)

631
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:47,944
Where are you going?

632
00:30:48,244 --> 00:30:49,804
(Do you have any popcorn? This is fun.)

633
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:54,785
All right. This is the first
performance for the draft.

634
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:59,795
These are players with great potential.

635
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:00,994
Gosh.

636
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,524
This group consists only
of members in their teens.

637
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:06,564
All of them?

638
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,564
The first group with the spirit of teens.

639
00:31:09,565 --> 00:31:11,463
- Teens are precious.
- Right. They're all teens.

640
00:31:11,464 --> 00:31:12,973
We'll bring them right up. Let's go!

641
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:14,535
We'll bring them right up. Let's go!

642
00:31:19,075 --> 00:31:21,914
We will show you all of our young energy.

643
00:31:23,944 --> 00:31:27,085
Please enjoy the performance
we worked hard for.

644
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:31,484
We will make sure to
show you our true teen spirit.

645
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,723
(Confident)

646
00:31:37,724 --> 00:31:38,765
Let's go!

647
00:31:44,065 --> 00:31:45,164
They're young!

648
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:48,174
They're really young. They're all teens?

649
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,644
Gosh.

650
00:31:49,944 --> 00:31:51,104
They're cute.

651
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:52,875
Their heads are all so small.

652
00:31:53,315 --> 00:31:55,714
They're all wearing blue.

653
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:57,914
- An Yul! - He looks cute.

654
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:00,654
Nam Do Yoon!

655
00:32:02,414 --> 00:32:03,454
You look amazing!

656
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:04,884
Park Ju Won.

657
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:06,954
He's cute.

658
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,694
- Cute! - Mac!

659
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:11,565
Yeo Gangdong.

660
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:14,494
And Zen Zen.

661
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:17,565
Their cheeks are all blushing.

662
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:21,174
- In 2, 3... Hello. - Hello.

663
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,903
- We are Group "THRILL RIDE!"
- Group "THRILL RIDE!"

664
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:27,014
(We are Group "THRILL RIDE!")

665
00:32:27,015 --> 00:32:29,173
- "THRILL RIDE?" - Thank you.

666
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:30,854
(They prepared "THRILL RIDE" by THE BOYZ.)

667
00:32:30,944 --> 00:32:33,284
- They're cute. - You are so cute!

668
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,130
(How was their first
encounter with each other?)

669
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,213
Gosh.

670
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:38,624
(Group "THRILL RIDE's" practice room)

671
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,894
Hello, everyone.

672
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,254
- Hello. - I'm Zen Zen.

673
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:44,095
I greeted them. You should greet them too.

674
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,693
I'll film you too.

675
00:32:45,694 --> 00:32:46,864
(These two boys are waiting
for the other members.)

676
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:48,535
- Greet them. - Hello.

677
00:32:49,194 --> 00:32:50,203
Gosh.

678
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:51,264
(Who is this boy that is very shy?)

679
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:52,334
Feel comfortable.

680
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:56,575
Hello. I'm 19-year-old Park Ju Won.

681
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:01,713
(During the audition in Korea)

682
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,845
How long were you in your agency?

683
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:05,515
It has been 12 months.

684
00:33:05,845 --> 00:33:07,755
- You were there for a year? - Right.

685
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,854
After dreaming of becoming an idol star,

686
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,194
I loved dancing so much.

687
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:15,755
I have been practicing every single day.

688
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,325
I will work hard...

689
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,095
to be able to make my debut
through Universe League.

690
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,634
(He waits for the others
with an excited heart.)

691
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:25,865
Everyone...

692
00:33:26,164 --> 00:33:28,174
- It must be him. - No.

693
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:30,403
- Oh, hello. - In 1, 2, 3...

694
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:31,805
- Hello! - Hello!

695
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,743
Hello.

696
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:36,174
- Hello. - Hello.

697
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:38,683
- Hello. - Hello.

698
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,153
Where are you all from? Are you Korean?

699
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,784
- Yes. - Yes.

700
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:44,924
- I'm Korean too. - I see.

701
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,693
We are from Thailand.

702
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,054
- Daegu? - Thailand.

703
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,294
- Thailand. - Yes.

704
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,095
- Thailand. - Right.

705
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,194
Where are you from?

706
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,963
I'm from Gangdong-gu, Seoul.

707
00:33:56,964 --> 00:33:58,335
- Gangdong-gu? - Yes.

708
00:33:58,464 --> 00:34:00,574
- My name is Yeo Gangdong. - Oh, right.

709
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:01,575
(My name is Yeo Gangdong!)

710
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:02,605
Right.

711
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:05,904
(The last member still hasn't arrived yet.)

712
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,843
Should we greet him in a special way?

713
00:34:08,844 --> 00:34:10,884
- Let's do something together.
- What should we do?

714
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:12,314
- Like this? - Should we scream...

715
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,414
when he's around here?

716
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:15,214
- Should we? - While being like this...

717
00:34:15,215 --> 00:34:18,224
- Gosh! - Gosh!

718
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:21,354
(The last member arrives.)

719
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:22,425
Gosh.

720
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:25,823
Hello!

721
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:27,735
Why aren't you getting up?

722
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:29,363
In 1, 2, 3...

723
00:34:29,364 --> 00:34:31,034
- Hello. - Hello.

724
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:32,835
Why aren't you getting up?

725
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:36,105
- Come on, Zen Zen! - What was that?

726
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:38,243
How old are you?

727
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,175
I'm 15.

728
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:41,414
(Surprised)

729
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:44,513
- The youngest! - The youngest!

730
00:34:44,514 --> 00:34:47,454
I think our group will be fresh.

731
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:49,314
Am I wrong?

732
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:51,424
(A fresh first encounter
for Group "THRILL RIDE")

733
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:54,424
We were all teens.

734
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,723
We had a bright energy...

735
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,924
and great teamwork.

736
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:00,163
(Their practice room was full of energy.)

737
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,993
We'll give a bright and
happy performance...

738
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:05,405
that can showcase our teenager energy.

739
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:07,775
How refreshing.

740
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,203
Okay. Are you ready?

741
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:12,644
- Yes! - Yes!

742
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:13,775
Let's go!

743
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,414
- Yes! - Let's go!

744
00:35:17,414 --> 00:35:18,944
- We can do this. - One, two, three.

745
00:35:18,945 --> 00:35:20,314
- Baby catch me go! - Baby catch me go!

746
00:35:20,315 --> 00:35:22,215
- "THRILL RIDE!" Let's go! - Let's go!

747
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:25,585
I like their energy.

748
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:29,494
Let's go!

749
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:34,863
I want to be the youngest member...

750
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:37,735
who isn't outshined by the older members.

751
00:35:38,534 --> 00:35:40,505
Even at school, I was on the bench.

752
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:43,804
Here, I want to be a starting
player and go to the next round.

753
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:46,944
I plan to give my all...

754
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:51,244
on Universe League so I have no regrets.

755
00:35:56,385 --> 00:35:58,454
Ready? Go.

756
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,924
Let's go.

757
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:05,925
("THRILL RIDE" by An Yul, Mac,
Nam Do Yoon, Yeo Gangdong, Zen Zen)

758
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:22,445
Very powerful.

759
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:48,375
Nice.

760
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:54,474
He's so cute!

761
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:07,355
So good!

762
00:37:20,034 --> 00:37:21,175
Very nice.

763
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:02,844
Him and the guy in the middle aren't bad.

764
00:38:27,675 --> 00:38:31,304
Give it up one time for "THRILL RIDE!"

765
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:34,973
Give it up one time for "THRILL RIDE!"

766
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:37,244
So good!

767
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:38,885
They're all good.

768
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:41,614
- Thank you. - That was so good.

769
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:43,655
They're good.

770
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,724
Who do you think...

771
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:48,425
The member with the 26 on his arm.

772
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:49,925
Park Ju Won.

773
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:54,034
Directors. What did you
think of Group "THRILL RIDE?"

774
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,163
The song, your outfits,

775
00:38:57,164 --> 00:39:00,905
and the energy you exuded
really went well together.

776
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:03,275
The colors blended well together.

777
00:39:03,704 --> 00:39:06,544
And the young energy...

778
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:08,314
you exuded...

779
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:10,585
made those watching it feel happy.

780
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:11,815
I liked it.

781
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,184
- Thank you. - Thank you.

782
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:16,355
First,

783
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:21,624
I noticed Park Ju Won...

784
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,194
because of his strong energy while dancing.

785
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:27,434
- Thank you. - It was nice to see.

786
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,934
I also thought Park Ju Won...

787
00:39:32,934 --> 00:39:33,974
We thought the same thing.

788
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:38,044
I also thought Park Ju Won stood out a lot.

789
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,604
(Player Park Ju Won also
caught TEAM RHYTHM's eye.)

790
00:39:39,605 --> 00:39:42,774
When you were performing,
your facial expressions...

791
00:39:42,775 --> 00:39:44,614
and gestures were so natural.

792
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:46,315
It was so nice to see.

793
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:47,854
- Thank you. - Thank you.

794
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:49,315
- Thank you. - Thank you.

795
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:54,695
Now, this is the important part.

796
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:57,363
I'll give you 60 seconds.

797
00:39:57,364 --> 00:39:58,364
(The first draft begins.)

798
00:39:58,824 --> 00:40:02,394
In 60 seconds, choose your 1st Pick...

799
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:04,235
to be your starting player.

800
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,495
One player from each
group will be picked...

801
00:40:06,664 --> 00:40:09,904
to create a starting lineup of
seven players for each team.

802
00:40:09,905 --> 00:40:11,343
(The directors will choose
their 1st Pick in 60 seconds.)

803
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,074
If 2 teams have the same 1st Pick,

804
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:17,814
the player will get to choose the team.

805
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,553
(If 2 teams have the same
1st Pick, the player will choose.)

806
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:22,014
Oh, goodness.

807
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:23,683
My heart is pounding.

808
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:27,155
Please pick the player you want.

809
00:40:27,894 --> 00:40:30,493
(Your 60 seconds start now.)

810
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,824
- No way. - Oh, right now?

811
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:33,695
Right now?

812
00:40:34,735 --> 00:40:35,934
Oh, goodness.

813
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:38,534
What should I do?

814
00:40:39,335 --> 00:40:41,204
I like him.

815
00:40:41,304 --> 00:40:42,973
- Visually. - Right.

816
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,774
These two stand out.

817
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,973
- Right. - Earlier, RHYTHM and BEAT...

818
00:40:47,974 --> 00:40:51,143
I think he did a better job
with portraying the concept.

819
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:52,844
- The song... - Right, the concept...

820
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,815
Time is ticking.

821
00:40:56,885 --> 00:40:58,554
- Oh, my goodness. - Gosh.

822
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:04,924
- I think everyone will choose him.
- Right?

823
00:41:04,925 --> 00:41:06,724
If you look at the performance,

824
00:41:06,994 --> 00:41:08,634
- he's good, - I think so.

825
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,735
But whether he suits the song...

826
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:14,074
That one minute of
standing there is so scary.

827
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,034
It must be so nerve-racking.

828
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:22,255
There are ten seconds left.

829
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:25,283
Seven, six...

830
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:27,214
(There are less than 10 seconds left.)

831
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:29,984
- But if we do that... - Five, four,

832
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:31,885
- Hurry. Should I go with him?
- Three, two...

833
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,925
- Five, four, - Five, four,

834
00:41:34,224 --> 00:41:35,925
- three, two, - three, two,

835
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:37,025
- one! - one!

836
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:39,823
Your time is up.

837
00:41:39,824 --> 00:41:41,533
Your time is up, everyone.

838
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:43,703
(They seriously chose their First Pick.)

839
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:44,704
Okay.

840
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,704
Nice.

841
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:47,375
We're doing well.

842
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:52,945
I'm curious about your decisions.

843
00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:00,854
This is an interesting situation.

844
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:03,114
They prepared this performance together.

845
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:07,195
But actually, they have to
compete against the members...

846
00:42:07,554 --> 00:42:10,695
they practiced with to be chosen.

847
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,424
You can't let your guard
down even for a moment.

848
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:14,934
Universe League is very cruel.

849
00:42:17,105 --> 00:42:19,005
Oh, right. This was a survival program.

850
00:42:19,505 --> 00:42:22,774
Okay. We will now reveal
the 3 teams' 1st Picks.

851
00:42:22,775 --> 00:42:26,743
First, we will reveal TEAM BEAT's...

852
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:27,744
First Pick.

853
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:28,945
Yes!

854
00:42:32,485 --> 00:42:34,315
Will they pick me?

855
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:37,053
If they do, I can work very hard.

856
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,184
I really hope they pick me.

857
00:42:53,105 --> 00:42:56,135
I waited, thinking, "Please call my name."

858
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:59,504
(TEAM BEAT's First Pick...)

859
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:01,614
(Park Ju Won.)

860
00:43:03,175 --> 00:43:04,715
- TEAM BEAT... - Thank you.

861
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:06,614
Chose player Park Ju Won...

862
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:09,755
- Thank you. - as their First Pick.

863
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:12,454
Good job.

864
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:13,925
Oh, my gosh.

865
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:17,594
We will reveal TEAM GROOVE's First Pick.

866
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:23,033
(First Pick, BEAT, Park Ju Won)

867
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:26,034
I could only see him.

868
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,303
Right? I think the votes will go...

869
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:30,474
to Ju Won.

870
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:36,243
(First Pick, BEAT, Park Ju Won)

871
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:41,885
(First Pick, BEAT, Park Ju Won)

872
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:43,755
(Who is TEAM GROOVE's First Pick?)

873
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:45,385
(Zen Zen)

874
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:46,954
TEAM GROOVE chose...

875
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:49,454
player Zen Zen.

876
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:50,565
Congratulations.

877
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:52,195
Okay.

878
00:43:52,695 --> 00:43:53,734
The starting player...

879
00:43:53,735 --> 00:43:55,010
- that TEAM GROOVE chose...
- He's handsome.

880
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:56,394
Is player Zen Zen.

881
00:43:57,264 --> 00:43:59,335
I mostly paid attention to vocal ability,

882
00:43:59,434 --> 00:44:01,474
and he had the pretty
voice that I was looking for.

883
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:02,934
Thank you.

884
00:44:03,335 --> 00:44:06,474
Two teams have chosen different players.

885
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:09,945
Lastly, we will reveal
TEAM RHYTHM's First Pick.

886
00:44:10,844 --> 00:44:13,113
(First Pick, GROOVE, Zen
Zen, BEAT, Park Ju Won)

887
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:14,614
I think it might be him.

888
00:44:15,815 --> 00:44:17,424
(Will they have the same pick as
TEAM BEAT or TEAM GROOVE?)

889
00:44:17,425 --> 00:44:18,425
I'm nervous.

890
00:44:18,426 --> 00:44:20,530
(Will they have the same pick as
TEAM BEAT or TEAM GROOVE?)

891
00:44:20,554 --> 00:44:23,554
(Or will they pick another player?)

892
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:30,363
(Park Ju Won)

893
00:44:30,364 --> 00:44:31,364
TEAM RHYHM...

894
00:44:31,365 --> 00:44:34,434
- also picked player Park Ju Won.
- Thank you.

895
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:36,235
Oh, no.

896
00:44:36,236 --> 00:44:37,343
(It's just the first performance, )

897
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,303
(and TEAM RHYTHM and TEAM
BEAT already chose the same player.)

898
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:40,874
Already. Oh, no.

899
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:41,875
Thank you.

900
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:44,744
This is fun.

901
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:46,720
- Thank you. - This isn't easy.

902
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:48,284
Oh, spicy. Okay.

903
00:44:50,885 --> 00:44:52,985
RHYTHM and BEAT...

904
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:55,224
both chose you, Ju Won.

905
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,994
I really wanted to go to these two teams.

906
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:01,465
I'm so grateful...

907
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:05,505
that they both wanted me. Thank you.

908
00:45:09,888 --> 00:45:12,457
First, player Zen Zen...

909
00:45:12,758 --> 00:45:13,828
has become...

910
00:45:14,198 --> 00:45:16,526
a starting player for TEAM GROOVE.

911
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:19,727
Please go to the team
seat right away, Zen Zen.

912
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:21,737
(Oh, my.)

913
00:45:21,738 --> 00:45:24,308
GROOVE. It's time to groove.

914
00:45:24,508 --> 00:45:25,808
Congratulations, Zen Zen.

915
00:45:26,567 --> 00:45:29,237
Let's do a wi-fi handshake. Okay.

916
00:45:29,238 --> 00:45:30,777
(Jealous)

917
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:36,617
I'm so happy. I feel so happy.

918
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:37,618
Director...

919
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:41,456
Lee Chang Sub, now that I'm on TEAM GROOVE,

920
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:44,058
I'll work even harder and do well.

921
00:45:44,587 --> 00:45:45,658
Thank you.

922
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:47,726
(TEAM GROOVE has
drafted its first starting player.)

923
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:50,127
- The greatest happiness.
- Let's wear that too.

924
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:51,727
Let's wear that too.

925
00:45:54,138 --> 00:45:56,538
If 2 teams have the same 1st Pick,

926
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,437
the player...

927
00:45:58,808 --> 00:46:01,277
- gets to pick his team. - Spicy.

928
00:46:01,977 --> 00:46:03,038
Oh, my.

929
00:46:05,977 --> 00:46:08,776
We will reveal player Park Ju Won's...

930
00:46:08,777 --> 00:46:09,816
(Which team will player Park Ju Won pick?)

931
00:46:09,817 --> 00:46:10,888
decision!

932
00:46:12,488 --> 00:46:13,488
I will...

933
00:46:13,489 --> 00:46:15,558
(I will...)

934
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:18,727
teach you how to have a long career...

935
00:46:18,828 --> 00:46:21,397
as much as possible
and teach you everything...

936
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:24,397
about basic techniques and such,

937
00:46:24,598 --> 00:46:25,698
so please come to our team.

938
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:28,138
Thank you.

939
00:46:29,768 --> 00:46:31,268
(I can't lose to that.)

940
00:46:31,638 --> 00:46:33,167
Our team...

941
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:36,037
will teach you the tips...

942
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:38,907
on showing off your
personal charms onstage.

943
00:46:38,908 --> 00:46:40,916
And we've done both group...

944
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:42,877
and solo activities.

945
00:46:43,178 --> 00:46:45,816
We'll teach you many things,

946
00:46:45,817 --> 00:46:48,317
so please believe in us.

947
00:46:48,658 --> 00:46:51,387
I'll say something since
I didn't get to speak.

948
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:52,427
Okay.

949
00:46:52,428 --> 00:46:55,396
(So happy)

950
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:57,127
What I want to say is...

951
00:46:57,328 --> 00:47:00,397
You know what songs I've produced,

952
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:01,667
right?

953
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:02,997
Yes, I do.

954
00:47:03,468 --> 00:47:05,637
("eight" by IU, "Take Two" by
BTS, "Stay Alive" by Jungkook)

955
00:47:05,638 --> 00:47:07,706
("We don't talk together" by
Heize, "Kangaroo" by NCT U)

956
00:47:07,707 --> 00:47:09,884
("Girls Never Die" by tripleS,
"Honestly..." by Eric Nam, etc.)

957
00:47:09,908 --> 00:47:10,948
That's all.

958
00:47:16,518 --> 00:47:18,316
- Hold on. - Hold on.

959
00:47:18,317 --> 00:47:20,658
- You can't lose, NCT and WayV!
- Yes, let's go.

960
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:21,917
One second.

961
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,627
I'll show you how we practice at SM.

962
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:29,357
You can use HYBE's practice rooms here.

963
00:47:30,328 --> 00:47:32,167
I'll take you to HYBE's practice rooms.

964
00:47:33,468 --> 00:47:34,797
- This is insane. - Seriously.

965
00:47:35,198 --> 00:47:37,908
What? I want to go! What about me?

966
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:39,808
Oh, gosh.

967
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:43,237
I can't believe I'm seeing a
fight between SM and HYBE here.

968
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,908
- Oh, my. - This is insane.

969
00:47:45,178 --> 00:47:46,207
Spicy.

970
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:49,477
This is just the first performance,
and it's so intense. Oh, no.

971
00:47:49,848 --> 00:47:50,917
Okay, we will...

972
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:52,518
hear...

973
00:47:53,317 --> 00:47:55,357
player Park Ju Won's...

974
00:47:56,357 --> 00:47:57,428
decision.

975
00:47:58,328 --> 00:48:01,956
(YUGYEOM and EL
CAPITXN's TEAM BEAT versus...)

976
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:03,427
(TEN and YANGYANG's TEAM RHYTHM)

977
00:48:03,428 --> 00:48:05,167
The team I want to go to...

978
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:17,590
(Which team will Park Ju Won choose?)

979
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:19,739
is TEAM RHYTHM.

980
00:48:19,787 --> 00:48:21,270
(Park Ju Won's decision)

981
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:22,828
TEAM RHYTHM.

982
00:48:22,829 --> 00:48:24,688
(Welcome to RHYTHM.)

983
00:48:24,689 --> 00:48:27,058
- Welcome. - Of course. Nice.

984
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:28,099
Welcome.

985
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:29,797
TEAM RHYTHM.

986
00:48:29,798 --> 00:48:31,498
(Oh, no!)

987
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:32,737
Gosh!

988
00:48:32,738 --> 00:48:36,137
(TEAM BEAT didn't get its First Pick.)

989
00:48:36,138 --> 00:48:39,408
Please go to the team seat right away.

990
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:43,140
I really want to do well...

991
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:44,710
with my performance,

992
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,011
and I want to learn a lot.

993
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:50,249
I thought I could learn a
lot about those things...

994
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,879
from TEN and YANGYANG.

995
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,520
That's why I wanted to go to their team.

996
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:56,519
- Oh, my gosh. - Very good.

997
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,959
(Draft Starting Lineup: Park Ju Won)

998
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,690
- Congratulations. - It's a bummer.

999
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,599
(Park Ju Won)

1000
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:06,265
(TEAM RHYTHM's first starting player)

1001
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:10,135
You lost your player, TEAM
BEAT. How do you feel?

1002
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:13,634
It doesn't feel great, to
be honest. Oh, goodness.

1003
00:49:13,635 --> 00:49:14,905
But still.

1004
00:49:15,635 --> 00:49:18,844
Please tell us your Second
Pick, BEAT directors.

1005
00:49:18,845 --> 00:49:20,445
(Revealing TEAM BEAT's Second Pick)

1006
00:49:21,745 --> 00:49:28,084
(Which player will get
to take this last chance?)

1007
00:49:29,184 --> 00:49:30,225
An Yul.

1008
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:32,284
(TEAM BEAT's starting player, An Yul)

1009
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:35,353
- Thank you. - The Second Pick is An Yul.

1010
00:49:35,354 --> 00:49:36,425
Congratulations, An Yul.

1011
00:49:36,595 --> 00:49:38,964
Nice. He's a good singer.

1012
00:49:39,294 --> 00:49:41,894
- Nice. - Nice!

1013
00:49:43,035 --> 00:49:44,663
(TEAM BEAT drafts An
Yul, the youngest player.)

1014
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:46,974
- Good job. - Thank you.

1015
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:48,004
Good job.

1016
00:49:48,504 --> 00:49:49,543
Should we do a fist bump?

1017
00:49:49,544 --> 00:49:50,603
(An Yul takes a starting
player spot as the Second Pick.)

1018
00:49:50,604 --> 00:49:52,344
- Yes. - Good job.

1019
00:49:52,345 --> 00:49:53,744
(An Yul takes a starting
player spot as the Second Pick.)

1020
00:49:53,745 --> 00:49:56,414
- I'm so emotional. I'm tearing up.
- I think I'm tearing up too.

1021
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:01,854
I was so happy that I became...

1022
00:50:02,055 --> 00:50:04,155
TEAM BEAT's first starting player.

1023
00:50:04,285 --> 00:50:06,754
Oh, my. I've already made it halfway.

1024
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:08,494
(Draft Starting Lineup:)

1025
00:50:08,495 --> 00:50:10,695
(An Yul)

1026
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,164
The three remaining players,

1027
00:50:13,394 --> 00:50:16,503
please return to the bench
with the other participants.

1028
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:17,504
Good work.

1029
00:50:17,505 --> 00:50:19,474
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1030
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:20,575
Good work.

1031
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:29,345
What will happen to me now?

1032
00:50:30,144 --> 00:50:33,314
I could go home like
this. I was really worried.

1033
00:50:34,854 --> 00:50:37,083
I felt a bit down.

1034
00:50:37,084 --> 00:50:39,455
I felt really sad, actually,

1035
00:50:39,754 --> 00:50:41,654
because I'm doing my best, but still,

1036
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:43,894
it wasn't enough to impress the judges.

1037
00:50:44,995 --> 00:50:48,464
I wanted to go home
instead of going to the bench.

1038
00:50:52,975 --> 00:50:54,074
I was so sad.

1039
00:50:54,075 --> 00:50:55,273
(The different fates...)

1040
00:50:55,274 --> 00:50:58,405
(of those in the starting
lineup and those on the bench)

1041
00:50:59,245 --> 00:51:01,214
Oh, no. This is what happened?

1042
00:51:02,175 --> 00:51:04,785
- They take three, and it's over. - Right.

1043
00:51:05,644 --> 00:51:07,484
So we realized...

1044
00:51:07,584 --> 00:51:11,084
that not everyone in the group
could go down the same path.

1045
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:15,753
I thought they might be...

1046
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:18,325
testing our mental resilience.

1047
00:51:20,434 --> 00:51:22,954
(They ended up in different
places after just one performance.)

1048
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:25,905
We will continue with the draft stage.

1049
00:51:28,075 --> 00:51:30,274
I want to see him in
person. He's so good-looking.

1050
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:33,445
He does really stand out.

1051
00:51:34,374 --> 00:51:35,984
He's so good-looking.

1052
00:51:37,914 --> 00:51:39,353
(Checking his name)

1053
00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:41,885
Okay. Please come out, players.

1054
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:01,104
What?

1055
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:03,445
- You're so cool. - They're so cool.

1056
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:09,983
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1057
00:52:09,984 --> 00:52:11,884
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1058
00:52:11,885 --> 00:52:12,885
They're so cool.

1059
00:52:12,886 --> 00:52:15,055
- He's Chih En, right? - Originally...

1060
00:52:16,285 --> 00:52:17,425
So handsome.

1061
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:20,425
His face is so small. He's handsome.

1062
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:22,995
He's handsome.

1063
00:52:22,996 --> 00:52:26,034
(This boy caught everyone's attention.)

1064
00:52:26,035 --> 00:52:29,433
In August, 2021, I came
here for the 1st time.

1065
00:52:29,434 --> 00:52:30,934
- To Korea? - Yes.

1066
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:35,233
(What kind of idol does
Chih En dream of becoming?)

1067
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:37,904
I used to get energy...

1068
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,814
from watching K-pop.

1069
00:52:40,374 --> 00:52:42,544
If I get to debut,

1070
00:52:42,984 --> 00:52:44,314
I want to become an artist...

1071
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:47,754
who can give people energy.

1072
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:50,983
I'm not a perfect artist yet.

1073
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:54,055
I know I need to improve on
both my dancing and singing,

1074
00:52:54,225 --> 00:52:57,894
so I put in a lot of effort
to find my own charms.

1075
00:52:58,464 --> 00:52:59,535
So people can...

1076
00:53:00,265 --> 00:53:01,334
Oh, gosh.

1077
00:53:01,695 --> 00:53:02,733
Oh, gosh.

1078
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:04,634
So people can fall for me.

1079
00:53:04,635 --> 00:53:05,864
(Feeling shy about saying it)

1080
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:07,204
I want to be that kind of idol.

1081
00:53:07,205 --> 00:53:09,273
(Shy)

1082
00:53:09,274 --> 00:53:10,804
I'm doing...

1083
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:11,873
(Shy)

1084
00:53:11,874 --> 00:53:13,774
I'm doing my best.

1085
00:53:14,544 --> 00:53:15,615
So I would...

1086
00:53:16,615 --> 00:53:19,015
appreciate it if you looked forward to me.

1087
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:22,484
Chih En.

1088
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,885
Kairi.

1089
00:53:25,325 --> 00:53:27,624
Eito. Bae Jae Ho.

1090
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:29,624
Kim Joo Hyoung.

1091
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:31,225
And Sirin, everyone.

1092
00:53:32,095 --> 00:53:34,234
- Two, three. Hello! - Hello!

1093
00:53:34,995 --> 00:53:36,603
We're Universe League,

1094
00:53:36,604 --> 00:53:38,433
- Group "S-Class!" - Group "S-Class!"

1095
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:40,135
- Group "S-Class!" - Group "S-Class!"

1096
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:41,434
(Shaking)

1097
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:42,575
We are in your care.

1098
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:43,905
(They're cute.)

1099
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,445
Gosh. "S-Class" by Stray Kids is difficult.

1100
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,213
Energy is our strength.

1101
00:53:50,214 --> 00:53:52,483
This is our introduction!

1102
00:53:52,484 --> 00:53:54,584
- We're special! - We're special!

1103
00:53:54,785 --> 00:53:56,425
Let's go!

1104
00:53:57,854 --> 00:53:59,354
- My goodness. - Let's go.

1105
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:04,064
Universe League, are you ready?

1106
00:54:08,064 --> 00:54:12,234
I want to show you my
infinite potential. Yes.

1107
00:54:12,604 --> 00:54:17,144
I’ll show you all of my
potential in this stage.

1108
00:54:19,774 --> 00:54:20,874
They're cool.

1109
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,615
Ready? Go.

1110
00:54:32,484 --> 00:54:39,164
("S-Class" by Bae Jae Ho, Chih
En, Eito, Kairi, Kim Joo Hyoung, Sirin)

1111
00:54:47,175 --> 00:54:48,205
What was that?

1112
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:10,254
Their live performance is so good!

1113
00:55:22,675 --> 00:55:23,905
My goodness. They're good.

1114
00:56:20,934 --> 00:56:22,365
Hey!

1115
00:56:23,104 --> 00:56:24,635
Hey!

1116
00:56:53,434 --> 00:56:54,734
They're so good.

1117
00:56:56,265 --> 00:56:57,365
My goodness.

1118
00:56:58,205 --> 00:56:59,305
This is difficult.

1119
00:57:00,604 --> 00:57:02,174
I like him.

1120
00:57:02,175 --> 00:57:03,373
Yes, he's good.

1121
00:57:03,374 --> 00:57:04,444
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1122
00:57:04,445 --> 00:57:05,844
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1123
00:57:05,845 --> 00:57:07,614
He can be the center.

1124
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:10,615
Directors, how was the performance?

1125
00:57:11,214 --> 00:57:14,184
Watching a bright and
cheerful performance earlier,

1126
00:57:14,555 --> 00:57:16,853
and now seeing a powerful stage,

1127
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:20,624
the contrast made it
feel even more intense.

1128
00:57:21,524 --> 00:57:23,264
Everyone is good at live performance.

1129
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:24,265
He's right.

1130
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:25,925
So...

1131
00:57:26,695 --> 00:57:30,804
I think it would be difficult
to choose from this group.

1132
00:57:30,805 --> 00:57:32,234
(Deeply moved)

1133
00:57:32,434 --> 00:57:34,103
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1134
00:57:34,104 --> 00:57:35,781
(They are praised for their stable vocals.)

1135
00:57:35,805 --> 00:57:36,844
(Envious)

1136
00:57:36,845 --> 00:57:39,474
On this stage, Sirin...

1137
00:57:39,475 --> 00:57:41,015
Did I pronounce it correctly? Yes.

1138
00:57:41,615 --> 00:57:43,483
It was obvious that you had great talent.

1139
00:57:43,484 --> 00:57:45,913
Even though it was a group choreography,

1140
00:57:45,914 --> 00:57:48,814
you fully showcased your own charm.

1141
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:52,054
- You were cool. - Thank you.

1142
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:53,694
- Thank you. - Thank you!

1143
00:57:53,695 --> 00:57:55,725
- Thank you. - Thank you!

1144
00:57:55,995 --> 00:57:59,063
Surprisingly, it was my first time...

1145
00:57:59,064 --> 00:58:01,865
seeing Chih En.

1146
00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:04,734
And I found myself constantly drawn to him.

1147
00:58:04,934 --> 00:58:05,934
He was...

1148
00:58:05,934 --> 00:58:06,934
(Grinning)

1149
00:58:07,175 --> 00:58:10,474
- I found myself constantly drawn...
- We cross paths again.

1150
00:58:10,475 --> 00:58:11,675
Why do we have the same taste?

1151
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:15,514
(TEAM BEAT was interested in one person.)

1152
00:58:15,515 --> 00:58:16,515
Chih En.

1153
00:58:16,516 --> 00:58:18,483
(TEAM BEAT was interested in one person.)

1154
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:19,884
He's the third person there, right?

1155
00:58:22,714 --> 00:58:24,354
Yes, you're right.

1156
00:58:24,725 --> 00:58:26,554
(His First Pick in his heart, )

1157
00:58:26,555 --> 00:58:28,595
(Chih En)

1158
00:58:28,995 --> 00:58:30,064
It's...

1159
00:58:30,765 --> 00:58:32,864
your aura.

1160
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:35,765
Or maybe, it’s your
star quality. I'm not sure.

1161
00:58:36,234 --> 00:58:38,104
But you constantly had my attention.

1162
00:58:39,035 --> 00:58:40,104
Thank you.

1163
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:44,845
(Feeling nervous)

1164
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:50,814
I'll give you 60 seconds from now.

1165
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:53,753
Directors, within one minute,

1166
00:58:53,754 --> 00:58:57,424
choose a First Pick starting player.

1167
00:58:57,425 --> 00:58:58,425
(The directors will choose
their 1st Pick in 60 seconds.)

1168
00:58:58,426 --> 00:59:00,354
If two teams choose the same person,

1169
00:59:00,894 --> 00:59:05,064
the decision of which team
to join will be up to the player.

1170
00:59:05,365 --> 00:59:06,365
Gosh.

1171
00:59:06,535 --> 00:59:08,095
This is the most nerve-racking part.

1172
00:59:08,664 --> 00:59:11,305
Please pick your starting players.

1173
00:59:14,604 --> 00:59:16,233
I'll give you 60 seconds.

1174
00:59:16,234 --> 00:59:18,274
- This isn't easy.
- I don't know about this.

1175
00:59:18,745 --> 00:59:20,345
- But we need to choose wisely. - But...

1176
00:59:20,714 --> 00:59:23,244
But he is...

1177
00:59:23,245 --> 00:59:26,014
- Right. - But I think...

1178
00:59:26,015 --> 00:59:27,483
he was more visible.

1179
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:29,583
Because these two are similar.

1180
00:59:29,584 --> 00:59:31,583
Their vibes are.

1181
00:59:31,584 --> 00:59:36,624
(Their First Picks are different.)

1182
00:59:37,064 --> 00:59:38,663
- This is driving me crazy.
- Please pick...

1183
00:59:38,664 --> 00:59:40,434
- your starting players. - This is...

1184
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:42,764
Shall we try to pick him?

1185
00:59:42,765 --> 00:59:43,933
(Yes.)

1186
00:59:43,934 --> 00:59:45,864
- This person? Okay. - Yes.

1187
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:47,905
- We should just try first. - Okay.

1188
00:59:50,245 --> 00:59:51,304
Okay.

1189
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:53,221
(His eyes look anxious even
though he sounded brave.)

1190
00:59:53,245 --> 00:59:55,614
(TEAM GROOVE looks peaceful.)

1191
00:59:55,615 --> 00:59:58,245
(Staring intently)

1192
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:03,955
(Who is he looking at?)

1193
01:00:08,195 --> 01:00:13,594
(The intense deliberation
felt through his hands)

1194
01:00:13,595 --> 01:00:16,064
My heartbeat...

1195
01:00:16,394 --> 01:00:19,234
I could hear my own heartbeat.

1196
01:00:19,734 --> 01:00:22,635
I wished my name to be called.

1197
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:27,644
Everyone. The time to
choose is almost over.

1198
01:00:28,144 --> 01:00:33,015
Five, four, three, two, one!

1199
01:00:33,984 --> 01:00:35,213
(Nomination complete)

1200
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,124
The First Pick nomination is completed.

1201
01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:40,201
- The First Pick nomination...
- I think we chose the same person.

1202
01:00:40,225 --> 01:00:41,854
Is completed.

1203
01:00:42,254 --> 01:00:44,095
Directors, do you think...

1204
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:46,535
you chose the same First Pick again?

1205
01:00:47,334 --> 01:00:49,333
- Yes. - Oh, is that so?

1206
01:00:49,334 --> 01:00:51,564
I think so too.

1207
01:00:52,205 --> 01:00:54,204
(Did they choose the
same First Pick again?)

1208
01:00:54,205 --> 01:00:55,634
- I see. - Oh, is that so?

1209
01:00:55,635 --> 01:00:58,844
This will be fun.

1210
01:00:58,845 --> 01:01:00,143
I don't think I chose the same person.

1211
01:01:00,144 --> 01:01:01,844
(Lee Chang Sub)

1212
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:03,313
(His taste is unique.)

1213
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:04,913
- TEAM GROOVE is definite. - Yes.

1214
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:06,584
Chang Sub is definite.

1215
01:01:06,854 --> 01:01:08,894
Yes, I don't think I chose
the same person as them.

1216
01:01:09,555 --> 01:01:12,253
Okay. Now, we'll reveal...

1217
01:01:12,254 --> 01:01:14,794
the results.

1218
01:01:18,765 --> 01:01:21,793
He keeps looking at us.

1219
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:23,334
(Is this a green light?)

1220
01:01:25,104 --> 01:01:27,704
We'll reveal TEAM BEAT's First Pick.

1221
01:01:27,705 --> 01:01:32,604
(TEAM BEAT reveals its First Pick.)

1222
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:38,044
(Chih En)

1223
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:42,854
TEAM BEAT chose Chih En!

1224
01:01:43,984 --> 01:01:45,055
I knew it.

1225
01:01:46,794 --> 01:01:47,854
Chih En!

1226
01:01:51,765 --> 01:01:52,964
Yes, sir.

1227
01:01:53,195 --> 01:01:56,293
We'll reveal TEAM GROOVE's First Pick.

1228
01:01:56,294 --> 01:01:58,003
(Who did TEAM GROOVE choose?)

1229
01:01:58,004 --> 01:02:01,934
(First Pick, BEAT, Chih En)

1230
01:02:03,575 --> 01:02:06,043
(Kim Joo Hyoung)

1231
01:02:06,044 --> 01:02:08,974
Kim Joo Hyoung is picked.

1232
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,083
Congratulations.

1233
01:02:10,084 --> 01:02:12,124
(First Pick, GROOVE, Kim
Joo Hyoung, BEAT, Chih En)

1234
01:02:12,484 --> 01:02:13,484
We didn't cross paths.

1235
01:02:13,485 --> 01:02:15,685
- I knew he would pick differently.
- Kim Joo Hyoung...

1236
01:02:16,785 --> 01:02:18,225
He's a great dancer.

1237
01:02:18,425 --> 01:02:21,655
He has a good voice too.
That's why I chose him.

1238
01:02:22,055 --> 01:02:23,124
Congratulations.

1239
01:02:23,464 --> 01:02:25,425
Now, this is the highlight.

1240
01:02:25,894 --> 01:02:28,964
We'll check the last First Pick.

1241
01:02:29,794 --> 01:02:31,933
We'll reveal TEAM RHYTHM's First Pick.

1242

(First Pick, GROOVE, Kim
Joo Hyoung, BEAT, Chih En)

1243
01:02:33,535 --> 01:02:36,175
(Sirin was praised for
his good expression.)

1244
01:02:36,774 --> 01:02:39,175
(Chih En grabbed attention
from the start and throughout.)

1245
01:02:39,874 --> 01:02:42,245
(Kim Joo Hyoung was picked by TEAM GROOVE.)

1246
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:46,015
Who did they choose?

1247
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:53,495
(Sirin)

1248
01:02:54,195 --> 01:02:57,695
- TEAM RHYTHM picked... - Thank you.

1249
01:02:57,995 --> 01:02:59,893
Sirin as their starting
player. Congratulations.

1250
01:02:59,894 --> 01:03:00,963
(They picked Sirin who was
praised highly by YANGYANG.)

1251
01:03:00,964 --> 01:03:02,134
Congratulations.

1252
01:03:02,135 --> 01:03:03,705
(Very satisfied)

1253
01:03:04,104 --> 01:03:06,873
All three teams successfully...

1254
01:03:06,874 --> 01:03:08,705
scouted their starting player.

1255
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:10,043
Yes.

1256

(Draft Starting Lineup:
Zen Zen, Kim Joo Hyoung)

1257
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:13,714
(Draft Starting Lineup: An Yul, Chih En)

1258
01:03:14,475 --> 01:03:15,543
Welcome.

1259
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:16,614
(Chih En)

1260
01:03:16,615 --> 01:03:17,684
Come on.

1261
01:03:18,615 --> 01:03:20,284
You're good-looking.

1262
01:03:20,285 --> 01:03:22,214
- Good work. Yes. - Thank you.

1263
01:03:23,455 --> 01:03:26,124
- They're like our kids already. - Exactly.

1264
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:28,555
- I guess this is how fathers feel.
- Right.

1265
01:03:29,124 --> 01:03:31,063
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1266
01:03:31,064 --> 01:03:32,495
- Hello. - Hello.

1267
01:03:34,195 --> 01:03:35,265
(Sirin: Hello.)

1268
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:39,305
The second starting player spots...

1269
01:03:39,405 --> 01:03:40,405
are filled for all teams.

1270
01:03:40,406 --> 01:03:42,034
(The second draft ended peacefully.)

1271
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:43,035
Nice to meet you.

1272
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:46,104
I think this is the start, and not the end.

1273
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:48,144
I want to improve more...

1274
01:03:48,814 --> 01:03:52,813
and secure my seat as a starting player...

1275
01:03:52,814 --> 01:03:54,584
until my debut.

1276
01:03:55,515 --> 01:03:58,684
(Unlike the starting players
thinking about their future, )

1277
01:03:59,725 --> 01:04:03,225
(the players on the bench only
have regrets of not doing better.)

1278
01:04:04,164 --> 01:04:07,694
(Two different atmospheres in one area)

1279
01:04:07,695 --> 01:04:10,205
This group's song itself is its concept.

1280
01:04:10,964 --> 01:04:12,204
(Concept)

1281
01:04:12,205 --> 01:04:14,135
- What is it? - So...

1282
01:04:14,374 --> 01:04:17,075
It's "Love Shot" by EXO.

1283
01:04:17,305 --> 01:04:19,675
- "Love Shot!" - My goodness.

1284
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:21,475
"Love Shot!"

1285
01:04:22,075 --> 01:04:24,384
("Love Shot" by EXO: A song
that emphasizes powerful...)

1286
01:04:24,385 --> 01:04:28,055
(and captivating charms
with a restrained sexiness.)

1287
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,654
(I know this song very well.)

1288
01:04:30,655 --> 01:04:34,124
EXO is your senior.
You'll know this song well.

1289
01:04:34,524 --> 01:04:35,595
It's quite sexy.

1290
01:04:36,124 --> 01:04:37,124
- Sexy? - It's sexy.

1291
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,925
It's sexy and powerful.

1292
01:04:39,024 --> 01:04:40,195
- Powerful. - Yes.

1293
01:04:40,894 --> 01:04:43,464
First of all, EXO members...

1294
01:04:43,734 --> 01:04:47,575
performed this song very
well, so it's difficult to remake it.

1295
01:04:47,774 --> 01:04:49,374
- Yes. - He's right.

1296
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:53,305
So I'm worried, but I hope they do well.

1297
01:04:53,544 --> 01:04:55,464
I'm looking forward to
seeing their performance.

1298
01:04:55,575 --> 01:04:56,675
Yes, sir.

1299
01:04:56,984 --> 01:05:00,014
Group "Love Shot" that will
showcase their sexiness in suits...

1300
01:05:00,015 --> 01:05:01,455
with model-like physiques.

1301
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,624
Let's see them now!

1302
01:05:07,995 --> 01:05:09,294
I'll debut...

1303
01:05:09,894 --> 01:05:12,124
and become the Asian Prince.

1304
01:05:12,964 --> 01:05:14,495
Especially in choreography.

1305
01:05:15,035 --> 01:05:17,805
I've spent so much time
on it that I can't do bad.

1306
01:05:18,464 --> 01:05:19,864
I'll show you.

1307
01:05:19,865 --> 01:05:21,785
(Less talk, more action.
(I’ll prove it onstage.)

1308
01:05:23,175 --> 01:05:24,874
- Let's go. - Yes!

1309
01:05:26,845 --> 01:05:28,614
(They make a powerful
entrance in sharp suits.)

1310
01:05:28,615 --> 01:05:29,615
They look amazing.

1311
01:05:30,615 --> 01:05:32,314
Oh, suits.

1312
01:05:32,814 --> 01:05:33,914
You look amazing.

1313
01:05:35,084 --> 01:05:36,854
"Love Shot" is famous for the suit.

1314
01:05:37,524 --> 01:05:38,764
My goodness. The white uniform.

1315
01:05:39,655 --> 01:05:42,425
- They're so tall. - They look amazing.

1316
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:45,095
Being tall makes it feel different.

1317
01:05:48,334 --> 01:05:49,834
- You look amazing. - Let's go!

1318
01:05:50,805 --> 01:05:52,705
(Looking carefully)

1319
01:05:53,064 --> 01:05:54,075
Zhang Shuaibo.

1320
01:05:57,544 --> 01:05:58,544
Oh, okay.

1321
01:05:59,305 --> 01:06:00,314
Li Zhiwei!

1322
01:06:01,845 --> 01:06:02,874
Park Ji Hoon.

1323
01:06:04,515 --> 01:06:05,515
Hiroto.

1324
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:07,714
Jin Ziming.

1325
01:06:09,385 --> 01:06:10,684
Jang Kyung Ho.

1326
01:06:11,385 --> 01:06:14,695
He did a lot of things too.

1327
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:20,293
Universe League, are you ready?

1328
01:06:20,294 --> 01:06:24,035
- Yes! - Yes!

1329
01:06:24,405 --> 01:06:26,305
Two, three. We got this!

1330
01:06:26,405 --> 01:06:27,805
- "Love Shot!" - "Love Shot!"

1331
01:06:31,504 --> 01:06:34,874
I'll do my best and debut.

1332
01:06:36,615 --> 01:06:38,484
I'm going to make it. I can do it.

1333
01:06:39,084 --> 01:06:40,854
The results will be good.

1334
01:06:42,684 --> 01:06:43,684
I feel weird.

1335
01:06:50,825 --> 01:06:52,795
Ready? Go.

1336
01:06:57,234 --> 01:07:00,404
("Love Shot" by Hiroto, Li Zhiwei,
Zhang Shuaibo, Jang Kyung Ho, )

1337
01:07:00,405 --> 01:07:02,035
(Park Ji Hoon, Jin Zi Ming)

1338
01:09:23,045 --> 01:09:24,843
- Yes! - Zhang Shuaibo!

1339
01:09:24,844 --> 01:09:26,344
They were Group "Love Shot."

1340
01:09:27,415 --> 01:09:28,495
- "Love Shot." - Thank you!

1341
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:36,554
(The directors with unreadable expressions)

1342
01:09:37,665 --> 01:09:39,965
(Reading the room)

1343
01:09:41,835 --> 01:09:43,195
Oh, gosh.

1344
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:51,274
(Reading the room)

1345
01:09:51,275 --> 01:09:54,313
I think everyone is shocked.

1346
01:09:54,314 --> 01:09:56,144
Directors, how was the performance?

1347
01:09:56,974 --> 01:09:57,984
Well...

1348
01:09:58,314 --> 01:10:00,785
(Director TEN is speechless.)

1349
01:10:03,255 --> 01:10:05,824
I think "Love Shot" has...

1350
01:10:05,825 --> 01:10:07,294
the potential to craft...

1351
01:10:07,295 --> 01:10:10,464
a flashy stage when used effectively.

1352
01:10:10,465 --> 01:10:13,294
So I was looking forward to this stage.

1353
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:14,295
But...

1354
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:19,165
this performance feels slightly lacking.

1355
01:10:20,005 --> 01:10:21,674
(Gulping)

1356
01:10:24,604 --> 01:10:26,643
At the start, it had an impact,

1357
01:10:26,644 --> 01:10:28,973
and it was dynamic, which was good.

1358
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,644
But I felt that the dynamics
slowly disappeared toward the end.

1359
01:10:34,054 --> 01:10:39,125
(The opening was impactful and intense.)

1360
01:10:41,354 --> 01:10:43,295
(But as the performance went on, )

1361
01:10:43,995 --> 01:10:46,763
(the movements became slightly offbeat, )

1362
01:10:46,764 --> 01:10:49,393
(the choreography didn’t quite match, )

1363
01:10:49,394 --> 01:10:51,835
(and the exaggerated facial expressions...)

1364
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:56,974
(made the energy fade, turning
the stage increasingly dull.)

1365
01:10:57,505 --> 01:11:00,814
I think we all felt the same.

1366
01:11:01,144 --> 01:11:04,344
The performance needs to keep us focused.

1367
01:11:04,445 --> 01:11:08,115
But it felt like each player
was focused on his own parts.

1368
01:11:08,585 --> 01:11:10,684
You went, "Now, it's
time for the dance break."

1369
01:11:10,955 --> 01:11:14,023
I couldn't feel any emotions.

1370
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:15,295
That's how we felt.

1371
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:16,594
Yes. That's it.

1372
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:21,535
(The first harsh critique
heard during the draft stage.)

1373
01:11:21,934 --> 01:11:25,965
It's my responsibility that
our team received criticism.

1374
01:11:26,734 --> 01:11:28,734
As I was the leader,

1375
01:11:29,674 --> 01:11:31,804
I couldn't show or appeal...

1376
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,574
my own charms.

1377
01:11:35,575 --> 01:11:39,484
It ended just like that, highlighting
the group's weaknesses.

1378
01:11:40,514 --> 01:11:42,854
That was the most stressful part.

1379
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:47,455
Oh, okay. So today...

1380
01:11:47,955 --> 01:11:51,295
This stage received some criticism.

1381
01:11:51,764 --> 01:11:54,594
Do you still have players
that you want to pick despite it?

1382
01:11:55,264 --> 01:11:56,264
Yes.

1383
01:11:57,665 --> 01:11:58,934
- You do? - Yes.

1384
01:11:59,365 --> 01:12:02,134
- Someone did draw my attention. - I see.

1385
01:12:04,104 --> 01:12:06,045
I would need to think further.

1386
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:10,374
I'll give you all one minute from now.

1387
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,414
I'll give you 60 seconds.

1388
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:13,484
Please nominate your players.

1389
01:12:17,825 --> 01:12:19,023
(It's him, right?)

1390
01:12:19,024 --> 01:12:20,255
(Yes.)

1391
01:12:21,024 --> 01:12:24,724
(As soon as the countdown starts, )

1392
01:12:25,965 --> 01:12:26,965
Nice.

1393
01:12:26,966 --> 01:12:29,195
(two teams choose their First Pick.)

1394
01:12:39,545 --> 01:12:42,074
(TEAM BEAT is still thinking.)

1395
01:12:42,075 --> 01:12:44,884
- It was... - But he grabs attention too.

1396
01:12:45,184 --> 01:12:46,184
Yes.

1397
01:12:46,984 --> 01:12:49,384
His vocals weren't bad.

1398
01:12:50,085 --> 01:12:53,085
(Two players had a lot of vocal parts.)

1399
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:55,594
Honestly, this player...

1400
01:12:56,495 --> 01:12:58,495
lacks a bit of star quality.

1401
01:13:03,365 --> 01:13:05,064
Then shall we go with him?

1402
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,673
- But he's also... - This is hard.

1403
01:13:10,674 --> 01:13:11,843
I'd rather...

1404
01:13:11,844 --> 01:13:15,344
- listen to his vocals more. - Six, five,

1405
01:13:15,774 --> 01:13:17,445
- Oh, no. - four, three,

1406
01:13:17,745 --> 01:13:19,383
- Him? No, let's choose him. - two, one!

1407
01:13:19,384 --> 01:13:23,155
Everyone, the time is up.

1408
01:13:24,155 --> 01:13:25,155
- Now, - This is too difficult.

1409
01:13:25,156 --> 01:13:28,124
- It's okay. - let's see who they picked.

1410
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:29,625
I'm curious about their decision.

1411
01:13:30,354 --> 01:13:33,195
Name one charm about
the player of your choice.

1412
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:36,964
He knew where to keep
his gaze while performing.

1413
01:13:36,965 --> 01:13:38,445
He knew where to keep his gaze? Okay.

1414
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:41,473
There's something
prudent about his behavior.

1415
01:13:41,474 --> 01:13:42,604
He seems prudent.

1416
01:13:42,774 --> 01:13:45,445
I don't know anything about him
other than that he's good-looking.

1417
01:13:45,905 --> 01:13:47,774
- He's good-looking. - Gosh.

1418
01:13:48,274 --> 01:13:50,785
Okay. Then,

1419
01:13:51,144 --> 01:13:52,644
let us see the result.

1420
01:13:53,715 --> 01:13:56,955
Let us reveal TEAM GROOVE's First Pick.

1421
01:14:02,155 --> 01:14:04,995
There were no words that
could describe my feelings.

1422
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:07,495
I had never felt that nervous before...

1423
01:14:08,035 --> 01:14:09,894
in my life.

1424
01:14:10,764 --> 01:14:14,104
I didn't receive any positive feedback,

1425
01:14:14,304 --> 01:14:17,344
so all I could do was pray.

1426
01:14:18,804 --> 01:14:22,774
(Who is TEAM GROOVE's First Pick?)

1427
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:27,045
(Jang Kyung Ho)

1428
01:14:27,955 --> 01:14:29,154
(First Pick, GROOVE, Jang Kyung Ho)

1429
01:14:29,155 --> 01:14:30,924
TEAM GROOVE chose...

1430
01:14:31,424 --> 01:14:34,294
- Jang Kyung Ho. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1431
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:36,295
(First Pick, GROOVE, Jang Kyung Ho)

1432
01:14:36,795 --> 01:14:39,995
There seemed to be weight
to the way he carried himself.

1433
01:14:40,264 --> 01:14:42,665
He's older than the others as well,

1434
01:14:42,934 --> 01:14:44,864
so I thought my team...

1435
01:14:44,865 --> 01:14:47,505
would function well with
him as the eldest of the group.

1436
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:49,375
That's why I chose him.

1437
01:14:51,545 --> 01:14:52,575
Okay, next.

1438
01:14:53,075 --> 01:14:54,835
We'll reveal the First
Pick for TEAM RHYTHM.

1439
01:14:56,245 --> 01:14:58,383
(TEAM RHYTHM chose someone...)

1440
01:14:58,384 --> 01:15:01,955
(who knew where to keep
his gaze while performing.)

1441
01:15:02,514 --> 01:15:06,554
(Will their choice be the
same as TEAM GROOVE's?)

1442
01:15:08,094 --> 01:15:10,353
(Zhang Shuaibo)

1443
01:15:10,354 --> 01:15:11,423
(First Pick, GROOVE, Jang Kyung Ho)

1444
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,564
TEAM RHYTHM chooses...

1445
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:17,134
Zhang Shuaibo. Congratulations.

1446
01:15:17,165 --> 01:15:18,704
(Zhang Shuaibo won over TEAM RHYTHM...)

1447
01:15:18,705 --> 01:15:20,204
(with the way he held his gaze onstage.)

1448
01:15:20,205 --> 01:15:21,335
Zhang Shuaibo!

1449
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:22,934
(Smirking)

1450
01:15:26,505 --> 01:15:29,513
The two teams chose different players.

1451
01:15:29,514 --> 01:15:32,344
Lastly, let's check the First
Pick for TEAM BEAT. Let's go.

1452
01:15:33,045 --> 01:15:35,014
(They pondered until the very last second.)

1453
01:15:35,585 --> 01:15:37,784
(Their First Pick is someone
who is good-looking.)

1454
01:15:37,785 --> 01:15:39,683
Let's check the First Pick
for TEAM BEAT. Let's go.

1455
01:15:39,684 --> 01:15:40,854
(Nervous for some reason)

1456
01:15:41,625 --> 01:15:44,064
(Please don't pick the player I chose.)

1457
01:15:45,224 --> 01:15:48,665
(Who is TEAM BEAT's First Pick?)

1458
01:15:50,905 --> 01:15:53,404
(Park Ji Hun)

1459
01:15:53,405 --> 01:15:54,473
(First Pick, RHYTHM, Zhang
Shuaibo, GROOVE, Jang Kyung Ho)

1460
01:15:54,474 --> 01:15:56,934
Gosh. TEAM BEAT chooses...

1461
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,104
Park Ji Hun. Congratulations.

1462
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:02,215
Ji Hun.

1463
01:16:06,945 --> 01:16:09,483
The 1st round of drafts has
ended, and all 3 teams were able...

1464
01:16:09,484 --> 01:16:11,223
to welcome their First Picks.

1465
01:16:11,224 --> 01:16:12,683
- Is he good-looking? - Those chosen...

1466
01:16:12,684 --> 01:16:15,124
- will sit with their teammates.
- I'm suddenly on the fence.

1467
01:16:21,165 --> 01:16:23,465
I didn't expect it at all.

1468
01:16:24,665 --> 01:16:26,064
It felt...

1469
01:16:27,104 --> 01:16:28,604
really good,

1470
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:31,705
but I didn't know if I had
the right to be chosen.

1471
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:36,715
I only thought about
working harder from here.

1472
01:16:37,785 --> 01:16:39,983
(Draft Starting Lineup: Park Ji Hun)

1473
01:16:39,984 --> 01:16:41,983
(Draft Starting Lineup: Jang Kyung Ho)

1474
01:16:41,984 --> 01:16:44,825
(Draft Starting Lineup: Zhang Shuaibo)

1475
01:16:45,325 --> 01:16:47,724
(Zhang Shuaibo runs to the team's dugout)

1476
01:16:48,024 --> 01:16:50,864
- Hi. - Hi. Thank you.

1477
01:16:50,865 --> 01:16:51,894
Good luck.

1478
01:16:53,295 --> 01:16:56,394
- I'm over the moon. - You were amazing.

1479
01:16:59,304 --> 01:17:00,365
Good job.

1480
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:03,604
- Bring it in. Let's work hard.
- Thank you.

1481
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:07,303
- Thank you. - You did great.

1482
01:17:07,304 --> 01:17:10,343
- Can I get a fist bump too?
- You did a good job.

1483
01:17:10,344 --> 01:17:11,884
- Good job, guys. - Thank you.

1484
01:17:13,615 --> 01:17:17,354
(He finally gets to wear the team jersey.)

1485
01:17:17,684 --> 01:17:20,625
It gave me hope that I could get up...

1486
01:17:20,755 --> 01:17:22,125
on the stage again.

1487
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:25,194
I have a greater desire to debut.

1488
01:17:25,195 --> 01:17:26,540
(I'm more determined than ever to debut.)

1489
01:17:26,564 --> 01:17:29,365
I won't be satisfied with
what I accomplished today.

1490
01:17:29,734 --> 01:17:33,405
I will keep this spot...

1491
01:17:33,535 --> 01:17:36,575
and keep on moving up the ladder.

1492
01:17:37,075 --> 01:17:40,474
Each team has three starting players.

1493
01:17:41,045 --> 01:17:43,274
There are now only four slots left...

1494
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:45,415
in each team.

1495
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:49,655
We will now continue...

1496
01:17:49,884 --> 01:17:51,354
today's cutthroat draft.

1497
01:18:01,564 --> 01:18:03,995
I will come out on top, no matter what.

1498
01:18:04,465 --> 01:18:07,505
I will debut, so watch me do it.

1499
01:18:07,905 --> 01:18:10,474
I will bring down the
Universe League stage.

1500
01:18:13,304 --> 01:18:16,114
- I can't wait. - Nice!

1501
01:18:16,115 --> 01:18:17,174
Looking good.

1502
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:20,445
Look how handsome he is.
Wait, they're all handsome.

1503
01:18:21,215 --> 01:18:23,054
You all look great.

1504
01:18:29,594 --> 01:18:32,594
It's my goal to be
known as an all-rounder...

1505
01:18:32,924 --> 01:18:34,465
and be acknowledged by everyone.

1506
01:18:34,634 --> 01:18:37,804
I will debut, so watch me do it.

1507
01:18:39,234 --> 01:18:40,264
Kenta.

1508
01:18:42,575 --> 01:18:43,575
Gosh.

1509
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:45,545
Kwon Hee Jun.

1510
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:48,375
Kim Dae Yun.

1511
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:50,415
Keum Jin Ho.

1512
01:18:51,014 --> 01:18:52,045
Royce.

1513
01:18:52,844 --> 01:18:55,155
- And Kim Gi Joong. - Kim Gi Joong.

1514
01:18:55,984 --> 01:18:57,344
They're dressed in military green.

1515
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:03,794
Hello, I'm Sergeant Kim.

1516
01:19:03,795 --> 01:19:05,093
(Kim Dae Yun, Nickname: Sergeant Kim)

1517
01:19:05,094 --> 01:19:07,054
I was only recently
discharged from the military.

1518
01:19:07,424 --> 01:19:09,894
Ever since I was a kid,
I idolized K-pop idols.

1519
01:19:10,064 --> 01:19:12,934
Thank you for granting me
this incredible opportunity.

1520
01:19:13,134 --> 01:19:14,734
- You've completed your service? - Yes.

1521
01:19:15,104 --> 01:19:16,535
It's only been two weeks.

1522
01:19:16,934 --> 01:19:19,773
That must be why your hair is still short.

1523
01:19:19,774 --> 01:19:21,144
- Yes. - I see.

1524
01:19:21,245 --> 01:19:24,075
To be honest, I consider
myself to have been reborn...

1525
01:19:24,545 --> 01:19:25,643
after my time in the military.

1526
01:19:25,644 --> 01:19:28,983
I'll work hard, thinking
that it's do or die for me.

1527
01:19:28,984 --> 01:19:30,853
(He was reborn after
serving in the military.)

1528
01:19:30,854 --> 01:19:33,523
Can you face the camera?

1529
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:35,795
(Seeing how he looks on camera)

1530
01:19:36,394 --> 01:19:38,824
- Are you trying to lose weight?
- Yes, I'm on it.

1531
01:19:38,825 --> 01:19:39,825
Is that so?

1532
01:19:40,695 --> 01:19:41,964
I gained a lot of weight
while in the military.

1533
01:19:41,965 --> 01:19:43,593
You were only discharged in June.

1534
01:19:43,594 --> 01:19:44,665
Right.

1535
01:19:45,134 --> 01:19:47,264
I just weighed myself, and it said 81kg.

1536
01:19:48,405 --> 01:19:50,375
I'll drop down to 74.

1537
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:54,144
- We met at the meeting. - That's right.

1538
01:19:54,445 --> 01:19:55,513
(It's good to see you.)

1539
01:19:55,514 --> 01:19:57,114
- I didn't expect this. - Neither did I.

1540
01:19:57,684 --> 01:19:59,284
- Salute. - Hold on.

1541
01:19:59,285 --> 01:20:01,455
(Salute)

1542
01:20:02,554 --> 01:20:04,034
I also completed my military service.

1543
01:20:04,684 --> 01:20:06,784
(They didn't expect to
have that in common!)

1544
01:20:06,785 --> 01:20:08,093
(The three men entered the competition...)

1545
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:10,023
(to chase their dreams after
completing their military service.)

1546
01:20:10,024 --> 01:20:12,464
I am here to compete,

1547
01:20:12,465 --> 01:20:14,695
thinking that this is my last chance,

1548
01:20:14,894 --> 01:20:16,254
so I'll work until my body breaks.

1549
01:20:20,835 --> 01:20:23,374
It's been three years
since I performed onstage.

1550
01:20:23,375 --> 01:20:26,375
I wanted to show them
how much I've improved.

1551
01:20:27,174 --> 01:20:28,444
I'll perform with the determination...

1552
01:20:28,445 --> 01:20:30,314
to go to the military
if I don't get to debut.

1553
01:20:31,884 --> 01:20:35,284
- Are you ready? - Yes!

1554
01:20:35,285 --> 01:20:36,553
- Go for it. - Let's do this.

1555
01:20:36,554 --> 01:20:37,615
Let's go.

1556
01:20:41,854 --> 01:20:42,854
Ready?

1557
01:20:43,424 --> 01:20:44,495
Go.

1558
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:50,864
("BOOMERANG" by Kenta, Keum Jin Ho, )

1559
01:20:50,865 --> 01:20:52,965
(Kim Dae Yun, Kim Gi
Joong, Kwon Hee Jun, Royce)

1560
01:22:14,585 --> 01:22:17,585
Yes, sir. That was Group "BOOMERANG."

1561
01:22:18,384 --> 01:22:19,554
And now...

1562
01:22:19,755 --> 01:22:22,724
Yes, sir. That was Group "BOOMERANG."

1563
01:22:23,495 --> 01:22:24,564
And now...

1564
01:22:25,394 --> 01:22:26,465
This is a tough one.

1565
01:22:30,965 --> 01:22:35,173
(They're panting harder than anyone else.)

1566
01:22:35,174 --> 01:22:39,445
(They're panting harder than anyone else.)

1567
01:22:40,804 --> 01:22:44,344
In my opinion, this
performance demonstrated...

1568
01:22:44,615 --> 01:22:47,445
how your experience could work against you.

1569
01:22:51,484 --> 01:22:53,585
You were losing your cool,

1570
01:22:53,984 --> 01:22:55,554
and there was too much power.

1571
01:22:56,155 --> 01:22:58,593
With confidence and experience,

1572
01:22:58,594 --> 01:23:00,364
we're able to understand...

1573
01:23:00,365 --> 01:23:03,495
and control ourselves when performing.

1574
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:07,365
However, I believe
you took it a bit too far.

1575
01:23:10,674 --> 01:23:12,374
You hit every move too hard,

1576
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:14,844
which was why the moves...

1577
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:17,045
weren't to the beat.

1578
01:23:19,684 --> 01:23:22,554
The energy level was
constantly at 100 percent,

1579
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:25,034
so if you were to perform the entire song,

1580
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:27,785
you would've had to give up midway.

1581
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:31,565
- What should we do? - Experience...

1582
01:23:32,165 --> 01:23:33,894
(Pondering)

1583
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:36,534
I wanted to make an impression,

1584
01:23:36,535 --> 01:23:39,064
and leaving an impression
was all we thought about.

1585
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:42,334
That had us going over the top,

1586
01:23:42,335 --> 01:23:44,035
which probably hurt us.

1587
01:23:45,445 --> 01:23:47,473
I thought about how I lacked.

1588
01:23:47,474 --> 01:23:49,574
It was my first time performing on a stage,

1589
01:23:49,575 --> 01:23:51,044
so I wasn't able to relax.

1590
01:23:51,045 --> 01:23:53,245
I told myself not to get my hopes up.

1591
01:23:54,984 --> 01:23:58,955
Let us reveal the First
Pick for TEAM GROOVE.

1592
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:06,923
(Who did TEAM GROOVE
choose as its First Pick?)

1593
01:24:06,924 --> 01:24:08,804
(Who did TEAM GROOVE
choose as its First Pick?)

1594
01:24:10,335 --> 01:24:13,034
(Kenta)

1595
01:24:13,035 --> 01:24:15,633
(First Pick, GROOVE, Kenta)

1596
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,405
Gosh. TEAM GROOVE...

1597
01:24:17,734 --> 01:24:19,944
chose Kenta to join the team.

1598
01:24:19,945 --> 01:24:21,143
Congratulations.

1599
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:22,615
(First Pick, GROOVE, Kenta)

1600
01:24:23,215 --> 01:24:24,644
I could only see him.

1601
01:24:24,814 --> 01:24:27,183
I guess he has a face that I like.

1602
01:24:27,184 --> 01:24:29,554
His build is quite manly as well.

1603
01:24:33,484 --> 01:24:35,255
Here's the First Pick for TEAM BEAT.

1604
01:24:38,394 --> 01:24:41,264
(Keum Jin Ho)

1605
01:24:41,695 --> 01:24:44,335
- Thank you. - TEAM BEAT chooses...

1606
01:24:44,495 --> 01:24:47,404
Keum Jin Ho. Congratulations.

1607
01:24:47,405 --> 01:24:49,245
(First Pick, GROOVE,
Kenta, BEAT, Keum Jin Ho)

1608
01:24:49,535 --> 01:24:51,405
He stood out.

1609
01:24:54,245 --> 01:24:56,513
The 2 teams chose 2 different players.

1610
01:24:56,514 --> 01:24:59,384
Lastly, let us see the First
Pick for TEAM RHYTHM.

1611
01:25:00,915 --> 01:25:07,285
(Who's the First Pick for TEAM RHYTHM?)

1612
01:25:09,424 --> 01:25:11,424
(Royce)

1613
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:15,263
Gosh. Thank you so much.

1614
01:25:15,264 --> 01:25:17,094
(First Pick, RHYTHM, Royce)

1615
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:19,204
He was an all-rounder.

1616
01:25:19,205 --> 01:25:22,634
He was a decent dancer and singer.

1617
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:26,075
That's someone we needed on our team.

1618
01:25:26,774 --> 01:25:29,343
(Draft Starting Lineup: Royce)

1619
01:25:29,344 --> 01:25:31,914
(Draft Starting Lineup: Kenta)

1620
01:25:31,915 --> 01:25:34,584
(Draft Starting Lineup: Keum Jin Ho)

1621
01:25:34,585 --> 01:25:37,254
- What a relief. - Thanks.

1622
01:25:37,255 --> 01:25:38,255
(What a relief.)

1623
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:42,853
I'll work harder to be
a better performer...

1624
01:25:42,854 --> 01:25:45,165
and end up debuting.

1625
01:25:46,165 --> 01:25:47,964
(The 3 ex-soldiers are back on the bench.)

1626
01:25:47,965 --> 01:25:49,394
I could've done better.

1627
01:25:51,165 --> 01:25:53,634
The result really hurt me.

1628
01:25:53,905 --> 01:25:58,745
I didn't know I was that invisible.

1629
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:00,843
"Yes, this is a survival show."

1630
01:26:00,844 --> 01:26:03,344
It finally hit me that I was
competing in a survival show...

1631
01:26:03,715 --> 01:26:05,415
and that it was cruel.

1632
01:26:06,585 --> 01:26:08,454
We'll take a 30-minute break.

1633
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:10,354
- Good job, everyone. - Good job.

1634
01:26:10,884 --> 01:26:13,584
(Celebrating being picked with a song)

1635
01:26:13,585 --> 01:26:15,795
(A blue spark will fly on your beat)

1636
01:26:16,094 --> 01:26:17,723
Are you Kang...

1637
01:26:17,724 --> 01:26:21,165
- I'm Kim Joo Hyoung. - Kim Joo Hyoung.

1638
01:26:21,434 --> 01:26:22,695
Be honest with me.

1639
01:26:23,465 --> 01:26:26,733
Which team did you want to join?

1640
01:26:26,734 --> 01:26:27,763
Me?

1641
01:26:27,764 --> 01:26:28,804
(Taken aback)

1642
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:32,343
I... TEAM BEAT.

1643
01:26:32,344 --> 01:26:34,344
- Same here. - Really?

1644
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:37,945
- I don't really mind, though.
- Yes, exactly.

1645
01:26:39,014 --> 01:26:40,814
- Hello. - Hi.

1646
01:26:42,354 --> 01:26:44,314
Can I ask how old you are?

1647
01:26:44,615 --> 01:26:45,924
- Sorry? - How old are you?

1648
01:26:46,125 --> 01:26:47,354
My age?

1649
01:26:48,394 --> 01:26:50,495
- Are you 22? - Yes.

1650
01:26:51,325 --> 01:26:54,495
I'm 19, and he's 16.

1651
01:26:55,165 --> 01:26:56,563
Yes, I'm 16.

1652
01:26:56,564 --> 01:26:59,103
(Laughing)

1653
01:26:59,104 --> 01:27:00,165
No way.

1654
01:27:01,505 --> 01:27:06,445
(Things are awkward since
it's day 1 as teammates.)

1655
01:27:07,205 --> 01:27:10,274
(We'll slowly get to know each other.)

1656
01:27:11,245 --> 01:27:13,183
I want to go to the Jay Park team.

1657
01:27:13,184 --> 01:27:14,483
(Since he's on the bench
and not on any team)

1658
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:17,314
Jay Park's team is named Universe League.

1659
01:27:18,354 --> 01:27:19,423
We are the best.

1660
01:27:19,424 --> 01:27:20,554
(The birth of a new team?)

1661
01:27:21,594 --> 01:27:23,624
I'd give anything to
sit up there with them.

1662
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:24,723
(They're still waiting to perform.)

1663
01:27:24,724 --> 01:27:26,125
They don't have...

1664
01:27:26,924 --> 01:27:29,795
- to be worried anymore.
- Tell me about it.

1665
01:27:30,934 --> 01:27:35,134
(Those who haven't
performed yet are still nervous.)

1666
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,973
Is "little" better or
should I pronounce it "lil'?"

1667
01:27:36,974 --> 01:27:39,444
- Lil'? Little? - Little. Sure.

1668
01:27:39,445 --> 01:27:40,504
What should I wear?

1669
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,574
Let me choose one

1670
01:27:41,575 --> 01:27:43,874
Black is so simple,
matching colors stand out

1671
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:47,114
(Nationality doesn't matter when
it comes to advice for the stage.)

1672
01:27:47,115 --> 01:27:48,454
- Right. - What's better?

1673
01:27:48,455 --> 01:27:49,814
- "Little." - "Little?"

1674
01:27:50,314 --> 01:27:52,224
I want to sit there.

1675
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:55,795
(Listening)

1676
01:27:56,295 --> 01:27:57,494
Join TEAM BEAT.

1677
01:27:57,495 --> 01:28:00,023
(Pitching his team)

1678
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:01,325
I'll write you a good song.

1679
01:28:01,795 --> 01:28:03,665
(Amazed)

1680
01:28:04,165 --> 01:28:05,165
That's so cool.

1681
01:28:05,705 --> 01:28:07,705
We'll resume the shoot.

1682
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,034
Gosh, I'm nervous.

1683
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,315
(Which group will perform next?)

1684
01:28:11,474 --> 01:28:14,045
RHYTHM and BEAT.

1685
01:28:14,644 --> 01:28:16,273
It seems as though...

1686
01:28:16,274 --> 01:28:19,143
we should be choosing
the team we want to join.

1687
01:28:19,144 --> 01:28:20,214
That's right.

1688
01:28:20,215 --> 01:28:23,255
However, what matters
more is our personal color.

1689
01:28:24,014 --> 01:28:26,424
Hold on. Who here has warm undertones?

1690
01:28:27,054 --> 01:28:28,994
- Who has cool undertones? - Me.

1691
01:28:28,995 --> 01:28:30,194
Do you have a cool undertone?

1692
01:28:30,195 --> 01:28:31,564
What's your favorite color?

1693
01:28:32,424 --> 01:28:33,563
I want the best color.

1694
01:28:33,564 --> 01:28:34,694
Daisuke, take a seat.

1695
01:28:34,695 --> 01:28:36,164
Yes, sit.

1696
01:28:36,165 --> 01:28:37,365
- Daisuke, take a seat. - Sit.

1697
01:28:37,795 --> 01:28:39,675
This is how they determine
your personal color.

1698
01:28:41,035 --> 01:28:42,304
Do you see the difference?

1699
01:28:42,734 --> 01:28:44,334
Cha Woong Ki.

1700
01:28:44,335 --> 01:28:46,843
Even though we were
on set, he talked a lot...

1701
01:28:46,844 --> 01:28:48,843
so that it wouldn't be awkward for us.

1702
01:28:48,844 --> 01:28:51,245
I was able to learn how friendly he was.

1703
01:28:52,945 --> 01:28:56,214
Guys, let's... What is it again?

1704
01:28:56,215 --> 01:28:58,384
You need to show off
in front of the camera.

1705
01:28:58,524 --> 01:29:01,154
Think that the camera
should only be on you.

1706
01:29:01,155 --> 01:29:03,494
When you see a camera,
look straight into it.

1707
01:29:03,495 --> 01:29:05,664
That will guarantee a lot of airtime.

1708
01:29:05,665 --> 01:29:06,893
Hey, there.

1709
01:29:06,894 --> 01:29:09,194
I don’t care if the Universe League...

1710
01:29:09,195 --> 01:29:11,864
shortens my lifespan by years.

1711
01:29:11,865 --> 01:29:14,973
I'm doing my best and giving it my all.

1712
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:17,004
I want to show people...

1713
01:29:17,005 --> 01:29:20,674
that working hard can lead to success.

1714
01:29:23,974 --> 01:29:27,545
I know I can manage
whatever is thrown at me.

1715
01:29:28,884 --> 01:29:31,484
I'll do my best.

1716
01:29:32,424 --> 01:29:34,125
I think I can come out on top.

1717
01:29:35,854 --> 01:29:36,854
Yes!

1718
01:29:38,695 --> 01:29:40,695
- Let's do this. - You've got this.

1719
01:29:42,695 --> 01:29:43,795
Looking fresh, boys!

1720
01:29:45,705 --> 01:29:48,474
- They're in school uniforms.
- It's young and fresh.

1721
01:29:49,005 --> 01:29:50,633
- They look like students. - Yes, students.

1722
01:29:50,634 --> 01:29:51,803
They look adorable.

1723
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:53,144
- That's cute. - I know.

1724
01:29:53,245 --> 01:29:54,344
They're like baby chicks.

1725
01:29:54,915 --> 01:29:57,045
- They're like cute baby chicks.
- Right. In 2, 3.

1726
01:29:57,545 --> 01:29:58,615
He's 14.

1727
01:29:59,344 --> 01:30:01,214
(Who's the cute boy
that is like a baby chick?)

1728
01:30:01,215 --> 01:30:02,585
Daisuke.

1729
01:30:02,785 --> 01:30:05,254
He was just so adorable.

1730
01:30:05,255 --> 01:30:08,295
Daisuke is cute when he smiles.

1731
01:30:09,995 --> 01:30:11,354
Daisuke's my bias.

1732
01:30:11,924 --> 01:30:12,995
Daisuke, I like you.

1733
01:30:13,795 --> 01:30:14,825
Sorry about that.

1734
01:30:16,064 --> 01:30:18,234
Hello, I'm Daisuke.

1735
01:30:19,734 --> 01:30:23,704
I may be young, but I will show you...

1736
01:30:23,705 --> 01:30:26,644
how confident and powerful
this 14-year-old can be.

1737
01:30:27,804 --> 01:30:30,813
Guys, show me your love.

1738
01:30:30,814 --> 01:30:31,915
Bye.

1739
01:30:34,014 --> 01:30:35,183
Daisuke.

1740
01:30:35,184 --> 01:30:37,354
- He's adorable. - He's so cute.

1741
01:30:38,384 --> 01:30:39,484
Cha Woong Ki.

1742
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:41,184
Go, Woong Ki.

1743
01:30:43,495 --> 01:30:44,724
Xie Yuxin.

1744
01:30:45,125 --> 01:30:46,563
- Nice. - Ayumu.

1745
01:30:46,564 --> 01:30:48,394
- He's cute too. - Kang Jun Hyuk.

1746
01:30:48,695 --> 01:30:50,795
- Seo Jeong Woo. - Look how handsome he is!

1747
01:30:51,335 --> 01:30:52,835
He's really good-looking.

1748
01:30:54,064 --> 01:30:55,835
Jeong Woo... That face of his.

1749
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:57,473
He's pretty.

1750
01:30:57,474 --> 01:30:59,150
(A boy with a pretty smile
who catches your attention)

1751
01:30:59,174 --> 01:31:01,405
Hello, I'm Seo Jeong Woo.

1752
01:31:02,974 --> 01:31:04,344
How old are you?

1753
01:31:05,085 --> 01:31:06,085
I'm on the older side.

1754
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:07,245
- Really? - Yes.

1755
01:31:08,484 --> 01:31:09,784
I thought you were in high school.

1756
01:31:09,785 --> 01:31:11,014
- No way. - I mean that.

1757
01:31:11,384 --> 01:31:13,884
- I'm 24. - Really? No way.

1758
01:31:14,554 --> 01:31:16,854
(His adorable smile makes
you forget about his age!)

1759
01:31:17,325 --> 01:31:18,964
I've been a trainee...

1760
01:31:18,965 --> 01:31:21,024
- for three weeks. - What?

1761
01:31:22,195 --> 01:31:25,564
(The rookie trainee is still
awkward in front of the camera.)

1762
01:31:26,804 --> 01:31:28,974
I have no experience being a trainee,

1763
01:31:29,535 --> 01:31:31,505
so I'm worried the most
about my level of talent.

1764
01:31:32,005 --> 01:31:34,875
I just hope I don't bring the others down.

1765
01:31:36,115 --> 01:31:40,584
I can confidently say I can
give it everything I have.

1766
01:31:40,585 --> 01:31:42,825
(I can confidently say I can
give it everything I have.)

1767
01:31:42,854 --> 01:31:44,813
(Today will be the
beginning of his new dream.)

1768
01:31:44,814 --> 01:31:46,383
Let us watch the next performance.

1769
01:31:46,384 --> 01:31:50,854
- Universe League, are you ready? - Yes!

1770
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:52,325
Go, Woong Ki!

1771
01:31:52,665 --> 01:31:54,465
- All right. - Let's go.

1772
01:31:54,965 --> 01:31:57,535
Check this out. Daisuke has a solo dance.

1773
01:31:57,865 --> 01:32:00,205
Is that so? He's dancing solo?

1774
01:32:00,335 --> 01:32:01,365
Go!

1775
01:32:01,634 --> 01:32:03,535
- Go, Woong Ki! - Good luck.

1776
01:32:05,005 --> 01:32:08,574
The fiery boy Daisuke will burn hot.

1777
01:32:08,575 --> 01:32:12,284
I have to do my best to
survive in this competition.

1778
01:32:12,285 --> 01:32:14,245
It's do or die for me.

1779
01:32:14,415 --> 01:32:15,814
I'll show you I'm serious.

1780
01:32:20,585 --> 01:32:22,825
Ready? Go.

1781
01:32:27,825 --> 01:32:29,334
("Replay" by Ayumu,
Cha Woong Ki, Daisuke, )

1782
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,975
(Kang Jun Hyuk, Seo Jeong Woo, Xie Yuxin)

1783
01:32:34,564 --> 01:32:36,044
I haven't heard this song in a while.

1784
01:32:42,045 --> 01:32:43,144
Nice.

1785
01:32:44,344 --> 01:32:45,415
I like it.

1786
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:01,995
He's adorable.

1787
01:33:10,634 --> 01:33:11,705
They're adorable.

1788
01:33:32,625 --> 01:33:34,365
They have good teamwork.

1789
01:34:06,764 --> 01:34:08,064
This team is amazing.

1790
01:34:20,545 --> 01:34:21,545
Who's that in the center?

1791
01:35:02,255 --> 01:35:03,255
Nice.

1792
01:35:08,655 --> 01:35:09,894
"Replay."

1793
01:35:10,695 --> 01:35:12,564
They're even prepared for the ending.

1794
01:35:14,465 --> 01:35:15,594
Oh, what?

1795
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:18,803
Very good.

1796
01:35:18,804 --> 01:35:20,035
Cha Woong Ki did a good job.

1797
01:35:23,234 --> 01:35:24,234
They're good.

1798
01:35:26,774 --> 01:35:29,343
Yes, sir. This was Group "Replay."

1799
01:35:29,344 --> 01:35:32,784
(What will the judges say?)

1800
01:35:32,785 --> 01:35:35,354
When you first began...

1801
01:35:35,615 --> 01:35:38,084
the choreography,

1802
01:35:38,085 --> 01:35:39,655
it was incredible.

1803
01:35:40,724 --> 01:35:43,454
In terms of the choreography,

1804
01:35:43,455 --> 01:35:46,063
you had good teamwork and chemistry.

1805
01:35:46,064 --> 01:35:48,994
I enjoyed watching your performance.

1806
01:35:48,995 --> 01:35:50,535
The girls will love it.

1807
01:35:52,005 --> 01:35:53,005
Thank you.

1808
01:35:53,234 --> 01:35:55,233
It's a bummer that there are no girls here.

1809
01:35:55,234 --> 01:35:56,234
I know.

1810
01:35:57,005 --> 01:35:58,034
We only have boys here.

1811
01:35:58,035 --> 01:35:59,603
(The boys liked it too.)

1812
01:35:59,604 --> 01:36:02,245
Chang Sub, any player you have an eye on?

1813
01:36:02,575 --> 01:36:03,575
I have one.

1814
01:36:03,576 --> 01:36:04,715
- You do? - Yes.

1815
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,144
He's my only pick.

1816
01:36:09,484 --> 01:36:10,484
Only pick?

1817
01:36:10,615 --> 01:36:11,684
Only pick?

1818
01:36:13,224 --> 01:36:14,284
I hope we don't overlap.

1819
01:36:14,285 --> 01:36:15,525
In terms of the choreography...

1820
01:36:17,255 --> 01:36:20,524
Now, you have 60 seconds.

1821
01:36:20,995 --> 01:36:22,995
Pick your nominees.

1822
01:36:25,035 --> 01:36:26,104
It's happening again.

1823
01:36:28,734 --> 01:36:29,734
This is hard.

1824
01:36:32,945 --> 01:36:34,673
- Look. - Okay.

1825
01:36:34,674 --> 01:36:38,075
I picked two. But what if...

1826
01:36:38,575 --> 01:36:39,684
It might overlap, right?

1827
01:36:40,285 --> 01:36:41,714
He was overwhelming.

1828
01:36:41,715 --> 01:36:44,655
Yes, from the start,

1829
01:36:45,424 --> 01:36:46,684
he stood out.

1830
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:49,053
He knows that he's cute.

1831
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:52,295
Yes. And that can be an advantage.

1832
01:36:53,825 --> 01:36:55,965
While I was waiting for their choice,

1833
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:58,904
I thought about how I fell.

1834
01:36:58,905 --> 01:37:02,974
I was nervous that I wouldn't get chosen.

1835
01:37:04,274 --> 01:37:06,304
I can never guess.

1836
01:37:07,974 --> 01:37:09,615
(TEAM GROOVE goes with its only pick.)

1837
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:13,284
(TEAM BEAT also quickly makes its choice.)

1838
01:37:13,285 --> 01:37:16,314
I hope we choose him.

1839
01:37:19,255 --> 01:37:20,785
Why does a minute feel so short?

1840
01:37:21,755 --> 01:37:23,455
Five, four,

1841
01:37:23,995 --> 01:37:25,665
three, two,

1842
01:37:26,094 --> 01:37:27,094
one.

1843
01:37:27,524 --> 01:37:29,664
Can you give us ten more seconds?

1844
01:37:29,665 --> 01:37:30,795
- Ten seconds? - Yes.

1845
01:37:31,195 --> 01:37:33,205
(No way.)

1846
01:37:33,405 --> 01:37:35,263
No. Never.

1847
01:37:35,264 --> 01:37:36,803
- You can't change. - Sorry.

1848
01:37:36,804 --> 01:37:38,534
- It's so hard. - It's hard?

1849
01:37:38,535 --> 01:37:40,455
(Time's up. All three
teams made their choices.)

1850
01:37:40,575 --> 01:37:42,313
That's Universe League for you.

1851
01:37:42,314 --> 01:37:43,715
That's Universe League.

1852
01:37:44,274 --> 01:37:48,683
Then let's reveal TEAM BEAT's First Pick.

1853
01:37:48,684 --> 01:37:50,455
(Revealing TEAM BEAT's First Pick)

1854
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:57,054
I want to join TEAM BEAT.

1855
01:37:58,255 --> 01:38:00,325
- Get closer. - I want TEAM BEAT.

1856
01:38:00,695 --> 01:38:02,034
(Cha Woong Ki chose TEAM BEAT.)

1857
01:38:02,035 --> 01:38:05,264
- Come here. - Because...

1858
01:38:05,934 --> 01:38:08,035
when I learned to dance,

1859
01:38:08,434 --> 01:38:09,934
I started with GOT7's songs.

1860
01:38:11,535 --> 01:38:15,005
It feels like they're my first step.

1861
01:38:15,715 --> 01:38:17,114
So I choose TEAM BEAT.

1862
01:38:17,115 --> 01:38:18,615
- BEAT. - BEAT.

1863
01:38:20,915 --> 01:38:25,155
(Will TEAM BEAT choose him as he wishes?)

1864
01:38:36,634 --> 01:38:38,165
(Cha Woong Ki)

1865
01:38:40,035 --> 01:38:42,834
- TEAM BEAT chose... - Thank you.

1866
01:38:42,835 --> 01:38:44,574
Cha Woong Ki.

1867
01:38:44,575 --> 01:38:47,044
(First Pick, BEAT, Cha Woong Ki)

1868
01:38:47,045 --> 01:38:49,273
Thank you.

1869
01:38:49,274 --> 01:38:50,945
(TEAM BEAT chose Cha Woong Ki.)

1870
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:53,584
If you're that thankful, come to us.

1871
01:38:53,585 --> 01:38:54,884
(That's right.)

1872
01:38:56,884 --> 01:38:58,755
Next, let's reveal TEAM GROOVE's...

1873
01:38:58,955 --> 01:39:01,024
First Pick.

1874
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:06,824
(First Pick, BEAT, Cha Woong Ki)

1875
01:39:06,825 --> 01:39:10,695
(First Pick, BEAT, Cha Woong Ki)

1876
01:39:11,465 --> 01:39:14,764
I hope there's a spot for me.

1877
01:39:21,174 --> 01:39:22,343
(Seo Jeong Woo)

1878
01:39:22,344 --> 01:39:26,084
TEAM GROOVE chose Seo Jeong Woo.

1879
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:27,085
Congratulations.

1880
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:28,313
(First Pick, GROOVE, Seo Jeong Woo)

1881
01:39:28,314 --> 01:39:29,915
His boyish image.

1882
01:39:30,215 --> 01:39:31,853
I came to think that once
he gets used to the camera,

1883
01:39:31,854 --> 01:39:33,655
he'll become even cuter.

1884
01:39:36,024 --> 01:39:37,494
- What's your wish? - If you had to choose.

1885
01:39:37,495 --> 01:39:39,794
I'll have to go where I'm accepted,

1886
01:39:39,795 --> 01:39:41,063
but my wish is to sing better.

1887
01:39:41,064 --> 01:39:42,064
GROOVE?

1888
01:39:43,264 --> 01:39:44,264
GROOVE.

1889
01:39:44,265 --> 01:39:47,665
(Seo Jeong Woo chose TEAM GROOVE.)

1890
01:39:47,934 --> 01:39:48,934
Congratulations.

1891
01:39:48,935 --> 01:39:50,074
(Director Chang Sub and I connected.)

1892
01:39:50,075 --> 01:39:51,905
I hope no one overlapped.

1893
01:39:53,804 --> 01:39:55,514
This is really hard.

1894
01:39:56,674 --> 01:39:59,414
Two teams chose different players.

1895
01:39:59,415 --> 01:40:02,084
Lastly, let's reveal TEAM
RHYTHM's First Pick.

1896
01:40:02,085 --> 01:40:03,114
(Revealing TEAM RHYTHM's First Pick)

1897
01:40:03,115 --> 01:40:09,155
(First Pick, GROOVE, Seo
Jeong Woo, BEAT, Cha Woong Ki)

1898
01:40:09,655 --> 01:40:14,524
(Will their First Pick overlap?)

1899
01:40:14,924 --> 01:40:18,393
(Or will it be a new player?)

1900
01:40:18,394 --> 01:40:21,005
(First Pick, GROOVE, Seo
Jeong Woo, BEAT, Cha Woong Ki)

1901
01:40:22,234 --> 01:40:24,035
(Daisuke)

1902
01:40:24,604 --> 01:40:27,075
(Daisuke)

1903
01:40:29,075 --> 01:40:32,044
TEAM RHYTHM chose Daisuke.

1904
01:40:32,045 --> 01:40:33,945
- Congratulations. - Don't cry.

1905
01:40:34,984 --> 01:40:35,984
Don't cry.

1906
01:40:35,985 --> 01:40:37,955
(First Pick, RHYTHM, Daisuke)

1907
01:40:38,285 --> 01:40:39,285
It's okay.

1908
01:40:40,524 --> 01:40:41,724
Why are you crying?

1909
01:40:42,455 --> 01:40:45,893
(Bursting into tears due to anxiety)

1910
01:40:45,894 --> 01:40:47,424
It's okay.

1911
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,535
Is there a reason?

1912
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:53,005
I wanted to join TEAM RHYTHM so badly.

1913
01:40:54,335 --> 01:40:56,074
You wanted it so badly, and
you're happy that you made it?

1914
01:40:56,075 --> 01:40:58,433
- Yes. - They're tears of joy.

1915
01:40:58,434 --> 01:41:00,474
- Yes, I'm so happy. - Okay.

1916
01:41:00,905 --> 01:41:02,643
- It breaks my heart. - Why are you crying?

1917
01:41:02,644 --> 01:41:04,013
(He's cute.)

1918
01:41:04,014 --> 01:41:07,883
I chose Daisuke because...

1919
01:41:07,884 --> 01:41:10,914
you slipped while dancing, right?

1920
01:41:10,915 --> 01:41:11,915
Oh, yes. I saw it too.

1921
01:41:16,455 --> 01:41:19,224
(He continued performing
firmly even after the mistake.)

1922
01:41:21,724 --> 01:41:24,233
Yet, you continued...

1923
01:41:24,234 --> 01:41:25,664
without showing it.

1924
01:41:25,665 --> 01:41:28,063
I like professionals.

1925
01:41:28,064 --> 01:41:29,580
(Daisuke caught Director TEN's attention.)

1926
01:41:29,604 --> 01:41:31,473
Still, you're chosen...

1927
01:41:31,474 --> 01:41:33,004
- by the team you wanted. - Good luck.

1928
01:41:33,005 --> 01:41:34,005
Good luck.

1929
01:41:34,005 --> 01:41:35,005
(Both directors and players
connected in this draft.)

1930
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:37,473
All three teams succeeded...

1931
01:41:37,474 --> 01:41:38,843
in scouting the players they wanted!

1932
01:41:38,844 --> 01:41:40,964
(Both directors and players
connected in this draft.)

1933
01:41:43,585 --> 01:41:46,023
(Draft Starting Lineup: Daisuke)

1934
01:41:46,024 --> 01:41:48,353
(Draft Starting Lineup: Seo Jeong Woo)

1935
01:41:48,354 --> 01:41:51,094
(Draft Starting Lineup: Cha Woong Ki)

1936
01:41:51,554 --> 01:41:54,195
Directors, focus on this team.

1937
01:41:54,465 --> 01:41:56,465
Korea, Japan, China, Thailand,

1938
01:41:56,764 --> 01:41:57,964
and even the Philippines.

1939
01:41:57,965 --> 01:42:00,864
National players who
represent the five countries...

1940
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:02,804
are all on this team.

1941
01:42:03,405 --> 01:42:06,045
- Oh, so global. - That really is global.

1942
01:42:12,514 --> 01:42:14,684
I have someone in mind.

1943
01:42:15,144 --> 01:42:16,455
- Already? - Yes.

1944
01:42:18,285 --> 01:42:21,054
- How? - It's just my feeling.

1945
01:42:21,354 --> 01:42:22,354
Your feeling?

1946
01:42:22,495 --> 01:42:24,155
KUN also has a feeling.

1947
01:42:24,394 --> 01:42:25,763
- You too? - He said...

1948
01:42:25,764 --> 01:42:27,495
we should watch this person.

1949
01:42:27,965 --> 01:42:32,064
When I saw him, he caught my attention.

1950
01:42:32,304 --> 01:42:33,465
He has a good hunch.

1951
01:42:34,165 --> 01:42:35,204
(Who is Special Director KUN eyeing?)

1952
01:42:35,205 --> 01:42:38,005
We have someone in mind too.

1953
01:42:38,274 --> 01:42:40,320
But we won't know for sure
until we watch his performance.

1954
01:42:40,344 --> 01:42:44,173
Right. It's the 1st time
all 3 teams have said that.

1955
01:42:44,174 --> 01:42:45,174
I know.

1956
01:42:45,274 --> 01:42:48,214
I'm afraid we might overlap.

1957
01:42:48,215 --> 01:42:50,115
What happens if we all overlap?

1958
01:42:50,884 --> 01:42:52,254
- What? - What happens if we all overlap?

1959
01:42:52,255 --> 01:42:54,015
- If that happens...
- It's going to be fun.

1960
01:42:54,224 --> 01:42:55,504
- Right. - How is that possible?

1961
01:42:57,195 --> 01:42:58,195
Let's try overlapping.

1962
01:43:04,035 --> 01:43:06,734
I joined Universe League
to become a K-pop idol.

1963
01:43:07,835 --> 01:43:10,005
I came to Korea to break my own frame.

1964
01:43:10,405 --> 01:43:12,234
To take on new challenges.

1965
01:43:14,974 --> 01:43:19,644
(6 players enter the
stage with determination.)

1966
01:43:20,215 --> 01:43:21,215
Come on.

1967
01:43:22,415 --> 01:43:23,884
That's a cute outfit.

1968
01:43:25,215 --> 01:43:26,224
That's cute.

1969
01:43:26,524 --> 01:43:27,784
They're so cute.

1970
01:43:27,785 --> 01:43:29,255
So cute.

1971
01:43:29,418 --> 01:43:30,418
Kim Dong Yun.

1972
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:33,258
He's cute.

1973
01:43:33,259 --> 01:43:35,929
- He's wearing a backpack.
- I want to wear a backpack too.

1974
01:43:36,759 --> 01:43:37,759
Yuito.

1975
01:43:39,998 --> 01:43:41,028
JL.

1976
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:44,498
JL.

1977
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:48,497
(Are the directors interested in JL?)

1978
01:43:48,498 --> 01:43:49,839
Park Yeon Jun.

1979
01:43:51,969 --> 01:43:53,008
James.

1980
01:43:53,009 --> 01:43:54,339
Oh, James.

1981
01:43:54,738 --> 01:43:55,778
He Junjin.

1982
01:43:58,078 --> 01:44:00,218
They're all wearing different colors.

1983
01:44:00,219 --> 01:44:01,779
(They're all from different countries.)

1984
01:44:02,049 --> 01:44:06,889
(Applicants from 75 countries)

1985
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:12,599
(Numerous applicants gathered from
around the world to become an idol.)

1986
01:44:12,998 --> 01:44:15,059
- Hello. - Hello.

1987
01:44:15,828 --> 01:44:19,099
Hello. My name is He Junjin.

1988
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:22,067
I'm from China.

1989
01:44:22,068 --> 01:44:23,238
I'm 19 years old.

1990
01:44:23,868 --> 01:44:24,868
(Hitting)

1991
01:44:25,469 --> 01:44:27,978
I'll hit the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd bases,

1992
01:44:27,979 --> 01:44:30,308
and come home in Universe League.

1993
01:44:30,309 --> 01:44:32,719
Please look forward to it. Thank you.

1994
01:44:33,378 --> 01:44:36,448
Hello. I'm Yuito.

1995
01:44:36,849 --> 01:44:39,487
I'm here to achieve my dream...

1996
01:44:39,488 --> 01:44:41,059
of becoming a K-pop idol.

1997
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:44,589
(In-person audition in Thailand)

1998
01:44:45,128 --> 01:44:48,859
(In-person audition in the Philippines)

1999
01:44:53,399 --> 01:44:57,707
Beautiful love

2000
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:01,538
(If I get to be with you
under the same sky)

2001
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:07,318
(6 players gathered with the same goal.)

2002
01:45:08,118 --> 01:45:11,549
The one in the colorful
sweater can really sing.

2003
01:45:12,559 --> 01:45:14,458
- We can do it. - Okay.

2004
01:45:15,658 --> 01:45:18,488
Hello, world. This is Universe Boy.

2005
01:45:19,899 --> 01:45:21,498
- Let's go. - Nice energy.

2006
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:22,929
I like their energy.

2007
01:45:23,299 --> 01:45:25,867
Universe League, are you ready?

2008
01:45:25,868 --> 01:45:28,667
- Yes! - Yes!

2009
01:45:28,668 --> 01:45:30,707
(Good luck!)

2010
01:45:30,708 --> 01:45:32,877
- Okay. - Let's go.

2011
01:45:32,878 --> 01:45:35,707
(The players get ready to perform.)

2012
01:45:35,708 --> 01:45:38,979
I'll show you with the
result instead of words.

2013
01:45:39,778 --> 01:45:43,448
I can make it to the
First Pick of the mentors.

2014
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:47,317
I'll pull it off big time onstage...

2015
01:45:47,318 --> 01:45:48,988
and become the starting player.

2016
01:45:49,889 --> 01:45:50,929
Let's go.

2017
01:45:57,368 --> 01:45:58,399
Ready?

2018
01:45:58,868 --> 01:45:59,939
Go.

2019
01:46:04,038 --> 01:46:05,338
("One and Only" by He Junjin, James, JL, )

2020
01:46:05,339 --> 01:46:06,779
(Kim Dong Yun, Park Yeon Jun, Yuito)

2021
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:08,738
They're cute.

2022
01:48:53,038 --> 01:48:55,078
This was Group "One and Only."

2023
01:48:57,549 --> 01:49:00,618
- I enjoyed watching them the most.
- He's the one.

2024
01:49:01,149 --> 01:49:03,019
- It's guaranteed. - The directors...

2025
01:49:04,248 --> 01:49:05,248
I like this guy.

2026
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:08,519
He was way too good.

2027
01:49:09,559 --> 01:49:12,028
The directors had feelings...

2028
01:49:12,628 --> 01:49:15,627
about a few players before the performance.

2029
01:49:15,628 --> 01:49:17,729
Now that you've seen
it, were you right about it?

2030
01:49:18,229 --> 01:49:21,168
- Yes. - We're doomed without him.

2031
01:49:21,469 --> 01:49:23,339
- Really? That good? - Yes.

2032
01:49:25,068 --> 01:49:27,277
- I can feel how desperate you are.
- I'm excited.

2033
01:49:27,278 --> 01:49:28,809
He's very excited.

2034
01:49:28,939 --> 01:49:30,648
I know. I can't wait to find out.

2035
01:49:30,649 --> 01:49:33,248
(Who's the one that seized
Director EL CAPITXN's heart?)

2036
01:49:33,448 --> 01:49:35,617
The third guy did a good job.

2037
01:49:35,618 --> 01:49:37,418
I think he was the best.

2038
01:49:39,019 --> 01:49:41,589
The boy named JL stood out the most.

2039
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:44,888
I think he's the only one who stood out...

2040
01:49:44,889 --> 01:49:46,099
in "One and Only."

2041
01:49:46,458 --> 01:49:48,458
While singing and dancing,

2042
01:49:49,769 --> 01:49:51,528
his expression was... Gosh.

2043
01:49:52,599 --> 01:49:55,038
He knew how to grab attention.

2044
01:49:55,538 --> 01:49:56,538
He shined.

2045
01:49:56,539 --> 01:49:58,139
(He shined onstage.)

2046
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:01,338
- He was a good singer. - Yes.

2047
01:50:01,339 --> 01:50:03,907
He's not only good at
dancing, but he can really sing.

2048
01:50:03,908 --> 01:50:05,878
He's an all-rounder.

2049
01:50:06,878 --> 01:50:08,719
Now,

2050
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:10,649
I will give you 60 seconds.

2051
01:50:10,948 --> 01:50:13,389
Pick the player you want to nominate.

2052
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:21,599
We're sticking to our first pick.

2053
01:50:22,899 --> 01:50:25,660
- I think everyone will choose him.
- It'll overlap this time, right?

2054
01:50:25,969 --> 01:50:28,098
If it doesn't, we'll be grateful.

2055
01:50:28,099 --> 01:50:30,539
Then we couldn't be more
grateful. It's basically a giveaway.

2056
01:50:32,439 --> 01:50:35,037
(Director Lee Chang Sub makes
his decision without hesitation.)

2057
01:50:35,038 --> 01:50:36,548
(Tapping)

2058
01:50:36,549 --> 01:50:37,748
Look.

2059
01:50:38,349 --> 01:50:41,019
I'd choose him for a stronger performance.

2060
01:50:41,418 --> 01:50:42,818
I think he'd pull it off the best.

2061
01:50:43,389 --> 01:50:45,488
He was mostly in the center.

2062
01:50:45,589 --> 01:50:46,957
He stood out.

2063
01:50:46,958 --> 01:50:49,628
- He was good. - Actually...

2064
01:50:50,059 --> 01:50:51,328
He stood out to me the most.

2065
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:54,299
- Okay. - Okay?

2066
01:50:55,229 --> 01:50:57,627
- I'd choose the third one. - Me too.

2067
01:50:57,628 --> 01:50:58,804
I'd go with the third one too.

2068
01:50:58,828 --> 01:51:02,099
I think the three
groups will all choose JL.

2069
01:51:04,439 --> 01:51:09,207
(Will there be 3 identical 1st
Picks in the draft for the 1st time?)

2070
01:51:09,208 --> 01:51:11,708
Four, three, two,

2071
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:13,149
one.

2072
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:15,818
Your time's up...

2073
01:51:16,149 --> 01:51:18,019
for the nomination.

2074
01:51:18,549 --> 01:51:20,589
I can't wait to see your choices.

2075
01:51:21,288 --> 01:51:22,588
I think it'll overlap.

2076
01:51:22,589 --> 01:51:23,988
(Anxious already)

2077
01:51:24,259 --> 01:51:26,327
(On eggshells)

2078
01:51:26,328 --> 01:51:28,259
Will it overlap?

2079
01:51:28,559 --> 01:51:30,268
I think so.

2080
01:51:30,269 --> 01:51:31,928
That's how it feels, right?

2081
01:51:31,929 --> 01:51:34,439
(A scout fight is expected
among the three teams.)

2082
01:51:35,769 --> 01:51:38,469
Now, let's reveal the 3 teams' 1st Pick.

2083
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:42,308
I can't wait to find out.

2084
01:51:42,309 --> 01:51:44,608
(Who will become the 1st
Pick among the 6 players?)

2085
01:51:44,609 --> 01:51:46,049
I think all three teams overlapped.

2086
01:51:48,849 --> 01:51:51,248
Revealing TEAM BEAT's First Pick.

2087
01:51:52,019 --> 01:51:53,657
- I think it's him. - Ta-da.

2088
01:51:53,658 --> 01:51:54,759
- Ta-da. - We'll see.

2089
01:51:55,288 --> 01:51:59,729
(Will the result be just
as everyone expects?)

2090
01:51:59,998 --> 01:52:02,059
(JL)

2091
01:52:04,969 --> 01:52:06,898
- Thank you. - TEAM BEAT chose...

2092
01:52:06,899 --> 01:52:08,439
JL.

2093
01:52:09,139 --> 01:52:12,038
(First Pick, BEAT, JL)

2094
01:52:12,309 --> 01:52:15,208
(Exclaiming)

2095
01:52:15,939 --> 01:52:17,378
JL.

2096
01:52:19,719 --> 01:52:22,349
Next, let's reveal TEAM RHYTHM's...

2097
01:52:23,288 --> 01:52:24,288
First Pick.

2098
01:52:27,389 --> 01:52:29,628
They're smiling. It overlapped.

2099
01:52:30,759 --> 01:52:35,099
(Is TEAM RHYTHM's First Pick also JL?)

2100
01:52:38,469 --> 01:52:39,769
- See? - See?

2101
01:52:40,068 --> 01:52:41,939
- TEAM RHYTHM chose... - Gosh.

2102
01:52:42,339 --> 01:52:44,438
(JL)

2103
01:52:44,439 --> 01:52:46,308
TEAM RHYTHM chose...

2104
01:52:46,309 --> 01:52:49,108
JL.

2105
01:52:49,109 --> 01:52:50,178
Come on.

2106
01:52:50,179 --> 01:52:52,848
(First Pick, RHYTHM, BEAT, JL)

2107
01:52:52,849 --> 01:52:54,849
He was that good at singing.

2108
01:52:55,549 --> 01:52:56,618
It's unbelievable.

2109
01:52:58,519 --> 01:53:00,519
Lastly, let's reveal TEAM GROOVE's...

2110
01:53:01,019 --> 01:53:03,628
First Pick.

2111
01:53:04,528 --> 01:53:07,128
What if all three teams overlap?

2112
01:53:08,028 --> 01:53:10,028
Three First Picks for the first time.

2113
01:53:11,828 --> 01:53:15,639
(Will it be 3 identical 1st
Picks for the 1st time?)

2114
01:53:16,538 --> 01:53:20,009
(Or will it be a different player?)

2115
01:53:20,939 --> 01:53:22,008
No way.

2116
01:53:22,009 --> 01:53:23,948
(Anxious, Nervous)

2117
01:53:25,109 --> 01:53:26,918
- Gosh! - That's crazy.

2118
01:53:27,318 --> 01:53:28,318
My goodness.

2119
01:53:28,618 --> 01:53:32,118
(JL)

2120
01:53:32,549 --> 01:53:34,317
(TEAM GROOVE's First Pick is also JL.)

2121
01:53:34,318 --> 01:53:35,559
TEAM GROOVE also...

2122
01:53:36,628 --> 01:53:37,929
picked...

2123
01:53:38,929 --> 01:53:40,229
- JL. - Let's go.

2124
01:53:42,059 --> 01:53:44,899
(This can't be happening.)

2125
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:47,299
TEAM GROOVE also...

2126
01:53:51,568 --> 01:53:53,537
(3 identical 1st Picks for the 1st time)

2127
01:53:53,538 --> 01:53:55,078
How is that possible?

2128
01:53:56,179 --> 01:53:59,049
It's like, I couldn't really believe it.

2129
01:53:59,349 --> 01:54:02,049
While being on the
stage, I tried not to cry.

2130
01:54:03,049 --> 01:54:05,889
I was surprised by how
good of a singer you are.

2131
01:54:07,019 --> 01:54:11,388
While dancing, you
were singing in falsetto,

2132
01:54:11,389 --> 01:54:13,458
and yet you were firm.

2133
01:54:13,559 --> 01:54:14,859
That surprised me.

2134
01:54:15,328 --> 01:54:16,828
(Right!)

2135
01:54:17,998 --> 01:54:19,498
I hope he joins our team.

2136
01:54:19,738 --> 01:54:22,598
When you were
performing, you were flirting.

2137
01:54:22,599 --> 01:54:25,368
That stood out immediately.

2138
01:54:25,639 --> 01:54:28,139
He was wonderful.

2139
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:31,609
After watching his performance,
they couldn't help but choose JL.

2140
01:54:33,049 --> 01:54:35,918
Just choose the team you want.

2141
01:54:36,248 --> 01:54:39,049
- We have to appeal to him now.
- Just choose the team you want.

2142
01:54:41,818 --> 01:54:44,859
(Taking his time)

2143
01:54:45,259 --> 01:54:47,399
We'll make Korea your second home.

2144
01:54:47,628 --> 01:54:50,627
And with all our welcoming heart...

2145
01:54:50,628 --> 01:54:53,398
Please come to our team.
We'll take care of you.

2146
01:54:53,399 --> 01:54:56,099
I'll teach you some
Korean. A lot of Korean.

2147
01:54:56,538 --> 01:54:58,038
Hey.

2148
01:54:58,769 --> 01:55:01,738
Your weapon is your vocals.

2149
01:55:03,948 --> 01:55:09,148
Come to the team that will
help you use your weapon wisely.

2150
01:55:09,149 --> 01:55:10,689
Gosh.

2151
01:55:10,849 --> 01:55:13,859
Your weapon is your existence.

2152
01:55:14,059 --> 01:55:15,817
(Touched)

2153
01:55:15,818 --> 01:55:18,127
That was unforgettable. My goodness.

2154
01:55:18,128 --> 01:55:20,299
Do I get popcorn? This is fun.

2155
01:55:21,759 --> 01:55:23,929
I love you

2156
01:55:24,698 --> 01:55:29,367
(Melting JL's heart with his sweet song)

2157
01:55:29,368 --> 01:55:31,469
(Touched)

2158
01:55:31,939 --> 01:55:33,078
I love you too.

2159
01:55:35,278 --> 01:55:37,247
Hey!

2160
01:55:37,248 --> 01:55:38,549
(JL)

2161
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:40,278
If you love us, join us.

2162
01:55:42,278 --> 01:55:44,088
Now,

2163
01:55:44,089 --> 01:55:45,089
(Time for JL to choose)

2164
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:46,787
it's time to choose.

2165
01:55:46,788 --> 01:55:49,588
(When the First Pick overlaps,
the player chooses the team.)

2166
01:55:49,589 --> 01:55:51,429
- Please. Join us. - Now...

2167
01:55:53,299 --> 01:55:58,168
(Who will JL choose?)

2168
01:55:59,939 --> 01:56:04,038
The team that I've chosen is...

2169
01:56:04,932 --> 01:56:06,532
Come here.

2170
01:56:06,533 --> 01:56:08,062
- BEAT. - We will welcome you.

2171
01:56:09,402 --> 01:56:10,901
(Join our team!)

2172
01:56:10,902 --> 01:56:11,932
Where is it going to be?

2173
01:56:15,772 --> 01:56:16,971
TEAM RHYTHM.

2174
01:56:16,972 --> 01:56:18,971
(JL's choice)

2175
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:20,772
JL chooses TEAM RHYTHM.

2176
01:56:21,043 --> 01:56:22,841
Welcome home.

2177
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:23,981
Congratulations.

2178
01:56:23,982 --> 01:56:25,753
Gosh, that is...

2179
01:56:25,913 --> 01:56:27,582
- It hurts. - It hurts.

2180
01:56:27,583 --> 01:56:28,869
(TEAM BEAT is hurt many times today.)

2181
01:56:29,623 --> 01:56:31,592
(Congratulations.)

2182
01:56:34,562 --> 01:56:36,722
Hurry up. Hurry.

2183
01:56:38,633 --> 01:56:39,663
It's a bummer.

2184
01:56:41,463 --> 01:56:43,102
Welcome.

2185
01:56:45,272 --> 01:56:49,203
TEN is really my role model.

2186
01:56:49,442 --> 01:56:52,011
Seeing them super close...

2187
01:56:52,012 --> 01:56:54,011
and being with them...

2188
01:56:54,012 --> 01:56:56,982
as my mentors.

2189
01:56:57,213 --> 01:57:01,052
It's a super dream come true for me.

2190
01:57:01,883 --> 01:57:02,883
(Draft Starting Lineup:)

2191
01:57:02,884 --> 01:57:06,453
(Park Ju Won, Sirin, Zhang
Shuaibo, Royce, Daisuke, JL)

2192
01:57:06,793 --> 01:57:11,033
Now, it's time for your Second Pick.

2193
01:57:12,793 --> 01:57:15,802
Let's reveal TEAM BEAT's Pick first.

2194
01:57:16,732 --> 01:57:17,732
TEAM BEAT.

2195
01:57:18,972 --> 01:57:20,002
Thank you.

2196
01:57:20,003 --> 01:57:21,242
(TEAM BEAT chooses Kim Dong Yun.)

2197
01:57:21,243 --> 01:57:22,842
Come here.

2198
01:57:24,342 --> 01:57:28,642
Revealing TEAM GROOVE's Pick.

2199
01:57:29,512 --> 01:57:31,052
(James)

2200
01:57:31,453 --> 01:57:32,511
(TEAM GROOVE chooses James.)

2201
01:57:32,512 --> 01:57:34,011
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

2202
01:57:34,012 --> 01:57:36,722
Thank you.

2203
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:39,453
Good job.

2204
01:57:39,953 --> 01:57:42,221
- Congratulations. - Come on.

2205
01:57:42,222 --> 01:57:44,732
Hello. Gosh.

2206
01:57:48,402 --> 01:57:49,462
(Draft Starting Lineup:)

2207
01:57:49,463 --> 01:57:51,202
(Zen Zen, Kim Joo Hyoung, Jang
Kyung Ho, Kenta, Seo Jeong Woo, James)

2208
01:57:51,203 --> 01:57:52,203
(Draft Starting Lineup:)

2209
01:57:52,204 --> 01:57:54,519
(An Yul, Chih En, Park Ji Hun, Keum
Jin Ho, Cha Woong Ki, Kim Dong Yun)

2210
01:57:54,543 --> 01:57:57,972
Now, we only have one draft stage left.

2211
01:57:58,272 --> 01:58:00,042
Already?

2212
01:58:00,043 --> 01:58:02,043
(Only one seat remains in each team.)

2213
01:58:02,342 --> 01:58:04,583
What are we missing now?
We're missing the main dancer.

2214
01:58:04,812 --> 01:58:06,482
No. We don't have the main dancer yet.

2215
01:58:07,682 --> 01:58:11,292
We need to think about what to do.

2216
01:58:11,293 --> 01:58:13,753
(Will the directors be able
to finish their last lineup?)

2217
01:58:21,033 --> 01:58:24,703
I barely have experience of
dancing with applause onstage.

2218
01:58:24,873 --> 01:58:27,333
I only have what I have left to show them.

2219
01:58:28,102 --> 01:58:29,382
I want to show that I can do it.

2220
01:58:29,703 --> 01:58:31,613
For everyone to see me.

2221
01:58:31,743 --> 01:58:34,012
I'm going to be the starting player.

2222
01:58:34,783 --> 01:58:36,012
My goodness.

2223
01:58:38,012 --> 01:58:39,452
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2224
01:58:39,453 --> 01:58:40,782
(Appearing in intense outfits)

2225
01:58:40,783 --> 01:58:42,823
I love their outfits.

2226
01:58:47,222 --> 01:58:48,623
Li Zhinuo.

2227
01:58:49,793 --> 01:58:51,363
Kim Hyo Tae.

2228
01:58:52,232 --> 01:58:53,391
Jiang Fan.

2229
01:58:53,392 --> 01:58:54,602
Hi.

2230
01:58:55,062 --> 01:58:56,732
Koo Han Seo.

2231
01:58:58,533 --> 01:59:00,503
- Park Han. - Hey.

2232
01:59:01,772 --> 01:59:02,772
Steven.

2233
01:59:04,302 --> 01:59:05,472
He's really cool.

2234
01:59:06,342 --> 01:59:07,413
Yes.

2235
01:59:08,243 --> 01:59:11,953
He's debuted before.

2236
01:59:14,883 --> 01:59:18,051
I lived in Australia.

2237
01:59:18,052 --> 01:59:21,662
Eight years ago, with the
dream to become an idol,

2238
01:59:21,663 --> 01:59:24,533
I moved to Korea alone.

2239
01:59:25,533 --> 01:59:30,002
(He began living in Korea
alone when he was 16.)

2240
01:59:30,003 --> 01:59:34,032
Then I debuted in LUMINOUS.

2241
01:59:34,033 --> 01:59:35,753
(Steven debuted in LUMINOUS 5 years later.)

2242
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:37,673
After performing for a year,

2243
01:59:38,743 --> 01:59:42,582
we paused for a while.

2244
01:59:42,583 --> 01:59:45,083
Because I wasn't doing anything,

2245
01:59:45,312 --> 01:59:48,323
my parents told me...

2246
01:59:48,522 --> 01:59:53,823
to come back if there was
no result or performance.

2247
01:59:55,892 --> 01:59:59,091
I didn't want to go back like that.

2248
01:59:59,092 --> 02:00:02,363
I decided to show them.

2249
02:00:02,503 --> 02:00:03,932
So I didn't give up.

2250
02:00:06,873 --> 02:00:09,301
(Starting over again)

2251
02:00:09,302 --> 02:00:11,003
Hold the mic.

2252
02:00:14,472 --> 02:00:17,641
I came to Korea at 16...

2253
02:00:17,642 --> 02:00:19,413
without knowing anything.

2254
02:00:20,283 --> 02:00:24,622
I chased this dream for eight years.

2255
02:00:24,623 --> 02:00:26,422
I think...

2256
02:00:26,423 --> 02:00:29,691
this is my last chance.

2257
02:00:29,692 --> 02:00:32,261
I'm desperate for this dream.

2258
02:00:32,262 --> 02:00:33,702
(I'm desperate for Universe League.)

2259
02:00:34,562 --> 02:00:39,602
Sometimes, I wonder if anyone
can be as desperate as I am.

2260
02:00:39,732 --> 02:00:44,002
Because I've been
waiting for seven years now.

2261
02:00:44,003 --> 02:00:45,341
(Because I've been
waiting for 7 years now.)

2262
02:00:45,342 --> 02:00:49,383
I joined an agency when I
was 16 and became a trainee.

2263
02:00:49,682 --> 02:00:53,811
I spent most of the period...

2264
02:00:53,812 --> 02:00:56,982
for building my ego...

2265
02:00:57,423 --> 02:01:02,863
in the practice room
with my fellow trainees.

2266
02:01:03,692 --> 02:01:06,191
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

2267
02:01:06,192 --> 02:01:09,762
(He chased his goal to debut for 7 years.)

2268
02:01:10,432 --> 02:01:13,572
When I think about it, I've
never been onstage before.

2269
02:01:13,573 --> 02:01:15,141
I've never performed
properly onstage before.

2270
02:01:15,142 --> 02:01:18,471
I never sang or danced
in front of a crowd before.

2271
02:01:18,472 --> 02:01:20,272
No one knows who I am.

2272
02:01:21,342 --> 02:01:22,682
I don't want to...

2273
02:01:23,642 --> 02:01:27,083
sing and dance in front
of a mirror anymore.

2274
02:01:29,682 --> 02:01:32,452
I want the whole world to know.

2275
02:01:32,453 --> 02:01:35,923
I want to show them who I am.

2276
02:01:37,192 --> 02:01:41,463
(The players are trying for
Universe League with desperation.)

2277
02:01:43,003 --> 02:01:46,133
This is a tough song.

2278
02:01:46,503 --> 02:01:48,972
This is a hard song.

2279
02:01:49,942 --> 02:01:52,772
(What's the song every
director says is hard?)

2280
02:01:53,373 --> 02:01:56,942
(RIIZE released "Siren"
before their official debut.)

2281
02:01:57,883 --> 02:02:01,481
(It's an intense song with
a difficult performance)

2282
02:02:01,482 --> 02:02:03,181
Honestly, no one pulled it off yet...

2283
02:02:03,182 --> 02:02:06,122
- on audition shows. - Right.

2284
02:02:06,123 --> 02:02:07,722
No one.

2285
02:02:08,062 --> 02:02:10,191
Either they really pull it
off or mess it up big time.

2286
02:02:10,192 --> 02:02:11,332
That's why I'm looking forward to it.

2287
02:02:11,333 --> 02:02:14,363
- If they pull it off... - Universe League.

2288
02:02:14,463 --> 02:02:17,972
- Are you ready? - Yes!

2289
02:02:18,402 --> 02:02:20,902
(The players send a loud cheer.)

2290
02:02:21,902 --> 02:02:22,971
Good luck.

2291
02:02:22,972 --> 02:02:25,242
(How will they perform the
extremely difficult song?)

2292
02:02:25,243 --> 02:02:27,641
My teammates are the ones you go to...

2293
02:02:27,642 --> 02:02:29,182
for a great performance.

2294
02:02:29,342 --> 02:02:31,243
I'm confident we'll kill it.

2295
02:02:31,583 --> 02:02:34,312
I will devote my seven
years to the performance...

2296
02:02:34,512 --> 02:02:35,852
and become a starting player.

2297
02:02:36,623 --> 02:02:39,151
I'm a fighter. I will not lose.

2298
02:02:39,152 --> 02:02:41,152
I will become a starting player.

2299
02:02:53,972 --> 02:02:57,401
("Siren" by Jiang Fan, Kim Hyo
Tae, Koo Han Seo, Li Zhinuo, )

2300
02:02:57,402 --> 02:02:58,442
(Park Han, Steven)

2301
02:03:17,123 --> 02:03:18,163
They're good at dancing.

2302
02:03:22,402 --> 02:03:23,402
Hey!

2303
02:03:56,062 --> 02:03:57,663
- Hey. - Goodness.

2304
02:03:59,102 --> 02:04:00,203
They're good.

2305
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,692
(How cool.)

2306
02:04:40,113 --> 02:04:41,243
Isn't he amazing?

2307
02:04:53,092 --> 02:04:54,092
Hey!

2308
02:05:00,493 --> 02:05:01,502
What?

2309
02:05:01,503 --> 02:05:03,302
- Who is he? - This guy.

2310
02:05:11,842 --> 02:05:13,012
Gosh, here he comes again.

2311
02:05:39,873 --> 02:05:41,003
That was fantastic.

2312
02:05:43,272 --> 02:05:44,272
Nice.

2313
02:05:45,373 --> 02:05:50,942
(All the directors were satisfied
with the quality of performance.)

2314
02:05:51,142 --> 02:05:52,312
That was legendary.

2315
02:05:52,883 --> 02:05:54,152
They were incredible.

2316
02:05:55,583 --> 02:05:57,622
That was the performance by Group "Siren."

2317
02:05:57,623 --> 02:05:59,622
All right. Directors.

2318
02:05:59,623 --> 02:06:02,192
What did you think about their performance?

2319
02:06:03,363 --> 02:06:06,033
The song, "Siren,"

2320
02:06:06,633 --> 02:06:08,333
is quite tough.

2321
02:06:08,432 --> 02:06:11,101
- It looks tough. - You either do well...

2322
02:06:11,102 --> 02:06:12,333
or do really bad.

2323
02:06:12,732 --> 02:06:14,533
It's 1 of the 2. There's no middle.

2324
02:06:15,243 --> 02:06:16,902
From what I saw,

2325
02:06:17,573 --> 02:06:20,673
you killed it today.

2326
02:06:21,043 --> 02:06:22,642
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2327
02:06:22,812 --> 02:06:23,883
That's a high praise.

2328
02:06:24,182 --> 02:06:27,212
I've watched many covers of "Siren."

2329
02:06:27,213 --> 02:06:31,322
But this performance was the best...

2330
02:06:31,323 --> 02:06:32,623
among all the covers.

2331
02:06:32,722 --> 02:06:35,493
- Really? - Yes. I was very happy with it.

2332
02:06:38,732 --> 02:06:39,732
What a high praise.

2333
02:06:40,692 --> 02:06:44,102
I wasn't sure if they could
sing live while dancing.

2334
02:06:44,432 --> 02:06:46,772
But everyone was powerful...

2335
02:06:47,033 --> 02:06:48,901
and did an overall good job.

2336
02:06:48,902 --> 02:06:50,972
I was very satisfied and
enjoyed the performance.

2337
02:06:54,113 --> 02:06:55,182
That was cool.

2338
02:06:55,942 --> 02:06:56,982
Seriously.

2339
02:06:57,182 --> 02:06:59,782
I was bewitched by the performance.

2340
02:06:59,783 --> 02:07:01,282
- Were you? - Yes. It was so cool...

2341
02:07:01,283 --> 02:07:02,623
that I simply kept watching.

2342
02:07:02,852 --> 02:07:04,123
You were seriously cool.

2343
02:07:06,123 --> 02:07:08,963
(All the directors praised "Siren.")

2344
02:07:09,522 --> 02:07:12,333
Whoever gets picked, I agree with it.

2345
02:07:18,732 --> 02:07:20,402
I bet this is the toughest performance.

2346
02:07:21,232 --> 02:07:22,243
No wonder they went last.

2347
02:07:22,373 --> 02:07:23,503
Really.

2348
02:07:23,602 --> 02:07:25,472
Is it Park Han?

2349
02:07:25,743 --> 02:07:27,673
The guy in the center
wearing a black jacket.

2350
02:07:27,772 --> 02:07:29,142
He stood out to me.

2351
02:07:29,743 --> 02:07:30,743
Same here.

2352
02:07:30,982 --> 02:07:32,152
He was flying around.

2353
02:07:33,453 --> 02:07:34,783
I can't even do push-ups.

2354
02:07:36,583 --> 02:07:39,493
(At a crossroads while scouting players)

2355
02:07:40,152 --> 02:07:42,062
- Let's do it. - I'll go with this guy.

2356
02:07:42,163 --> 02:07:43,163
Okay.

2357
02:07:43,993 --> 02:07:44,993
I'm in.

2358
02:07:44,994 --> 02:07:47,092
He really caught my eye.

2359
02:07:49,302 --> 02:07:53,202
Honestly, we only need three players...

2360
02:07:53,203 --> 02:07:55,502
who are great at dancing.

2361
02:07:55,503 --> 02:07:57,572
Everyone was amazing.

2362
02:07:57,573 --> 02:07:58,743
- It's hard. - Right?

2363
02:07:59,243 --> 02:08:00,743
- Four, three, - Let's go.

2364
02:08:01,113 --> 02:08:02,982
Two, one.

2365
02:08:03,613 --> 02:08:07,753
That's all the time you
get to nominate the players.

2366
02:08:08,323 --> 02:08:10,282
Performing onstage has
always been my dream.

2367
02:08:10,283 --> 02:08:11,892
I want to keep performing onstage.

2368
02:08:12,823 --> 02:08:14,823
I must become a starting player.

2369
02:08:18,833 --> 02:08:22,003
Let us reveal the First
Pick for TEAM GROOVE.

2370
02:08:22,762 --> 02:08:24,203
Who is it?

2371
02:08:26,503 --> 02:08:27,703
I hope we don't overlap.

2372
02:08:28,743 --> 02:08:32,272
(Who did TEAM GROOVE pick?)

2373
02:08:33,243 --> 02:08:34,742
(Park Han)

2374
02:08:34,743 --> 02:08:35,811
Here it is.

2375
02:08:35,812 --> 02:08:38,112
(First pick, GROOVE, Park Han)

2376
02:08:38,113 --> 02:08:41,652
TEAM GROOVE picked Park Han.

2377
02:08:48,022 --> 02:08:51,463
Let us reveal the First
Pick for TEAM RHYTHM.

2378
02:08:52,163 --> 02:08:56,562
(First pick, GROOVE, Park Han)

2379
02:08:56,963 --> 02:08:58,633
(Come to our team.)

2380
02:08:58,972 --> 02:09:01,743
Here's TEAM RHYTHM's First Pick.

2381
02:09:02,503 --> 02:09:04,902
(Steven)

2382
02:09:05,743 --> 02:09:09,242
TEAM RHYTHM picked Steven.

2383
02:09:09,243 --> 02:09:10,243
Thank you.

2384
02:09:11,283 --> 02:09:12,283
Congratulations.

2385
02:09:12,284 --> 02:09:13,352
(Feeling relieved)

2386
02:09:13,652 --> 02:09:15,383
(Glaring)

2387
02:09:17,753 --> 02:09:20,453
Without knowing, I kept looking at him.

2388
02:09:20,592 --> 02:09:24,363
He has a mysterious vibe.
That's why we picked him.

2389
02:09:27,833 --> 02:09:30,061
The two teams have
nominated different players.

2390
02:09:30,062 --> 02:09:33,072
Lastly, let us reveal the
First Pick for TEAM BEAT.

2391
02:09:33,073 --> 02:09:34,353
(Who is TEAM BEAT's First Pick?)

2392
02:09:34,533 --> 02:09:35,543
I have no idea.

2393
02:09:38,713 --> 02:09:41,613
- I think they overlapped.
- I think so too.

2394
02:09:42,413 --> 02:09:44,641
Here's TEAM BEAT's First Pick.

2395
02:09:44,642 --> 02:09:48,883
(First pick, RHYTHM,
Steven, GROOVE, Park Han)

2396
02:09:49,982 --> 02:09:52,753
(How could this happen?)

2397
02:09:53,753 --> 02:09:55,122
(Park Han)

2398
02:09:55,123 --> 02:09:59,162
TEAM BEAT has picked Park Han.

2399
02:09:59,163 --> 02:10:05,633
(First pick, RHYTHM, Steven,
GROOVE, BEAT, Park Han)

2400
02:10:08,503 --> 02:10:11,202
(TEAM GROOVE and TEAM
BEAT's First Pick has overlapped.)

2401
02:10:11,203 --> 02:10:13,213
(Having fun)

2402
02:10:14,613 --> 02:10:16,681
- How come? - I got drawn in by him.

2403
02:10:16,682 --> 02:10:19,182
- How come? - He drew me in.

2404
02:10:21,052 --> 02:10:22,783
- I'm with you. - Right?

2405
02:10:22,883 --> 02:10:23,883
Thank you.

2406
02:10:24,352 --> 02:10:27,622
Firstly, Steven who has been...

2407
02:10:27,623 --> 02:10:31,322
picked first solo can
head to the team seat.

2408
02:10:31,323 --> 02:10:32,663
Okay. Thank you.

2409
02:10:34,592 --> 02:10:35,602
Thank you.

2410
02:10:36,533 --> 02:10:37,533
I'm jealous.

2411
02:10:38,573 --> 02:10:40,003
Congratulations.

2412
02:10:40,703 --> 02:10:42,373
You were great.

2413
02:10:43,573 --> 02:10:46,011
I'm grateful they called out my name.

2414
02:10:46,012 --> 02:10:48,113
It's a chance I cannot miss.

2415
02:10:48,272 --> 02:10:52,082
Now then, TEAM BEAT is having...

2416
02:10:52,083 --> 02:10:54,113
the hardest time forming the team.

2417
02:10:54,552 --> 02:10:56,352
The First Pick overlapped again.

2418
02:10:56,722 --> 02:10:58,253
Why do you need Park Han?

2419
02:10:59,123 --> 02:11:01,152
I saw his desperation
during the performance.

2420
02:11:01,522 --> 02:11:04,493
And he just grabbed my attention.

2421
02:11:04,863 --> 02:11:06,562
My reasons are similar to his.

2422
02:11:09,363 --> 02:11:11,362
(Being loved by the directors)

2423
02:11:11,363 --> 02:11:15,033
I know the feeling of
desperation. I've been there before.

2424
02:11:15,373 --> 02:11:19,472
I will make that desperation come true.

2425
02:11:19,842 --> 02:11:20,842
Okay.

2426
02:11:21,113 --> 02:11:24,583
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask them now.

2427
02:11:26,982 --> 02:11:30,423
I already have a team in mind.

2428
02:11:30,953 --> 02:11:31,953
Already?

2429
02:11:31,954 --> 02:11:34,192
(A bolt out of the blue)

2430
02:11:37,092 --> 02:11:38,092
Please.

2431
02:11:38,093 --> 02:11:39,133
(Praying earnestly)

2432
02:11:39,633 --> 02:11:41,833
Chang Sub. Don't look so down already.

2433
02:11:44,833 --> 02:11:48,232
(He has given up on hope.)

2434
02:11:53,573 --> 02:11:54,672
(Please.)

2435
02:11:54,673 --> 02:11:55,913
Let's hear it right away.

2436
02:11:56,743 --> 02:11:58,143
Tell us which team you have chosen.

2437
02:11:58,953 --> 02:12:01,253
(Which team will Park Han choose?)

2438
02:12:01,283 --> 02:12:03,423
- Okay, I... - Please come to our team.

2439
02:12:03,967 --> 02:12:04,779
Okay, I...

2440
02:12:06,833 --> 02:12:12,052
(Even the players are hoping for Park Han.)

2441
02:12:12,374 --> 02:12:13,514
Okay, I...

2442
02:12:14,513 --> 02:12:15,513
choose TEAM GROOVE.

2443
02:12:15,514 --> 02:12:19,209
(Park Han chooses TEAM GROOVE.)

2444
02:12:20,882 --> 02:12:24,552
(Hurrah!)

2445
02:12:25,882 --> 02:12:29,852
(Feeling incredibly proud)

2446
02:12:31,993 --> 02:12:33,492
Welcome.

2447
02:12:33,493 --> 02:12:37,333
(The players are as happy as the director.)

2448
02:12:37,993 --> 02:12:41,601
(TEAM BEAT has failed
to scout 3 players in a row.)

2449
02:12:41,602 --> 02:12:45,172
(TEAM BEAT has failed
to scout 3 players in a row.)

2450
02:12:45,903 --> 02:12:47,902
(Devastated)

2451
02:12:47,903 --> 02:12:48,942
TEAM BEAT.

2452
02:12:49,603 --> 02:12:51,573
TEAM BEAT. YUGYEOM!

2453
02:12:52,872 --> 02:12:56,513
(Leaving his seat)

2454
02:12:56,853 --> 02:12:58,112
(What do we do?)

2455
02:13:01,452 --> 02:13:04,221
Where are you going?
You can't quit already.

2456
02:13:04,222 --> 02:13:05,292
(He wants to go home.)

2457
02:13:05,423 --> 02:13:07,923
(The choice makes one
happy while the other sad.)

2458
02:13:08,362 --> 02:13:10,192
- I'm feeling dizzy. - Wait.

2459
02:13:10,663 --> 02:13:12,463
You keep losing whenever
the player overlaps.

2460
02:13:12,933 --> 02:13:16,031
(The players TEAM BEAT failed to scout)

2461
02:13:16,032 --> 02:13:19,273
Our team will prove itself from now on.

2462
02:13:19,403 --> 02:13:21,302
- Totally. - We'll prove it.

2463
02:13:21,942 --> 02:13:22,972
Let's do this!

2464
02:13:23,103 --> 02:13:27,612
(Let's go, TEAM BEAT.)

2465
02:13:29,743 --> 02:13:32,212
All right. TEAM BEAT, pick your...

2466
02:13:32,782 --> 02:13:33,823
starting player.

2467
02:13:34,253 --> 02:13:35,852
(Who is TEAM BEAT's Second Pick?)

2468
02:13:35,853 --> 02:13:37,023
Actually...

2469
02:13:38,093 --> 02:13:40,263
- I picked him. - He was great at dancing.

2470
02:13:40,663 --> 02:13:43,532
His dance moves were extraordinary.

2471
02:13:43,833 --> 02:13:47,301
(A player TEAM RHYTHM identifies at once?)

2472
02:13:47,302 --> 02:13:48,862
- Jiang Fan. - Jiang Fan.

2473
02:13:50,003 --> 02:13:51,673
(Jiang Fan)

2474
02:13:51,872 --> 02:13:53,441
- Jiang Fan. - Thank you.

2475
02:13:53,442 --> 02:13:57,513
(TEAM BEAT's Second Pick is Jiang Fan.)

2476
02:13:59,343 --> 02:14:01,583
- Welcome. - Hi.

2477
02:14:02,013 --> 02:14:04,712
- Hi. - Thank you.

2478
02:14:07,523 --> 02:14:10,593
(TEAM BEAT's last
starting player is Jiang Fan.)

2479
02:14:10,853 --> 02:14:12,621
- Welcome. - Hi.

2480
02:14:12,622 --> 02:14:14,362
- Great work. - Good job.

2481
02:14:14,462 --> 02:14:16,662
Welcome. Thanks.

2482
02:14:16,663 --> 02:14:19,093
(Welcome. Thanks.)

2483
02:14:20,603 --> 02:14:22,903
I wasn't sure if it was real.

2484
02:14:23,403 --> 02:14:26,132
I'm a step closer to my dream now.

2485
02:14:27,442 --> 02:14:29,872
I had a mix of many feelings.

2486
02:14:30,872 --> 02:14:33,811
The starting players of each
team have been decided.

2487
02:14:33,812 --> 02:14:36,512
(The 7 starting players are complete.)

2488
02:14:36,513 --> 02:14:37,552
Good work to everyone.

2489
02:14:38,413 --> 02:14:41,153

in Universe League if they

2508
02:15:28,333 --> 02:15:32,673

2509
02:15:33,003 --> 02:15:35,503
Today? Are they eliminated today?

2510
02:15:36,273 --> 02:15:37,343
How scary.

2511
02:15:37,872 --> 02:15:41,743
I don't want to go home right now.

2512
02:15:42,782 --> 02:15:45,082
I want to stay here longer.

2513
02:15:45,083 --> 02:15:46,952
I have much more to show.

2514
02:15:52,823 --> 02:15:55,023
You are given...

2515
02:15:55,622 --> 02:15:56,763
one more chance.

2516
02:15:58,062 --> 02:15:59,961
The last chance to be scouted into a team.

2517
02:15:59,962 --> 02:16:01,833
(The last chance to survive)

2518
02:16:03,132 --> 02:16:04,933
(The last chance for the teamless players)

2519
02:16:06,233 --> 02:16:07,801
(I will perform like it's my last stage.)

2520
02:16:07,802 --> 02:16:08,942
(It starts now.)

2521
02:16:09,243 --> 02:16:10,348
(I will show them for sure.)

2522
02:16:10,372 --> 02:16:11,372
(It's the last chance.)

2523
02:16:11,573 --> 02:16:12,772
(Sing the Korean national anthem.)

2524
02:16:12,773 --> 02:16:14,743
(Again. You're out of tune.)

2525
02:16:15,013 --> 02:16:16,712
The meaning of this time

2526
02:16:18,112 --> 02:16:19,152
(Disappointed)

2527
02:16:19,153 --> 02:16:20,282
(I'm losing it.)

2528
02:16:20,952 --> 02:16:22,023
- Good grief. - I'm done.

2529
02:16:22,222 --> 02:16:24,923
(What is the fate of the boys
who are near elimination?)

2530
02:16:25,993 --> 02:16:27,263
(I want to try.)

2531
02:16:27,823 --> 02:16:28,862
(Player...)

2532
02:16:29,323 --> 02:16:30,362
(You are eliminated.)

2533
02:16:30,862 --> 02:16:33,263
(What is the final result
of the Bench Test?)

2534
02:16:34,802 --> 02:16:39,273
(Was I bad?)

2535
02:16:39,503 --> 02:16:42,302
(And...)

2536
02:16:42,503 --> 02:16:44,303
(the competition to
debut officially starts.)

2537
02:16:44,673 --> 02:16:45,743
They're good.

2538
02:16:46,372 --> 02:16:47,442
We'll win.

2539
02:16:48,013 --> 02:16:49,042
It's worth a shot.

2540
02:16:53,483 --> 02:16:56,822
I will do my best and
defend my starting position.

2541
02:16:56,823 --> 02:16:58,853
(Universe League)
