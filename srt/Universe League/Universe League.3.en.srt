(First Half Starting Lineup Match)

4
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:12,532
Are you ready?

5
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:13,562
- Yes! - Yes!

6
00:00:14,272 --> 00:00:17,673
(A good match with their pride on the line)

7
00:00:19,502 --> 00:00:21,742
(As expected from the starting players,)

8
00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:23,143
(they pumped everyone up.)

9
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:26,242
(The first half of the starting lineup match has ended.)

10

12
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:32,422
(TEAM RHYTHM ranked 1st place in the starting lineup match.)

13
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:34,253
What? For real?

14
00:00:34,553 --> 00:00:38,763
(Unfortunately, TEAM GROOVE's starting players ranked 2nd.)

15
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:41,992
(Well done.)

16
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,702
(Due to numerous mistakes, TEAM BEAT ranked last.)

17
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:47,132
(If this continues, it's six yellow cards.)

18
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:49,702
(This is bad.)

19
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,503
(The league continues with the second half Bench Match.)

20
00:00:53,202 --> 00:00:55,142
(We have to kill the performance.)

21
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,212
Guys.

22
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:58,083

23
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,943
(We will beat TEAM GROOVE and TEAM RHYTHM...)

24
00:00:59,943 --> 00:01:02,053
(and rank 1st place.)

25
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,783
(The bench players' rebellion begins.)

26
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,382

46
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:12,283
(The 2nd half of Round 1 finally begins.)

47
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:17,593
(The two teams aim to turn the tables in this match.)

48
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:20,623
- Gosh. - Let's go!

49
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:21,632
Go!

50
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:22,632
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench is up first.)

51
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:24,232
- The bench team... - Gosh.

52
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:25,463
has to do well.

53
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:26,463
- Okay. - Okay.

54
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:28,702
- Show them your attitude. - Understood.

55
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,473
We're in first place right now. Show them what you've got.

56
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:32,602
- Okay. - Okay.

57
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,003
Let's go, "Baggy Jeans."

58
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:35,112
"Baggy Jeans."

59
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:36,142
- Go! - Let's go!

60
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:37,273
- Go kill it! - Good luck!

61
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:38,542
- Good luck! - Nice!

62
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,243
We will win. We are the winner.

63
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,253
Let's go, brother!

64
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,653
- Let's go! - Let's go!

65
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:43,783
Go!

66
00:02:43,882 --> 00:02:45,223
The first performance.

67
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:47,822
Please come on out, TEAM RHYTHM's bench players.

68
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:56,132
Hi.

69
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,362
- Hi. - Hi.

70
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:59,762
- Hi. - Hi.

71
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,832
- Hi. - Hi.

72
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,773
- Hi. - Hi.

73
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:04,903
Kwon Hee Jun.

74
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:07,572
(Hee Jun)

75
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:08,612
Ayumu.

76
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:10,373
Eito.

77
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:13,183
Mac. Li Zhinuo.

78
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,783
Xie Yuxin. Jin Ziming.

79
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:18,653
Two, three.

80
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:19,822
- Rhythm! - Rhythm!

81
00:03:20,653 --> 00:03:22,892
- We can do it! - We can do it!

82
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:24,922
(We can do it!)

83
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:27,193
Hi.

84
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:30,033
- Hi. - We're TEAM RHYTHM's bench team.

85
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,533
- We're in your care. - We're in your care.

86
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,903
(Breathing out)

87
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:35,172
- Hee Jun looks nervous. - He's nervous.

88
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:37,433
Why does he look so sad?

89
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,802
Hee Jun!

90
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,373
But he easily gets nervous.

91
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,213
- Hee Jun. - Yes?

92
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:44,683
Are you confident you'll win today?

93
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:49,753
The starting team before us performed perfectly.

94
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,683
Ours will be much more perfect...

95
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:57,153
so TEAM RHYTHM can win first place in this match.

96
00:03:57,762 --> 00:03:59,023
Let's do this!

97
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,322
- Let's do this! - Let's go!

98
00:04:01,563 --> 00:04:04,632
Who says they can?

99
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,033
Our bench will get first place.

100
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,302
We didn't approve of it yet.

101
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:08,403
- I'm afraid... - No.

102
00:04:08,403 --> 00:04:09,503
our bench will come first place.

103
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:10,672
- I'm sorry. - GROOVE's bench.

104
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:11,873
No. Sorry.

105
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,042
- We won't let that happen. - Never.

106
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,143
Never.

107
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:16,612
Being ambitious is good.

108
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:20,143
(We won't lose it.)

109
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:23,812
Nice. What performance did you prepare for today?

110
00:04:24,953 --> 00:04:26,883
We prepared NCT U's...

111
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:29,653
"Baggy Jeans."

112
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:31,023
(Director TEN's group)

113
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:33,122
(Amazed)

114
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:39,502
(A catchy melody)

115
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:44,672
(The sharp performance is the signature of "Baggy Jeans.")

116
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:46,403
(That's the song?)

117
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:50,612
(I have faith in you guys.)

118
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:53,742
(What will TEAM RHYTHM's "Baggy Jeans" look like?)

119
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,653
- Look at them. - Let's go.

120
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:56,852
Here I go, guys.

121
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:59,283
- Let's go! - Oh, my gosh.

122
00:05:02,153 --> 00:05:05,692
(The choreography starts with a catchy move.)

123
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:09,062
(Restrained power is the choreography's characteristic.)

124
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,232
I want this part.

125
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:14,473
- That's so cool. - It's cool.

126
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:16,232
The performance was really challenging.

127
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:19,672
"Will we be able to do it?"

128
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:22,013
That was my biggest concern.

129
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:25,013
(Excited)

130
00:05:25,013 --> 00:05:26,383
Oh, my gosh.

131
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:29,653
- We are the winner. - Oh, my gosh.

132
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:30,783
Oh, my gosh.

133
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,783
I'm shocked right now. How do we...

134
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:37,422
(The choreography draft made the younger brothers excited.)

135
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,122
Calm down.

136
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:42,292
- Calm down. - The dance break is coming.

137
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,102
- How do we... - Sorry.

138
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,302
decide the parts?

139
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:48,073
Our parts.

140
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,973
As for your parts,

141
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:56,172
Directors TEN and YANGYANG will come the day after tomorrow.

142
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,583
They will decide your parts.

143
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,713
(Before the part distribution,)

144
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:02,112
We can do it.

145
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,852
(they have two days to practice.)

146
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:07,922
There's this choreography in the introduction.

147
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:11,523
I think that's the highlight.

148
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:16,432
(Part 1 is the catchy highlight of the introduction.)

149
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:18,062
I want to do part one.

150
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:19,062
Part one for sure.

151
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:22,133
I was going to get part one, one way or another.

152
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:26,643
(The players are practicing the parts they want.)

153
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:28,742
Hey.

154
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:31,942
Can you listen to me once?

155
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:33,413
I see.

156
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:38,453
I take another big breath

157
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:41,453
Can you do it more than strong?

158
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:42,953
- What? - More than strong.

159
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,922
"More than strong?" Do you mean stronger?

160
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,862
A little bit stronger.

161
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:49,932
I'll do my best.

162
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:53,163
Guys, I'll check your pronunciation.

163
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:54,802
Can you try?

164
00:06:54,802 --> 00:06:58,442
(Correcting the pronunciation of the players not good at Korean)

165
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:01,913
(Glancing)

166
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:04,213
It's written as "I can do,"

167
00:07:04,213 --> 00:07:05,843
- "I can do..." - but repeat after me.

168
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:07,913
"I can do."

169
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:10,752
(Coaching each player)

170
00:07:10,953 --> 00:07:13,383
- Overall, we need to... - Yes?

171
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:14,823
We all...

172
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:18,723
need to articulate.

173
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:24,633
Okay?

174
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:25,633
(We all need to articulate.)

175
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:28,973
Right now, we look too kind.

176
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:31,703
And, just... "One, two, three..."

177
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:34,643
Hee Jun is very observative,

178
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,372
gentle,

179
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:41,182
and has a strong sense of responsibility.

180
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:46,252
In our group chat,

181
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:49,453
he uses all three languages.

182
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,393
It's to help our teammates understand better.

183
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,292
To be honest, I think I owe a lot of it...

184
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,963
to Hee Jun as well. So I'm really grateful that...

185
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,403
he's able to be there for us...

186
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:04,573
and give us that good feedback.

187
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:07,403
Hi.

188
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,742
- Hi. - Hi.

189
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:10,473
- Hi. - Hi.

190
00:08:11,413 --> 00:08:15,352
(The evaluation starts with Jin Ziming.)

191
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:28,033
(Mac goes after him.)

192
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:33,962
(Unsure)

193
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,802
How do I do this?

194
00:08:36,773 --> 00:08:37,773
Well...

195
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:46,182
Before memorizing the choreography,

196
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:49,312
you should get the basics of bouncing down first.

197
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,383
You don't look cool.

198
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:52,783
It's kind of...

199
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:56,493
"Baggy Jeans" needs that hip-hop vibe.

200
00:08:56,493 --> 00:09:00,462
Right now, you have no groove in your body.

201
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:03,033
There's no groove at all.

202
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,503
You don't look cool.

203
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:07,302
Good luck.

204
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,743
(Feeling the pressure, it's Hee Jun's turn.)

205
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:19,483
(Biting his lips)

206
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,353
- Thank you. - Good job.

207
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:31,462
From what I see, you look too light.

208
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,822
Putting aside the lack of energy,

209
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:37,133
there's no accent in your dance, from beginning to end.

210
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:40,503
You're being too gentle. The moves need to connect more.

211
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:41,873
This one too.

212
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:44,972
This was the amount of energy you used.

213
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:49,072
You should practice dragging the move out until the end.

214
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:53,283
I think it'll look better if you practice dancing...

215
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:54,783
while extending your muscles.

216
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:56,413
- Thank you. - Thank you.

217
00:09:56,413 --> 00:09:57,753
- Thank you. - Thank you.

218
00:09:58,383 --> 00:09:59,383
Thank you.

219
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:00,483
(Hee Jun's turn ended with disappointment.)

220
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,523
In today's interim check,

221
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:08,332
I couldn't show them as much as I had practiced.

222
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:11,363
I felt more bummed out than during practice.

223
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:14,932
- Next, Ayumu. - Yes.

224
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,133
Let's go.

225
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,003
- Good luck. - Let's go.

226
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:19,302
Dance.

227
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:27,442
(Focused eyes)

228
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:36,922
(Smiling brightly)

229
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,403
- Thank you. - Great job.

230
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:49,172
(The first compliment)

231
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:53,042
Your rhythm and bounce were good.

232
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:54,403
But here's one thing.

233
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,712
I want you to keep the moves going until the end.

234
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:01,783
Yes, but you danced well.

235
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:03,013
- Thank you. - Good.

236
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:05,182
(Ayumu is the only one who got praised.)

237
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:06,353
- Good job. - Now,

238
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:09,222
I will announce your parts.

239
00:11:09,322 --> 00:11:10,322
- Okay. - Okay.

240
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,663
Part one...

241
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:12,663
(Announcing the parts right away)

242
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:17,462
(Nervous)

243
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,503
goes to Ayumu.

244
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:21,903
(The highlight)

245
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:22,903
That's what we decided.

246
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:27,603
Overall, today's performance...

247
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:30,442
didn't meet...

248
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:33,082
my expectations.

249
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:34,983
You know, right?

250
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:37,413
Who did well and who didn't today.

251
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:40,322
- Yes. - You should put in more effort.

252
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:45,263
- Either way, this is a team battle. - Right.

253
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:46,562
If you are to...

254
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:51,062
get the yellow card twice, you won't be able to perform.

255
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:54,562
Think of that when you practice.

256
00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:58,342
- Let's do this. - Okay!

257
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,403
(He gives them cool-headed advice as he cares for his teammates.)

258
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:02,273
It was a bit disappointing, but I will do my best to practice...

259
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,472
and do well to perform.

260
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:07,442
(After the interim check and part distribution)

261
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:14,082
I should've been sent back to China if this were going to happen.

262
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:18,023
(I should've been sent back to China if this were going to happen.)

263
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,023
To be honest,

264
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:27,432
I don't want to accept the part distribution.

265
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:32,403
If I were to take that part,

266
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:34,042
I think I would've done a better job.

267
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:36,413
I'm dissatisfied.

268
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:44,682
(They practice again the next day.)

269
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:46,983
(They start warming up 1 by 1.)

270
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,952
There were a few members...

271
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:53,393
who had trouble focusing.

272
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:56,163
I think I showed my complaints about the part distribution...

273
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,633
a lot during practice.

274
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,202
There's a sound like a boom.

275
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:02,932
(Even during the dance lesson the next day,)

276
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:06,143
(he stood there blankly without thinking about practicing.)

277
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:09,743
(Jin Ziming can't seem to focus at all.)

278
00:13:09,743 --> 00:13:12,312
One, two, three, four,

279
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,613
five, six.

280
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,983
Jin Ziming couldn't focus,

281
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:18,253
and he kept sitting on his own.

282
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:21,452
Eito is sick right now.

283
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,822
- Right. - Still?

284
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:26,163
I heard Eito is really sick.

285
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:27,222
Eito.

286
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:29,893
I think I can do anything

287
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,302
Eito missed practice for three days.

288
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:34,733
He kept sitting out because he was sick.

289
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,832
(He kept sitting out because he was sick.)

290
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:39,942
Eito missed almost everything.

291
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:43,013
(They try to practice without Eito.)

292
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:47,682
(They can't practice properly because of Jin Ziming and Eito.)

293
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:51,483
We are all here to achieve something.

294
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,853
If there are people who aren't even going to practice hard,

295
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:57,452
I don't know why they are here.

296
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:02,092
(Hee Jun, Jin Ziming)

297
00:14:03,363 --> 00:14:07,263
(Hee Jun reaches out to him first as the older one.)

298
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,332
Jin Ziming is upset.

299
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:13,342
We can do this. Positive vibes!

300
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:16,773
But we're one team.

301
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:19,283
No matter how small their part is,

302
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:22,113
the performance cannot be complete without them.

303
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,812
I will make sure to put the performance together...

304
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:27,983
no matter what.

305
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:31,023
(It's finally the final day of practice.)

306
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:37,562
We did really well during the first chorus.

307
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,932
(Amazed)

308
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:44,633
Do you see our formation?

309
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:46,572
It can't get any better than this.

310
00:14:46,903 --> 00:14:48,442
It's absolutely perfect.

311
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,013
This has to be applauded.

312
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:52,883
I really want to make my team become the winning team.

313
00:14:53,883 --> 00:14:56,113
I will grind in everything that I have to make this possible.

314
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:58,353
We can do this.

315
00:14:58,353 --> 00:14:59,822
(We can do this.)

316
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,653
Let's go, Kwon Hee Jun!

317
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:07,263
(Excited)

318
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:09,462
Ready? Go.

319
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,763
Ayumu is the center.

320
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:16,302
("Baggy Jeans" by Ayumu, Eito, Jin Ziming,)

321
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:17,873
(Kwon Hee Jun, Li Zhinuo, Mac, Xie Yuxin)

322
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:24,743
Nice.

323
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:34,853
Hey, let's go!

324
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:24,332
That was great.

325
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:26,643
- Check out their expressions! - Let's go!

326
00:16:59,243 --> 00:17:00,842
He looks nervous. Oh, no.

327
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:02,472
He's straining too much.

328
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:25,732
- It's okay. - It's okay.

329
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:27,232
Just do well with the choreography.

330
00:17:33,143 --> 00:17:34,143
Let's go!

331
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:49,653
(Frozen)

332
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:54,823
Let's go!

333
00:18:17,682 --> 00:18:18,682
Baggy!

334
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,093
But...

335
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:01,262
- What is it? - Never mind.

336
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,333
Eito.

337
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,903
(The level of completion was below expectations,)

338
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:11,573
(and the members of TEAM RHYTHM become speechless.)

339
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:13,643
(Smirking)

340
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:16,573
(The other directors look a lot more confident.)

341
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:21,413
(The other directors look a lot more confident.)

342
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,482
As of right now...

343
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:24,252
As of right now,

344
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,782
I think you guys are untouchable.

345
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:28,553
(As of right now, I think you guys are untouchable.)

346
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:33,992
(The tables have turned in an instant.)

347
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:36,893
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench members...)

348
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:42,972
(are breathing heavily and struggling to lift their heads.)

349
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:45,472
(Slipping)

350
00:19:45,472 --> 00:19:47,803
(The highlight was given up so easily with a mistake.)

351
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:51,873
(The dance moves were careless.)

352
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,452
(There was a voice crack too.)

353
00:19:56,413 --> 00:20:02,853
(The level of completion was lacking overall for TEAM RHYTHM's bench.)

354
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,663
The vote will begin right away.

355
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,692
The vote will be an individual evaluation.

356
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:11,063
The team's rank will be decided...

357
00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:12,633
after all individual scores are added together.

358
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:16,172
The one with the most votes will become the MVP.

359
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:17,333
(Round 1 Rules)

360
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,373
Three,

361
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:19,772
two,

362
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:20,903
one.

363
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,643
Okay.

364
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:23,813
(Voting closed.)

365
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,043
All right.

366
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:27,712
Let's see who will become the MVP.

367
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:30,512
This is really hard to decide.

368
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:33,353
I think it'll be the Korean guy.

369
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:37,222
(Hee Jun who did well with the main rapper part?)

370
00:20:37,422 --> 00:20:40,663
- I think it'll be Xie Yuxin. - Xie Yuxin did really well.

371
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:42,833
- Right. - Right. Xie Yuxin.

372
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,803
(Xie Yuxin who performed with stable vocals?)

373
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:47,803
The MVP of this performance is...

374
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:53,603
(Who will become the MVP of TEAM RHYTHM's bench?)

375
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:56,012
Kwon Hee Jun!

376
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,073
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench's MVP, Kwon Hee Jun)

377
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:00,982
Congratulations!

378
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:03,083
(Hee Jun sees himself on the LED screen...)

379
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,512
(and bursts into tears.)

380
00:21:07,252 --> 00:21:08,682
- Hee Jun. - Don't cry.

381
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:10,893
- Don't cry. - Great job.

382
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,462
(Hugging)

383
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,293
You did well!

384
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:16,992
- You did well! - Thank you, our leader.

385
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:20,462
You're the best leader.

386
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,903
(The teammates comfort Hee Jun who worked really hard.)

387
00:21:22,903 --> 00:21:25,303
But it was really hard for him.

388
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:27,043
He had to communicate with them in English...

389
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:29,143
with the translation app.

390
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:32,413
(Relating to the leader)

391
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:36,153
(Holding in his tears)

392
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:40,682
It must've been hard for everyone, to be honest.

393
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:42,653
- Great job! - Thank you...

394
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:44,653
for following me until the end,

395
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:47,722
even though I lacked as a leader.

396
00:21:50,192 --> 00:21:51,732
- You did well! - Don't cry!

397
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:53,962
- You did well! - Don't cry!

398
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,603
- Don't cry! - Don't cry!

399
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:59,073
To be really honest, it was very tough.

400
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:02,813
But we did our best to prepare for the performance.

401
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,573
Both my teammates and I worked very hard.

402
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:08,613
It's true that we were competing against each other,

403
00:22:08,613 --> 00:22:11,512
but we prepared for the performance with our sweat and tears.

404
00:22:11,512 --> 00:22:13,752
(A time of tears and laughter as teammates)

405
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,653
I felt grateful and sorry to my teammates...

406
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:18,692
at the same time.

407
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:20,962
- Don't cry! - Gosh!

408
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:22,863
- You did well. - You did well.

409
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,992
- You did well. - You did really well.

410
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:27,663
- You did really well. - Right.

411
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:29,633
- You all did well. - Thank you.

412
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,202
- "Baggy Jeans!" - You did well.

413
00:22:31,202 --> 00:22:33,143
- Nice one. - Thank you.

414
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:36,172
- You did well. - Thank you.

415
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,373
You did well.

416
00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:39,942
Hold on. It's us next.

417
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,813
- Right. - Isn't it us?

418
00:22:41,813 --> 00:22:43,353
We have to turn things around.

419
00:22:43,353 --> 00:22:44,813
(We have to turn things around.)

420
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:46,583
It isn't over until it's over.

421
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,952
Right.

422
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:51,952
(After watching the disappointing performance by TEAM RHYTHM,)

423
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:56,232
(TEAM BEAT sees this as a chance to turn things around.)

424
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:57,663
We will carry the team.

425
00:22:57,663 --> 00:22:59,663
You should get us 3,000 points.

426
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,962
- Okay. We can do that. - Okay.

427
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:03,232
- Really? - Okay.

428
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:05,702
- This is why we are a team. - We can do this.

429
00:23:05,702 --> 00:23:08,073
We'll get six yellow cards if it ends like this.

430
00:23:09,212 --> 00:23:11,643
We'll turn things around with this performance...

431
00:23:11,942 --> 00:23:13,512
and take first place.

432
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:14,782
(We'll take 1st place.)

433
00:23:15,553 --> 00:23:20,522
(The only chance to turn things around with the ranks)

434
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:23,893
We'll move on to the next performance.

435
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,863
Make sure to do well.

436
00:23:28,863 --> 00:23:30,333
- Let's go! - Passion!

437
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,603
- You trust us, right? - I trust you.

438
00:23:32,603 --> 00:23:33,903
- Do well for us. - You trust us, right?

439
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:36,373
- The P word. Passion! - You are all we can trust now.

440
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,432
Okay.

441
00:23:38,073 --> 00:23:39,972
Okay. Go and carry us.

442
00:23:39,972 --> 00:23:41,043
- Okay! - Okay!

443
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:42,413
TEAM BEAT. One, two, three!

444
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:44,373
- Let's go! - Let's go!

445
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:47,113
- Let's go! - Let's go and carry hard!

446
00:23:47,113 --> 00:23:48,413
- Let's go! - Hard carry

447
00:23:48,413 --> 00:23:49,782
- Get the moves right. - We'll get it done.

448
00:23:49,782 --> 00:23:50,952
Don't feel nervous.

449
00:23:51,282 --> 00:23:52,452
Do well for us.

450
00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:53,952
Don't worry!

451
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:55,853
- Okay! - Let's go!

452
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:57,623
I'm feeling nervous.

453
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:02,192
These are the bench players of TEAM BEAT. Please come out.

454
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:03,932
(Yeo Gangdong)

455
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:12,742
Let's go!

456
00:24:12,972 --> 00:24:13,972
Gosh.

457
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,843
We have racers here.

458
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:21,712
(TEAM BEAT's bench makes an intense appearance.)

459
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:24,282
They look amazing.

460
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,752
Koo Han Seo,

461
00:24:28,422 --> 00:24:29,522
Kairi,

462
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:33,192
Yuito, Kang Jun Hyuk,

463
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:36,692
Kim Hyo Tae, Park Yeon Jun,

464
00:24:36,863 --> 00:24:37,962
Nam Do Yoon.

465
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:40,232
(Yeo Gangdong)

466
00:24:40,232 --> 00:24:41,462
(Kang Jun Hyuk)

467
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:42,573
Two, three.

468
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,732
We won't get discouraged.

469
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,742
(We won't get discouraged.)

470
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:48,242
Hello, we are...

471
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:50,772
- TEAM BEAT's bench! - TEAM BEAT's bench!

472
00:24:51,012 --> 00:24:53,012
(Fully...)

473
00:24:53,012 --> 00:24:55,313
(relaxed)

474
00:24:55,313 --> 00:24:57,353
- Yes! - Let's go, TEAM BEAT's bench!

475
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,722
- BEAT! - Go!

476
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:02,623
(TEAM RHYTHM feels a greater sense of danger.)

477
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,153
I think they will do well.

478
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:06,663
- They might do really well. - Right.

479
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:11,192
(They feel nervous as their opposing team looks relaxed.)

480
00:25:11,192 --> 00:25:12,663
All right, Han Seo.

481
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:15,432
What kind of performance did you prepare?

482
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:17,633
The song we prepared is...

483
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:21,073
a song by Director YUGYEOM, "Hard Carry" by GOT7.

484
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:24,313
(Hip-hop swagger)

485
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:29,353
(The powerful beat and difficult choreography...)

486
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:34,323
(stand out in the intense song, "Hard Carry" by GOT7.)

487
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:37,022
It's "Hard Carry" and "Baggy Jeans."

488
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:40,192
They are songs that go against each other.

489
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:43,333
The performance stands out with both songs.

490
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,262
("Baggy Jeans" and "Hard Carry" are known as performance songs.)

491
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:47,532
They changed the choreography really nicely.

492
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:49,202
- Really? - Yes.

493
00:25:49,202 --> 00:25:50,272
It's really hot.

494
00:25:50,972 --> 00:25:52,672
(Worried)

495
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:55,643
- "Baggy Jeans." - They will go against each other.

496
00:25:55,643 --> 00:25:56,742
(Even the songs have similar vibes...)

497
00:25:56,742 --> 00:25:57,873
(while they aren't certain about their win.)

498
00:25:58,012 --> 00:26:01,682
Was there any hardship while practicing as bench players?

499
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:04,282
Since we became bench players,

500
00:26:04,282 --> 00:26:06,853
it hurt our prides, and we were upset.

501
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:10,192
But since we are all talented enough to be in the starting lineup,

502
00:26:10,192 --> 00:26:12,323
we will make sure to carry hard with today's performance.

503
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,232
- Great! - I love that!

504
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:17,262
(I love that confidence!)

505
00:26:17,563 --> 00:26:19,532
- Show us what you've got! - Great!

506
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:24,732
(How were confident TEAM BEAT's practice sessions?)

507
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:26,103
Hello, everyone.

508
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:27,843
- Hello. - Hello.

509
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:31,272
I'm the eldest in this team,

510
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:33,182
- and I became the leader. - Right.

511
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:35,512
You can all trust and follow me, right?

512
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:36,883
- Yes. - Yes.

513
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,083
Let's do this.

514
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,022
- Let's do this. - Let's go!

515
00:26:40,022 --> 00:26:41,653
(Let's go, TEAM BEAT's bench!)

516
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:44,593
Actually, Han Seo was in front of me during the Bench Test.

517
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:46,623
He was the first one to go in front of me,

518
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:48,863
and I was so motivated by him.

519
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:51,532
- I see. - "Han Seo definitely is talented."

520
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:52,732
Really?

521
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:57,833
("Siren" was praised by the directors during the draft.)

522
00:26:58,303 --> 00:27:02,672
(Koo Han Seo was the main rapper of Group "Siren.")

523
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:04,643
(He's good from Group "Siren.")

524
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:07,212
(Director YUGYEOM had his eyes on Koo Han Seo before the Bench Test.)

525
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:12,482
(The directors of TEAM BEAT went to Koo Han Seo right away.)

526
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:16,853
(Koo Han Seo started the Bench Test first.)

527
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:23,293
(Han Seo is really good!)

528
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:28,032
(He was scouted to TEAM BEAT's bench first.)

529
00:27:28,032 --> 00:27:30,603
I was the first one to get scouted to the bench.

530
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,442
There's no one who can beat me from the bench.

531
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:36,212
You all heard that we will get yellow cards if we lose.

532
00:27:36,212 --> 00:27:37,212
Right.

533
00:27:37,212 --> 00:27:39,343
Let's carry the team while destroying the others.

534
00:27:39,343 --> 00:27:40,413
Great.

535
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:42,682
We are bench players.

536
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:45,113
We have more of a disadvantage as we are bench players...

537
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:47,282
and a greater risk from getting the yellow cards.

538
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:49,422
I can never lose.

539
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:51,222
I will make sure this team wins.

540
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:54,093
(Koo Han Seo has thrown his life on the line for victory.)

541
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:58,093
I want to be the best in first place.

542
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,633
Kairi joined our team second.

543
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:02,833
I saw him and thought, "Our team is set."

544
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:04,702
"Our team is ready to win."

545
00:28:05,672 --> 00:28:06,742
Kairi.

546
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:09,772
His dancing skills are amazing.

547
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:12,313
I did think that all of our members were talented,

548
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:14,843
but I was really impressed by Kairi...

549
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:16,353
who had already made his debut.

550
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,383
(Kairi made his debut through the 9-member boy group, TFN.)

551
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:24,492
(He has the experience of performing for 3 years.)

552
00:28:25,722 --> 00:28:28,922
I thought that Kairi would carry our team,

553
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:30,462
and I was excited about that.

554
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:33,633
(The two ace players have gathered at TEAM BEAT's bench.)

555
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:35,903
I sang "Fighting."

556
00:28:35,903 --> 00:28:37,403
- Right. I heard it. - I heard that one too.

557
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:38,403
Right.

558
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:39,643
Didn't you change the lyrics?

559
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:42,143
- There was "BSS" in the lyrics. - Right.

560
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:43,313
I changed it to my name.

561
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:45,442
- I see. - I see. The idea is good.

562
00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:48,182
(During the Bench Test)

563
00:28:48,182 --> 00:28:50,413
(Can we see any kind of dance from you?)

564
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:51,952
One, two, three, four.

565
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,623
(I am your)

566
00:28:53,623 --> 00:28:54,782
(Nam Do Yoon)

567
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:58,323
In the repetitive day

568
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:01,492
(Nam Do Yoon's Bench Test that flustered everyone.)

569
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,492
(I am Nam Do Yoon)

570
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,932
(We have to cheer up)

571
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:09,403
(He was full of energy, but it was hard for him to get scouted.)

572
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:13,972
I was tested by the directors of TEAM RHYTHM twice,

573
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:16,472
but I failed to get scouted.

574
00:29:17,942 --> 00:29:20,543
(The Bench Test was especially hard for Nam Do Yoon.)

575
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:23,053
(Can we see you?)

576
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:28,123
(A blue ray of hope came to Nam Do Yoon.)

577
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:30,422
(We have to cheer up)

578
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:34,823
Director YUGYEOM scouted me.

579
00:29:34,992 --> 00:29:37,692
(Thank you so much.)

580
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,962
That was how I joined TEAM BEAT last.

581
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,762
He was your savior.

582
00:29:42,163 --> 00:29:44,573
I almost shed tears with a sense of relief.

583
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:47,172
We can prove ourselves.

584
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:48,972
- There must be a reason we're here. - Right.

585
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:50,143
Let's prove ourselves and move up.

586
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:51,442
(The bench players are determined to prove their talent.)

587
00:29:52,012 --> 00:29:53,883
(They check the rearranged version of "Hard Carry" by EL CAPITXN.)

588
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:55,442
- Oh, my gosh. - Turn it up to the highest.

589
00:29:59,653 --> 00:30:01,583
- It sounds like a war song. - Right.

590
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,553
The choreography has completely changed.

591
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:05,252
Right. It's completely different.

592
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:09,962
(With EL CAPITXN's rearrangement and the new choreography,)

593
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:18,133
(the 2024 version of "Hard Carry" is a lot more powerful and intense.)

594
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:24,373
I think that my greatest weapon is my dancing.

595
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,512
I believe I am able to reveal that a lot with this song.

596
00:30:27,512 --> 00:30:29,782
I thought that the image of the song really suited me,

597
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:31,012
and I wanted to carry our team.

598
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:32,083
(I wanted to carry our team.)

599
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,823
We can't lose with this.

600
00:30:33,823 --> 00:30:36,123
- We can't lose with this song. - No.

601
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:38,422
- It's our fault if we lose. - Right.

602
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,522
Right. We can't lose with this.

603
00:30:40,522 --> 00:30:42,893
Let's try the part we just saw.

604
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:45,762
I think we start with our backs showing.

605
00:30:46,502 --> 00:30:47,603
There's a jump next.

606
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,432
Arms out. I think the body is tilted diagonally.

607
00:30:52,232 --> 00:30:53,873
Diagonally.

608
00:30:53,873 --> 00:30:56,043
Arms out like this.

609
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,843
If you listen to the song, you'll hear this part.

610
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:01,482
There's a certain beat.

611
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:03,182
Then...

612
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,282
It looks nicer when you use more of your hair.

613
00:31:09,222 --> 00:31:12,252
(He uses his whole body to shoot the bullets of love.)

614
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:15,293
Stomp. Stretch out your chest.

615
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,833
The hand goes up to your head.

616
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:20,063
Bounce with your pelvis.

617
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:21,863
(Nam Do Yoon tries to follow along while gritting his teeth.)

618
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:23,232
- Okay? - Okay.

619
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:26,803
I did hear that Do Yoon...

620
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,472
hasn't learned how to dance at all.

621
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:33,413
I felt a lot more worried after working with him.

622
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:37,482
I thought that our team could be in danger...

623
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:38,583
at that moment.

624
00:31:40,053 --> 00:31:41,252
Shall we give it a try?

625
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:42,793
- Yes. - Yes.

626
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:44,553
You need to look more relaxed here.

627
00:31:46,663 --> 00:31:49,992
(The powerful choreography looks tough for Do Yoon.)

628
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:56,903
(He remembers the moves, but he still looks awkward.)

629
00:31:58,603 --> 00:31:59,603
(Rolling his body)

630
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:05,813
You don't know this part of the choreography, right?

631
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:06,913
Not yet.

632
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,182
(Showing Do Yoon his part)

633
00:32:10,182 --> 00:32:12,282
- Can you do this? - Yes.

634
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,482
Really? The song is very fast.

635
00:32:15,222 --> 00:32:16,222
I'll give it a try.

636
00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:18,793
(Nam Do Yoon's solo part)

637
00:32:21,262 --> 00:32:23,363
(The fast foot movement is the highlight.)

638
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,692
Start.

639
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,833
(Can Do Yoon do it?)

640
00:32:27,232 --> 00:32:29,002
(Stepping)

641
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:31,432
(How was it?)

642
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:33,403
(Not sure what to say)

643
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:35,903
It'll be better if I make...

644
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:37,343
- the choreography simpler, right? - Yes.

645
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:39,982
I've never lost in a game

646
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,143
I'm overflowing with passion

647
00:32:41,143 --> 00:32:42,212
This would be better for you.

648
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,282
Or I'll try practicing after today's lesson.

649
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:45,313
- Do you want to try practicing it? - Yes.

650
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:47,323
- Okay. Give it a shot. - Okay.

651
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:48,982
- You're doing well. - Thank you.

652
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:51,293
You're doing well, but... Sit down, guys.

653
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:53,163
It hasn't been long since you started dancing, right?

654
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,593
No, I started with this program.

655
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:57,833
- You've been dancing for a month? - Yes.

656
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,403
It's not bad for only dancing for a month.

657
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:02,633
You have talent.

658
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:05,373
You've been dancing for a month.

659
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:07,143
(Nam Do Yoon, a dance newbie who started just a month ago)

660
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:10,012
I don't have much experience learning choreography,

661
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:12,343
and I'm slow.

662
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:16,282
The older guys learned the moves and started practicing earlier.

663
00:33:16,782 --> 00:33:19,522
I was struggling alone. That was the hardest part.

664
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:24,353
(Do Yoon was struggling with controlling his body.)

665
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:27,222
I can't memorize the moves.

666
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:29,163
- The moves? - I can't memorize them.

667
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:30,932
- Look closely. - Okay.

668
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:34,333
Hit, hit. Then go like this.

669
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,333
Step, step. Yes, like that.

670
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:42,043
I wanted everyone to look good so that our team could win.

671
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:45,242
I wanted to help Do Yoon grow no matter what.

672
00:33:45,343 --> 00:33:46,343
Then kick like this.

673
00:33:46,613 --> 00:33:50,083
Open your legs, then raise your head.

674
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:53,353
(Kairi became Do Yoon's dance teacher.)

675
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:56,353
(Rolling his body)

676
00:33:58,623 --> 00:34:00,992
(Thanks to Kairi, Do Yoon has started to improve.)

677
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:02,962
Look, Do Yoon. Make your hands cooler too.

678
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:05,133
Hit and hit. Make it cool.

679
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:07,432
Bring your hands back and go like this.

680
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:08,432
Yes, so...

681
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:14,702
(With their help, Do Yoon is slowly improving.)

682
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:15,943
Nice, Like that.

683
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:19,373
Let's practice while singing.

684
00:34:19,713 --> 00:34:20,713
Sounds good.

685
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:23,213
Director YUGYEOM told us to practice while singing.

686
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:29,182
(The bench players practice live singing.)

687
00:34:31,423 --> 00:34:32,523
- Hard carry - Hard carry

688
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:36,063
(The music suddenly stopped?)

689
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,402
(Instead of stopping, they sing even harder.)

690
00:34:41,532 --> 00:34:42,632
- Hard carry - Hard carry

691
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:43,932
- Hard - Hard

692
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:45,132
- Hard carry - Hard carry

693
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:46,472
- Hard carry - Hard carry

694
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:50,713
That was nice.

695
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:52,213
Let's keep going.

696
00:34:53,143 --> 00:34:54,143
Let's go!

697
00:34:56,353 --> 00:35:00,322
(They keep practicing without rest.)

698
00:35:00,952 --> 00:35:02,023
- Hard carry - Hard carry

699
00:35:03,423 --> 00:35:04,552
- Hard carry - Hard carry

700
00:35:05,693 --> 00:35:07,262
- Once more? - Okay.

701
00:35:07,693 --> 00:35:09,492
- One more time. - Right away?

702
00:35:09,492 --> 00:35:10,862
- Right away. - Let's go.

703
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:12,092
I'm ready.

704
00:35:13,063 --> 00:35:15,032
How am I doing? Everybody knows it

705
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,333
We wanted the feeling...

706
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:20,003
of friends cheering each other on.

707
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:22,342
We're trying to push ourselves...

708
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:24,043
to get better every day.

709
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:29,652
I think all of our members...

710
00:35:29,652 --> 00:35:31,282
are full of passion.

711
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:33,353
We felt the same.

712
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:36,523
(Falling over from the endless practice)

713
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:37,853
Save me.

714
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:40,393
(Out of energy)

715
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,862
There were some parts where our rhythm was off.

716
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:44,862
You're right.

717
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:46,733
One more time? Right away?

718
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:48,432
- No. - I really can't.

719
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,503
This is torture.

720
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,242
One more time?

721
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:54,273
I can do it.

722
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:56,173
This is torture. Do Yoon is dead.

723
00:35:57,543 --> 00:36:00,583
(Save me.)

724
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:02,182
Let's do five very intense live singing practices.

725
00:36:02,182 --> 00:36:03,452
- With the music on. - With the music on.

726
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:06,983
Should we see the bench team next?

727
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:07,983
- Okay. - Okay.

728
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,123
(Director YUGYEOM's interim check a few days later)

729
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:12,193
- Hard carry - Hard carry

730
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:14,893
(Perfect angles)

731
00:36:15,793 --> 00:36:16,992
- Hard carry - Hard carry

732
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:24,233
(Koo Han Seo starts the song with his confident rapping.)

733
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,273
Wherever I go the mood gets higher

734
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:31,742
(And Kairi's facial expressions look laid-back.)

735
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:33,913
I've never lost in a game

736
00:36:33,913 --> 00:36:35,112
I always see it through to the end

737
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:36,612
(Doing his best)

738
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:37,782
- Hard carry - Hard carry

739
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,152
(What did the directors think of the bench players?)

740
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:42,452
- Thank you. - Thank you.

741
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:43,693
Thank you.

742
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:46,693
They were much more stable.

743
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:48,222
Because they were synchronized.

744
00:36:49,362 --> 00:36:51,132
I could tell you practiced a lot.

745
00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:53,532
- Thank you. - Thank you.

746
00:36:53,532 --> 00:36:55,833
I'm so proud of you for that.

747
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:58,932
I want to compliment Han Seo.

748
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:01,003
(Surprised)

749
00:37:01,103 --> 00:37:02,103
Thank you.

750
00:37:03,173 --> 00:37:06,943
I think you led the members well as the leader.

751
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:11,152
And Do Yoon...

752
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:14,322
did much better than I expected.

753
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:16,923
Because you listened to your leader,

754
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:19,923
you're getting good feedback.

755
00:37:22,722 --> 00:37:23,733
Thank you.

756
00:37:25,432 --> 00:37:26,603
I was so happy.

757
00:37:27,603 --> 00:37:29,802
There wasn't a single person who didn't work hard.

758
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:31,532
If we clashed, it was only out of passion.

759
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:34,173
There wasn't a single member who didn't work hard.

760
00:37:34,572 --> 00:37:36,913
We were able to improve much more quickly.

761
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:39,742
I'll lead the performance,

762
00:37:40,782 --> 00:37:41,913
lead the younger members,

763
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:43,983
and do my rap part well...

764
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:45,952
to carry my team.

765
00:37:47,923 --> 00:37:50,952
(Will the bench players change TEAM BEAT's fate?)

766
00:37:50,952 --> 00:37:53,862
Do Yoon. How do you plan to carry your team?

767
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:56,862
I will carry my team with the spirit...

768
00:37:56,862 --> 00:37:58,463
- of the youngest member. - Spirit!

769
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:00,233
(So cute.)

770
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:01,563
I believe in him.

771
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:05,432
- I believe in him. - I also believe...

772
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:08,173
- I also believe in him. - Believe in him.

773
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:09,173
(Why are the two directors of TEAM BEAT nervously laughing?)

774
00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:11,572
(Before the bench players went up onstage,)

775
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:16,682
(they did a final check of their rehearsal video.)

776
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:19,052
- Do Yoon. - Yes?

777
00:38:19,853 --> 00:38:21,222
- Cheer up, Do Yoon. - Okay.

778
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:22,923
- Be more energetic. - Okay.

779
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,253
- You did get better. - Okay. Thank you.

780
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:27,893
Do Yoon comes forward during his part, right?

781
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:30,632
Does he really need to sit once in the middle of that?

782
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:31,762
He doesn't have to.

783
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:38,032
(Do Yoon does the sitting move during his solo part.)

784
00:38:38,373 --> 00:38:39,943
Do you want to try not sitting?

785
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,802
Okay. I'll try it.

786
00:38:41,802 --> 00:38:42,802
- Will you be okay? - Yes.

787
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:44,413
I think it'll be better...

788
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:49,242
for you to just walk up and have the focus on you.

789
00:38:49,983 --> 00:38:51,052
That's not too hard, right?

790
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:52,353
- You can do that, right? - Yes.

791
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:55,023
Just slowly walk up.

792
00:38:55,222 --> 00:38:56,253
- Okay. - Okay?

793
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,253
Okay.

794
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:58,923
(Will Do Yoon successfully complete his last mission?)

795
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:01,092
TEAM BEAT, are you ready?

796
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:03,592
Let's go!

797
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,463
(Kairi)

798
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:06,663
(Yeon Jun)

799
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:08,233
Let's go.

800
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:10,733
(The directors are just as nervous as the players.)

801
00:39:12,472 --> 00:39:13,802
I'm more nervous.

802
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,313
This song is actually pretty hard.

803
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,773
It is.

804
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:26,983
- Kairi! - You can do it!

805
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:28,353
Let's go, Yuito!

806
00:39:28,822 --> 00:39:32,893
Aren't games the most exciting when a team comes up from behind?

807
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:35,463
We'll beat GROOVE and RHYTHM...

808
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:37,492
and get first place.

809
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:46,384
Ready? Go.

810
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:50,024
I think they'll be able to show everyone.

811
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:52,593
(Please.)

812
00:39:54,163 --> 00:39:56,194
("Hard Carry" by Kairi, Kang Jun Hyuk, Kim Hyo Tae, Koo Han Seo)

813
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,993
(Nam Do Yoon, Park Yeon Jun, Yuito)

814
00:39:57,993 --> 00:39:59,064
Oh, yes!

815
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:02,904
It's a strong arrangement.

816
00:40:03,174 --> 00:40:04,174
Nice.

817
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:26,893
He's good.

818
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:02,493
Yuito is good.

819
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:21,283
Director YUGYEOM told me not to sit.

820
00:41:21,384 --> 00:41:23,884
I need to do really well today.

821
00:41:27,453 --> 00:41:28,854
(Sitting down)

822
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:31,593
- Oh, he sat down. - I told him not to sit.

823
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,114
Oh, Han Seo.

824
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:52,984
He is quite impactful.

825
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:04,223
Oh, nice!

826
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:14,703
Park Yeon Jun!

827
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:37,053
- It's okay. - It's okay.

828
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,944
Oh, nice.

829
00:42:55,544 --> 00:42:56,573
Let's go.

830
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:21,564
What? They're so cool.

831
00:43:33,183 --> 00:43:35,584
(Applauding)

832
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:36,614
It was clean.

833
00:43:37,283 --> 00:43:39,553
Look. Only they seemed like they were on "SBS Inkigayo."

834
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:41,053
This performance really deserves to get first place.

835
00:43:42,893 --> 00:43:45,323
This was really...

836
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:46,364
(TEAM BEAT directors put their hopes on the bench players.)

837
00:43:46,364 --> 00:43:48,093
- Nice! - Han Seo is so good.

838
00:43:49,134 --> 00:43:51,794
The member in the middle really suits this song well.

839
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:53,604
He was so good.

840
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,433
Han Seo and Kairi really stood out.

841
00:43:57,104 --> 00:43:58,234
"Hard Carry" is an intense song,

842
00:43:58,234 --> 00:44:00,604
but it's also one that allows you to show off your vocal abilities.

843
00:44:02,314 --> 00:44:04,944
- I think the fans' preferences... - Right.

844
00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:07,643
will determine the outcome.

845
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:12,283
I thought that these guys had such great teamwork.

846
00:44:12,823 --> 00:44:15,794
I thought I should watch out for those guys.

847
00:44:15,794 --> 00:44:16,823
(TEAM RHYTHM is nervous after TEAM BEAT's performance.)

848
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,524
It was "Hard Carry" by TEAM BEAT.

849
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:20,524
(TEAM BEAT's bench players gave...)

850
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,723
(a strong performance that surprised everyone.)

851
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:23,533
Okay. We will now begin...

852
00:44:24,093 --> 00:44:25,134
the vote.

853
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:31,774
(The fans' votes can change TEAM BEAT's fate.)

854
00:44:31,774 --> 00:44:33,973
Please press the button.

855
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:38,243
(Every fan vote is precious to TEAM BEAT.)

856
00:44:39,384 --> 00:44:41,584
(Nam Do Yoon knows how to strike the fans' hearts.)

857
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:42,654
Puppy ears!

858
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:45,723
(He does everything that the fans ask him to do!)

859
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:50,553
(Showing off his abs)

860
00:44:50,924 --> 00:44:53,823
(TEAM BEAT shows off their charms to get more votes.)

861
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:55,933
(Han Seo will take TEAM BEAT to 1st place today!)

862
00:44:56,234 --> 00:44:57,334
We got it.

863
00:44:57,763 --> 00:45:00,634
- That's cheating. - That's totally cheating.

864
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:01,763
Kenta.

865
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:03,904
You can do it.

866
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:05,134
- Let's go, Kenta. - Kenta.

867
00:45:05,674 --> 00:45:07,973
Next time, I'll make you a part to show off your abs.

868
00:45:09,413 --> 00:45:11,843
(A fierce battle of abs to win over the fans is coming soon)

869
00:45:12,174 --> 00:45:14,283
(Relaxed)

870
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:17,183
(TEAM BEAT's bench players' heated self-promotion time)

871
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,823
We will close the vote.

872
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:20,854
(The vote ends.)

873
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:24,524
Let's check who the MVP is.

874
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,223
(Who will it be on this team?)

875
00:45:27,464 --> 00:45:29,694
(Who do you think it will be?)

876
00:45:30,334 --> 00:45:34,134
(TEAM BEAT's bench gave a good performance overall.)

877
00:45:34,703 --> 00:45:36,533
- Han Seo? - He's always been good.

878
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,073
- Right. He was in Group "Siren." - Yes.

879
00:45:38,373 --> 00:45:39,774
I think he'll get the MVP.

880
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:43,143
He suited the concept well.

881
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:46,643
(Koo Han Seo perfectly performed the strong concept.)

882
00:45:47,143 --> 00:45:48,183
Who do you think the MVP is?

883
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:51,114
- Kairi? - Kairi.

884
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:54,984
(Will it be Kairi with his eye-catching performance?)

885
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:57,024
He really killed that part.

886
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:00,524
(Will it be Kairi with his eye-catching performance?)

887
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:01,794
- Who will it be? - Who will it be?

888
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:02,964
(The other TEAM BEAT members are curious as well.)

889
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:06,263
(Who is the MVP that stole the fans' hearts?")

890
00:46:06,703 --> 00:46:08,864
I thought I could be it...

891
00:46:08,964 --> 00:46:10,933
since I really dominated the stage.

892
00:46:12,174 --> 00:46:15,643
I gave a satisfying performance,

893
00:46:16,044 --> 00:46:17,573
so I had hope.

894
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,683
The MVP of this performance...

895
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,413
is Kairi.

896
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:29,723
(The MVP of TEAM BEAT's bench is Kairi.)

897
00:46:36,064 --> 00:46:37,593
I told you that Kairi was good.

898
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:40,834
Right. When Kairi is in the center, the energy explodes.

899
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:43,634
- You're right. - When he did this, it was over.

900
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:45,303
I knew it.

901
00:46:45,504 --> 00:46:46,944
His solo part...

902
00:46:47,343 --> 00:46:49,143
- must've had a strong impact. - Right.

903
00:46:51,544 --> 00:46:54,783
I was so happy to be the MVP. I hope we can continue this...

904
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:58,084
Our members did so well.

905
00:46:58,553 --> 00:47:00,254
I hope we get first place.

906
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:03,893
Good job.

907
00:47:03,893 --> 00:47:04,893
(A glorious return)

908
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:08,663
(Director YUGYEOM praises each of the players.)

909
00:47:08,924 --> 00:47:10,794
We really did so well. I appreciated your abs.

910
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:16,303
I told you you were the best. I told you you were good, right?

911
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:17,473
Thank you.

912
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:19,774
You really did well.

913
00:47:19,774 --> 00:47:21,203
- Good job. - Good job.

914
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,743
(TEAM BEAT's bench gave a good performance.)

915
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:29,183
(Will TEAM BEAT be able to make a comeback and win?")

916
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:31,953
- GROOVE! - GROOVE!

917
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:33,683
(It's time for the last performance of Round 1 by TEAM GROOVE's bench.)

918
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:35,723
- Let's seriously get first place. - We can do that.

919
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:40,493
We're in second place, but we can definitely catch up.

920
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:42,364
I think we'll get a good score.

921
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,263
I'm not really worried about the bench team.

922
00:47:46,104 --> 00:47:48,464
- Let's go. Come here. - Let's go.

923
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,004
- Let's go! - Let's go.

924
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:52,203
- Gather around. - You can do it.

925
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:53,873
- Do as you practiced. - Okay.

926
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:56,143
Always do as you practiced.

927
00:47:56,743 --> 00:47:59,114
- Okay? You should try a bit harder. - Okay.

928
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:00,743
- You need to smile a lot. - Okay.

929
00:48:00,743 --> 00:48:03,154
You need to smile for everything to go well.

930
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:04,553
Okay?

931
00:48:04,854 --> 00:48:07,354
- We'll get first place for you. - Okay.

932
00:48:07,683 --> 00:48:09,893
- One, two, three. Let's go! - Let's go!

933
00:48:09,893 --> 00:48:11,623
- Let's go! - Let's go!

934
00:48:11,754 --> 00:48:13,763
- Let's go! - See you soon.

935
00:48:13,763 --> 00:48:15,524
- Let's go! - You already killed it. I saw it.

936
00:48:15,524 --> 00:48:16,593
- Let's go! - Let's go!

937
00:48:16,763 --> 00:48:19,134
This is the last performance of the day.

938
00:48:21,303 --> 00:48:23,873
Please come on out, TEAM GROOVE's bench players.

939
00:48:24,073 --> 00:48:25,134
Hello.

940
00:48:25,604 --> 00:48:26,743
(Meeting the fans for the first time in cute outfits)

941
00:48:26,743 --> 00:48:27,743
Very pink.

942
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:28,803
(Meeting the fans for the first time in cute outfits)

943
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:30,513
Oh, so pink.

944
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:32,614
Their outfits are so cute.

945
00:48:32,614 --> 00:48:33,614
(TEAM GROOVE's bench will melt the winter cold away.)

946
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:35,953
- It's spring. - They're all so cute.

947
00:48:35,953 --> 00:48:37,084
The mood completely changed.

948
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:40,984
Each team has such a different concept.

949
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:42,794
Kim Gi Joong.

950
00:48:44,823 --> 00:48:45,893
Kim Dae Yun.

951
00:48:47,194 --> 00:48:49,123
Bae Jae Ho. Hiroto.

952
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:52,294
He Junjin. Li Zhiwei.

953
00:48:52,703 --> 00:48:53,703
Yeo Gangdong.

954
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:56,404
(Yeo Gangdong)

955
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,234
So cute.

956
00:48:58,873 --> 00:48:59,904
The mood is completely different.

957
00:49:00,973 --> 00:49:02,104
Hello. We are...

958
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,343
- G. - R.

959
00:49:04,343 --> 00:49:05,873
- O. - O.

960
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:07,683
- V. - E.

961
00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:08,944
- GROOVE. - GROOVE.

962
00:49:09,553 --> 00:49:11,814
(Go, TEAM GROOVE's bench!)

963
00:49:11,814 --> 00:49:12,884
So cute.

964
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:15,323
(They're so cute.)

965
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:17,294
Nice.

966
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:19,493
What kind of performance did you prepare today?

967
00:49:19,493 --> 00:49:22,163
We prepared a song called "Second Confession..."

968
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:23,734
by BTOB.

969
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:29,604
(A song that portrays the excitement before confessing your feelings)

970
00:49:30,373 --> 00:49:34,243
(Both vocal ability and expression are important.)

971
00:49:35,143 --> 00:49:38,073
Do you think you'll be able to gift your director a win?

972
00:49:38,873 --> 00:49:42,413
I saw that the other teams had a dark mood.

973
00:49:42,953 --> 00:49:44,984
- Okay. - I see.

974
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:46,024
(A public attack)

975
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,424
We'll melt your hearts...

976
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:50,424
with our cute confession song.

977
00:49:51,024 --> 00:49:53,593
(We're already melting...)

978
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:56,334
How was Director Chang Sub's special training?

979
00:49:56,734 --> 00:49:59,234
Gosh. Director Lee Chang Sub...

980
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:03,473
(What happened to TEAM GROOVE's bench?)

981
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:05,973
- I'll play it now. - Okay.

982
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:07,143
Okay.

983
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:08,473
I'm excited.

984
00:50:08,473 --> 00:50:10,614
(TEAM GROOVE's bench checks out the rearranged "Second Confession.")

985
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:12,714
(A cute and rhythmic song with a bouncy mood)

986
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:13,714
It's so cute.

987
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:18,413
- Oh, my. - It's seriously so good.

988
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:19,424
Oh, my.

989
00:50:20,424 --> 00:50:23,154
(And one member seems to especially like it.)

990
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,654
(A big reaction)

991
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:27,323
I love it.

992
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:33,404
(He can't stop smiling.)

993
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:36,473
I'm so glad to be on TEAM GROOVE.

994
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:39,473
(In the locker room during the draft)

995
00:50:39,843 --> 00:50:42,873
(He wanted to be on TEAM GROOVE.)

996
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,614
It's because Lee Chang Sub's the director.

997
00:50:45,614 --> 00:50:48,714
I'm a huge fan of his.

998
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:51,084
(During the Bench Test)

999
00:50:51,584 --> 00:50:54,154
(Director Lee Chang Sub, I want to join TEAM GROOVE.)

1000
00:50:54,424 --> 00:51:00,464
(He took the initiative and asked to be on TEAM GROOVE.)

1001
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:02,323
(Gi Joong's dream came true,)

1002
00:51:02,323 --> 00:51:03,794
(and he joined TEAM GROOVE as a bench member.)

1003
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,803
I want to get an earful from Chang Sub...

1004
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:07,964
about my vocals.

1005
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:11,604
(He's excited to get an earful.)

1006
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:15,743
(Here's another member who's also focused on the music.)

1007
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:17,013
This is adorable.

1008
00:51:17,473 --> 00:51:21,283
It's an honor to be performing a song that Lee Chang Sub sang.

1009
00:51:21,584 --> 00:51:24,283
(Their first encounter with Director Lee during the draft)

1010
00:51:24,884 --> 00:51:26,283
(I love you!)

1011
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:30,493
Lee Chang Sub is a master vocalist, so...

1012
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:33,064
(Another player who desperately wanted...)

1013
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:34,993
(to be on TEAM GROOVE)

1014
00:51:35,263 --> 00:51:37,663
(Chang Sub also chose Bae Jae Ho.)

1015
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:39,194
Thank you.

1016
00:51:39,334 --> 00:51:42,134
My first and only choice was TEAM GROOVE.

1017
00:51:42,703 --> 00:51:45,104
I'm so glad to be on TEAM GROOVE.

1018
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:47,643
Is there a part that you want for yourselves?

1019
00:51:47,803 --> 00:51:48,904
Absolutely.

1020
00:51:48,904 --> 00:51:50,444
(Burning with passion)

1021
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:53,044
I wanted to sing the bridge section.

1022
00:51:53,283 --> 00:51:55,683
Of course, I want to sing the bridge section.

1023
00:51:56,453 --> 00:51:59,314
(This transitional bridge section that is sung by Lee Chang Sub...)

1024
00:51:59,314 --> 00:52:00,323
(shows off one's vocals.)

1025
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:02,723
It's the part Chang Sub sings,

1026
00:52:02,924 --> 00:52:07,163
which was the main reason I wanted to sing it.

1027
00:52:07,163 --> 00:52:10,533
The bridge part that Director Lee sings.

1028
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:12,364
Channel the emotions...

1029
00:52:12,364 --> 00:52:14,734
- while delivering the lines. - Sure.

1030
00:52:14,904 --> 00:52:18,174
I was confident about getting the part right.

1031
00:52:18,634 --> 00:52:19,803
(Sir!)

1032
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,944
Sir,

1033
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:23,843
I want to try this part.

1034
00:52:24,044 --> 00:52:25,114
Okay.

1035
00:52:25,114 --> 00:52:27,314
I think I should try...

1036
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:29,413
because I think I can do it.

1037
00:52:30,453 --> 00:52:34,823
(Kim Gi Joong first sings the bridge.)

1038
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,223
Why is it

1039
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:42,964
(Passion in his eyes)

1040
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:44,834
- Good. Thanks. - Thanks.

1041
00:52:45,493 --> 00:52:51,573
(Next up is Bae Jae Ho.)

1042
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:54,743
(Li Zhiwei, the last one to aim for the part,)

1043
00:52:54,743 --> 00:52:56,643
(makes his attempt at the bridge!)

1044
00:52:59,984 --> 00:53:01,714
(Impressed)

1045
00:53:03,913 --> 00:53:07,424
(Li Zhiwei's soft and mellifluous voice)

1046
00:53:10,093 --> 00:53:17,033
(Who will sing the bridge that is sung by Chang Sub?)

1047
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:20,234
The bridge will go to Li Zhiwei.

1048
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:23,703
It was a bummer since I wanted the part.

1049
00:53:25,004 --> 00:53:26,243
(Disappointed)

1050
00:53:28,343 --> 00:53:31,274
(On the day of the interim check, they finally meet Director Lee.)

1051
00:53:31,714 --> 00:53:34,984
(They'll soon be performing for Chang Sub.)

1052
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:38,584
(Chang Sub's biggest fans are training hard.)

1053
00:53:38,913 --> 00:53:39,953
Zen Zen.

1054
00:53:40,854 --> 00:53:42,254
- Hello. - Hello.

1055
00:53:42,254 --> 00:53:43,993
- Hi. - No way.

1056
00:53:43,993 --> 00:53:45,294
It's good to see you.

1057
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:46,794
It's so humid.

1058
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:47,924
Have you been well?

1059
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,163
- Yes. - Yes.

1060
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:52,904
This was my first time seeing him in the practice room.

1061
00:53:52,904 --> 00:53:53,933
He was so cool.

1062
00:53:53,933 --> 00:53:55,004
(Our director is so cool!)

1063
00:53:55,004 --> 00:53:56,334
I was all tingly inside.

1064
00:53:56,774 --> 00:53:59,104
I was nervous since he was finally...

1065
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:00,944
evaluating us,

1066
00:54:00,944 --> 00:54:04,513
but I was also excited to be learning from him.

1067
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:06,913
- Do as you practiced. - Sure.

1068
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:10,053
Do as you learned and practiced.

1069
00:54:10,053 --> 00:54:11,913
Don't try to go the extra mile.

1070
00:54:11,913 --> 00:54:12,953
- Sure. - Got it.

1071
00:54:12,953 --> 00:54:14,053
Okay, let's go.

1072
00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:16,623
I kind of messed up...

1073
00:54:16,623 --> 00:54:18,953
during my first performance, which was "Boomerang."

1074
00:54:19,564 --> 00:54:22,424
(During the draft, Kim Gi Joong displayed a shaky pitch,)

1075
00:54:22,424 --> 00:54:24,064
(and his voice cracked.)

1076
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:27,134
I thought this could be my chance.

1077
00:54:27,604 --> 00:54:29,904
I was more nervous than I was when I performed onstage.

1078
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:37,674
(The intro begins with sweet and cute expressions.)

1079
00:54:38,243 --> 00:54:40,544
(Focused)

1080
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:42,984
I swallow my pride and confess my love a second time

1081
00:54:42,984 --> 00:54:45,614
I'll skip the many things I wish to say

1082
00:54:45,614 --> 00:54:50,123
I'm frustrated on this restless night

1083
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:51,294
(He nailed his high note.)

1084
00:54:51,294 --> 00:54:52,453
(Proud)

1085
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:56,294
Shoot the arrow and save me

1086
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:57,634
(The solo highlight that has only him jump into the center.)

1087
00:54:57,634 --> 00:55:01,433
Can we go back to that time? Are you willing to be with me again?

1088
00:55:02,464 --> 00:55:06,444
(Li Zhiwei sings the bridge that was originally sung by Chang Sub.)

1089
00:55:06,444 --> 00:55:08,473
Why is it

1090
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:12,643
(The beat gets faster and faster.)

1091
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:17,614
(Their choreography becomes a mess.)

1092
00:55:21,053 --> 00:55:27,424
(What will Chang Sub say about TEAM GROOVE's bench?)

1093
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:34,404
The dancing...

1094
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:40,703
was all over the place.

1095
00:55:41,973 --> 00:55:44,114
Is the teamwork not fully there yet?

1096
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,643
Didn't you practice enough?

1097
00:55:48,484 --> 00:55:49,683
We practiced enough.

1098
00:55:51,254 --> 00:55:54,623
If you have practiced enough, the situation is worse.

1099
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,123
The situation is worse.

1100
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:58,654
It's better not to have practiced enough.

1101
00:55:58,654 --> 00:55:59,924
(It's better not to have practiced enough.)

1102
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:05,964
I only wanted to show him how talented I was,

1103
00:56:05,964 --> 00:56:07,504
so it was disappointing.

1104
00:56:09,334 --> 00:56:11,734
- Let's try to sing in tune. - Okay.

1105
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:13,703
Being in tune and singing on the beat is crucial.

1106
00:56:14,843 --> 00:56:17,843
(Chang Sub demonstrates the high notes Li Zhiwei must sing.)

1107
00:56:17,843 --> 00:56:21,013
That you don't know how I feel?

1108
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:24,214
Be nimbler.

1109
00:56:25,584 --> 00:56:28,683
(He coaches Li Zhiwei by demonstrating again.)

1110
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:30,493
(Nice.)

1111
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:33,893
(Is this a concert? They focus on Chang Sub's voice.)

1112
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:40,263
That you don't know how I feel?

1113
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,433
(We expected no less.)

1114
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:44,203
I was listening to him in awe.

1115
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:48,604
Just being able to hear him sing that one line...

1116
00:56:48,904 --> 00:56:51,274
had me up in the clouds.

1117
00:56:53,183 --> 00:56:58,513
(Li Zhiwei sings it again in the way he heard it.)

1118
00:56:58,513 --> 00:56:59,513
That's it. Good.

1119
00:56:59,953 --> 00:57:02,654
(Director Lee's lesson paid off.)

1120
00:57:02,984 --> 00:57:05,154
He was a great mentor.

1121
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:08,393
I want to get an earful from Chang Sub...

1122
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:09,424
about my vocals.

1123
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:13,763
(He continues to coach them.)

1124
00:57:15,504 --> 00:57:17,174
You must sing until that beat. Give it a try.

1125
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:21,873
Someday, when you finally come back to me

1126
00:57:22,544 --> 00:57:25,573
I thought I'd get an earful for not singing well enough.

1127
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:27,513
Come back to me

1128
00:57:27,513 --> 00:57:29,444
- It's okay. Squeeze your core. - Okay.

1129
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:32,513
Below your belly button. That's the part you should squeeze.

1130
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:35,384
(I want to get an earful.)

1131
00:57:35,984 --> 00:57:40,263
(Trying hard)

1132
00:57:40,263 --> 00:57:42,993
- Right. Extend the note like that. - Okay.

1133
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:45,334
Extend the note, and...

1134
00:57:46,533 --> 00:57:48,864
(Is it finally time for him to scold Gi Joong?)

1135
00:57:48,864 --> 00:57:50,303
And in the second verse, you...

1136
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:52,573
I want to get an earful from Chang Sub about my vocals.

1137
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:54,073
(His heart is pounding.)

1138
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,504
(Your section)

1139
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:56,614
- You did great. - Okay.

1140
00:57:56,614 --> 00:57:58,573
Know that you can sing this part a little louder.

1141
00:57:58,573 --> 00:58:00,343
- Got it. - Don't turn down the volume.

1142
00:58:01,143 --> 00:58:03,754
I wanted to get an earful from him,

1143
00:58:03,754 --> 00:58:06,984
so it was a bummer to only get compliments.

1144
00:58:07,553 --> 00:58:08,924
- Gangdong. - Yes?

1145
00:58:08,924 --> 00:58:10,794
The "Hey, it's a green light."

1146
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:12,424
Shoot the arrow and save me

1147
00:58:12,424 --> 00:58:16,194
(His solo highlight that features a cute pose)

1148
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:18,294
- Why do you look depressed? - Sorry?

1149
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,303
You must be beaming during that section.

1150
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:22,203
Just now, it looked like a red light.

1151
00:58:22,203 --> 00:58:23,834
You were almost embodying a red light.

1152
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,674
- Okay? - Okay.

1153
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:28,203
Be more dynamic with your moves.

1154
00:58:28,203 --> 00:58:29,973
- Be dynamic. - Okay.

1155
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,174
- With a smile. - Got it.

1156
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,913
Always smile.

1157
00:58:33,044 --> 00:58:34,944
(Will the highlight be a green light this time?)

1158
00:58:35,884 --> 00:58:39,154
(Awkward)

1159
00:58:40,154 --> 00:58:41,223
Why?

1160
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:45,623
Did that seem like a green light to you?

1161
00:58:46,393 --> 00:58:47,694
- No. - No?

1162
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:48,723
No.

1163
00:58:48,723 --> 00:58:50,364
Could there be another pose you can do?

1164
00:58:50,364 --> 00:58:51,734
(Is the pose the issue?)

1165
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:53,093
How about this?

1166
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,703
"Hey, it's a green light."

1167
00:58:54,703 --> 00:58:57,504
(The director suggests a dynamic green light.)

1168
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,373
Hey, it's a green light.

1169
00:58:59,634 --> 00:59:00,873
(Trembling)

1170
00:59:01,073 --> 00:59:02,803
Why is even your running this awkward?

1171
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,243
What do we do with you?

1172
00:59:04,444 --> 00:59:06,073
"Hey, it's a green light."

1173
00:59:06,073 --> 00:59:07,413
(The director suggests a cuter pose this time.)

1174
00:59:08,183 --> 00:59:09,384
Hey, it's a green light.

1175
00:59:09,384 --> 00:59:11,183
- No, that's just wrong. - What?

1176
00:59:11,183 --> 00:59:13,623
Think of another move you can do.

1177
00:59:14,524 --> 00:59:15,884
Think of one. That's your homework.

1178
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:17,524
- Okay. - I'm giving you an assignment.

1179
00:59:17,524 --> 00:59:19,453
That was me being cheerful,

1180
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:21,223
so it got embarrassing.

1181
00:59:21,393 --> 00:59:23,933
I'm going to try different poses...

1182
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:26,393
and see what the others think.

1183
00:59:26,393 --> 00:59:28,433
- Gangdong, let's go. - Show us.

1184
00:59:28,433 --> 00:59:29,604
(The day after the interim check)

1185
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:32,004
- I'll give it a try. - Okay.

1186
00:59:32,004 --> 00:59:33,873
(He shows them the pose he worked on.)

1187
00:59:33,873 --> 00:59:35,203
Hey, it's a green light.

1188
00:59:35,203 --> 00:59:37,013
Shoot the arrow and save me

1189
00:59:37,013 --> 00:59:38,143
(He falls onto the ground.)

1190
00:59:38,143 --> 00:59:39,343
- What? - Hold on.

1191
00:59:40,484 --> 00:59:42,444
Are you a damsel in distress?

1192
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:44,254
(He tries again with a different pose.)

1193
00:59:44,254 --> 00:59:45,783
Hey, it's a green light.

1194
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:49,283
(His poses are hard to understand.)

1195
00:59:49,683 --> 00:59:51,223
(The director's assignment is too much for Gangdong.)

1196
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:54,393
Okay. I think that's the most eye-catching part of the song.

1197
00:59:54,393 --> 00:59:57,263
The other teams are performing powerful and spicy songs.

1198
00:59:57,393 --> 00:59:59,593
They're like...

1199
01:00:00,004 --> 01:00:02,104
(TEAM RHYTHM's addictive and intoxicating performance)

1200
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:05,334
(TEAM BEAT adds a heap of spice.)

1201
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:07,703
Meanwhile, our performance is like a dessert.

1202
01:00:07,873 --> 01:00:10,814
- It's like a tiramisu. - A tiramisu.

1203
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:14,114
- Hey, it's a green light. - Out of all six songs,

1204
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:16,783
"Second Confession" is the sweetest and most upbeat.

1205
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,053
We practiced our expressions to the point...

1206
01:00:20,053 --> 01:00:21,953
where we can win over the fans.

1207
01:00:21,953 --> 01:00:23,453
We worked really hard on it.

1208
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:24,654
Gangdong, smile.

1209
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:25,694
(They dance with bright expressions that fit the mood of the song.)

1210
01:00:25,694 --> 01:00:26,763
Smile!

1211
01:00:26,763 --> 01:00:28,364
(They dance with bright expressions that fit the mood of the song.)

1212
01:00:28,364 --> 01:00:30,064
I felt like we had a chance...

1213
01:00:30,834 --> 01:00:33,093
to beat the other five teams by putting in the work.

1214
01:00:34,504 --> 01:00:36,303
I have the confidence.

1215
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:40,604
Let's see the performance by TEAM GROOVE's bench.

1216
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,004
TEAM GROOVE, are you ready?

1217
01:00:43,004 --> 01:00:44,743
- Yes! - Let's go!

1218
01:00:45,774 --> 01:00:46,814
Let's go.

1219
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:48,314
I can't wait.

1220
01:00:48,944 --> 01:00:50,484
- Please do well. - Please.

1221
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:51,854
- You can do this. - Go, team!

1222
01:00:51,854 --> 01:00:53,214
(The teams' standings depend on how well the bench does.)

1223
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,084
Gangdong has to do a good job.

1224
01:00:55,484 --> 01:00:57,493
(Worried)

1225
01:00:58,524 --> 01:01:00,864
I'll turn on the green lights that'll guarantee...

1226
01:01:00,864 --> 01:01:02,064
TEAM GROOVE's victory.

1227
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:06,493
So that Director Lee Chang Sub doesn't regret picking me,

1228
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:08,163
I'll do my best.

1229
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:15,373
Ready? Go.

1230
01:01:21,683 --> 01:01:22,683
That's pretty.

1231
01:01:24,854 --> 01:01:28,623
("Second Confession" by Bae Jae Ho, He Junjin, Hiroto, Kim Dae Yun,)

1232
01:01:28,623 --> 01:01:31,593
(Kim Gi Joong, Li Zhiwei, Yeo Gangdong)

1233
01:01:48,573 --> 01:01:49,703
Gosh, that was nice.

1234
01:02:03,393 --> 01:02:04,393
(Kim Joo Hyoung)

1235
01:02:06,254 --> 01:02:07,263
They're great.

1236
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:18,634
Oh, dear.

1237
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:22,604
You still did great.

1238
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:39,993
He's good.

1239
01:03:21,933 --> 01:03:23,064
(Yeo Gangdong)

1240
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:36,243
Gangdong, nice.

1241
01:04:07,413 --> 01:04:08,444
He's a good vocalist.

1242
01:04:41,513 --> 01:04:43,343
- Nicely done! - They did it.

1243
01:04:43,854 --> 01:04:45,453
- That's enough. - They actually did it.

1244
01:04:46,283 --> 01:04:47,283
Seriously, that was enough.

1245
01:04:48,323 --> 01:04:49,384
They did a good job.

1246
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:53,223
It was a performance that the fans would've loved.

1247
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,424
It was cute.

1248
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:58,763
It must be because the director's a BTOB member,

1249
01:04:58,763 --> 01:05:00,964
but they focused a lot on the vocals.

1250
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:06,234
TEAM GROOVE got a lot of love from those in the audience,

1251
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:07,404
so I couldn't tell who was going to win.

1252
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:12,013
Fans have different tastes, which had me worried.

1253
01:05:13,714 --> 01:05:15,683
The bench's performance...

1254
01:05:15,683 --> 01:05:18,354
made me think we could come out on top.

1255
01:05:18,553 --> 01:05:20,223
- Same here. - It wasn't about them doing well.

1256
01:05:20,223 --> 01:05:21,553
The smile wouldn't leave my face.

1257
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,553
I was smiling at them like a proud mom.

1258
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:26,053
I bet anyone who watched that shared our sentiment.

1259
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:27,993
They did great.

1260
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:32,194
The audience will vote right away.

1261
01:05:32,893 --> 01:05:34,964
Please press the circle if you enjoyed his performance.

1262
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,334
If you didn't, press X.

1263
01:05:37,703 --> 01:05:39,873
Ladies, please vote for me this once.

1264
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:42,174
Gangdong, you're so handsome!

1265
01:05:42,473 --> 01:05:43,473
Vote for the others as well.

1266
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:45,013
(Vote for the others as well.)

1267
01:05:45,214 --> 01:05:47,183
- That's what I'm talking about. - He has a funny bone.

1268
01:05:47,183 --> 01:05:48,183
That's what I wanted.

1269
01:05:48,783 --> 01:05:50,683
I'm desperate and would appreciate your vote.

1270
01:05:51,783 --> 01:05:54,654
(He shows his desperation by bowing on his knees.)

1271
01:05:55,024 --> 01:05:56,024
Goodness, Gi Joong.

1272
01:05:56,424 --> 01:05:59,493
It's finally time to see who the MVP is.

1273
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,694
I think... Gangdong.

1274
01:06:03,323 --> 01:06:04,734
- Me too. - Gangdong.

1275
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:06,734
(Is it Yeo Gangdong who performed while staying true to the concept?)

1276
01:06:07,334 --> 01:06:09,933
Gi Joong and Jae Ho might also have a chance.

1277
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:10,933
(Kim Gi Joong or Bae Jae Ho?)

1278
01:06:11,174 --> 01:06:12,533
Why do I feel like it's going to be Dae Yun?

1279
01:06:14,343 --> 01:06:16,444
Who was the MVP of that performance?

1280
01:06:16,444 --> 01:06:18,314
(Which player won over the audience?)

1281
01:06:18,643 --> 01:06:20,243
It was Kim Gi Joong.

1282
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:22,044
(Kim Gi Joong is the MVP of TEAM GROOVE's bench.)

1283
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:23,183
What? Really?

1284
01:06:23,614 --> 01:06:26,413
(Surprised)

1285
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:28,854
- You're so handsome. - You're good-looking!

1286
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:30,794
(You're good-looking!)

1287
01:06:30,993 --> 01:06:32,254
It's Gi Joong.

1288
01:06:35,093 --> 01:06:36,493
I wanted to be the MVP,

1289
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:39,564
but I didn't think it was possible...

1290
01:06:39,564 --> 01:06:42,634
since the concept suited the others better.

1291
01:06:42,634 --> 01:06:44,734
Still, I tried hard to make this look work.

1292
01:06:45,203 --> 01:06:49,743
I'm happy since being the MVP means that my hard work paid off.

1293
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:52,274
You never know what will happen in life.

1294
01:06:52,473 --> 01:06:53,573
This is proof of that.

1295
01:06:55,084 --> 01:06:56,243
Wait, I'm getting emotional.

1296
01:06:56,984 --> 01:06:58,584
You have a delicate soul.

1297
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:01,423
We used to train together seven years ago.

1298
01:07:01,423 --> 01:07:03,183
- That's why you feel a bond. - Right.

1299
01:07:04,093 --> 01:07:06,223
(Gi Joong, you did great!)

1300
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:08,164
(After all the performances,)

1301
01:07:08,593 --> 01:07:10,763
(they gathered to hear the results.)

1302
01:07:10,763 --> 01:07:12,133
(TEAM RHYTHM)

1303
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:13,393
(TEAM GROOVE)

1304
01:07:13,393 --> 01:07:14,904
(TEAM BEAT)

1305
01:07:14,904 --> 01:07:17,473
We'll now check the standings of Round One.

1306
01:07:17,473 --> 01:07:19,374
(The standings will be revealed.)

1307
01:07:19,374 --> 01:07:22,374
(Nerve-racking)

1308
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:27,713
The audience's vote will determine the teams' rankings.

1309
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:29,213
(Scores of the starting lineup and bench will be added.)

1310
01:07:29,213 --> 01:07:31,484
Depending on where your team stands,

1311
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:33,183
the players will receive yellow cards.

1312
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:34,324
(Teams that rank low will receive yellow cards.)

1313
01:07:34,624 --> 01:07:36,454
Three for the team in second place...

1314
01:07:37,524 --> 01:07:39,553
and a whopping 6 for the team in 3rd place.

1315
01:07:39,553 --> 01:07:40,994
(3rd place: 6 yellow cards)

1316
01:07:42,593 --> 01:07:46,333
Your second yellow card will result in elimination.

1317
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:49,234
(2 yellow cards will send you home.)

1318
01:07:49,234 --> 01:07:51,473
This is the result of the starting lineup match.

1319
01:07:53,604 --> 01:07:56,003
(They showed off their explosive energy.)

1320
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:59,114
("Give Me That" by TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup)

1321
01:07:59,114 --> 01:08:00,213
(They delivered a message...)

1322
01:08:00,213 --> 01:08:02,683
(of taking on challenges and overcoming hardship.)

1323
01:08:02,683 --> 01:08:04,354
("Boys Never Die" by TEAM BEAT's starting lineup)

1324
01:08:04,383 --> 01:08:07,553
(Their powerful vocals left a strong impression.)

1325
01:08:07,553 --> 01:08:10,694
("Missing You" by TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup)

1326
01:08:15,664 --> 01:08:17,234
(First half starting lineup match)

1327
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:18,564
(TEAM RHYTHM: 1st place, 1,234 points)

1328
01:08:18,564 --> 01:08:19,893
(TEAM GROOVE: 2nd place, 1,172 points)

1329
01:08:19,893 --> 01:08:22,164
(TEAM BEAT: 3rd place, 966 points)

1330
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:25,133
Director of TEAM RHYTHM, your team is currently in the lead.

1331
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:26,234
How does it feel?

1332
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,704
I'm just proud of them. You did great, boys.

1333
01:08:33,043 --> 01:08:34,213
We did great.

1334
01:08:34,843 --> 01:08:36,883
You also did great. I mean that.

1335
01:08:36,883 --> 01:08:38,253
- Thank you. - Thanks.

1336
01:08:38,253 --> 01:08:39,513
(Disappointed)

1337
01:08:40,824 --> 01:08:44,423
(TEAM BEAT ranked 3rd in the starting lineup match.)

1338
01:08:44,893 --> 01:08:46,923
The gap is nearly 300 points.

1339
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:48,664
(The huge difference in score has TEAM BEAT looking defeated.)

1340
01:08:50,194 --> 01:08:52,494
(During the starting lineup match,)

1341
01:08:52,494 --> 01:08:54,963
(Park Ji Hun's pitch was off, and he missed a few beats.)

1342
01:08:57,003 --> 01:08:59,074
There's too much power, so the choreography isn’t in sync.

1343
01:09:00,374 --> 01:09:01,374
Completely.

1344
01:09:04,114 --> 01:09:08,114
I was upset since it felt like I had ruined the performance.

1345
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:10,683
- But we carried the team. - We totally carried the team.

1346
01:09:10,683 --> 01:09:11,683
We carried the team for sure.

1347
01:09:11,683 --> 01:09:12,683
(It's too soon to give up!)

1348
01:09:13,713 --> 01:09:16,024
(With their outstanding teamwork,)

1349
01:09:16,024 --> 01:09:19,494
(the bench members of TEAM BEAT delivered a twist.)

1350
01:09:19,494 --> 01:09:21,824
Out of the performances by the bench members,

1351
01:09:22,164 --> 01:09:26,234
I believe our team's was the best.

1352
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:29,364
I know we carried our team to rank in first place.

1353
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:32,234
We could come back from behind. There was hope.

1354
01:09:32,874 --> 01:09:36,944
Now, we will see the final result of Round One with the addition...

1355
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:38,914
of the bench members' scores.

1356
01:09:39,043 --> 01:09:40,343
- Come on! - Please.

1357
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,414
- Please. - I'm begging you.

1358
01:09:41,414 --> 01:09:43,414
- My heart is pounding. - Oh, no!

1359
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,114
(First half starting lineup match)

1360
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,154
(TEAM RHYTHM: 1st place, 1,234 points)

1361

1363
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:50,494
- Oh, dear. - Let's do this.

1364
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,354
My heart is beating really fast.

1365
01:09:56,194 --> 01:09:58,833
First, here is TEAM BEAT's final score.

1366
01:09:59,164 --> 01:10:00,633
(TEAM BEAT's final score will be revealed.)

1367
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:01,633
I can't watch.

1368
01:10:01,833 --> 01:10:03,133
Please.

1369
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:05,704
Please say we crushed the others.

1370
01:10:05,704 --> 01:10:07,744
- Please. - This is insane.

1371
01:10:08,143 --> 01:10:12,043
TEAM BEAT did a great job with its performance of "Hard Carry."

1372
01:10:12,414 --> 01:10:14,583
That had me super nervous.

1373
01:10:15,143 --> 01:10:16,513
They had great teamwork,

1374
01:10:16,843 --> 01:10:19,513
so losing to them seemed quite possible.

1375
01:10:20,114 --> 01:10:22,284
Here is TEAM BEAT's final score.

1376
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,454
- Please. - Gosh, please.

1377
01:10:23,454 --> 01:10:25,324
(TEAM BEAT's final score will be revealed.)

1378
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:27,624
- My goodness. - Okay.

(TEAM BEAT, Starting: 966, Bench: 979, Total: 1,945)

1383
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:38,734
The final score...

1384
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:42,374
is 1,945 points.

1385
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,374
(They're devastated.)

1386
01:10:46,173 --> 01:10:49,583
Was it a performance that deserved to be ranked this low?

1387
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:52,183
I was upset.

1388
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,324
This is risky.

1389
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:59,494
Next, TEAM GROOVE's final score will be revealed.

1390
01:10:59,494 --> 01:11:01,324
- Oh, please. - Please!

1391
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:03,933
- Please. - Please.

1392
01:11:04,164 --> 01:11:05,164
I feel sick.

1393
01:11:05,564 --> 01:11:07,963
We can't afford a yellow card. Seriously.

1394
01:11:08,734 --> 01:11:11,333
I think our bench did a good job.

1395
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,433
I'm confident.

1396
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:16,204
Honestly, I didn't think TEAM GROOVE would win.

1397
01:11:16,543 --> 01:11:18,574
TEAM GROOVE will rank third.

1398
01:11:20,374 --> 01:11:26,883

1402
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:38,234
What's going on?

01:11:38,234 --> 01:11:39,293
(TEAM GROOVE, Starting: 1,172, Bench: 1,181, Total: 2,353)

1404
01:11:39,293 --> 01:11:40,734
- This is good. - We can be first.

1405
01:11:41,534 --> 01:11:42,803
This is good. Well done, everyone!

1406
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:46,303
- Good job! - The total score is 2,353 points.

1407

(Bitter)

1408
01:11:50,204 --> 01:11:53,173
- Well done. - Thank you.

1409
01:11:53,944 --> 01:11:56,043
The bench's score is higher than the starting lineup's.

(TEAM GROOVE, Starting: 1,172, Bench: 1,181, Total: 2,353)

(TEAM GROOVE's bench did a great job.)

1412
01:11:58,683 --> 01:12:01,654
A comeback seems possible.

1413
01:12:02,154 --> 01:12:04,194
- Wait. - Oh, no.

1414
01:12:04,923 --> 01:12:06,293
- This was unexpected. - We never know.

1415
01:12:06,494 --> 01:12:08,124
This is unpredictable.

1416
01:12:09,393 --> 01:12:10,463
(TEAM RHYTHM's fate depends on the bench.)

1417
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:12,393
- It will be difficult. - Please!

1418
01:12:13,034 --> 01:12:14,104
Please!

1419
01:12:16,104 --> 01:12:19,234
We had only a 60-vote difference with the 1st place.

1420
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:22,343
Maybe we can win.

1421
01:12:22,803 --> 01:12:24,914
TEAM GROOVE might win.

1422
01:12:25,244 --> 01:12:28,583
Will TEAM GROOVE make a comeback and win?

I hope we can win the first place. I really want to win.

1430

1431

1436
01:13:03,247 --> 01:13:10,188
(Who will be the final winner of Round 1?)

1437
01:13:10,617 --> 01:13:11,688

I was proud...

1454
01:13:57,768 --> 01:14:00,907
as I thought I saved our team.

1455
01:14:01,207 --> 01:14:04,978
I was happy to share this happiness together...

1456
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:07,008
with the starting lineup and the bench.

1457
01:14:10,478 --> 01:14:13,518

(Disappointed)

1462
01:14:20,858 --> 01:14:23,287

(TEAM BEAT ranked 3rd.)

(There is a 408-vote difference with 1st place.)

1467
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,707
I was devastated.

1468
01:14:41,608 --> 01:14:43,407
I can't put it into words.

1469
01:14:44,848 --> 01:14:46,548
I felt very sorry...

1470
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:48,987
to our team members.

1471
01:14:50,388 --> 01:14:52,817
Now, according to the results of Round One,

1472
01:14:52,817 --> 01:14:55,627
it's time to distribute the yellow cards.

1473
01:14:57,728 --> 01:14:58,827
TEAM RHYTHM...

1474
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:00,798

01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,338

1478
01:15:07,338 --> 01:15:10,938
(TEAM BEAT, the 3rd place, receives 6 yellow cards.)

1479
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:13,237

1480
01:15:13,577 --> 01:15:16,077
the lower-ranking members on the team bench...

1481
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:17,678
based on fan votes.

1482
01:15:18,277 --> 01:15:21,287
Let's take a look at the individual rankings...

1483
01:15:21,588 --> 01:15:24,117
to see who will receive yellow cards.

1484
01:15:24,117 --> 01:15:26,457
(This announcement of the individual rankings will determine their fate.)

1485
01:15:26,457 --> 01:15:29,388
First, I'll announce the ranking of the team in first place,

1486
01:15:29,388 --> 01:15:32,298
TEAM GROOVE, that has no yellow cards.

1487
01:15:32,298 --> 01:15:33,598
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

1488
01:15:33,598 --> 01:15:37,167
TEAM GROOVE, please come out to the stage.

1489
01:15:39,197 --> 01:15:40,907

1490
01:15:41,468 --> 01:15:44,508
(The two teams envy TEAM GROOVE as they have no yellow cards.)

1491

1496
01:16:03,157 --> 01:16:05,598

1498
01:16:08,228 --> 01:16:10,298

1499
01:16:11,268 --> 01:16:12,997
- My gosh. - I will announce who...

1500
01:16:12,997 --> 01:16:15,468
the final MVP will be between the two.

1501
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:17,478
(Who will be the final MVP of TEAM GROOVE?)

1502
01:16:17,577 --> 01:16:19,338
The first place of TEAM GROOVE is...

1503
01:16:21,907 --> 01:16:24,178
You never know. The bench could win with the popularity vote.

1504
01:16:28,218 --> 01:16:30,287

01:20:26,258 --> 01:20:27,688
It's Steven.

1593
01:20:27,688 --> 01:20:30,428
(TEAM RHYTHM, Starting lineup: Steven, 173 votes, 5th place)

1594
01:20:32,827 --> 01:20:34,567
- There's not much change here. - Very little change.

1595
01:20:34,567 --> 01:20:36,098
Right. There's not much change for this team.

1596
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:37,638
The sixth!

1597
01:20:37,638 --> 01:20:42,167
(Announcement of the 6th place of TEAM RHYTHM's individual ranking)

1598
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:44,877
(Announcement of the 6th place of TEAM RHYTHM's individual ranking)

1599
01:20:44,877 --> 01:20:46,008
- It's Daisuke. - Oh, my.

1600
01:20:46,178 --> 01:20:47,978
- Thank you! - Oh, my!

1601
01:20:47,978 --> 01:20:50,577
- Thank goodness. - He's cute.

1602
01:20:50,817 --> 01:20:51,917
He's cute.

1603
01:20:53,447 --> 01:20:56,817
I'll announce the last starting lineup, the seventh place.

1604
01:20:58,188 --> 01:21:02,987
(Who will fill up the last spot in the starting lineup of TEAM RHYTHM?)

1605
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:04,027
The seventh place is...

1606
01:21:07,527 --> 01:21:09,497
- Ayumu. Congratulations. - Oh, gosh!

1607
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:11,268
Ayumu!

1608
01:21:11,268 --> 01:21:13,638
(TEAM RHYTHM, Starting lineup: Ayumu, 150 votes, 7th place)

1609
01:21:13,638 --> 01:21:15,567
He moved up to the starting lineup.

1610
01:21:16,768 --> 01:21:19,138
The remaining seven go to the bench.

1611
01:21:19,138 --> 01:21:20,377
(All the remaining 7 go to the bench.)

1612
01:21:20,907 --> 01:21:22,407
Three of them...

1613
01:21:22,407 --> 01:21:26,148
(Among the 7 bench players, 3 will...)

1614
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:28,287
receive a yellow card.

1615
01:21:28,487 --> 01:21:30,858
- Wait. I can't watch this. - This is heartbreaking.

1616
01:21:31,917 --> 01:21:33,688
I'll announce from the eighth.

1617
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:35,157
(TEAM RHYTHM: Bench)

1618
01:21:37,627 --> 01:21:38,928
- It's like that. - My gosh.

1619
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:41,898
(The starting lineup of TEAM RHYTHM is nervous too.)

1620
01:21:41,898 --> 01:21:42,997
The eighth place is...

1621
01:21:42,997 --> 01:21:48,067
(Who will rank 8th, avoiding the yellow card?)

1622
01:21:48,067 --> 01:21:49,567
- It's Xie Yuxin. - My gosh.

1623
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:54,247
(TEAM RHYTHM, Bench: Xie Yuxin, 139 votes, 8th place)

1624
01:21:56,178 --> 01:21:57,207
The ninth is...

1625
01:21:57,207 --> 01:21:58,848
(Who ranked 9th in the individual ranking?)

1626
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:01,348
- It's Jin Ziming. Congratulations. - My gosh.

1627
01:22:01,348 --> 01:22:02,348
(TEAM RHYTHM, Bench: Jin Ziming, 134 votes, 8th place)

1628
01:22:02,348 --> 01:22:05,058
You can move to your seat. Thank you.

1629
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,188
There are only two seats left.

1630
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,188
The tenth is...

1631
01:22:08,188 --> 01:22:09,487
(The 10th in the individual ranking is...)

1632
01:22:11,197 --> 01:22:12,497
It's Sirin.

1633
01:22:12,497 --> 01:22:16,367
(TEAM RHYTHM, Bench: Sirin, 132 votes, 8th place)

1634
01:22:18,237 --> 01:22:22,237
Let's see who the last player to avoid the yellow card will be.

1635
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,737
- There's only one seat left. - My goodness.

1636
01:22:25,237 --> 01:22:27,277
(Among the 4 players,)

1637
01:22:27,277 --> 01:22:32,777
(only one can avoid the yellow card.)

1638
01:22:32,777 --> 01:22:36,048
I think that since we have three yellow cards,

1639
01:22:36,048 --> 01:22:37,718
I thought it was going to go...

1640
01:22:38,088 --> 01:22:42,627
to people who might not have done well on the stage.

1641
01:22:42,627 --> 01:22:45,298
Eito and Royce.

1642
01:22:45,298 --> 01:22:47,027
Eito's voice cracked.

1643
01:22:47,358 --> 01:22:48,798
Even during practice,

1644
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:50,798
his voice often cracks.

1645
01:22:51,537 --> 01:22:53,567
I was out of tune.

1646
01:22:53,567 --> 01:22:55,707
So I'm a little anxious.

1647
01:22:56,308 --> 01:22:58,438
Don't be me.

1648
01:22:58,877 --> 01:23:00,338
There's a tie.

1649
01:23:00,338 --> 01:23:02,247
Tied for tenth place.

1650
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:07,987
(Who will avoid the yellow card?)

1651
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:10,917
Eito, please move to your seat.

1652
01:23:11,088 --> 01:23:13,487
Thank you!

1653
01:23:13,487 --> 01:23:14,627
(TEAM RHYTHM, Bench: Eito, 132 votes, 10th place)

1654
01:23:16,127 --> 01:23:19,957
The 12th place is Li Zhinuo, 13th is Mac,

1655
01:23:20,298 --> 01:23:22,197
and 14th is Royce.

1656
01:23:22,728 --> 01:23:25,537
If you receive one more yellow card,

1657
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:27,838
- you will be eliminated. - My gosh.

1658
01:23:27,838 --> 01:23:29,867
- Seriously. - Oh, no.

1659
01:23:32,308 --> 01:23:35,747
The third-ranking team, TEAM BEAT, please come out.

1660
01:23:35,747 --> 01:23:37,548
(TEAM BEAT's individual rankings will be revealed.)

1661
01:23:37,548 --> 01:23:38,747
Let's go.

1662
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,588
I can't watch this.

1663
01:23:43,588 --> 01:23:45,218
Oh, no.

1664
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:47,417
The third-ranking team...

1665
01:23:47,417 --> 01:23:50,527
will receive six yellow cards.

1666
01:23:50,527 --> 01:23:53,228
(TEAM BEAT, the 3rd team, gets 6 yellow cards.)

1667
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:55,228
It's difficult to hide my emotions.

1668
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,838
I'll announce the 1st place 1st.

1669
01:23:57,838 --> 01:23:58,898
(Announcing the 1st place)

1670
01:23:58,898 --> 01:24:00,938
Cha Woong Ki, the MVP of the starting lineup,

1671
01:24:00,938 --> 01:24:01,938
(Cha Woong Ki, the MVP of the starting lineup of TEAM BEAT)

1672
01:24:01,938 --> 01:24:06,138
and the MVP of the bench, Kairi. Who will be the final MVP?

1673
01:24:06,138 --> 01:24:11,178
(Who will be the final MVP of TEAM BEAT?)

1674
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:13,678
It's Cha Woong Ki. Congratulations.

1675
01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:16,617
(TEAM BEAT, Starting lineup: Cha Woong Ki, 219 votes, 1st place)

1676
01:24:18,218 --> 01:24:19,258
The second place is...

1677
01:24:19,258 --> 01:24:21,688
(Who won 2nd place?)

1678
01:24:26,558 --> 01:24:27,697
It's Chih En!

1679
01:24:27,697 --> 01:24:29,527
(TEAM BEAT, Starting lineup: Chih En, 180 votes, 2nd place)

1680
01:24:32,938 --> 01:24:35,268
The third place is An Yul.

1681
01:24:35,268 --> 01:24:38,407
(TEAM BEAT, Starting lineup: Ahn Yul, 177 votes, 3rd place)

1682
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,577
The fourth is...

1683
01:24:40,077 --> 01:24:41,577
(Who won 4th place in TEAM BEAT?)

1684
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:42,747
It's Kairi.

1685
01:24:42,747 --> 01:24:44,308
(TEAM BEAT, Starting lineup: Kairi, 171 votes, 4th place)

1686
01:24:44,308 --> 01:24:45,348
Thank you.

1687
01:24:48,088 --> 01:24:49,088
The fifth place is...

1688
01:24:49,688 --> 01:24:50,688
Maybe Han Seo?

1689
01:24:51,317 --> 01:24:52,588
I think so too.

1690
01:24:52,758 --> 01:24:55,758
(Will it be Koo Han Seo as the directors predicted?)

1691
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,058
It's Yuito!

1692
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:01,728
(TEAM BEAT, Starting lineup: Yuito, 166 votes, 5th place)

1693
01:25:01,997 --> 01:25:03,598
The sixth is...

1694
01:25:03,997 --> 01:25:08,237
(TEAM BEAT's 6th in individual rankings)

1695
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:10,138
Nam Do Yoon.

1696
01:25:10,808 --> 01:25:14,277
(TEAM BEAT, Starting lineup: Nam Do Yoon, 163 votes, 6th place)

1697
01:25:14,678 --> 01:25:16,077
(Surprised)

1698
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:17,577
(Oh, my.)

1699
01:25:17,817 --> 01:25:21,117
I'll announce the last starting player, the seventh place.

1700
01:25:21,947 --> 01:25:22,987
The seventh is...

1701
01:25:22,987 --> 01:25:29,428
(TEAM BEAT's last starting player)

1702
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:31,197
Koo Han Seo.

1703
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:34,928
(TEAM BEAT, Starting lineup: Koo Han Seo, 159 votes, 7th place)

1704
01:25:34,928 --> 01:25:38,938
Starting players, please move to your seats.

1705
01:25:39,398 --> 01:25:41,237
My goodness.

1706
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:47,678
Only one among them can avoid the yellow card.

1707
01:25:47,678 --> 01:25:48,707
(Only one can avoid the yellow card.)

1708
01:25:48,707 --> 01:25:51,277
I'll announce it now.

1709
01:25:51,277 --> 01:25:52,817
(TEAM BEAT: Bench)

1710
01:25:52,817 --> 01:25:56,188
- Seriously. - This is too cruel.

1711
01:25:56,617 --> 01:26:00,117
(The directors watching them are nervous too.)

1712
01:26:00,117 --> 01:26:03,627
The eighth place who avoided the yellow card is...

1713
01:26:04,327 --> 01:26:11,338
(Who will be the one to avoid the yellow card?)

1714
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:15,237
Keum Jin Ho.

1715
01:26:15,237 --> 01:26:19,777
(TEAM BEAT, Bench: Keum Jin Ho, 150 votes, 8th place)

1716
01:26:19,777 --> 01:26:22,048
Please move to your seat.

1717
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:23,308
Thank you.

1718
01:26:25,848 --> 01:26:29,148
Everyone remaining will receive a yellow card.

1719
01:26:29,848 --> 01:26:31,688
Park Yeon Jun ranked ninth.

1720
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:34,218
Kim Hyo Tae ranked tenth.

1721
01:26:34,218 --> 01:26:36,558
Jiang Fan ranked 11th.

1722
01:26:36,787 --> 01:26:39,358
Kim Dong Yun ranked 12th.

1723
01:26:39,358 --> 01:26:41,398
Kang Jun Hyuk ranked 13th.

1724
01:26:41,598 --> 01:26:44,798
Park Ji Hun ranked 14th.

1725
01:26:45,497 --> 01:26:48,207
(Sighing)

1726
01:26:48,508 --> 01:26:50,938
It's the directors' turn now.

1727
01:26:51,508 --> 01:26:54,037
Let's start the trade.

1728
01:26:54,037 --> 01:26:55,648
(The trade will take place following the directors' choices.)

1729
01:26:56,808 --> 01:26:59,978
There is an important reason that today's rankings matter.

1730
01:27:00,718 --> 01:27:03,747
There's a special benefit to the 1st and 2nd-ranking teams.

1731
01:27:03,747 --> 01:27:04,817
(A special benefit to the 1st and 2nd-ranking teams)

1732
01:27:04,817 --> 01:27:07,688
It's the trade ticket.

1733
01:27:07,688 --> 01:27:09,127
(Trade ticket)

1734
01:27:09,787 --> 01:27:14,497
(The directors learned that they could trade.)

1735
01:27:14,497 --> 01:27:15,497
They're trading us?

1736
01:27:16,867 --> 01:27:20,867
The 1st team will win 2 tickets, and the 2nd team will win 1.

1737
01:27:20,867 --> 01:27:22,707
(The 1st team will win 2 tickets and the 2nd team will win 1.)

1738
01:27:22,707 --> 01:27:25,178
We might be kicked out as well.

1739
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:29,947
It's a chance to make your team stronger.

1740
01:27:30,447 --> 01:27:33,518
You can recruit players from the lower-ranking teams...

1741
01:27:33,518 --> 01:27:36,817
and release players you don't want from the team.

1742
01:27:37,447 --> 01:27:40,287
It's like a real trade. Just like nominating.

1743
01:27:40,558 --> 01:27:42,058
(Sighing)

1744
01:27:43,487 --> 01:27:45,358
- We'll lose our player. - Exactly.

1745
01:27:47,657 --> 01:27:51,197
Director Lee Chang Sub of TEAM GROOVE,

1746
01:27:51,197 --> 01:27:53,598
the first-ranking team, please come out.

1747
01:27:53,838 --> 01:27:58,377
(TEAM GROOVE has 2 trade tickets.)

1748
01:27:58,377 --> 01:28:00,907
(He can use it on both TEAM RHYTHM and TEAM BEAT.)

1749
01:28:01,947 --> 01:28:04,478
- Why did he look at me? - I'm scared.

1750
01:28:04,478 --> 01:28:06,577
- Why did he look at me? - Don't look at me.

1751
01:28:07,117 --> 01:28:08,947
I don't want to leave TEAM GROOVE.

1752
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:15,457
(Trade)

1753
01:28:16,787 --> 01:28:20,197
Director Lee Chang Sub of TEAM GROOVE,

1754
01:28:21,027 --> 01:28:24,838
please announce the player you want to release.

1755
01:28:26,598 --> 01:28:29,237
The player I want to release is...

1756
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:31,938
(Someone needs to be released from TEAM GROOVE.)

1757
01:28:31,938 --> 01:28:35,678
I kept thinking about my mistakes and my flaws.

1758
01:28:35,678 --> 01:28:37,508
I thought it might be me.

1759
01:28:38,077 --> 01:28:41,417
I thought it could be one of the bench players.

1760
01:28:41,947 --> 01:28:45,388
I thought the lower-ranking players would be chosen.

1761
01:28:47,928 --> 01:28:50,358
(Who will Director Lee Chang Sub release first?)

1762
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:52,627
It's Li Zhiwei.

1763
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:58,468
(TEAM GROOVE is removing Li Zhiwei who ranked 14th.)

1764
01:28:59,537 --> 01:29:01,338
(Li Zhiwei is leaving the team with the director's choice.)

1765
01:29:01,338 --> 01:29:03,167
Yes, it's Li Zhiwei.

1766
01:29:04,978 --> 01:29:06,108
Now,

1767
01:29:06,777 --> 01:29:10,648
who will you recruit to replace Li Zhiwei?

1768
01:29:11,548 --> 01:29:13,277
Please announce it.

1769
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:19,817
Steven. I think they will get Steven.

1770
01:29:20,758 --> 01:29:23,188
I expected...

1771
01:29:23,527 --> 01:29:27,228
Woong Ki to be picked first since he was the MVP of our team.

1772
01:29:29,468 --> 01:29:30,867
The player I'd like to recruit is...

1773
01:29:35,308 --> 01:29:39,978
from TEAM BEAT...

1774
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,377
(Director Lee Chang Sub chooses a player from TEAM BEAT.)

1775
01:29:42,947 --> 01:29:45,817
No. I think it's me. Or maybe you?

1776
01:29:47,417 --> 01:29:50,619
(Who is Director Lee going to scout?)

1777
01:29:51,815 --> 01:29:53,246
Player Koo Han Seo.

1778
01:29:53,246 --> 01:29:54,386
(TEAM GROOVE first scouts Koo Han Seo.)

1779
01:29:54,386 --> 01:29:57,985
(Trading Li Zhiwei with Koo Han Seo)

1780
01:29:57,985 --> 01:29:59,416
Player Koo Han Seo.

1781
01:30:00,086 --> 01:30:01,586
(Trading with Koo Han Seo who placed 7th in TEAM BEAT)

1782
01:30:01,586 --> 01:30:05,225
Koo Han Seo, please stand up.

1783
01:30:10,536 --> 01:30:12,636
(By presenting a powerful performance and rap,)

1784
01:30:12,636 --> 01:30:15,006
(Koo Han Seo moved up to the starting lineup from the bench.)

1785
01:30:15,006 --> 01:30:17,075
I scouted him because I needed someone...

1786
01:30:17,075 --> 01:30:20,006
with a strong look to be in charge of rap.

1787
01:30:21,945 --> 01:30:24,046
(How will Koo Han Seo do on TEAM GROOVE?)

1788
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:25,445
It was such a shame.

1789
01:30:25,876 --> 01:30:28,485
How will the team go without Han Seo?

1790
01:30:30,386 --> 01:30:32,586
(Sighing)

1791
01:30:32,786 --> 01:30:36,485
(TEAM BEAT lost their starting player.)

1792
01:30:36,485 --> 01:30:40,966
The two players, please move to your new teams.

1793
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:43,265
(They're going to compete in different teams now.)

1794
01:30:43,265 --> 01:30:44,435
- Well done. - Li Zhiwei.

1795
01:30:45,235 --> 01:30:47,235
- Don't go. - See you.

1796
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:49,536
- Don't go. - Han Seo.

1797
01:30:49,536 --> 01:30:51,235
(Clingy)

1798
01:30:51,536 --> 01:30:54,445
Don't leave me. You know I can't live without you.

1799
01:30:55,145 --> 01:30:56,306
(Grinning)

1800
01:30:56,546 --> 01:31:00,086
To be honest, among the many players in TEAM RHYTHM...

1801
01:31:00,416 --> 01:31:01,716
and starting players in TEAM BEAT,

1802
01:31:01,716 --> 01:31:04,815
I'm happy that he selected me.

1803
01:31:05,155 --> 01:31:07,325
I became the starting player on my own...

1804
01:31:08,025 --> 01:31:09,426
in TEAM BEAT.

1805
01:31:09,725 --> 01:31:11,126
I feel confident to pull it off in TEAM GROOVE.

1806
01:31:12,426 --> 01:31:16,096
Now, you only have one trade ticket left.

1807
01:31:16,996 --> 01:31:20,435
Please announce the second player to release.

1808
01:31:22,506 --> 01:31:25,905
(One of them is going to leave the team.)

1809
01:31:30,145 --> 01:31:32,246
The player to release is...

1810
01:31:32,246 --> 01:31:39,056
(Who will be the second player to be released in TEAM GROOVE?)

1811
01:31:39,056 --> 01:31:40,056
Hiroto.

1812
01:31:40,056 --> 01:31:44,655
(Releasing Hiroto in 4th place)

1813
01:31:44,655 --> 01:31:48,025
(Releasing Hiroto in 4th place)

1814
01:31:48,695 --> 01:31:50,195
(The starting player, Hiroto, is released.)

1815
01:31:50,195 --> 01:31:51,536
What? A starting player?

1816
01:31:57,706 --> 01:32:00,506
Who do you want to scout?

1817
01:32:01,645 --> 01:32:03,246
The player I'd like to scout is...

1818
01:32:03,246 --> 01:32:06,775
(Who will TEAM GROOVE scout next?)

1819
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:09,015
He wouldn't trade only with us, right?

1820
01:32:09,115 --> 01:32:10,756
- I doubt it. - Right?

1821
01:32:14,426 --> 01:32:15,586
My heart's beating fast.

1822
01:32:17,395 --> 01:32:19,626
(Who does Director Lee Chang Sub choose?)

1823
01:32:19,626 --> 01:32:22,666
From TEAM RHYTHM...

1824
01:32:24,365 --> 01:32:25,365
From TEAM RHYTHM...

1825
01:32:25,365 --> 01:32:28,006
(Nervous)

1826
01:32:29,006 --> 01:32:30,706
(Park Ju Won who placed 1st in TEAM RHYTHM?)

1827
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:34,246
No. It's not me.

1828
01:32:34,445 --> 01:32:35,506
No.

1829
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,475
(I think it's him.)

1830
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:39,546
- JL? - No?

1831
01:32:40,075 --> 01:32:41,185
No. It's not me.

1832
01:32:41,815 --> 01:32:42,846
No.

1833
01:32:43,615 --> 01:32:46,115
No.

1834
01:32:46,115 --> 01:32:49,525
(Who will he trade with Hiroto?)

1835
01:32:49,525 --> 01:32:51,126
Player Kwon Hee Jun.

1836
01:32:51,126 --> 01:32:55,725
(TEAM GROOVE's last scout is Kwon Hee Jun.)

1837
01:32:56,796 --> 01:32:58,435
(The players are surprised to hear Kwon Hee Jun's name.)

1838
01:32:58,435 --> 01:32:59,435
Hee Jun.

1839
01:32:59,435 --> 01:33:00,435
- Hee Jun. - No.

1840
01:33:02,636 --> 01:33:06,176
(Trading Hiroto with Kwon Hee Jun)

1841
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:09,706
You've traded Hiroto with Kwon Hee Jun.

1842
01:33:11,445 --> 01:33:12,815
(I see.)

1843
01:33:13,515 --> 01:33:15,916
I can see what he likes.

1844
01:33:16,286 --> 01:33:17,615
He likes...

1845
01:33:18,456 --> 01:33:22,286
a strong look.

1846
01:33:23,256 --> 01:33:25,525
He has the face...

1847
01:33:25,525 --> 01:33:27,666
that can pull off any style.

1848
01:33:27,825 --> 01:33:29,395
He also dominates the stage.

1849
01:33:30,796 --> 01:33:32,435
(TEAM GROOVE's trade is completed after scouting Kwon Hee Jun.)

1850
01:33:32,435 --> 01:33:36,306
Next, it's time for TEAM RHYTHM's trade.

1851
01:33:36,405 --> 01:33:40,645
Let's bring in a director from TEAM RHYTHM.

1852
01:33:41,275 --> 01:33:45,075
(TEAM RHYTHM can only trade with TEAM BEAT.)

1853
01:33:52,756 --> 01:33:56,086
TEAM RHYTHM has only one trade ticket.

1854
01:33:56,086 --> 01:33:57,096
(Who will be released from TEAM RHYTHM?)

1855
01:33:57,096 --> 01:34:00,765
Please announce the player to release.

1856
01:34:02,296 --> 01:34:04,666
The player to release is...

1857
01:34:06,296 --> 01:34:08,966
I was nervous at the time.

1858
01:34:10,836 --> 01:34:15,006
I didn't want my name to be called.

1859
01:34:15,945 --> 01:34:17,876
(Who does TEAM RHYTHM's director choose?)

1860
01:34:17,876 --> 01:34:18,975
Royce.

1861
01:34:18,975 --> 01:34:23,815
(Releasing Royce in 14th place)

1862
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:27,985
Royce, please stand up.

1863
01:34:27,985 --> 01:34:29,786
(Royce in last place is called to be released.)

1864
01:34:29,786 --> 01:34:33,426
Then who are you going to scout?

1865
01:34:33,426 --> 01:34:34,825
(Who will he trade Royce with?)

1866
01:34:34,825 --> 01:34:40,435
You can only choose from TEAM BEAT.

1867
01:34:40,435 --> 01:34:42,836
(Feeling dizzy)

1868
01:34:42,836 --> 01:34:43,905
From TEAM BEAT...

1869
01:34:45,275 --> 01:34:47,746
I was afraid of losing Woong Ki.

1870
01:34:48,605 --> 01:34:51,775
And I was afraid of losing Chih En next.

1871
01:34:52,846 --> 01:34:55,386
Then, this team will be doomed.

1872
01:34:55,685 --> 01:34:58,185
That will be the end of our team.

1873
01:34:59,155 --> 01:35:00,655
We'd like to scout...

1874
01:35:00,655 --> 01:35:04,296
(TEAM RHYTHM chooses...)

1875
01:35:04,296 --> 01:35:06,296
(Chih En.)

1876
01:35:06,296 --> 01:35:07,426
Chih En.

1877
01:35:08,695 --> 01:35:09,865
- Chih En? - Really?

1878
01:35:10,735 --> 01:35:12,796
Chih En.

1879
01:35:14,306 --> 01:35:16,935
So he's traded Royce...

1880
01:35:17,536 --> 01:35:20,306
with Chih En.

1881
01:35:20,945 --> 01:35:22,075
(Blaming)

1882
01:35:22,075 --> 01:35:25,846
YUGYEOM's blaming you with his eyes.

1883
01:35:26,315 --> 01:35:28,515
(You can't do that.)

1884
01:35:30,485 --> 01:35:34,655
(Chih En became TEAM RHYTHM's player.)

1885
01:35:34,655 --> 01:35:36,256
He's making me feel competitive.

1886
01:35:38,025 --> 01:35:40,765
We lost all the key players.

1887
01:35:41,626 --> 01:35:42,895
This is merciless.

1888
01:35:43,596 --> 01:35:44,895
So this is how you play the game.

1889
01:35:45,636 --> 01:35:46,636
This is what you call a league.

1890
01:35:47,605 --> 01:35:49,036
It's making me feel competitive.

1891
01:35:50,735 --> 01:35:53,636
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup)

1892
01:35:53,636 --> 01:35:56,645
(TEAM GROOVE's bench)

1893
01:35:56,645 --> 01:35:59,575
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup)

1894
01:35:59,575 --> 01:36:02,185
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench)

1895
01:36:02,185 --> 01:36:04,655
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup)

1896
01:36:04,655 --> 01:36:07,556
(TEAM BEAT's bench)

1897
01:36:08,225 --> 01:36:11,956
Now, I will reveal Round Two.

1898
01:36:11,956 --> 01:36:16,966
(Revealing Universe League Round 2)

1899
01:36:17,395 --> 01:36:18,735
League match Round Two.

1900
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:21,935
I, Intercept.

1901
01:36:23,336 --> 01:36:24,836
(Intercept)

1902
01:36:24,836 --> 01:36:25,836
Intercept.

1903
01:36:26,405 --> 01:36:27,475
Intercept?

1904
01:36:28,546 --> 01:36:32,716
You're going to intercept the new song.

1905
01:36:32,716 --> 01:36:35,615
(Intercept the new song.)

1906
01:36:35,615 --> 01:36:36,716
Oh, gosh.

1907
01:36:37,185 --> 01:36:40,725
Your directors prepared new songs for starting players.

1908
01:36:41,056 --> 01:36:42,086
Really?

1909
01:36:42,626 --> 01:36:46,195
The bench will choose other starting players to compete...

1910
01:36:46,195 --> 01:36:48,765
and intercept their new song.

1911
01:36:49,195 --> 01:36:50,666
- That's bad. - Let's intercept.

1912
01:36:50,735 --> 01:36:52,735
- Let's intercept. - We can do it.

1913
01:36:52,996 --> 01:36:56,136
And only the winning team will get to...

1914
01:36:56,735 --> 01:36:58,905
release the song.

1915
01:37:00,075 --> 01:37:01,206
Does that mean there's a chance we won't?

1916
01:37:01,645 --> 01:37:03,975
Two teams will compete for the same song,

1917
01:37:03,975 --> 01:37:06,246
and only the winning team gets to release the song.

1918
01:37:06,975 --> 01:37:08,815
Intercept it or secure it?

1919
01:37:08,815 --> 01:37:11,216
Who will get to keep the new song?

1920
01:37:12,655 --> 01:37:14,325
(How dare you eye our new song?)

1921
01:37:14,556 --> 01:37:16,586
(Hurting their pride)

1922
01:37:16,886 --> 01:37:18,695
(We'll never lose it.)

1923
01:37:19,655 --> 01:37:22,395
(The starting lineup's determined declaration to secure the new song)

1924
01:37:23,065 --> 01:37:24,195
(Strong tension between the starting lineup and bench)

1925
01:37:26,395 --> 01:37:28,365
(Bugged)

1926
01:37:28,666 --> 01:37:31,206
(There's a reason none of us has a yellow card.)

1927
01:37:33,575 --> 01:37:35,506
(The bench challenges the starting lineup.)

1928
01:37:35,846 --> 01:37:36,846
(Look at you. Are you confident?)

1929
01:37:37,246 --> 01:37:38,246
(Are you out of your mind?)

1930
01:37:38,515 --> 01:37:39,846
(It's the starting lineup versus the bench.)

1931
01:37:40,376 --> 01:37:41,945
(They're just cute.)

1932
01:37:41,945 --> 01:37:43,615
(We have what it takes to win.)

1933
01:37:43,615 --> 01:37:45,355
(I plan to smash the starting lineup.)

1934
01:37:46,015 --> 01:37:47,256
(Match Theme: Intercept)

1935
01:37:47,386 --> 01:37:49,185
Are you ready?

1936
01:37:50,626 --> 01:37:51,825
I plan to intercept it.

1937
01:37:52,225 --> 01:37:53,426
