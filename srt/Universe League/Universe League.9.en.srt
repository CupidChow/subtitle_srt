(Or will they stay behind in the locker room?)

153
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,889
Move or stay.

00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:40,580
- Woong Ki... - I'm happy to advance this early.

260
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,450

269
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:11,950
- Don't worry. - Wait for us up there.

270
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,620
Hurry up here.

271
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,889
The talented vocalist and performer...

272
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,990
is also a star in the making. It's Cha Woong Ki.

273
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,629
Congratulations.

274
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,559
(Congratulations)

278
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,070

Good going.

287
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,429
Thank you...

288
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,929
for once again...

289
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,330
letting me finish high...

290
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,169
in...

291
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,100
the overall standings.

292
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:10,370
To be honest,

293
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,350
I was only able to finish in first place...

294
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:18,880
thanks...

295
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,820
to the help...

296
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,349
of all my teammates.

297
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,689
That's why I'd like to thank them once again.

298
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,059
Also,

299
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,590

00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,659

Cha Woong Ki...

304
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,109
advances to the finals as the first player for TEAM BEAT.

305
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,809
(TEAM BEAT's first finalist, Cha Woong Ki)

306
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:52,980
Woong Ki...

307
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,219
started off in TEAM BEAT, and he will end in TEAM BEAT.

308
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
Lucky him.

309
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,649
Good job.

310
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,158
Next, we'll announce...

311
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,090
those advancing via fan voting...

312
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,630
from TEAM GROOVE.

313
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,429
Why couldn't you go with TEAM RHYTHM first?

314
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,460
Please announce the result for TEAM RHYTHM first.

315
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:10,729
(Even Chih En the robot is nervous about the final result.)

316
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,029
I'm too scared to stay seated.

317
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,409
Since TEAM GROOVE ended in second place...

318
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:19,110
after the league match,

319
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,879
three players will advance to the finals.

320
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,908
(The 3 most favored players from TEAM GROOVE will advance.)

321
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:25,509
I don't know what'll happen if I don't get chosen for this.

322
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,019
I'll first announce...

323
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,419
the player who's in third place via fan voting.

324
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,689
He's starting off with who's in third place.

325
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,119
(Who's in 3rd place on TEAM GROOVE via fan voting?)

326
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,389
The one in third place via fan voting...

327
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,129
on TEAM GROOVE.

328
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,130
(Who's in 3rd place via fan voting on TEAM GROOVE?)

329
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,299
(Which player from TEAM GROOVE will become a finalist?)

330
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,929
It's Kenta.

331
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,199
Kenta, move to stage.

332
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,070
(Kenta, move to stage.)

333
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:53,809
(Flustered)

334
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,179
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

335
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:59,979
(He moves to the stage as a finalist for TEAM GROOVE...)

336
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,450
(while being congratulated by his teammates.)

337
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:03,649
Lucky him.

338
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:08,620
- He's so cool. - Look at how handsome he is.

339
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,289
Kenta is known for his charming baritone voice.

340
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,899
The one who's been in charge of the songs' highlights.

341
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,200
He is a key player on TEAM GROOVE.

342
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,269
Congratulations.

343
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,939
- Kenta, congrats. - Go, Kenta!

344
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,439
- He's so handsome. - He's really good-looking.

345
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,080
- He's so good-looking. - Tell me about it.

346
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,519
In the overall standings, Kenta's ends...

347
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,849
in 12th place.

348
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,648
(Overall standings: Kenta, 12th place, 171,378 points)

349
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:39,689
He ends in 12th place.

350
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,259
To be honest, when I first...

351
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,289
joined Universe League,

352
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,659
I didn't know...

353
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:51,700
if I'd be able to advance to the finals.

354
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,100
I also was worried about how many people...

355
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,610
would approve...

356
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,278
of my talent...

357
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,939
as a performing artist.

358
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,779
Being able...

359
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,350
to perform...

360
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,519
and practice within a team...

361
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,019
that only had teammates with love to share...

362
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:17,929
helped build my confidence.

363
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,299
I was chosen as a finalist...

364
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,528
by finishing in third place on my team...

365
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,799
only thanks to the fans...

366
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,070
which I will forever be grateful for.

367
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,840
I won't forget that being chosen...

368
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,549
is a responsibility I must bear...

369
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,408
and make sure to deliver...

370
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:42,620
my best performance yet in the finals.

371
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,090
Thank you so much.

372
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,518
(Congratulations)

373
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,519
Next,

374
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,360
I will announce the player on TEAM GROOVE...

375
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,199
who is in second place via fan voting.

376
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,799
(The player on TEAM GROOVE who's in 2nd place via fan voting)

377
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,768
(Who on TEAM GROOVE ended in 2nd place via fan voting?)

378
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:59,528
The player on TEAM GROOVE to end in 2nd place.

379
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:02,399
(Who on TEAM GROOVE ended in 2nd place via fan voting?)

380
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,210
Is it Hee Jun?

381
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:06,409
Really? Is it Hee Jun?

382
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,339
- I think it can be Joo Hyoung. - Yes, that's a possibility.

383
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,810
Kyung Ho or Hee Jun.

384
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,279
It's hard to guess who it'll be.

385
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
TEAM GROOVE's...

386
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,918
Kim Joo Hyoung. Move to stage.

387
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,059
(Kim Joo Hyoung, move to stage.)

388
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,090
Me?

389
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,228
(Dumbfounded)

390
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:27,429
Are you sure it's me?

391
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:31,999
(Congratulations)

392
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:34,169
Joo Hyoung won't get to be on TEAM BEAT.

393
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,040
(Always so cheeky)

394
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,669
The player on TEAM GROOVE...

395
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:41,540
who always received a lot of votes.

396
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,050
It's Kim Joo Hyoung. Congratulations.

397
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,090
In the overall standings, Kim Joo Hyoung ends...

398
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,859
in tenth place.

399
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,459
(Overall standings: Kim Joo Hyoung, 10th place, 188,339 points)

400
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,958
I had no idea I'd end in TEAM GROOVE...

401
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,969
with a high ranking of second place.

402
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:08,738
I thank all the fans...

403
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:11,010
who supported and voted for me.

404
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,610
I won't fold easily. Thank you.

405
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,179
Once again, congratulations.

406
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,310
How cool was that?

407
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:24,020
Now, I will announce...

408
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:25,449
the final player...

409
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
on TEAM GROOVE...

410
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,089
who will become a finalist via fan voting.

411
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,290
(Which last player will become a finalist via fan voting?)

412
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,659
I bet it's Park Han.

413
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:35,760
It's got to be Han.

414
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:39,498
The one on TEAM GROOVE...

415
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:40,699
(Will it be Park Han who ended in 1st place after Round 3?)

416
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:42,238
who came in first place via fan voting.

417
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:46,540
(Or will it be someone else?)

418
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,238
Park Han, move to stage.

419
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:51,550
(Park Han, move to stage.)

420
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:58,249
(The player on our team in 1st place!)

421
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,458
- You did great, Han. - Nice job.

422
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:02,459
Congrats.

423
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,059
(As colleagues first rather than as rivals)

424
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,629
- See you soon. - Make a cool entrance.

425
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,159
- See you soon. - We'll see your entrance.

426
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:08,499
Make a cool entrance.

427
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,630
(Of course it's Park Han.)

428
00:19:12,969 --> 00:19:15,139
We failed to steal Park Han as well.

429
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,540
After being a trainee for seven years,

430
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,639
Park Han made his first appearance on a survival audition show.

431
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:23,909
With his solid basic skills and depth as a performer,

432
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,009
he won over the fans.

433
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,010
(Solid basic skills and depth as a performer made him a finalist!)

434
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
Nice. Good job.

435
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,320
In the overall standings, Park Han ends...

436
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,658
in fifth place.

437
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:39,559
(Overall standings: Park Han, 5th place, 467,242 points)

438
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,800
(Goodness)

439
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,370
I'm happy to know I'll be advancing...

440
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,199
to the finals. Also,

441
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,600
I want...

442
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,669
to thank you all...

443
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,479
for casting so many votes...

444
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,139
for me. And...

445
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,479
in the finals,

446
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,479
I'd like to do even better...

447
00:20:02,949 --> 00:20:04,149
so that I can...

448
00:20:04,689 --> 00:20:05,749
make my debut...

449
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:09,090
with my teammates on TEAM GROOVE. Thank you.

450
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,260
(Han, congratulations.)

451
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:18,770
Park Han, Kim Joo Hyoung, and Kenta...

452
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,600
were chosen by the fans...

453
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,800
to become finalists for TEAM GROOVE. Congratulations.

454
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,079
I'm truly happy for them...

455
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,709
even though it wasn't my name that was called out.

456
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,610
That's sadder in a way.

457
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,149
Lastly, I'll announce the finalists for TEAM RHYTHM,

458
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,260
the team that came in first place after the league match.

459
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,229
(They suddenly tense up.)

460
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,499
(Finally, it's time to reveal the finalists for TEAM RHYTHM.)

461
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,999
Up to five of the players on TEAM RHYTHM...

462
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,169
who received the most votes...

463
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,810
will advance to the finals.

464
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,340
I'll start with the player in fifth place.

465
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:02,909
The player on TEAM RHYTHM to finish in fifth place.

466
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:06,080
(Out of the 14 players on TEAM RHYTHM)

467
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:11,649
(Which player was chosen by the fans to become the first finalist?)

468
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,520
It's Park Ju Won. Move to stage.

469
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:21,829
(The first finalist for TEAM RHYTHM is Park Ju Won.)

470
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,398
Go, Ju Won!

471
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:24,599
(Ju Won)

472
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,629
I knew it.

473
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,630
(Ju Won, congratulations.)

474
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:27,770
Thanks.

475
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,638
Thank you.

476
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:31,109
(He moves to the stage while being cheered on by his teammates!)

477
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,939
- Ju Won. - Good luck!

478
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,939
Our pride.

479
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,580
With his fierce performance...

480
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,320
and energy he presented on stage,

481
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,179
he was able to advance to the finals.

482
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:46,389
Congratulations.

483
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,820
Our Ju Won.

484
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,790
Our Ju Won.

485
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,290
He was our Ju Won.

486
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,459
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

487
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,869
Congratulations.

488
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,070
(Congratulations)

489
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,139
In the overall standings, Park Ju Won ends...

490
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,839
in sixth place.

491
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,748
(Overall standings: Park Ju Won, 6th place, 414,534 points)

492
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:15,749
That's TEAM RHYTHM.

493
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,149
- Han was in fifth place, right? - Right.

494
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:21,360
TEAM RHYTHM's players must be in 1st place to 4th place.

495
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:26,360
During the first round of drafts,

496
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:28,860
I was the first one to sit in the seats...

497
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:30,969
for TEAM RHYTHM.

498
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,029
Once again, I'm the first one to occupy a seat here.

499
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,340
It's fascinating in a way,

500
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:39,209
and it also brings me joy.

501
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:40,669
I always say this,

502
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:44,280
but my days have been a dream...

503
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,949
thanks to all the fans.

504
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,279
(Clutching with both hands)

505
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,290
Since...

506
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,260
you voted for me, I will keep doing my best...

507
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,560
to become someone...

508
00:22:58,189 --> 00:22:59,489
that you can be proud of.

509
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,830
Thank you.

510
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:07,269
Next, I'll announce...

511
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,100
the player on TEAM RHYTHM who is in fourth place.

512
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,340
- Okay. Up next... - Is it Chih En?

513
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:15,010
Gosh, whatever.

514
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,279
- Is it Chih En? - I think it's Chih En.

515
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,978
- Is it Chih En? - Up next, we have Chih En.

516
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:20,249
And then...

517
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,979
(Which player on TEAM RHYTHM is in 4th place?)

518
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:26,320
Chih En, move to stage.

519
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:30,360
(Chih En is the second finalist for TEAM RHYTHM.)

520
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,259
(I knew it.)

521
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,559
Congratulations.

522
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,699
(I knew it.)

523
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:36,729
Get out of here, Chih En.

524
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,600
- Bye. - Move it along.

525
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,870
- Chih En. - To stage.

526
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,039
Was it Chih En?

527
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,469
Goodness.

528
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,438
But Chih En likes me.

529
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,540
(He's hung up on him.)

530
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,809
Chih En has looks that turn heads...

531
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,820
and is fluent in Korean.

532
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,889
He advances to the finals as a player for TEAM RHYTHM.

533
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,020
Congratulations.

534
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,260
(While being congratulated by those who already advanced)

535
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:10,429
(He sits with TEAM RHYTHM as the one in 4th place.)

536
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:15,299
In the overall standings, Chih En ends in fourth place.

537
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,938
(Overall standings: Chih En, 4th place, 504,012 points)

538
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:20,939
- No way. - A score of 504...

539
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:22,938
His score is over 500,000 points.

540
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,279
(The scores skyrocket for those in 4th place and higher.)

541
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,809
- No way. - Starting from him,

542
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,909
the players have over 500,000 points.

543
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:32,790
I had no idea I'd be able to make it this far.

544
00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:35,419
I know I lack in many ways,

545
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,159
but since many have been supporting me...

546
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,100
and voting for me,

547
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,830
I will keep doing my best...

548
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:47,969
to become someone...

549
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,398
who only puts his best forward.

550
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:51,409
Thank you.

551
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,509
How can he be that fluent in Korean?

552
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,479
Tell me about it. He sounds like a native.

553
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,679
Next, I'll announce the player on TEAM RHYTHM...

554
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
who finished in third place via fan voting.

555
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,350
- I bet it's Zhang Shuaibo. - Yes, ZS.

556
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,219
- Zhang Shuaibo. - It has to be Zhang Shuaibo.

557
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,619
It must be Zhang Shuaibo.

558
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,020
(Zhang Shuaibo was in 3rd place after Round 3.)

559
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:14,159
(Steven has always been high up in the rankings.)

560
00:25:14,699 --> 00:25:17,969
(Who out of the two will be the third finalist?)

561
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,539
Zhang Shuaibo, move to stage.

562
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,769
(Zhang Shuaibo, move to stage.)

563
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,908
Zhang Shuaibo.

564
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:26,109
It's Zhang Shuaibo.

565
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,479
(Smirking)

566
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:32,149
(Zhang Shuaibo is the third finalist for TEAM RHYTHM.)

567
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,080
- Go on. - Join me soon.

568
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,050
(We'll soon be there.)

569
00:25:39,449 --> 00:25:40,918
Zhang Shuaibo...

570
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,959
captured everyone's attention on stage with his unique ideas.

571
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,158
The fans voted him to become a finalist.

572
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,659
- Congratulations. - Hi.

573
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,329
(He sees Woong Ki and gets emotional.)

574
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,340
(Why?)

575
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:57,100
(Congratulations, Woong Ki!)

576
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,370
Hi.

577
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,718
In the overall standings, Zhang Shuaibo ends in third place.

578
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:11,689
(Overall standings: Zhang Shuaibo, 3rd place, 525,193 points)

579
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,090
(Check out his score.)

580
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,159
My gosh.

581
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,928
- Goodness. - My gosh.

582
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:21,428
It was close between him and Chih En.

583
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:23,229
(It was close between him and Chih En.)

584
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,069
(Him and his best friend Chih En...)

585
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,269
(advanced to the finals finishing in 3rd and 4th place.)

586
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,169
I thank you from the heart.

587
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,340
This time around,

588
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,310
I won't leave any regrets behind.

589
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,948
I want to show everyone...

590
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:43,850
that Zhang Shuaibo can do it.

591
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,659
Whatever happens, I wish for everyone on Universe League...

592
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:51,790
to have a bright future.

593
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,290
Right.

594
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,658
I believe I can make it this time.

595
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:59,399
(I believe I can make it this time.)

596
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:01,469
Thank you.

597
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:06,609
Zhang Shuaibo!

598
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,668
(Zhang Shuaibo, don't cry!)

599
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,010
- You can do it. - You can do it!

600
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,780
(Zhang Shuaibo, welcome.)

601
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,149
I'll now announce...

602
00:27:17,949 --> 00:27:19,790
the player in second place on TEAM RHYTHM.

603
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:22,459
(Only 2 more will become finalists via fan voting.)

604
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:24,458
(The two players on TEAM RHYTHM...)

605
00:27:24,459 --> 00:27:26,929
(who have been high in terms of individual rankings.)

606
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,360
Is it Steven?

607
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,929
(Our leader Steven?)

608
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,329
(Which of the two did fans choose...)

609
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,439
(as the player in 2nd place for TEAM RHYTHM?)

610
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:39,209
Steven, move to stage.

611
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,908
(The fans voted,)

612
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:46,149
(and Steven came out in 2nd place for TEAM RHYTHM.)

613
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,079
(His teammates congratulate him from the heart.)

614
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,388
- Go, Steven! - Go, Steven!

615
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:54,590
(They even prepared a ceremony for him.)

616
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,889
(What was that?)

617
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,389
- My gosh. - Good job, Steven.

618
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,959
- Go, Steven. - I'll see you on stage.

619
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:03,429
- Okay. - Okay.

620
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,069
- Bye. - Bye!

621
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,199
- Sure. Take care. - Bye!

622
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,569
By leading the songs in for TEAM RHYTHM,

623
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,239
Steven left a strong impression.

624
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,809
The fans voted for him to be a finalist.

625
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:17,810
Congratulations.

626
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:19,010
Hello.

627
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,620
(We knew you'd join us!)

628
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,889
(I knew our leader would join us!)

629
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,988
In the overall standings, Steven ends in second place.

630
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:33,530
(Steven, 2nd place, 598,718 points)

631
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:37,099
(Overall standings: Steven, 2nd place, 598,718 points)

632
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,040
(Overall standings: Steven, 2nd place, 598,718 points)

633
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,699
I knew he'd get a high score.

634
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,040
I'm dying to see JL's score.

635
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,380
I think his will be on a different level.

636
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,918
I thank the fans for allowing me...

637
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:57,850
to end up in second place.

638
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:00,619
You've always been cheering me on...

639
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,489
and have been voting for me which I'm grateful for.

640
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,589
From start to finish,

641
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,629
I was able to present stylish performances...

642
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,099
as a player on TEAM RHYTHM. I thank...

643
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,070
the directors for giving me this opportunity.

644
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,610
I will continue to work hard...

645
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:25,249
so that I can put on better performances...

646
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,249
and present good results. Thank you.

647
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:33,919
- Go, Steven! - Go, Steven!

648
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,689
Now, I'll announce the player on TEAM RHYTHM...

649
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,158
who finished in first place.

650
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,228
(The 1st place player on TEAM RHYTHM via fan voting)

651
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:44,769
It's JL.

652
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,800
JL.

653
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,169
The first-place player on TEAM RHYTHM.

654
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,968
(Who's the 1st place player on TEAM RHYTHM via fan voting?)

655
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:52,540
- It's JL. - JL.

656
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,708
- JL. - It's JL.

657
00:29:55,709 --> 00:29:56,709
(Is it JL who was in 1st place after Round 2 and Round 3?)

658
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:59,408
JL, move to stage.

659
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:00,510

Good job.

667
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,800
- Agreed. - Of course, it's him.

668
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:19,199
He's talented and popular. Lucky him.

669
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,509
JL was the only player who was wanted...

670
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,469
by the directors of all three teams.

671
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:32,379
The all-rounder who can sing, dance, and command the stage.

672
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,780
He is truly loved by global fans.

673
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:36,320
Congratulations.

674
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,678

- Hi. - Welcome.

677
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:43,159
(TEAM RHYTHM warmly welcomes him.)

678
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:46,489
In the overall standings, JL also ends...

679
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,658
in first place. Congratulations.

680
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:53,199

(JL, 1st place, 1,099,728 points)

683
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,408
(Overall standings: JL, 1st place, 1,099,728 points)

684
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,109
- No way. - Unbelievable.

685
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,638
- That's insane. - That's a shockingly high score.

686
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,380
My gosh!

687
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:05,148
What the... No way.

688
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:07,209
His score...

689
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:14,620
is 1,099,728 points.

690
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,888
- My gosh. - No way.

691
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:18,959
I love it.

692
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,259
First of all, I want to thank...

693
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,629
my TEAM RHYTHM members and the directors. Thank you.

694

Thank you so much.

695
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,639
And of course, everyone around the world...

696
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,979
To be honest, up until now... I can't...

697
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,120
I can't believe that we're standing here...

698
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,289
and getting this much support from everyone.

699
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,290
It's just unbelievable.

700
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:53,259
And we will promise...

701
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,800
one thing for our final stage.

702
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,570
We will show you...

703
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:01,870
one last time who TEAM RHYTHM is.

704
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,239
Thank you so much.

705
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,639
I will only continue to work hard.

706
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,138
JL, Steven, Zhang Shuaibo,

707
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:15,178
Chih En, and Park Ju Won were chosen by the fans...

708
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:18,289

00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:21,389
(were chosen by the fans as finalists for TEAM RHYTHM.)

712
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:27,630
Via Global Fan Voting, nine players...

713
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,760
advanced to the finals.

714
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,599
Now, for the players to make it to the finals,

715
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,099
(The remaining players)

716
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,869
they must be chosen by the directors.

717
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,879
(The remaining players...)

718
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
(must be chosen by the directors to advance to the finals.)

719
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:47,909
(The last chance for them that will decide their fate)

720
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,879
- My gosh. - Oh, no.

721
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,478
(Which of the remaining 25 will become finalists?)

722
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:53,120
Okay. Let's start praying.

723
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,120
Here are the spots left on each team.

724
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,389
Two spots for TEAM RHYTHM.

725
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:02,100
Four spots for TEAM GROOVE.

726
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,698
Six spots for TEAM BEAT.

727
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:05,969
(There are 6 spots left for TEAM BEAT.)

728
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,399
The directors...

729
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,870
can choose from any team...

730
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:16,040
for the players.

731
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:18,479
The ranking doesn't matter at all.

732
00:33:19,179 --> 00:33:23,019
(The locker room gets filled with tension...)

733
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,418
(due to the unpredictable results.)

734
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:26,419
My hands are sweaty.

735
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,519
(Which player will advance to the the finals...)

736
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,760
(after being chosen by a director?)

737
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,260
Directors, I will give you some time to think.

738
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,738
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

739
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:45,909
The nomination will be based on the final league match ranking.

740
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:49,510
TEAM RHYTHM who placed first will start.

741
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,080
Please get up on the stage.

742
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,379
(Feeling nervous)

743
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
Gosh.

744
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,789
(The time of selection for TEAM RHYTHM's directors)

745
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,759
All right. You may select a player from any team.

746
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Right.

747
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,790
Please announce which player you have selected.

748
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:11,300
I've thought a lot about this.

749
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:15,668
The player that I am thinking of...

750
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:18,709
has a lot more potential...

751
00:34:19,539 --> 00:34:20,669
than what he has shown so far.

752
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,779
- Jeong Woo? - Jeong Woo.

753
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,110
(Seo Jeong Woo who was traded in during the last round?)

754
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,479
Daisuke.

755
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:30,249
The youngest one of TEAM RHYTHM. It's Daisuke.

756
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:32,589
(TEAM RHYTHM's director selection, Daisuke)

757
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,049
Gosh, Daisuke!

758
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,859
- Daisuke! - Yes!

759
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,919
It's Daisuke.

760
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:38,090
Daisuke?

761
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,958
(I love it.)

762
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,958
Daisuke, move to stage.

763
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:43,199
(Daisuke, move to stage.)

764
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,099
- Go! - Thank you.

765
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,129
Let's go, Daisuke!

766
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,140
Daisuke!

767
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,510
He made his challenge for his first audition at the age of 14.

768
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:56,809
Daisuke.

769
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,379
He advances to the finals with the director's selection.

770
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,450
(He advances to the finals with the director's selection!)

771
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,089
Daisuke's overall ranking is eighth.

772
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,118
(Overall standings: Daisuke, 8th place, 298,630 points)

773
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,159
- He's in 8th place? - He's in 8th place.

774
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,590
So Daisuke was in eighth place.

775
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,259
- They're all single-digits. - That means...

776
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,700
all seven of them might be single-digit standings.

777
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,470
I love you, Daisuke!

778
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,269
Daisuke grew up so much.

779
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,070
To be honest, when I didn't make it...

780
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,538
in the top 5 for the fan voting,

781
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:29,880
I was worried that...

782
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,079
I would get released from TEAM RHYTHM.

783
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:40,019
As the directors chose me,

784
00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:44,890
I feel really happy and grateful.

785
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:48,360
I still lack a lot.

786
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,869
I will work hard...

787
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,430
to show all of you great performances.

788
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:56,599
Please watch over me!

789
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,269
Congratulations.

790
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,979
- Daisuke! - Yes!

791
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,209
Thank you.

792
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:05,610
Gosh.

793
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,208
Great job.

794
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,950
- Thank you. - Thank you.

795
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,119
TEAM RHYTHM's last finalist will be announced.

796
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:15,660
The last one.

797
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,789
(Feeling nervous)

798
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,590
TEAM RHYTHM's last player...

799
00:36:21,999 --> 00:36:25,930
was really hard to decide on.

800
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:29,598
This player has never been on stage...

801
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,010
with TEAM RHYTHM.

802
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,639
He has never performed with TEAM RHYTHM.

803
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,380
(A player that has never performed with TEAM RHYTHM?)

804
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,510
Is it Han Seo?

805
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:41,050
I think it's Han Seo.

806
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
Please.

807
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:47,749
As we watched him perform,

808
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:50,189
he kept improving...

809
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:51,760
and grew a lot.

810
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,429
He seems like a player...

811
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,800
that can create a new dynamic with our team.

812
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,499
Right. This player is...

813
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:06,687
(Who will be the one to take TEAM RHYTHM's last spot?)

814
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:09,176
Right. This player is...

815
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:12,379
(Who will be the one to take TEAM RHYTHM's last spot?)

816
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:15,318
Seo Jeong Woo.

817
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:18,689
(TEAM RHYTHM's director selection, Seo Jeong Woo)

818
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,558
Seo Jeong Woo.

819
00:37:22,229 --> 00:37:23,757
- Jeong Woo! - Seo Jeong Woo,

820
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:24,958
move to stage.

821
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,799
(Seo Jeong Woo, move to stage.)

822
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:31,268
(The remaining teammates...)

823
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:32,338
(congratulate TEAM RHYTHM's last player.)

824
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:33,899
- High-five! - Let's go!

825
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:36,238
- Let's go! - I'm sorry.

826
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,839
- Gosh. - Joke!

827
00:37:39,278 --> 00:37:41,038
You're so pretty

828
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,947
(Seo Jeong Woo advances to the finals as TEAM RHYTHM.)

829
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:43,948
Great job.

830
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:46,618
(Disappointed)

831
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:52,188
Player Seo Jeong Woo has made the fans' hearts flutter...

832
00:37:52,189 --> 00:37:53,689
with his bright boyish charms.

833
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:55,689
He started as a rookie trainee...

834
00:37:56,158 --> 00:37:58,388
and showed an amazing progress of growth.

835
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:02,569
Seo Jeong Woo's overall standing...

836
00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:04,527
- is 14th. - Thank you.

837
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:05,738
(Overall standings: Seo Jeong Woo, 14th place, 166,769 points)

838
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:08,439
No!

839
00:38:13,138 --> 00:38:17,249
To be honest, I don't really know...

840
00:38:18,278 --> 00:38:19,479
what to say right now.

841
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:24,789
As the directors have decided to trust and select me,

842
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:28,628
I will work hard and show you my development.

843
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:34,158
And for the fans who voted for me,

844
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:37,528
I will prepare a greater performance for the final stage.

845
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:39,298
I will become a Seo Jeong Woo that works even harder.

846
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:40,368
Thank you.

847
00:38:46,138 --> 00:38:48,678
TEAM RHYTHM's seven finalists...

848
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:51,549
have all been selected.

849
00:38:52,278 --> 00:38:53,319
Congratulations.

850
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:00,618
Next up, it's TEAM GROOVE...

851
00:39:01,218 --> 00:39:02,359
that has placed second in the league match.

852
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,428
Director Lee Chang Sub, please move to the stage.

853
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:11,799
- GROOVE. - It has begun.

854
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:13,467
- Gosh. - Only seven are selected.

855
00:39:13,468 --> 00:39:17,768
There are 23 players left in the locker room.

856
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:19,008
(There are still 23 players left in the locker room.)

857
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:21,807
There are four spots left for TEAM GROOVE.

858
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:22,948
(There are only four spots left for TEAM GROOVE.)

859
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,948
Which player will Director Lee Chang Sub select?

860
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:28,888
Please announce it.

861
00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:32,717
(Who will become TEAM GROOVE's first director selection finalist?)

862
00:39:32,718 --> 00:39:34,519
The player that I have chosen...

863
00:39:38,129 --> 00:39:39,198
is the player...

864
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:44,499
that will be in charge of TEAM GROOVE's performances.

865
00:39:45,169 --> 00:39:48,708
(Vocal group TEAM GROOVE's performance player?)

866
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:49,709
- Hey. - Kyung Ho.

867
00:39:53,638 --> 00:39:54,808
It's Jang Kyung Ho.

868
00:39:54,908 --> 00:39:58,848
(TEAM GROOVE's director selection, Jang Kyung Ho)

869
00:39:59,218 --> 00:40:01,677
Jang Kyung Ho, move to stage.

870
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:04,118
(Jang Kyung Ho, move to stage.)

871
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:05,558
Agreed!

872
00:40:08,218 --> 00:40:09,528
Wait right there. I'll be there soon.

873
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:14,158
(He moves to the stage with heartfelt congratulations.)

874
00:40:17,629 --> 00:40:20,669
It's the one that upgraded TEAM GROOVE's performances.

875
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:22,408
It's Jang Kyung Ho.

876
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:26,379
Jang Kyung Ho's overall standing...

877
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:28,708
is 16th.

878
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:32,019
(Overall standings: Jang Kyung Ho, 16th place, 156,105 points)

879
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:34,749
As I was in a group before...

880
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:38,249
and experienced bad results continuously,

881
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:43,158
I found myself preparing to accept elimination...

882
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:44,959
than being excited...

883
00:40:45,058 --> 00:40:46,799
for success once again.

884
00:40:47,598 --> 00:40:49,828
I hated myself...

885
00:40:49,928 --> 00:40:51,698
for being used to this.

886
00:40:53,399 --> 00:40:54,999
Director Lee Chang Sub trusted me...

887
00:40:55,868 --> 00:40:57,669
when I lacked trust in my own self.

888
00:40:58,609 --> 00:41:00,408
I want to thank you,

889
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:05,249
and I will do my best...

890
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:07,149
for the role you have selected me for.

891
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:10,488
I will make my debut with TEAM GROOVE...

892
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,689
with diverse and impressive performances.

893
00:41:13,789 --> 00:41:14,819
Thank you.

894
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,058
Congratulations.

895
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:24,629
(Kyung Ho heads to his teammates with a bright face.)

896
00:41:25,868 --> 00:41:29,108
(It feels great to see his team again.)

897
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:30,638
TEAM GROOVE has the best looks.

898
00:41:32,738 --> 00:41:35,508
(There are only three spots left for TEAM GROOVE.)

899
00:41:36,049 --> 00:41:40,479
(Which player will be selected as TEAM GROOVE's finalist next?)

900
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:44,049
Please announce the second player.

901
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:45,388
This is scary.

902
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,459
Personally, I think TEAM GROOVE's...

903
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:54,399
(It's someone from TEAM GROOVE?)

904
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:58,939
(Disappointed)

905
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:01,598
rapping...

906
00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:03,468
will be taken care of by this player.

907
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:07,738
- Go ahead, Han Seo. - It might not be me.

908
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:10,408
I think it's Hee Jun.

909
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:13,848
(Who will Director Lee Chang Sub select from TEAM GROOVE's rappers?)

910
00:42:16,388 --> 00:42:17,388
Koo Han Seo.

911
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:24,528
(TEAM GROOVE's director selection, Koo Han Seo)

912
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,459
Congratulations.

913
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,597
- Koo Han Seo, move to stage. - You're amazing, Koo Han Seo.

914
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:31,697
- You're so amazing, Koo Han Seo. - Let's go!

915
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:32,738
Let's go!

916
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:40,908
His powerful rapping is his greatest strength.

917
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:43,848
TEAM GROOVE's main rapper, Koo Han Seo.

918
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:47,378
He has been selected by the director to advance to the finals.

919
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:49,589
(He advances to the finals with TEAM GROOVE's director selection.)

920
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:50,918
It was Koo Han Seo indeed.

921
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:52,358
- Koo Han Seo indeed. - Koo Han Seo indeed.

922
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:54,319
(We're proud of you, Koo Han Seo.)

923
00:42:54,618 --> 00:42:56,757
Awesome. Han Seo made it.

924
00:42:56,758 --> 00:42:57,859
(Awesome. Han Seo made it.)

925
00:42:58,058 --> 00:43:01,458
Koo Han Seo's overall standing is 13th.

926
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:02,668
(Overall standings: Koo Han Seo, 13th place, 166,779 points)

927
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:03,729
Han Seo placed fairly high up.

928
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:05,839
Han Seo has got the talent.

929
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:08,839
Gosh.

930
00:43:10,408 --> 00:43:12,638
I feel nervous as it's my first time doing a speech.

931
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:14,408
First of all,

932
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:19,019
I want to thank the teammates I've worked with until now.

933
00:43:20,149 --> 00:43:21,578
And...

934
00:43:22,718 --> 00:43:24,419
I was selected for the trade,

935
00:43:24,988 --> 00:43:27,258
the SEVEN mission,

936
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:30,129
and again this time by my director. I want to thank you so much.

937
00:43:30,928 --> 00:43:33,758
As I was chosen as a rapper again,

938
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:37,499
I will make sure to be a better rapper...

939
00:43:37,968 --> 00:43:40,398
than the rappers in TEAM RHYTHM and TEAM BEAT.

940
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:41,399
Thank you.

941
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,908
(A cute poke by TEAM GROOVE's main rapper)

942
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:45,339
Who is our main rapper?

943
00:43:48,379 --> 00:43:49,379
Steven?

944
00:43:50,348 --> 00:43:52,049
(You can do better than him, right, Steven?)

945
00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:55,249
There are two spots left for TEAM GROOVE now.

946
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,459
(The chance of becoming a finalist is getting smaller.)

947
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:01,088
There are two spots left.

948
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:02,689
(There are two spots left.)

949
00:44:03,488 --> 00:44:04,558
Let's go!

950
00:44:04,888 --> 00:44:11,368
(Which players will take the last two spots?)

951
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:13,399
The director's selection.

952
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,499
Please announce the third player.

953
00:44:17,308 --> 00:44:19,308
This player...

954
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:23,347
really got my attention.

955
00:44:23,348 --> 00:44:26,478
I was able to bring this player through a trade.

956
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:30,049
I think he is a really charming player.

957
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,019
- Sirin. - Sirin.

958
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:35,488
(Sirin who was traded in with his great singing skills?)

959
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:37,658
- Hee Jun. - Right. Hee Jun.

960
00:44:38,899 --> 00:44:41,658
(Kwon Hee Jun who was traded in to strengthen the team's image?)

961
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:43,569
I believe this player...

962
00:44:44,428 --> 00:44:47,638
can show more of his charms in the future.

963
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:50,538
- Hee Jun? - Hee Jun?

964
00:44:50,539 --> 00:44:51,539
Sirin?

965
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,672
(Who will TEAM GROOVE's Director Lee Chang Sub select?)

966
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:54,758
I believe this player...

967
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,667
can show more of his charms in the future.

968
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:01,737
- Hee Jun? - Hee Jun?

969
00:45:01,738 --> 00:45:02,766
Sirin?

970
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:05,977
(Who will TEAM GROOVE's Director Lee Chang Sub select?)

971
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:07,937
Kwon Hee Jun.

972
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:11,578
Kwon Hee Jun, move to stage.

973
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:18,718
(TEAM GROOVE's director selection, Kwon Hee Jun)

974
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,457
Kwon Hee Jun.

975
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:24,027
Kwon Hee Jun.

976
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:27,557
(He can't believe it even after being called by the director.)

977
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,468
- Goodbye. - Congratulations!

978
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:37,706
(He moves after getting a warm send-off from his teammates.)

979
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:38,777
Goodbye, Kwon Hee Jun.

980
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,877
(He moves after getting a warm send-off from his teammates.)

981
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:42,577
- Congratulations. - I'll wait for you guys.

982
00:45:42,578 --> 00:45:43,578
Congratulations.

983
00:45:50,017 --> 00:45:51,647
He has created performances...

984
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:53,658
of different concepts...

985
00:45:53,758 --> 00:45:56,187
with his own style. It's Kwon Hee Jun.

986
00:45:57,857 --> 00:45:58,897
Hey!

987
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:01,997
Move!

988
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,666
His overall standing is 15th.

989
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:08,698
(Overall standings: Kwon Hee Jun, 15th place, 156,380 points)

990
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,037
Congratulations.

991
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:13,537
You look amazing!

992
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:27,086
While sitting on the bench,

993
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:29,287
I saw my friends getting their names get called,

994
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,558
and a lot of things went through my head.

995
00:46:36,868 --> 00:46:40,537
For my last challenge,

996
00:46:42,368 --> 00:46:43,667
TEAM RHYTHM's bench players...

997
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:48,308
have worked hard to come this far with me.

998
00:46:49,548 --> 00:46:50,948
The members of TEAM GROOVE...

999
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,816
helped me and performed with me for amazing performances.

1000
00:46:53,817 --> 00:46:55,047
(The members of TEAM GROOVE...)

1001
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:56,717
(helped me and performed with me for amazing performances.)

1002
00:46:56,718 --> 00:46:59,356
When I struggled the most during performances...

1003
00:46:59,357 --> 00:47:01,058
and also during...

1004
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:04,888
the practice sessions,

1005
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:10,567
the one who supported me...

1006
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,127
and helped me right by my side...

1007
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:15,397
was Director Lee Chang Sub.

1008
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:18,507
I want to sincerely thank him.

1009
00:47:18,508 --> 00:47:20,937
(I want to sincerely thank Director Lee Chang Sub.)

1010
00:47:22,848 --> 00:47:25,618
I want to thank the ones who voted for me as well.

1011
00:47:27,448 --> 00:47:29,147
- Congratulations. - Congratulations, Kwon Hee Jun.

1012
00:47:33,357 --> 00:47:35,218
He's a player that feels desperate all the time.

1013
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,558
It's the last player.

1014
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:46,667
Now, there is only one spot left...

1015
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,238
for TEAM GROOVE.

1016
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:50,437
Gosh, there's one spot left.

1017
00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:54,937
There seemed to be a lot of spots.

1018
00:47:55,178 --> 00:47:56,578
Seeing it again, there are so little spots.

1019
00:47:58,578 --> 00:48:01,816
(Feeling restless at the suffocating tension)

1020
00:48:01,817 --> 00:48:02,888
What's wrong?

1021
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:05,587
I wish the last spot...

1022
00:48:06,158 --> 00:48:07,158
was for me.

1023
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:09,187
(I wish the last spot was for me.)

1024
00:48:11,028 --> 00:48:13,298
The player that will take the last spot for TEAM GROOVE.

1025
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,627
Please announce that player.

1026
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:18,368
I was really torn...

1027
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:22,266
for the last spot.

1028
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:23,908
(The last finalist selected after much consideration)

1029
00:48:25,267 --> 00:48:26,278
Well,

1030
00:48:27,377 --> 00:48:29,377
I said that I was going to look for the players' basics...

1031
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,477
and desperation.

1032
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:35,718
I think that desperation...

1033
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,118
moved my heart.

1034
00:48:40,158 --> 00:48:41,658
If I can make it through one more time,

1035
00:48:42,828 --> 00:48:44,258
I can make sure to do better than anyone.

1036
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:53,198
(The player that competed with the most desperation)

1037
00:48:53,868 --> 00:48:56,368
As I saw this player work hard,

1038
00:48:56,607 --> 00:48:58,207
I thought that he had...

1039
00:48:58,607 --> 00:48:59,607
the potential...

1040
00:49:00,078 --> 00:49:03,348
to improve even more.

1041
00:49:05,207 --> 00:49:06,278
This has led to my selection.

1042
00:49:07,877 --> 00:49:13,917
(Who is TEAM GROOVE's last finalist?)

1043
00:49:15,928 --> 00:49:17,058
Kim Gi Joong.

1044
00:49:18,227 --> 00:49:20,897
Kim Gi Joong, move to stage.

1045
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:28,337
(TEAM GROOVE's director selection, Kim Gi Joong)

1046
00:49:30,707 --> 00:49:33,007
Our MVP.

1047
00:49:33,008 --> 00:49:36,278
(Congratulating him while putting aside all of the disappointment)

1048
00:49:36,548 --> 00:49:38,477
I'll do my best. Thank you.

1049
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:40,178
Thank you.

1050
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:44,947
(An unexpected result)

1051
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:45,987
Awesome.

1052
00:49:45,988 --> 00:49:47,087
(An unexpected result)

1053
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:49,957
- Gosh, I got goosebumps. Awesome. - Gosh, Gi Joong.

1054
00:49:51,227 --> 00:49:53,627
Gi Joong was definitely the most desperate.

1055
00:49:54,198 --> 00:49:57,227
Gi Joong was the most desperate out of all 42.

1056
00:50:01,937 --> 00:50:03,637
With powerful singing skills,

1057
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:07,308
Kim Gi Joong got approved by Director Lee Chang Sub.

1058
00:50:08,537 --> 00:50:11,747
He advances to the final as TEAM GROOVE's last player.

1059
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:15,477
(Light steps to the director)

1060
00:50:15,948 --> 00:50:16,948
Congratulations.

1061
00:50:17,888 --> 00:50:20,357
(The other members of TEAM GROOVE feel embarrassed.)

1062
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,988
Gosh, Kim Gi Joong.

1063
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:24,388
He's unbelievable.

1064
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:25,488
(They feel less tense thanks to Gi Joong.)

1065
00:50:26,198 --> 00:50:28,557
Kim Gi Joong's overall standing...

1066
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,227
is 25th.

1067
00:50:30,868 --> 00:50:32,767
First of all,

1068
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,837
I didn't expect this to happen at all.

1069
00:50:36,238 --> 00:50:37,837
I really want to thank Director Lee Chang Sub...

1070
00:50:38,337 --> 00:50:40,638
for trusting me until the end.

1071
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,308
Well,

1072
00:50:42,337 --> 00:50:44,778
I got selected as TEAM GROOVE's last player.

1073
00:50:46,218 --> 00:50:49,347
I will work hard to get prepared...

1074
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:51,747
so that I will not disappoint our director.

1075
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:53,417
Thank you.

1076
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:56,127
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1077
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:03,297
(Dramatically confirming the advance to the finals)

1078
00:51:03,298 --> 00:51:04,368
Congratulations.

1079
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:11,436
Seven members of TEAM GROOVE to advance to the finals are decided.

1080
00:51:11,437 --> 00:51:13,178
(7 members of TEAM GROOVE to advance to the finals are decided.)

1081
00:51:17,647 --> 00:51:19,316
All right. Finally,

1082
00:51:19,317 --> 00:51:22,747
directors of TEAM BEAT will make decisions.

1083
00:51:23,488 --> 00:51:24,548
Directors of TEAM BEAT,

1084
00:51:25,988 --> 00:51:26,988
please.

1085
00:51:28,888 --> 00:51:30,387
(Without being selected by directors of TEAM BEAT,)

1086
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:32,928
(they're immediately eliminated.)

1087
00:51:34,198 --> 00:51:35,657
What shall I do?

1088
00:51:35,658 --> 00:51:37,428
(What if I'm not selected?)

1089
00:51:42,337 --> 00:51:46,976
Directors, please come up on the stage.

1090
00:51:46,977 --> 00:51:49,207
(Who would be selected and advance to the finals?)

1091
00:51:50,448 --> 00:51:51,448
See you.

1092
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:52,977
Please.

1093
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:56,647
This is the last chance to advance to the finals.

1094
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:58,417
TEAM BEAT...

1095
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:01,117
has six seats left.

1096
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,118
(Only 6 seats are left for TEAM BEAT.)

1097
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,257
(TEAM RHYTHM has 7 members left.)

1098
00:52:04,258 --> 00:52:06,226
(TEAM GROOVE has 7 members left.)

1099
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:07,427
(TEAM BEAT has 5 members left.)

1100
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:08,597
Please.

1101
00:52:08,598 --> 00:52:11,066
(19 people are left in total, and only 6 will advance to the finals.)

1102
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:12,067
I feel dizzy.

1103
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:15,567
Director YUGYEOM, please announce the results.

1104
00:52:17,337 --> 00:52:20,707
First of all, it's our first time to stand here.

1105
00:52:21,178 --> 00:52:22,437
(At last, we made it.)

1106
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:24,746
Goodness.

1107
00:52:24,747 --> 00:52:26,948
(It's fortunate that they stand there now.)

1108
00:52:27,218 --> 00:52:28,247
Thank you.

1109
00:52:29,317 --> 00:52:31,516
I think we're very fortunate...

1110
00:52:31,517 --> 00:52:32,758
that this player is still left.

1111
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:34,888
(Which player will be picked first by directors of TEAM BEAT?)

1112
00:52:35,388 --> 00:52:37,126
He's a member to complete...

1113
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:40,298
the performance of TEAM BEAT.

1114
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,798
- Jin Ho. - It's Jin Ho.

1115
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:44,427
(Is it Keum Jin Ho, the leader of the choreography practice?)

1116
00:52:44,428 --> 00:52:45,467
I think it's Kairi.

1117
00:52:45,468 --> 00:52:47,598
(Is it the main dancer of TEAM BEAT, Kairi?)

1118
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:48,937
He is...

1119
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,308
Kairi.

1120
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:53,877
Kairi, move to stage!

1121
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:59,517
(TEAM BEAT's directors chose Kairi.)

1122
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,348
I told you you'd make it.

1123
00:53:02,988 --> 00:53:04,617
- Congratulations. - You should be waiting for me.

1124
00:53:04,618 --> 00:53:06,558
Four of us will meet you there, so wait for us.

1125
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,087
I'll be waiting for you.

1126
00:53:09,658 --> 00:53:11,758
- See you there, Kairi. - Thank you.

1127
00:53:12,087 --> 00:53:13,798
- It's all right. - It's fine.

1128
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:15,798
- We'll be there soon. - It's all right.

1129
00:53:19,368 --> 00:53:21,437
(Congratulations, Kairi.)

1130
00:53:21,738 --> 00:53:23,308
(Clapping as fast as he feels glad)

1131
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:27,277
Kairi is TEAM BEAT's main dancer.

1132
00:53:27,278 --> 00:53:29,808
He's advancing to the finals by the directors' choice.

1133
00:53:30,348 --> 00:53:31,348
(Overall standings: Kairi, 17th place, 145,115 points)

1134
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:34,517
Kairi is in 17th place in overall standings.

1135
00:53:35,747 --> 00:53:37,417
(Running across the stage)

1136
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:38,948
Director.

1137
00:53:40,558 --> 00:53:42,017
Kairi is awesome.

1138
00:53:43,028 --> 00:53:44,528
First of all,

1139
00:53:45,428 --> 00:53:48,657
to the directors who chose me,

1140
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,598
I'd like to give thanks.

1141
00:53:51,868 --> 00:53:55,767
And I'm so happy to be in TEAM BEAT...

1142
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:59,936
which is the best team.

1143
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,138
(Touched)

1144
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:03,308
(Glad)

1145
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:07,048
I'll do my best as I always have done...

1146
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,717
and slay the final performance.

1147
00:54:08,718 --> 00:54:09,747
Thank you.

1148
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:11,417
Congratulations.

1149
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:14,086
Kairi, please move to the team's seat.

1150
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:15,118
Congratulations.

1151
00:54:16,828 --> 00:54:18,487
(Hugging tight)

1152
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:19,697
Were you waiting for me?

1153
00:54:19,698 --> 00:54:21,298
(Of course)

1154
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:22,928
Thank you.

1155
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:26,468
He finally got someone sitting next to him.

1156
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:32,607
(Happy even when their eyes meet)

1157
00:54:33,877 --> 00:54:35,808
(Second choice for TEAM BEAT)

1158
00:54:36,448 --> 00:54:38,976
Thanks to this player,

1159
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:41,078
TEAM BEAT could overcome...

1160
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:45,417
adversities and hardships.

1161
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:46,718
Jin Ho, get ready.

1162
00:54:47,558 --> 00:54:48,717
Get ready, Jin Ho.

1163
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:52,528
I'd feel sorrier if my name is not called after this.

1164
00:54:53,298 --> 00:54:54,457
You're the only one to be called.

1165
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:58,428
(What's the choice of the directors of TEAM BEAT?)

1166
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:02,037
Our golden leader, Keum Jin Ho!

1167
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:05,067
Keum Jin Ho, move to stage.

1168
00:55:05,337 --> 00:55:06,337
(Smiling)

1169
00:55:06,338 --> 00:55:08,977
(TEAM BEAT directors chose Keum Jin Ho.)

1170
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:10,877
(Now he can smile with relief.)

1171
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:13,578
- I told you not to worry. - He's right.

1172
00:55:14,517 --> 00:55:16,247
I'll see you there in five minutes.

1173
00:55:16,548 --> 00:55:18,417
I'll leave on a high note.

1174
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:20,786
- Bye. - Bye.

1175
00:55:20,787 --> 00:55:21,817
All right.

1176
00:55:22,618 --> 00:55:24,258
Okay. We should go too.

1177
00:55:24,928 --> 00:55:26,627
Now three of us remain.

1178
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:30,927
- I'm nervous. - Trust me.

1179
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:31,997
(I'm nervous.)

1180
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:36,107
Keum Jin Ho is TEAM BEAT's leader.

1181
00:55:36,238 --> 00:55:39,307
He doesn't forget the details of performance's level of completion,

1182
00:55:39,308 --> 00:55:42,706
and that's why he's called Keumtail.

1183
00:55:42,707 --> 00:55:45,207
His overall standings is 22nd place.

1184
00:55:46,578 --> 00:55:48,177
Thank you.

1185
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,278
Thank you, Director.

1186
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,187
- He's in 22nd place. - Yes.

1187
00:55:51,287 --> 00:55:52,856
(The same situation as mine)

1188
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:56,726
First of all, rather than being a player and directors,

1189
00:55:56,727 --> 00:56:00,257
the directors were like older brothers and taught me well.

1190
00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:03,067
I give thanks to them once again.

1191
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:09,368
Despite repeated challenges and failures,

1192
00:56:09,738 --> 00:56:13,107
fans kept supporting us. I sincerely appreciate that.

1193
00:56:14,977 --> 00:56:17,476
Just like Round Three, TEAM BEAT...

1194
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:20,078
will prove it with its performance.

1195
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:22,718
If we do that, TEAM BEAT...

1196
00:56:23,187 --> 00:56:25,717
will be able to realize its dream, making a debut.

1197
00:56:25,718 --> 00:56:27,657
I will make sure it happens.

1198
00:56:27,658 --> 00:56:28,687
Thank you.

1199
00:56:29,357 --> 00:56:31,627
(Choking up)

1200
00:56:31,828 --> 00:56:32,928
It's been a while, Woong Ki.

1201
00:56:33,158 --> 00:56:34,727
Thank you.

1202
00:56:34,857 --> 00:56:37,267
Woong Ki, long time no see. Kairi, it's been a while.

1203
00:56:40,198 --> 00:56:42,738
Now, TEAM BEAT has...

1204
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:44,536
four seats left.

1205
00:56:44,537 --> 00:56:46,377
(Now only four seats remain.)

1206
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,408
Four seats.

1207
00:56:51,247 --> 00:56:53,348
(Anxious)

1208
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:56,987
(The fewer the seats remain,)

1209
00:56:56,988 --> 00:56:59,017
(the more they get nervous.)

1210
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,217
We never know what happens.

1211
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:05,658
They might take the remaining members of our team.

1212
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:07,397
That's right.

1213
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:11,627
(Is a well-balanced player of TEAM GROOVE the next finalist?)

1214
00:57:12,227 --> 00:57:15,997
This time, we chose one among global players.

1215
00:57:16,408 --> 00:57:18,967
We chose one among global players.

1216
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,707
Could it be us? Global players.

1217
00:57:22,477 --> 00:57:24,477
(Perhaps?)

1218
00:57:25,107 --> 00:57:26,848
- He's... - Sirin.

1219
00:57:27,517 --> 00:57:29,787
I have a feeling they'd take Sirin.

1220
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:33,187
(Is it Sirin to strengthen their vocal?)

1221
00:57:33,758 --> 00:57:34,856
(Is it Li Zhinuo who has both vocal and choreography skills?)

1222
00:57:34,857 --> 00:57:35,917
What shall I do?

1223
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,197
- It's your turn. - You should get ready to stand up.

1224
00:57:40,198 --> 00:57:41,527
- It's Yuito's turn. - Straighten out your legs.

1225
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:42,828
It's your turn, Yuito.

1226
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:45,397
He's Yuito.

1227
00:57:46,198 --> 00:57:47,198
(TEAM BEAT, Yuito)

1228
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,396
Yuito, move to stage.

1229
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:50,936
(Yuito, move to stage.)

1230
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:54,037
(TEAM BEAT directors chose Yuito.)

1231
00:57:54,207 --> 00:57:55,436
Your name was called right away.

1232
00:57:55,437 --> 00:57:59,307
(I made it!)

1233
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:02,078
- I knew you'd make it. - I'll be waiting for you.

1234
00:58:02,618 --> 00:58:03,787
Bye.

1235
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:10,328
(Feeling sorry)

1236
00:58:10,627 --> 00:58:12,257
With his skillful Korean rap,

1237
00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:15,097
Yuito surprised everyone.

1238
00:58:15,098 --> 00:58:16,298
(Yuito can rap in fluent Korean.)

1239
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:20,537
Yuito's overall standings is 30th place.

1240
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,908
(Players under 21st place are selected in a row.)

1241
00:58:24,207 --> 00:58:25,238
Oh, my.

1242
00:58:26,578 --> 00:58:27,836
He's in 30th place.

1243
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,178
(Yuito is in 30th place.)

1244
00:58:29,747 --> 00:58:30,847
(Directors' choice has nothing to do with the players' rankings.)

1245
00:58:30,848 --> 00:58:32,078
He's in 30th place.

1246
00:58:33,348 --> 00:58:35,078
In 30th place?

1247
00:58:36,488 --> 00:58:39,817
(The players in lower ranks have a glimpse of hope now.)

1248
00:58:40,618 --> 00:58:44,857
From the beginning, I've performed...

1249
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:48,198
as a member of TEAM BEAT.

1250
00:58:49,397 --> 00:58:52,627
And I'm advancing to the finals as a TEAM BEAT member.

1251
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:59,738
So, in the finals,

1252
00:59:02,107 --> 00:59:06,317
I'd like to put all the energy I have...

1253
00:59:08,317 --> 00:59:11,016
into giving a wonderful performance.

1254
00:59:11,017 --> 00:59:12,848
Thank you very much.

1255
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:19,126
- Yuito. - You're here.

1256
00:59:19,127 --> 00:59:20,198
(Gathering around)

1257
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:22,827
(TEAM BEAT members warmly welcome him all together.)

1258
00:59:22,828 --> 00:59:24,028
It's been a while.

1259
00:59:26,468 --> 00:59:29,397
(TEAM BEAT directors choose the fourth player.)

1260
00:59:30,207 --> 00:59:32,337
Well, this player...

1261
00:59:32,738 --> 00:59:35,377
caught our attention in every performance,

1262
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:41,647
so we have had an eye on him.

1263
00:59:42,817 --> 00:59:43,847
Who is that?

1264
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:45,487
- Is he on another team? - I guess so.

1265
00:59:45,488 --> 00:59:46,687
I don't think he's on our team.

1266
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:49,016
Gosh, really.

1267
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:51,357
(A player on another team, not a TEAM BEAT player?)

1268
00:59:51,857 --> 00:59:57,598
(Which player spoke to TEAM BEAT directors' hearts?)

1269
00:59:59,528 --> 01:00:03,536
(What's TEAM BEAT directors' choice?)

1270
01:00:03,537 --> 01:00:04,537
He's Sirin.

1271
01:00:05,537 --> 01:00:08,436
Sirin, move to stage.

1272
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:13,348
(Sirin, move to stage.)

1273
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:18,517
Good job.

1274
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,016
Sirin.

1275
01:00:22,017 --> 01:00:25,956
(Players are surprised that a player on another team is selected.)

1276
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:28,127
- Sirin. - He did a good job.

1277
01:00:28,627 --> 01:00:31,727
Sirin is experiencing all the teams.

1278
01:00:31,868 --> 01:00:33,397
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1279
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:35,537
I didn't expect this.

1280
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:38,436
Sirin has been selected...

1281
01:00:38,437 --> 01:00:42,238
by directors of all teams.

1282
01:00:42,408 --> 01:00:44,448
- You're right. - Then he's a favorite by three.

1283
01:00:45,247 --> 01:00:46,278
That's right.

1284
01:00:47,517 --> 01:00:51,317
Sirin has a mystique air and attractive voice.

1285
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,887
He was selected by TEAM BEAT directors...

1286
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,316
and is advancing to the finals.

1287
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:56,387
Congratulations.

1288
01:00:56,388 --> 01:00:57,527
(Advancing to the finals by TEAM BEAT directors' choice!)

1289
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:01,097
In the overall standings, Sirin ends in 18th place.

1290
01:01:01,098 --> 01:01:05,666
(Overall standings: Sirin, 18th place, 123,690 points)

1291
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,837
First one is,

1292
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:13,337
I want to thank the directors for choosing me to TEAM BEAT.

1293
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:14,638
Thank you so much.

1294
01:01:16,848 --> 01:01:17,848
And,

1295
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:21,817
thank you for Director TEN and Director YANGYANG too.

1296
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:25,217
They took care of me first,

1297
01:01:25,218 --> 01:01:29,488
and Director Lee Chang Sub took care of me too. Thank you.

1298
01:01:32,928 --> 01:01:34,456
Right now, I'm so happy.

1299
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:37,226
And thank you to everyone here.

1300
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:40,897
And thank you to everyone for voting for me.

1301
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,267
Thank you.

1302
01:01:48,107 --> 01:01:49,107
Sirin.

1303
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,477
He matches TEAM BEAT well.

1304
01:01:52,178 --> 01:01:54,678
The talent Sirin has...

1305
01:01:55,548 --> 01:01:57,687
goes well with TEAM BEAT.

1306
01:02:00,857 --> 01:02:04,258
(Now two seats remain.)

1307
01:02:04,928 --> 01:02:06,957
(Nervous)

1308
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:13,896
(15 players remain in the locker room.)

1309
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,267
(15 players remain in the locker room.)

1310
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,468
Please save the kids here.

1311
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:21,836
Director YUGYEOM, please announce the next player.

1312
01:02:21,837 --> 01:02:23,877
(TEAM BEAT's director selection, fifth player)

1313
01:02:24,977 --> 01:02:27,377
If this player joins us,

1314
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:30,888
TEAM BEAT's vocal will be very strong.

1315
01:02:32,848 --> 01:02:37,758
(Players of the vocal position remain in the locker room.)

1316
01:02:39,727 --> 01:02:40,727
Jae Ho?

1317
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:44,497
It could be Jae Ho.

1318
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,167
(TEAM GROOVE's Bae Jae Ho who has a delicate vocal ability?)

1319
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:49,368
An Yul?

1320
01:02:50,537 --> 01:02:51,537
Zen Zen?

1321
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,707
Zen Zen?

1322
01:02:53,877 --> 01:02:57,147
(Is it TEAM GROOVE's An Yul, traded for his vocal ability?)

1323
01:02:57,578 --> 01:03:00,448
(Is it TEAM RHYTHM's Zen Zen, with a solid high note?)

1324
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:04,348
I think you'd find this very unexpected.

1325
01:03:04,848 --> 01:03:08,718
(An unexpected selection?)

1326
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:13,087
He's...

1327
01:03:14,098 --> 01:03:16,356
(Is it one of the expected candidates, Zen Zen,)

1328
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:18,597
(An Yul,)

1329
01:03:18,598 --> 01:03:20,598
(or Bae Jae Ho?)

1330
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:21,897
Okay.

1331
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:26,578
(Or is it a selection beyond everyone's expectation?)

1332
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,507
(Who's the fifth player selected for the finals by TEAM BEAT directors?)

1333
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:34,817
He's Zen Zen.

1334
01:03:35,948 --> 01:03:38,686
Zen Zen, move to stage.

1335
01:03:38,687 --> 01:03:39,717
(TEAM BEAT, Zen Zen)

1336
01:03:39,718 --> 01:03:42,517
- Zen Zen! Yes! - You're a hero!

1337
01:03:42,817 --> 01:03:44,457
(Puzzled)

1338
01:03:46,058 --> 01:03:47,597
Go, Zen Zen!

1339
01:03:47,598 --> 01:03:49,028
Zen Zen!

1340
01:03:49,328 --> 01:03:51,468
Yes!

1341
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:52,667
Hero!

1342
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:55,166
(The unexpected selection surprises everyone!)

1343
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:56,167
Zen Zen.

1344
01:03:57,607 --> 01:03:59,107
- Oh, my. It's Zen Zen. - It's Zen Zen.

1345
01:03:59,738 --> 01:04:01,206
Zen Zen also has been on all three teams.

1346
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:02,707
That's right. Zen Zen has been on all the teams too.

1347
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:05,048
Zen Zen.

1348
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,178
Our team is going through an exceptional transformation.

1349
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:12,448
I'm glad.

1350
01:04:15,988 --> 01:04:19,857
Zen Zen always gives off positive energy.

1351
01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:23,968
He will be on the final stage as a new voice of TEAM BEAT.

1352
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:25,698
(Congratulations!)

1353
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:29,396
In the overall standings, Zen Zen ends in 11th place.

1354
01:04:29,397 --> 01:04:31,638
(Overall standings: Zen Zen, 11th place, 177,112 points)

1355
01:04:31,937 --> 01:04:33,707
(Taken aback)

1356
01:04:34,377 --> 01:04:35,707
Zen Zen is popular.

1357
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:39,747
First of all, BEAT TEAM directors,

1358
01:04:40,578 --> 01:04:44,747
I'd like to give thanks for selecting me.

1359
01:04:44,917 --> 01:04:49,016
And directors of TEAM GROOVE and TEAM RHYTHM...

1360
01:04:49,017 --> 01:04:51,327
and my colleagues,

1361
01:04:51,328 --> 01:04:53,598
you've worked so hard. Thank you.

1362
01:04:54,298 --> 01:04:55,397
And now,

1363
01:04:56,868 --> 01:04:59,167
I'm on TEAM BEAT,

1364
01:04:59,267 --> 01:05:01,667
so I'll work harder...

1365
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:03,707
and definitely make a debut.

1366
01:05:03,808 --> 01:05:04,808
- You can do it. - Thank you.

1367
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:09,577
Congratulations, Zen Zen. You can move to the team's seat.

1368
01:05:09,578 --> 01:05:10,578
Congratulations.

1369
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:12,147
I've wanted to perform with Zen Zen.

1370
01:05:12,877 --> 01:05:14,816
- Welcome. - Hello.

1371
01:05:14,817 --> 01:05:15,817
- Welcome, Zen Zen. - Hello.

1372
01:05:15,818 --> 01:05:17,348
- Welcome. - Welcome, Zen Zen.

1373
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:19,048
Zen Zen. Hi.

1374
01:05:19,247 --> 01:05:20,487
- Hello. - Welcome.

1375
01:05:20,488 --> 01:05:21,757
(Welcome, Zen Zen.)

1376
01:05:21,758 --> 01:05:22,758
Hello.

1377
01:05:23,328 --> 01:05:24,387
Hello.

1378
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:27,297
(6 TEAM BEAT members will advance to the finals.)

1379
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,396
I'm excited to see their performance. How would it be?

1380
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:31,927
Zen Zen seems to match TEAM BEAT.

1381
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,666
- Yes, he does. - His original choice was it.

1382
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:35,797
Zen Zen wanted to join TEAM BEAT.

1383
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:36,808
Really?

1384
01:05:37,138 --> 01:05:41,977
(Zen Zen will be on the final stage on the team he wanted.)

1385
01:05:43,238 --> 01:05:44,247
TEAM BEAT's...

1386
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:46,548
last...

1387
01:05:47,848 --> 01:05:48,947
remaining seat.

1388
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,988
(The last chance to advance to the finals!)

1389
01:05:52,647 --> 01:05:55,786
You can announce the player you selected.

1390
01:05:55,787 --> 01:05:56,787
Gosh, this is...

1391
01:05:56,788 --> 01:05:58,488
(TEAM BEAT's director selection, the last player!)

1392
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:05,666
Now, the remaining players in the locker room are 14.

1393
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:07,337
(14 remaining players in the locker room)

1394
01:06:09,267 --> 01:06:10,267
There's one seat left.

1395
01:06:10,268 --> 01:06:13,537
(However, only one seat remains.)

1396
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:14,808
This is the most brutal part.

1397
01:06:15,937 --> 01:06:17,376
Who's the last person?

1398
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:18,377
It really is the last person.

1399
01:06:18,777 --> 01:06:21,548
Seriously, I can't predict the last one.

1400
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:24,888
Who's the last one?

1401
01:06:26,218 --> 01:06:30,027
We really thought a lot about this player.

1402
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:34,928
(The last player selected after thinking carefully)

1403
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:38,127
We'd like to bring our player...

1404
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:41,268
taken by a trade.

1405
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:44,867
Is it Dong Yun?

1406
01:06:45,237 --> 01:06:46,877
- I think it's Dong Yun. - Dong Yun.

1407
01:06:47,277 --> 01:06:48,478
- An Yul. - An Yul?

1408
01:06:50,108 --> 01:06:51,946
- Is it Dong Yun? - It's Dong Yun.

1409
01:06:51,947 --> 01:06:53,417
Dong Yun.

1410
01:06:53,518 --> 01:06:54,577
It's Dong Yun.

1411
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:57,548
- I think it's Dong Yun. - It's Dong Yun.

1412
01:06:57,787 --> 01:06:58,787
I think it's Yul.

1413
01:06:58,787 --> 01:06:59,787
(Is it Dong Yun taken by a trade, or An Yul?)

1414
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,222
The player is...

1415
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:10,633
The player is...

1416
01:07:14,991 --> 01:07:15,991
Kim Dong Yun.

1417
01:07:17,062 --> 01:07:20,601
Kim Dong Yun, move to stage.

1418
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:23,232
(Kim Dong Yun, move to stage.)

1419
01:07:24,772 --> 01:07:27,501
(Dong Yun can't believe it despite team members congratulating him.)

1420
01:07:32,171 --> 01:07:33,341
(Surprised)

1421
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:34,482
That's amazing.

1422
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:38,051
Dong Yun.

1423
01:07:38,052 --> 01:07:39,250
(They couldn't predict TEAM BEAT director selection to the end.)

1424
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:40,751
It's Dong Yun.

1425
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:47,961
Kim Dong Yun was TEAM BEAT's staring player.

1426
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:51,391
He'll be on the final stage as a TEAM BEAT player again.

1427
01:07:51,392 --> 01:07:52,790
(Advancing to the finals as the last player of TEAM BEAT!)

1428
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:57,500
In the overall standings, Kim Dong Yun ends in 19th place.

1429
01:07:57,501 --> 01:08:03,102
(Overall standings: Kim Dong Yun, 19th place, 122,258 points)

1430
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:12,711
(Choking up to be on the stage again)

1431
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:15,852
- Don't cry. - Don't cry.

1432
01:08:16,482 --> 01:08:18,121
Honestly, as I started...

1433
01:08:19,352 --> 01:08:21,591
in TEAM BEAT and learned...

1434
01:08:22,392 --> 01:08:23,831
and experienced a lot,

1435
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:28,331
I could stay here until now.

1436
01:08:29,402 --> 01:08:30,732
Thank you so much...

1437
01:08:31,072 --> 01:08:34,442
for trusting me to the end and giving me another chance.

1438
01:08:34,801 --> 01:08:37,241
With this being the last chance,

1439
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,741
I will do my best...

1440
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:43,312
to show a nice performance.

1441
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:44,652
Thank you.

1442
01:08:45,982 --> 01:08:47,022
Congratulations.

1443
01:08:49,951 --> 01:08:51,391
(Team members welcome Dong Yun coming back as a TEAM BEAT player.)

1444
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:53,120
- It's been a while. - Jin Ho.

1445
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:54,161
You're here after a long time.

1446
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:55,620
- How are you? - He's crying the moment I see him.

1447
01:08:55,621 --> 01:08:56,621
It's nice to see you.

1448
01:08:58,692 --> 01:09:01,432
Hello. Thank you.

1449
01:09:02,102 --> 01:09:03,102
Congratulations.

1450
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:09,701
(TEAM BEAT's 7 finalists are completed.)

1451
01:09:11,942 --> 01:09:16,282
The players who have stayed in the locker room until now...

1452
01:09:16,982 --> 01:09:19,611
are, unfortunately, all eliminated.

1453
01:09:19,612 --> 01:09:21,022
(The players in the locker room are all eliminated.)

1454
01:09:24,022 --> 01:09:28,821
(13 players need to end the journey...)

1455
01:09:28,822 --> 01:09:33,961
(they had with Universe League.)

1456
01:09:41,671 --> 01:09:43,201
You've worked so hard so far.

1457
01:09:43,402 --> 01:09:46,041
Please give a big hand to the players too.

1458
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:52,981
Thank you.

1459
01:09:52,982 --> 01:09:54,050
- You worked hard! - Thank you!

1460
01:09:54,051 --> 01:09:55,120
Thank you for your work!

1461
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:57,421
(You've worked hard so far!)

1462
01:09:58,322 --> 01:09:59,692
Everyone, are you all right?

1463
01:10:01,392 --> 01:10:02,490
Good?

1464
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:03,521
(He Junjin comforts everyone while hiding his own regret.)

1465
01:10:03,522 --> 01:10:04,531
- Good? - Good.

1466
01:10:04,532 --> 01:10:05,562
Okay.

1467
01:10:06,232 --> 01:10:07,602
This is the real end.

1468
01:10:10,732 --> 01:10:12,871
The 21 players who will enter...

1469
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:15,241
the Universe League finals...

1470
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:17,740
have been chosen. Congratulations!

1471
01:10:17,741 --> 01:10:21,881
(The 21 players who entered the finals.)

1472
01:10:24,782 --> 01:10:26,782
Finalist of TEAM RHYTHM.

1473
01:10:27,822 --> 01:10:28,881
TEAM RHYTHM.

1474
01:10:34,722 --> 01:10:37,161
(Who's the first player of TEAM RHYTHM?)

1475
01:10:39,131 --> 01:10:40,191
JL.

1476
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:41,201
(Current rank: JL, 1st place, 1,099,728 points)

1477
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:46,331
From a small stage back home in the Philippines,

1478
01:10:46,602 --> 01:10:47,972
with dreams bigger than ever,

1479
01:10:48,102 --> 01:10:50,911
I made my way to Korea, the heart of K-pop.

1480
01:10:52,841 --> 01:10:55,442
(He showcased his overwhelming live skills on the Draft stage.)

1481
01:10:56,012 --> 01:10:58,251
(He was an ace from the start and caught TEAM BEAT directors' eyes.)

1482
01:11:00,782 --> 01:11:03,381
(Director TEN was also drawn by his skilled stage presence.)

1483
01:11:10,791 --> 01:11:12,732
(JL)

1484
01:11:13,461 --> 01:11:15,431
(JL)

1485
01:11:15,432 --> 01:11:16,501
TEAM RHYTHM.

1486
01:11:16,631 --> 01:11:19,501
(He was the only one who got 3 picks.)

1487
01:11:21,371 --> 01:11:22,371
I'll choose TEAM RHYTHM.

1488
01:11:22,372 --> 01:11:24,571
(JL chose TEAM RHYTHM, as his role model was Director TEN.)

1489
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:26,241
JL, TEAM RHYTHM!

1490
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:28,041
- Thank you. - Welcome home!

1491
01:11:28,782 --> 01:11:31,381
(From the start until the end, he was born to be TEAM RHYTHM.)

1492
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:35,551
(He was the center during the Director's Hit Song Match.)

1493
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:42,421
(He held the team together with stable skills,)

1494
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,660
It's JL!

1495
01:11:43,661 --> 01:11:46,362
(but placed 4th with 189 votes in the on-site voting.)

1496
01:11:46,831 --> 01:11:48,701
(During Round 2, Intercept Round,)

1497
01:11:49,602 --> 01:11:51,772
(he led the team with a great vocal.)

1498
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:53,700
- It's JL. Congratulations. - Oh, my.

1499
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:55,272
(He won the 1st place within the team during Round 2.)

1500
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:56,870
What?

1501
01:11:56,871 --> 01:11:57,910
(An overwhelming individual score that surprised everyone)

1502
01:11:57,911 --> 01:11:58,972
My goodness.

1503
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:04,312
(As Elite 7 of Round 3, JL performed in 2 stages.)

1504
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:10,751
(He flawlessly handled two contrasting concepts...)

1505
01:12:10,822 --> 01:12:11,822
- Oh, my. - My gosh.

1506
01:12:11,823 --> 01:12:13,550
(and secured 1st place in the individual ranking for Round 3.)

1507
01:12:13,551 --> 01:12:15,022
- Oh, my. - I mean...

1508
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:18,232
- His vote count is twice of Steven's. - It's more than 460,000.

1509
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:21,701
Thank you so much to the fans who voted for me.

1510
01:12:22,461 --> 01:12:24,201
Standing on that glittering stage...

1511
01:12:24,432 --> 01:12:26,631
Just imagining it makes my heart race.

1512
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:30,171
(Who's the next player of TEAM RHYTHM?)

1513
01:12:31,312 --> 01:12:32,312
Steven!

1514
01:12:32,313 --> 01:12:33,982
(Current rank: Steven, 2nd place, 598,718 points)

1515
01:12:34,211 --> 01:12:35,581
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

1516
01:12:38,051 --> 01:12:39,051
I'm a fighter.

1517
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:44,352
(Steven announced the start of the stage with an intense gaze.)

1518
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:51,831
(He was chosen as TEAM RHYTHM's first pick in the starting lineup.)

1519
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:54,862
I couldn't help but keep watching him.

1520
01:12:55,062 --> 01:12:58,701
I chose him because he has an aura that keeps people intrigued.

1521
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:04,572
(A master of intros who signaled the start in Round 1 as well.)

1522
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:06,540
It's Steven.

1523
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:09,282
(He delivered a top-tier performance but only ranked 5th in the team.)

1524
01:13:13,652 --> 01:13:17,551
(He took on the team's identity and mastered the intro in Round 2.)

1525
01:13:23,722 --> 01:13:25,891
- It's Steven! Congratulations. - Oh, my.

1526
01:13:25,892 --> 01:13:27,091
(He captured fans' hearts and rose to 3rd place.)

1527
01:13:27,831 --> 01:13:28,862
As expected, Steven.

1528
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:35,072
(Round 3 where Steven's powerful charm shone the brightest.)

1529
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:40,041
(ISA: Intro is by Steven Again)

1530
01:13:46,312 --> 01:13:48,050
First of all, thank you so much...

1531
01:13:48,051 --> 01:13:50,022
for voting for me this much.

1532
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:51,392
You're awesome.

1533
01:13:51,791 --> 01:13:55,491
(What would his final stage, which never stops improving, be like?)

1534
01:13:56,192 --> 01:13:58,362
(Who's the third player of TEAM RHYTHM?)

1535
01:14:00,262 --> 01:14:01,262
Zhang Shuaibo.

1536
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:07,442
(He captured attention from his very first appearance in Draft.)

1537
01:14:07,942 --> 01:14:09,871
(Zhang Shuaibo's powerful facial expression)

1538
01:14:11,472 --> 01:14:13,642
(Zhang Shuaibo)

1539
01:14:14,642 --> 01:14:16,812
TEAM RHYTHM nominates...

1540
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:20,381
Zhang Shuaibo as a starting lineup. Congratulations!

1541
01:14:23,022 --> 01:14:25,522
(He took the stage in Round 1 with a secret weapon.)

1542
01:14:26,152 --> 01:14:27,661
(Zhang Shuaibo with a rose)

1543
01:14:28,522 --> 01:14:30,732
- What's that rose? - Where did it come from?

1544
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:35,902
(Zhang Shuaibo's sexy charm enhanced with the rose performance.)

1545
01:14:36,201 --> 01:14:38,800
The third place is Zhang Shuaibo.

1546
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:40,771
(He secured 3rd place in the team.)

1547
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:41,772
As expected.

1548
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:47,041
(The highlight, paired choreography with Steven during "IGNITION")

1549
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:48,381
(That's it!)

1550
01:14:48,382 --> 01:14:50,041
They made eye contact just now.

1551
01:14:50,211 --> 01:14:52,751
The second place is Zhang Shuaibo. Congratulations.

1552
01:14:53,182 --> 01:14:54,620
He's so popular.

1553
01:14:54,621 --> 01:14:56,581
(He ranked 2nd in the team, aiming for the top, but...)

1554
01:14:58,551 --> 01:15:01,491
There are three players whose names weren't called. Right?

1555
01:15:02,892 --> 01:15:04,830
- Could you raise your hands? - My name.

1556
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,330
(Zhang Shuaibo wasn't chosen to be one of the Elite 7.)

1557
01:15:06,331 --> 01:15:07,701
I didn't expect this to happen.

1558
01:15:08,932 --> 01:15:12,072
I didn't expect this to happen.

1559
01:15:12,732 --> 01:15:14,102
(However)

1560
01:15:14,371 --> 01:15:16,370
- Love is still here... - Love is still here...

1561
01:15:16,371 --> 01:15:20,710
(Once again, he took the stage with his unique weapon,)

1562
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:22,740
He's a magician.

1563
01:15:22,741 --> 01:15:23,951
(showcasing his strengths to the directors.)

1564
01:15:24,652 --> 01:15:28,451
(Zhang Shuaibo joined Elite 7 in Round 3.)

1565
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:31,451
(His expressive face showcased his exceptional concept adaptability.)

1566
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:33,790
The third place is Zhang Shuaibo.

1567
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:35,361
(He earned on-site votes on two stages and rose to the top.)

1568
01:15:35,362 --> 01:15:38,392
Zhang Shuaibo won the third place.

1569
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:39,661
Congratulations.

1570
01:15:40,732 --> 01:15:42,261
Since I started in TEAM RHYTHM,

1571
01:15:42,262 --> 01:15:44,371
I'll do my best within the team until my debut.

1572
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:46,300
I'll do my best.

1573
01:15:46,301 --> 01:15:48,371
(I'll do my best!)

1574
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:52,942
(Current rank: Chih En, 4th place, 504,012 points)

1575
01:15:54,741 --> 01:15:58,312
I’ve worked hard to find my charm.

1576
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:01,282
I’ll do my best so fans can fall for me.

1577
01:16:02,581 --> 01:16:04,990
Gosh, he's so handsome.

1578
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,221
(He grabbed attention from his first appearance in Draft with his face.)

1579
01:16:06,222 --> 01:16:07,322
- He's cool. - My goodness!

1580
01:16:07,822 --> 01:16:10,591
- He's cool! - He’s handsome with a small face.

1581
01:16:11,991 --> 01:16:15,031
TEAM BEAT nominated Chih En!

1582
01:16:15,032 --> 01:16:16,732
(He was nominated as the first pick of TEAM BEAT with a handsome face.)

1583
01:16:17,432 --> 01:16:20,701
(Chih En made an impression as the visual center of TEAT BEAT.)

1584
01:16:23,671 --> 01:16:28,612
(He worked hard and played his role perfectly on stage.)

1585
01:16:28,982 --> 01:16:31,011
The second place is Chih En!

1586
01:16:31,012 --> 01:16:33,381
(He captured the audience's heart and secured 2nd place.)

1587
01:16:35,121 --> 01:16:36,621
TEAM RHYTHM will scout...

1588
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:38,491
Chih En.

1589
01:16:39,751 --> 01:16:40,892
- Chih En? - Chih En? My gosh.

1590
01:16:41,762 --> 01:16:44,231
Chih En is traded.

1591
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:45,892
(Chih En was traded to TEAM RHYTHM after Round 1.)

1592
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:48,362
(In Round 2, his first stage after joining TEAM RHYTHM,)

1593
01:16:49,362 --> 01:16:53,131
(he showcased his abs performance and revealed a surprising charm.)

1594
01:16:53,232 --> 01:16:55,141
The fourth place is Chih En.

1595
01:16:55,142 --> 01:16:56,500
He’s incredible.

1596
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:57,572
(He maintained his top rank even in the new team.)

1597
01:16:58,642 --> 01:17:01,642
- Chih En has only one expression. - Yes.

1598
01:17:02,312 --> 01:17:03,710
You seem like singing a sad song.

1599
01:17:03,711 --> 01:17:05,050
(Chih En's facial expression was criticized by the directors.)

1600
01:17:05,051 --> 01:17:07,381
"He only has the looks." "He's only good-looking."

1601
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:09,152
I saw a lot of comments as such.

1602
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:10,892
I plan to prepare well...

1603
01:17:11,222 --> 01:17:13,091
and show you.

1604
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:15,861
(He started practicing various facial expressions.)

1605
01:17:15,862 --> 01:17:16,862
(You're doing good.)

1606
01:17:18,661 --> 01:17:21,262
(On Round 3 after incorporating feedback,)

1607
01:17:21,701 --> 01:17:24,170
(he showed much more...)

1608
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:27,232
(diverse facial expressions...)

1609
01:17:27,472 --> 01:17:29,942
(whether cute or charismatic.)

1610
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:32,370
The fourth place is Chih En.

1611
01:17:32,371 --> 01:17:34,341
(He was a key team member, consistently ranking high.)

1612
01:17:35,911 --> 01:17:38,612
Look forward to the version of me that will shine the most on stage.

1613
01:17:41,722 --> 01:17:42,782
Park Ju Won.

1614
01:17:44,822 --> 01:17:47,421
(He drew attention with his stable skills.)

1615
01:17:48,322 --> 01:17:50,161
(Park Ju Won)

1616
01:17:50,661 --> 01:17:52,231
(Park Ju Won)

1617
01:17:52,232 --> 01:17:55,032
- TEAM RHYTHM chose Ju Won too. - Thank you!

1618
01:17:55,532 --> 01:17:56,602
- My gosh. - Thank you.

1619
01:17:57,371 --> 01:17:58,931
I'll choose TEAM RHYTHM.

1620
01:17:58,932 --> 01:18:00,841
(He joined TEAM RHYTHM as a starting lineup.)

1621
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:05,411
(He delivered a high-quality performance in Round 1.)

1622
01:18:05,711 --> 01:18:06,711
It's Park Ju Won.

1623
01:18:08,041 --> 01:18:10,540
(He won the MVP of TEAM RHYTHM.)

1624
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:12,851
It's Park Ju Won. Congratulations.

1625
01:18:12,852 --> 01:18:14,151
(He scored 287 points and won the first place.)

1626
01:18:14,152 --> 01:18:15,221
(Starting lineup: Park Ju Won, 287 points)

1627
01:18:15,222 --> 01:18:16,881
- He got 287 points! - Thank you.

1628
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:24,491
(Ju Won took the stage handling the dance break and rap parts.)

1629
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:28,602
The fifth place is...

1630
01:18:29,532 --> 01:18:31,800
Park Ju Won. Congratulations.

1631
01:18:31,801 --> 01:18:36,602
(He dropped to 5th place in the team, but...)

1632
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:38,812
It's Park Ju Won.

1633
01:18:40,442 --> 01:18:42,881
(He was scouted to TEAM GROOVE by Director Chang Sub's choice.)

1634
01:18:43,411 --> 01:18:46,652
I felt that a passionate and bright image...

1635
01:18:46,911 --> 01:18:48,581
was needed for the team.

1636
01:18:48,921 --> 01:18:51,791
Park Ju Won's image was the most suitable.

1637
01:18:52,692 --> 01:18:55,762
(He had to leave the team he had been with from the start.)

1638
01:18:55,892 --> 01:18:58,961
You need to show a completely different side...

1639
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:01,661
from your time in TEAM RHYTHM.

1640
01:19:02,831 --> 01:19:05,902
- I just need you. - I wish you were...

1641
01:19:06,932 --> 01:19:08,541
Honestly, this stage is...

1642
01:19:08,972 --> 01:19:12,141
the one I’m most worried about...

1643
01:19:12,142 --> 01:19:13,871
out of all the performances...

1644
01:19:14,682 --> 01:19:15,881
I’ve done on Universe League.

1645
01:19:19,182 --> 01:19:21,921
(But it was a flawless performance, making his worries unnecessary.)

1646
01:19:22,921 --> 01:19:24,521
Park Ju Won won the second place.

1647
01:19:24,522 --> 01:19:26,121
(He ranked 2nd in the team and improved even further.)

1648
01:19:26,722 --> 01:19:27,762
It's Park Ju Won.

1649
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,591
He should come back home.

1650
01:19:32,262 --> 01:19:36,032
(How will he turn out as an improved player in TEAM RHYTHM?)

1651
01:19:38,371 --> 01:19:39,431
Daisuke.

1652
01:19:39,432 --> 01:19:40,472
(Current rank: Daisuke, 8th place, 298,630 points)

1653
01:19:41,642 --> 01:19:44,711
I'm Daisuke, 14 years old, and I'm from Okinawa.

1654
01:19:45,841 --> 01:19:46,911
Dear fans,

1655
01:19:47,881 --> 01:19:49,782
- how do you find us? - How do you find us?

1656
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:52,251
(He's cute.)

1657
01:19:52,682 --> 01:19:54,580
- My gosh. - He's cute.

1658
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:55,652
(He has a cute expressive face that captured everyone's hearts.)

1659
01:19:58,822 --> 01:20:02,461
(Even when Daisuke made mistakes, he remained composed.)

1660
01:20:03,562 --> 01:20:04,691
(Seeing him continue the performance...)

1661
01:20:04,692 --> 01:20:06,561
(without showing any sign of his mistake)

1662
01:20:06,562 --> 01:20:08,862
(He was recognized for his professional demeanor.)

1663
01:20:09,461 --> 01:20:11,902
(Daisuke joins TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.)

1664
01:20:12,272 --> 01:20:15,072
(I'm happy to join TEAM RHYTHM that I always admired.)

1665
01:20:16,301 --> 01:20:20,240
(He perfectly pulled off a charismatic performance.)

1666
01:20:20,241 --> 01:20:22,282
Daisuke won the seventh place.

1667
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:26,711
(The Golden Child secured his place as a starting player.)

1668
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:33,250
(He infused his charm into every performance.)

1669
01:20:33,251 --> 01:20:36,221
Daisuke won the seventh place. Congratulations.

1670
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:38,830
(He won the 7th and maintained his spot in the starting lineup.)

1671
01:20:38,831 --> 01:20:41,232
(He was 1 of the Elite 7 and performed in 2 stages.)

1672
01:20:41,602 --> 01:20:43,232
(Not only does he excel at cute stages he's most confident in,)

1673
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:48,041
(but he also nails tough charismatic stages perfectly.)

1674
01:20:48,371 --> 01:20:50,000
(A Japanese middle school student's groove)

1675
01:20:50,001 --> 01:20:51,871
(TEAM RHYTHM's youngest member's image transformation)

1676
01:20:52,241 --> 01:20:56,482
(The youngest member's sexy charm makes others dazed.)

1677
01:20:56,812 --> 01:20:58,581
(No matter how seductive he acts, he's still cute.)

1678
01:21:00,812 --> 01:21:03,322
(He rose to the 5th place of the team, a rising trend.)

1679
01:21:04,652 --> 01:21:07,661
(Current Ranking: Seo Jeong Woo, 14th place, 166,769 points)

1680
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:12,392
(Jeong Woo tried to become an idol for the first time.)

1681
01:21:15,661 --> 01:21:17,432
(I hope I don't end up being a burden.)

1682
01:21:19,301 --> 01:21:22,772
(He made an impression with his stable vocals and cute visuals.)

1683
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:24,241
(Seo Jeong Woo)

1684
01:21:24,911 --> 01:21:27,472
(He joins the starting line up with TEAM GROOVE's first pick.)

1685
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:30,241
- I live like this - Okay, stop.

1686
01:21:30,642 --> 01:21:32,881
(Your choreography is a little clumsy.)

1687
01:21:33,282 --> 01:21:35,152
(I need to hide you for the team.)

1688
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:37,892
(Seo Jeong Woo ended up being the team's weak point.)

1689
01:21:38,591 --> 01:21:42,692
(He practiced again and again on the areas that were pointed out.)

1690
01:21:43,121 --> 01:21:45,762
(He focused solely on practice to overcome his shortcomings.)

1691
01:21:49,932 --> 01:21:50,971
(Feeling proud)

1692
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:53,401
(He flawlessly fulfilled his role.)

1693
01:21:53,402 --> 01:21:55,370
The MVP is Seo Jeong Woo.

1694
01:21:55,371 --> 01:21:58,472
(He won the first place in the team and became the team's MVP.)

1695
01:21:59,442 --> 01:22:04,682
(He showed a great improvement during Round 2, Intercept Round.)

1696
01:22:05,982 --> 01:22:09,950
(He nailed the highlight...)

1697
01:22:09,951 --> 01:22:14,461
(and secured a top spot in the team.)

1698
01:22:15,062 --> 01:22:17,362
(Jeong Woo, you're the key person.)

1699
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:22,931
(He played a key role...)

1700
01:22:22,932 --> 01:22:25,870
(with his refreshing, sunshine-like smile.)

1701
01:22:25,871 --> 01:22:27,901
The third place is Seo Jeong Woo.

1702
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:31,671
(He held firmly onto third place among the strong players.)

1703
01:22:32,112 --> 01:22:34,210
(TEAM RHYTHM will trade...)

1704
01:22:34,211 --> 01:22:36,041
(Seo Jeong Woo.)

1705
01:22:36,642 --> 01:22:41,121
(His consistent effort earned him a trade to TEAM RHYTHM.)

1706
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:45,652
(He's like the new face of the team.)

1707
01:22:45,991 --> 01:22:48,192
(With the addition of Seo Jeong Woo, TEAM RHYTHM,)

1708
01:22:48,991 --> 01:22:52,331
(now strengthened, completes its Finalist.)

1709
01:22:52,631 --> 01:22:54,961
Here's the Finalist of TEAM GROOVE.

1710
01:22:57,262 --> 01:22:58,272
TEAM GROOVE.

1711
01:22:58,671 --> 01:23:01,371
(Who's the first player to enter the finals in TEAM GROOVE?)

1712
01:23:04,642 --> 01:23:05,670
Park Han.

1713
01:23:05,671 --> 01:23:07,572
(Current rank: Park Han, 5th place, 467,242 points)

1714
01:23:08,911 --> 01:23:14,522
(Is there anyone as desperate as I am?)

1715
01:23:14,822 --> 01:23:18,521
(I want the whole world...)

1716
01:23:18,522 --> 01:23:21,121
(to know who Park Han, who I am.)

1717
01:23:21,762 --> 01:23:23,392
(His first stage during Draft)

1718
01:23:23,692 --> 01:23:27,961
(He showed overwhelming skill.)

1719
01:23:32,432 --> 01:23:33,572
(Park Han)

1720
01:23:34,131 --> 01:23:35,201
(Park Han)

1721
01:23:35,572 --> 01:23:36,601
(He chose TEAM GROOVE.)

1722
01:23:36,602 --> 01:23:37,710
I'll choose TEAM GROOVE.

1723
01:23:37,711 --> 01:23:42,112
(He’s the player who made the Director Chang Sub stand up.)

1724
01:23:42,512 --> 01:23:44,482
(It was my dream to be on stage.)

1725
01:23:44,581 --> 01:23:47,282
(As he wished, he unpacked what he wanted to show on stage.)

1726
01:23:47,852 --> 01:23:50,981
(He secured the main vocal position confidently...)

1727
01:23:50,982 --> 01:23:55,691
(and maintained his spot as a starting player in 6th place.)

1728
01:23:55,692 --> 01:23:56,721
(Honestly, I believe...)

1729
01:23:56,722 --> 01:23:59,061
(Han is the best singer in Universe League.)

1730
01:23:59,062 --> 01:24:00,661
The main vocalist among the main vocalists.

1731
01:24:01,432 --> 01:24:07,200
(Everyone agrees that he's the best main vocalist.)

1732
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:08,340
(Park Han effect is spreading to another team.)

1733
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:10,442
(I'm watching you.)

1734
01:24:12,171 --> 01:24:19,111
("Prison" was flawlessly handled with a clear high note)

1735
01:24:19,112 --> 01:24:20,152
The sixth place is...

1736
01:24:20,881 --> 01:24:25,152
(Park Han secured his place again as a starting player in Round 2.)

1737
01:24:25,652 --> 01:24:29,022
(He was selected for both UNIT stages of Round 3.)

1738
01:24:36,831 --> 01:24:41,101
(Park Han's two flawless performances as expected)

1739
01:24:41,102 --> 01:24:45,371
(Park Han's two flawless performances as expected)

1740
01:24:48,442 --> 01:24:53,682
(In the end, he won the 1st place in Round 3.)

1741
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:02,562
(Who's the second player of TEAM GROOVE?)

1742
01:25:02,892 --> 01:25:03,892
Kim Joo Hyoung.

1743
01:25:03,893 --> 01:25:05,491
(Current rank: Kim Joo Hyoung, 10th place, 188,339 points)

1744
01:25:06,262 --> 01:25:09,801
(He made a strong entrance with a powerful rap.)

1745
01:25:10,102 --> 01:25:13,631
(He caught Director Chang Sub's attention.)

1746
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:18,240
(Kim Joo Hyoung)

1747
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:20,642
(He joins TEAM GROOVE.)

1748
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:27,450
(He showcased his sweet vocal skills,)

1749
01:25:27,451 --> 01:25:29,782
(but ended up as a bench player with a disappointing rank.)

1750
01:25:30,822 --> 01:25:34,192
(He performed Round 2 as a bench player.)

1751
01:25:38,491 --> 01:25:41,631
(He participated the Intercept Round to challenge TEAM BEAT.)

1752
01:25:42,161 --> 01:25:45,201
(They were the only bench team to successfully intercept a song.)

1753
01:25:46,301 --> 01:25:50,102
(He rose to 5th place in the individual rankings.)

1754
01:25:50,402 --> 01:25:51,871
(But)

1755
01:25:52,072 --> 01:25:56,441
(Joo Hyoung wasn't able to perform.)

1756
01:25:56,442 --> 01:25:59,911
(My heart ached.)

1757
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:06,152
(He secured his 5th place only by the online voting.)

1758
01:26:06,352 --> 01:26:09,121
(As I survived the fiery pit,)

1759
01:26:09,491 --> 01:26:10,892
(I'll show you how scary I can be.)

1760
01:26:11,192 --> 01:26:13,362
(Who's the next player of TEAM GROOVE?)

1761
01:26:15,732 --> 01:26:16,761
Kenta.

1762
01:26:16,762 --> 01:26:17,762
(Current rank: Kenta, 12th place, 171,378 points)

1763
01:26:19,732 --> 01:26:22,441
(The first love visual that appeared in Universe League)

1764
01:26:22,442 --> 01:26:24,572
He was so handsome.

1765
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:28,182
(A good-looking man who even impressed the participants)

1766
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:35,551
(Despite his soft first impression, he showed a strong charm on stage.)

1767
01:26:37,121 --> 01:26:39,050
(Kenta caught my eye on stage.)

1768
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:41,191
(He captured Director Chang Sub's heart...)

1769
01:26:41,192 --> 01:26:43,621
(and joined TEAM GROOVE.)

1770
01:26:45,892 --> 01:26:50,902
(Kenta became the center of TEAM GROOVE.)

1771
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:56,141
The third place is...

1772
01:26:56,142 --> 01:27:01,512
(He secured a high rank of 3rd place from Round 1.)

1773
01:27:05,312 --> 01:27:08,421
(During "Prison", a powerful performance,)

1774
01:27:12,621 --> 01:27:14,891
(he captured attention with a strong intro...)

1775
01:27:14,892 --> 01:27:17,521
(and his distinctive deep voice.)

1776
01:27:17,522 --> 01:27:19,160
The first place of TEAM GROOVE is...

1777
01:27:19,161 --> 01:27:23,932
(He won the 1st place within the team for Round 2.)

1778
01:27:24,562 --> 01:27:30,040
(He participated in 2 UNIT stages of Round 3.)

1779
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:35,612
(He was both the beginning and the end of the stage.)

1780
01:27:36,642 --> 01:27:38,012
(He won the 4th place in Round 3.)

1781
01:27:38,551 --> 01:27:40,812
(Kenta was always at a high rank.)

1782
01:27:41,451 --> 01:27:46,522
(I’ll make the dream of debuting a reality.)

1783
01:27:47,222 --> 01:27:48,321
Jang Kyung Ho.

1784
01:27:48,322 --> 01:27:50,121
(Current rank: Jang Kyung Ho, 16th place, 156,105 points)

1785
01:27:51,091 --> 01:27:55,831
(He made a strong entrance with "Love Shot" performance.)

1786
01:27:57,201 --> 01:28:00,370
(If he takes on the role of leader as the eldest...)

1787
01:28:00,371 --> 01:28:03,241
(Director Chang Sub chose him as the leader of the team.)

1788
01:28:03,942 --> 01:28:05,572
(Jang Kyung Ho)

1789
01:28:05,812 --> 01:28:07,341
You can go a bit soft here.

1790
01:28:07,512 --> 01:28:10,811
(A reliable leader of TEAM GROOVE,)

1791
01:28:10,812 --> 01:28:14,482
(guiding his members with responsibility)

1792
01:28:15,522 --> 01:28:20,721
(Although he had the main rapper part...)

1793
01:28:20,722 --> 01:28:26,031
(and a solo performance,)

1794
01:28:26,032 --> 01:28:28,161
(he became a bench member after being in 9th place.)

1795
01:28:32,001 --> 01:28:34,201
(He sharpened his skills and prepared for "MAMA MIA.")

1796
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:41,641
(He defeated the starting lineup of TEAM BEAT.)

1797
01:28:41,642 --> 01:28:42,642
The second place...

1798
01:28:42,643 --> 01:28:46,711
(He returned as a starting player after winning the 2nd place.)

1799
01:28:51,182 --> 01:28:56,590
(He showed a fresh, refreshing charm.)

1800
01:28:56,591 --> 01:28:57,621
The sixth place is...

1801
01:28:58,192 --> 01:29:00,590
(He dropped to 6th place.)

1802
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:03,602
(How will it turn out in the finals?)

1803
01:29:04,262 --> 01:29:05,330
Kwon Hee Jun.

1804
01:29:05,331 --> 01:29:07,171
(Current rank: Kwon Hee Jun, 15th place, 156,380 points)

1805
01:29:08,032 --> 01:29:10,841
(He joined TEAM RHYTHM through the Bench Test.)

1806
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:15,411
(Hee Jun shed tears of joy.)

1807
01:29:16,012 --> 01:29:22,921
(As the eldest bench player of TEAM RHYTHM, he led the team.)

1808
01:29:25,551 --> 01:29:30,590
(At Round 1, he showcased his great stage presence.)

1809
01:29:30,591 --> 01:29:31,661
The second place is...

1810
01:29:32,692 --> 01:29:37,032
(Kwon Hee Jun won the 2nd place in Round 1's individual ranking.)

1811
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:42,041
(He joined TEAM GROOVE through Round 1 Trade.)

1812
01:29:42,642 --> 01:29:45,370
(Despite the sudden team change,)

1813
01:29:45,371 --> 01:29:51,210
(he showcased his versatile charm...)

1814
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:56,152
(by handling various concepts.)

1815
01:29:56,522 --> 01:29:57,551
The fourth place.

1816
01:29:58,322 --> 01:30:01,021
(From 2nd to 4th to 7th,)

1817
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:06,732
(his rank is going down.)

1818
01:30:07,091 --> 01:30:10,262
(He wants to achieve his last dream in Universe League.)

1819
01:30:10,862 --> 01:30:13,732
(I will secure my dream.)

1820
01:30:17,741 --> 01:30:20,541
(Overall standings: Koo Han Seo, 13th place, 166,779 points)

1821
01:30:20,942 --> 01:30:23,441
(Koo Han Seo joined TEAM BEAT after the bench test.)

1822
01:30:23,442 --> 01:30:24,741
(He's pretty impressive.)

1823
01:30:25,751 --> 01:30:29,921
(He led TEAM BEAT's bench with his amazing rap and performance.)

1824
01:30:30,352 --> 01:30:34,152
(He impressed Director Lee Chang Sub and moved to TEAM GROOVE.)

1825
01:30:35,262 --> 01:30:37,120
(I needed someone with a charismatic look like Han Seo...)

1826
01:30:37,121 --> 01:30:40,661
(to be in charge of rap.)

1827
01:30:42,661 --> 01:30:47,032
(Then he became the main rapper in TEAM GROOVE.)

1828
01:30:47,432 --> 01:30:51,841
(Koo Han Seo showed improvement in every round.)

1829
01:30:52,371 --> 01:30:54,011
(8th, Koo Han Seo, 7,568)

1830
01:30:54,012 --> 01:30:59,012
(However, he never got to leave the bench.)

1831
01:30:59,352 --> 01:31:01,581
(Why is Han Seo a bench again?)

1832
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:06,751
(Will he get a better result in the finals?)

1833
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:10,362
(Overall standings: Kim Gi Joong, 25th place, 81,816 points)

1834
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:13,991
(He joined TEAM GROOVE he always dreamed of.)

1835
01:31:14,091 --> 01:31:18,671
(He was even scolded as he wished.)

1836
01:31:18,902 --> 01:31:19,902
Second place goes to...

1837
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:24,472
(Kim Gi Joong was off to a good start by placing 2nd.)

1838
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:31,512
(His voice cracked twice in Round 2.)

1839
01:31:32,312 --> 01:31:35,421
(His individual rank rapidly dropped from 2nd to 10th.)

1840
01:31:37,381 --> 01:31:40,951
(He placed 10th in Round 3 again.)

1841
01:31:42,161 --> 01:31:43,920
(His rank may have dropped,)

1842
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:48,062
(but he had a desperate will to perform.)

1843
01:31:48,161 --> 01:31:49,630
(I wanted to get the best result...)

1844
01:31:49,631 --> 01:31:52,572
(on Universe League.)

1845
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:55,272
(I will smash the next round.)

1846
01:32:00,312 --> 01:32:02,241
TEAM BEAT's finalist.

1847
01:32:02,982 --> 01:32:03,982
TEAM BEAT.

1848
01:32:11,621 --> 01:32:12,621
Cha Woong Ki.

1849
01:32:12,622 --> 01:32:15,262
(Overall standings: Cha Woong Ki, 7th place, 400,554 points)

1850
01:32:16,621 --> 01:32:18,691
(I really wanted to avoid the survival.)

1851
01:32:18,692 --> 01:32:21,762
(I really didn't want to do it.)

1852
01:32:22,461 --> 01:32:24,160
(But I knew if I didn't join Universe League,)

1853
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:26,432
(I wouldn't be able to do what I wanted.)

1854
01:32:27,602 --> 01:32:30,101
(Woong Ki's desperate wish reached the directors.)

1855
01:32:30,102 --> 01:32:31,201
(Cha Woong Ki)

1856
01:32:31,711 --> 01:32:33,511
(He took the first step to success...)

1857
01:32:33,512 --> 01:32:35,312
(by becoming TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.)

1858
01:32:36,312 --> 01:32:38,511
(Come on.)

1859
01:32:38,512 --> 01:32:41,881
(Bowing)

1860
01:32:43,522 --> 01:32:47,251
(He joined Round 1 with desperation.)

1861
01:32:47,421 --> 01:32:53,362
(By giving his all, Woong Ki showed how desperate he was to win.)

1862
01:32:53,961 --> 01:32:56,232
(The MVP of this round is...)

1863
01:32:57,102 --> 01:32:58,571
It's Cha Woong Ki.

1864
01:32:58,572 --> 01:33:01,642
(He became an MVP by placing 1st in Round 1 on-site voting.)

1865
01:33:02,472 --> 01:33:06,040
(He pulled off the theme in Round 2 with his unique boyish charm.)

1866
01:33:06,041 --> 01:33:07,642
Amazing.

1867
01:33:08,982 --> 01:33:12,282
(TEAM BEAT players wanted to secure their new song.)

1868
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:16,282
(But when they lost to TEAM GROOVE,)

1869
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:21,591
(Woong Ki burst into tears.)

1870
01:33:22,262 --> 01:33:25,131
(However, he placed 1st in the team in Round 2.)

1871
01:33:25,661 --> 01:33:29,362
(His high online voting score made him 1st in the overall ranking.)

1872
01:33:30,161 --> 01:33:33,671
(He had a serious injury before Round 3.)

1873
01:33:33,772 --> 01:33:36,902
(Yet, Woong Ki pulled off both performances.)

1874
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:41,741
(Woong Ki's passion bloomed despite the hardship.)

1875
01:33:44,512 --> 01:33:46,351
(Perhaps, it was Woong Ki's desperation.)

1876
01:33:46,352 --> 01:33:49,682
(TEAM BEAT placed 1st in Round 3 Unit 2 match.)

1877
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:54,652
(1st place meant a lot to Woong Ki because he had a hard time.)

1878
01:33:55,121 --> 01:33:57,590
(The main player who led TEAM BEAT to success,)

1879
01:33:57,591 --> 01:34:00,232
(Cha Woong Ki)

1880
01:34:00,331 --> 01:34:01,331
First place goes to...

1881
01:34:03,801 --> 01:34:05,630
(The only 1 among the 42)

1882
01:34:05,631 --> 01:34:09,472
(Cha Woong Ki remained 1st in all league matches.)

1883
01:34:09,801 --> 01:34:11,201
(Thank you so much.)

1884
01:34:11,972 --> 01:34:15,711
(I promise I'll debut this time.)

1885
01:34:20,612 --> 01:34:21,612
Zen Zen.

1886
01:34:21,613 --> 01:34:23,751
(Overall standings: Zen Zen, 11th place, 177,112 points)

1887
01:34:24,551 --> 01:34:29,862
(Zen Zen put on stable and charismatic vocals.)

1888
01:34:30,661 --> 01:34:32,032
(Zen Zen)

1889
01:34:32,661 --> 01:34:34,791
(He joined TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.)

1890
01:34:35,762 --> 01:34:38,732
(Director Lee Chang Sub said he had the nice voice he was looking for.)

1891
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:45,670
(He pulled off the high pitch in Round 1,)

1892
01:34:45,671 --> 01:34:48,341
(but he placed 13th in the team and became a bench.)

1893
01:34:49,581 --> 01:34:50,811
(He stepped forward to steal...)

1894
01:34:50,812 --> 01:34:53,711
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup's song in Round 2.)

1895
01:34:53,951 --> 01:34:55,721
(But he remained 13th in Round 2.)

1896
01:34:55,722 --> 01:34:57,282
The player I'm going to release is...

1897
01:34:58,022 --> 01:35:01,152
(He was even released from TEAM GROOVE.)

1898
01:35:01,451 --> 01:35:03,222
(Yet Zen Zen is cheerful despite the silence.)

1899
01:35:03,491 --> 01:35:04,491
(On eggshells)

1900
01:35:04,492 --> 01:35:05,991
(Zen Zen's positive energy flustered other players.)

1901
01:35:06,362 --> 01:35:10,631
(Zen Zen soon adjusted to TEAM RHYTHM.)

1902
01:35:12,732 --> 01:35:16,602
(Zen Zen went on stage as TEAM RHYTHM's elite player.)

1903
01:35:16,741 --> 01:35:17,741
Tenth place goes to...

1904
01:35:18,911 --> 01:35:19,911
Zen Zen.

1905
01:35:20,312 --> 01:35:22,711
(How will Zen Zen do in the final?)

1906
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:27,012
Kairi.

1907
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:28,852
(Overall standings: Kairi, 17th place, 145,115 points)

1908
01:35:30,522 --> 01:35:35,121
(He became the bench's ace with his explosive charisma.)

1909
01:35:37,562 --> 01:35:38,932
The MVP of this round is...

1910
01:35:40,631 --> 01:35:41,631
Kairi.

1911
01:35:41,632 --> 01:35:47,032
(He placed 4th and joined the starting lineup after Round 1.)

1912
01:35:47,402 --> 01:35:50,201
(The directors approve of Kairi's charismatic energy.)

1913
01:35:51,972 --> 01:35:54,471
(His outstanding ability to pull off the theme...)

1914
01:35:54,472 --> 01:35:56,211
(and performance stood out.)

1915
01:35:59,251 --> 01:36:00,251
Fourth place goes to...

1916
01:36:01,012 --> 01:36:02,021
Kairi.

1917
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:05,692
(He remained 4th in the team.)

1918
01:36:10,892 --> 01:36:16,301
(He joined Round 3 as TEAM BEAT's 7 elite players as well as the ace.)

1919
01:36:19,932 --> 01:36:24,072
(He proved how sexy he could be with the blindfold performance.)

1920
01:36:24,642 --> 01:36:25,942
Kairi is crazy.

1921
01:36:27,942 --> 01:36:30,142
(TEAM BEAT's scene stealer who steals the scene in every round)

1922
01:36:30,241 --> 01:36:32,250
- Second place goes to... - Come here.

1923
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:33,351
- Kairi. - Come here.

1924
01:36:33,352 --> 01:36:36,381
(Kairi went up as high as 2nd place in the team.)

1925
01:36:36,881 --> 01:36:39,351
(I'll trust myself...)

1926
01:36:39,352 --> 01:36:41,921
(and move forward.)

1927
01:36:42,822 --> 01:36:43,822
Sirin.

1928
01:36:43,823 --> 01:36:45,532
(Overall standings: Sirin, 18th place, 123,690 points)

1929
01:36:46,862 --> 01:36:50,300
(Sirin pulled off "S-CLASS" with his stable vocals.)

1930
01:36:50,301 --> 01:36:53,072
(TEAM RHYTHM's directors spotted Sirin's potential.)

1931
01:36:53,572 --> 01:36:55,741
(Sirin)

1932
01:36:56,001 --> 01:36:59,341
(He joined Round 1 as TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.)

1933
01:37:00,341 --> 01:37:02,611
(He completed the performance successfully...)

1934
01:37:02,612 --> 01:37:04,041
(with his stable vocals.)

1935
01:37:04,142 --> 01:37:05,142
Tenth place goes to...

1936
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:08,921
(However, he was degraded to a bench by placing 10th in the team.)

1937
01:37:10,381 --> 01:37:12,151
(Sirin joined Round 2 as as the ace of TEAM RHYTHM's bench...)

1938
01:37:12,152 --> 01:37:14,121
(and showed off his vocals.)

1939
01:37:15,661 --> 01:37:17,522
(Despite his outstanding skills, he placed 12th in the team.)

1940
01:37:17,862 --> 01:37:19,491
The player I'm going to scout is...

1941
01:37:20,232 --> 01:37:21,630
(However, he seized Director Lee Chang Sub's attention...)

1942
01:37:21,631 --> 01:37:23,131
(and was scouted to TEAM GROOVE.)

1943
01:37:24,232 --> 01:37:27,532
(He was TEAM GROOVE's rival, but he was picked by TEAM GROOVE.)

1944
01:37:30,341 --> 01:37:32,271
(Thanks to TEAM GROOVE's special vocal training,)

1945
01:37:32,272 --> 01:37:34,972
(Sirin showed his potential.)

1946
01:37:36,312 --> 01:37:40,512
(He placed 8th in TEAM GROOVE.)

1947
01:37:41,051 --> 01:37:44,551
(I want to show my endless potential.)

1948
01:37:45,251 --> 01:37:46,251
Kim Dong Yun.

1949
01:37:46,252 --> 01:37:48,222
(Overall standings: Kim Dong Yun, 19th place, 122,258 points)

1950
01:37:49,262 --> 01:37:50,920
(Kim Dong Yun drew attention with his fresh and cute charms...)

1951
01:37:50,921 --> 01:37:52,461
(in the draft.)

1952
01:37:54,791 --> 01:37:56,232
(Kim Dong Yun)

1953
01:37:56,331 --> 01:37:59,171
(He joined TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.)

1954
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:04,371
(However, he put on a regrettable performance in Round 1.)

1955
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:11,112
(He was degraded to a bench by placing 12th.)

1956
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:14,682
(He joined Round 2 as a bench member.)

1957
01:38:15,051 --> 01:38:17,781
(He put on a spiteful performance.)

1958
01:38:17,782 --> 01:38:18,791
Second place goes to...

1959
01:38:19,591 --> 01:38:21,290
Kim Dong Yun.

1960
01:38:21,291 --> 01:38:23,262
(He soon placed 2nd in TEAM BEAT.)

1961
01:38:23,591 --> 01:38:24,722
TEAM BEAT's...

1962
01:38:25,932 --> 01:38:30,201
(TEAM RHTYHM's director scouted him for his potential.)

1963
01:38:31,102 --> 01:38:32,102
Let's go.

1964
01:38:32,432 --> 01:38:34,232
(However)

1965
01:38:35,102 --> 01:38:39,142
(He didn't get to perform in Round 3.)

1966
01:38:39,541 --> 01:38:41,741
Sixth place goes to Kim Dong Yun.

1967
01:38:41,841 --> 01:38:45,652
(However, he received enough online votes to place 6th in the team.)

1968
01:38:45,852 --> 01:38:48,381
(The first member to release is...)

1969
01:38:48,482 --> 01:38:50,021
(Kim Dong Yun)

1970
01:38:50,022 --> 01:38:54,091
(He was released without a chance to show what he's got.)

1971
01:38:54,421 --> 01:38:55,722
It's my last chance.

1972
01:38:56,121 --> 01:38:58,322
I want to put on a good performance...

1973
01:38:58,421 --> 01:39:00,362
with no regrets.

1974
01:39:01,892 --> 01:39:02,960

1975
01:39:02,961 --> 01:39:04,362
(Overall standings: Keum Jin Ho, 22nd place, 93,393 points)

1976
01:39:04,602 --> 01:39:06,501
When I first joined Universe League,

1977
01:39:07,001 --> 01:39:08,871
my first goal was...

1978
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:11,572
make the final no matter what.

1979
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:15,682
(He joined TEAM BEAT as their first pick.)

1980
01:39:17,112 --> 01:39:22,482
(Leader Keum led the performance in Round 1.)

1981
01:39:25,022 --> 01:39:26,051
The eighth place goes to...

1982
01:39:26,822 --> 01:39:28,620
Keum Jin Ho.

1983
01:39:28,621 --> 01:39:31,961
(However, he placed 8th in the team.)

1984
01:39:32,762 --> 01:39:36,501
(He decided to change for Round 2 Intercept Round.)

1985
01:39:38,362 --> 01:39:42,671
(Jin Ho proved himself with improvement.)

1986
01:39:42,902 --> 01:39:43,902
Third place goes to...

1987
01:39:45,301 --> 01:39:49,812

(TEAM BEAT put on an amazing performance in Round 3.)

1989
01:39:56,322 --> 01:40:01,951
(Jin Ho's performance stood out who always protected TEAM BEAT.)

1990
01:40:02,591 --> 01:40:04,262
Keum Jin Ho.

1991
01:40:04,762 --> 01:40:06,460
(He placed high in the team.)

1992
01:40:06,461 --> 01:40:07,461
I want to show...

1993
01:40:07,831 --> 01:40:08,902
that TEAM BEAT is...

1994
01:40:09,402 --> 01:40:11,232
still...

1995
01:40:12,102 --> 01:40:13,772
moving forward.

2001
01:40:27,751 --> 01:40:29,822
(with his stable skills and outstanding talents.)

2002
01:40:30,451 --> 01:40:31,482

(Yuito impressed the audience with his fresh boyish charm.)

2006

2007
01:40:42,701 --> 01:40:44,931

(He performed in Round 3 as 1 of the 7 elite players.)

01:41:13,461 --> 01:41:16,161
to debut in TEAM BEAT.

2016
01:41:20,201 --> 01:41:22,641
(The final 21 players survived...)

2017
01:41:22,642 --> 01:41:24,541
(the intense competition.)

2018
01:41:32,551 --> 01:41:34,652
