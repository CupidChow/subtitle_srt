1
00:00:02,313 --> 00:00:03,983
Universe League's Round One...

2
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,184
(Round 1 is over.)

3
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:07,814
(Revealing the long-awaited team ranking result)

4
00:00:08,347 --> 00:00:09,646
(My heart is pounding.)

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,347
(I can't watch.)

6
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:15,453
Round One, team ranking result.

7
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:17,723
TEAM GROOVE turned the tables.

8
00:00:17,723 --> 00:00:20,763
(Thanks to the bench, TEAM GROOVE came in first place.)

9
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:22,034
Yes!

10
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:24,839
(We did it. This is it.)

11
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,739
(Everyone did an amazing job.)

12
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,339
Following the Round One result...

13
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,248
(And the Round 1 Trade started.)

14
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,278
(The players released are...)

15
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:35,848
(TEAM GROOVE's released players)

16
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,519
(TEAM GROOVE traded players.)

17
00:00:41,318 --> 00:00:44,759
The player to release is Royce.

18
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:47,799
We'd like to scout Chih En.

19
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:53,398
(So this is how you play the game. This is what you call a league.)

20
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:54,939
(It's making me feel competitive.)

21
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,869
League match Round Two. It's Intercept.

22
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,049
(The three directors prepared new songs for the starting lineup.)

23
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,118
(The bench will choose other starting players to challenge...)

24
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,448
(and intercept...)

25
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:11,648
(the new song.)

26
00:01:12,318 --> 00:01:15,359
(The starting lineup must defend their new song.)

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,728
(The bench must intercept the new song.)

28
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:18,758
(Round 2 Intercept)

29
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:20,258
(Starting versus bench, who will get the new song?)

30
00:01:20,928 --> 00:01:23,398
Boys' dream match, Universe League.

31
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:24,868
(Universe League)

32
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:25,898
Are you ready?

33
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:34,739
(After Round 1, which changed the fates of the players, ended...)

34
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,079
EL CAPITXN has prepared...

35
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:41,148
a song he adores.

36
00:01:41,148 --> 00:01:42,948
- It's a killer. - It is indeed a killer song.

37
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:46,448
- I'm sure you guys will love it. - Oh, my gosh.

38
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:49,019
- He made it for you guys. - I... Yes.

39
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,758
It's a song I refused to sell, even when offered a high price.

40
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,329
- What? - I've become greedy.

41
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,629
We'll guard it for life.

42
00:01:56,928 --> 00:01:59,969
It's really good. Have faith in me and give it a listen.

43
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:01,669
(The hot K-pop producer is confident.)

44
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:02,769
The hit song maker.

45
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:06,438
("DDAENG," "Take Two," "Interlude: Shadow" by BTS)

46
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:07,438
("That That" by PSY, "Your City" by Jung Yong Hwa, "Noir" by SUNMI)

47
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:08,479
("We don't talk together" by Heize, "Intro: Walk The Line" by ENHYPEN)

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,479
("Way 4 Luv," "The 6th Summer," "Why?" by PLAVE, etc.)

49
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,479
I love all of Director EL CAPITXN's songs.

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,889
I looked forward to the song he was giving us.

51
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,658
I prepared a new song for you.

52
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:23,658
And I'm always seeking to make...

53
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,158
a team specialized in vocals.

54
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:28,829
Vocal-wise, it'll be really tough.

55
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:33,699
The song is that intense.

56
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:35,398
It's just that kind of song.

57
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:36,438
- Understood. - Understood.

58
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:37,739
Take a seat.

59
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:39,708
I'm excited.

60
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:40,908
(Full of expectation)

61
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,378
We can't lose the song.

62
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,949
We won't let that happen.

63
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:47,248
If the bench does better than you,

64
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:48,648
they will release the song.

65
00:02:48,648 --> 00:02:49,849
(The bench will release the song.)

66
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,148
That can't happen.

67
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:53,248
You must do well so as not to lose the song.

68
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:54,289
- Okay. - Okay.

69
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:56,958
(The starting lineup must defend the song made for them.)

70
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,128
- You know the rule, right? - Yes.

71
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:02,058
Don't lose it, okay?

72
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,558
- Thank you. - We'll guard it.

73
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,428
(We'll guard it for life.)

74
00:03:06,428 --> 00:03:09,498
The song also has a choreography.

75
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:12,069
Shall we listen to it?

76
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,239
- Yes, I'm in. - Yes.

77
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,479
(Looking forward to the new song)

78
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,919
It's a song that suits TEAM RHYTHM.

79
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:23,989
- "IGNITION." - "IGNITION."

80
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,349
(TEAM RHYTHM starting lineup's new song: "IGNITION")

81
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:26,849
- I'm excited. - It's already nice.

82
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:29,419
(A hip-hop dance track,)

83
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,229
(featuring powerful synth bass and rhythmic drum sounds,)

84
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,729
(showcasing the ambition to break boundaries...)

85
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:33,998
(and deliver a fierce performance onstage)

86
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:38,628
(The powerful expressions stand out...)

87
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:41,639
(in TEAM RHYTHM starting lineup's new song.)

88
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:46,438
(The highlight of "IGNITION" amazes everyone.)

89
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,509
(The robust performance and high notes...)

90
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,178
(are impressive and perfect for TEAM RHYTHM.)

91
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,088
It's so high.

92
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:06,158
It's the kind of song I wanted to try.

93
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,128
Our and the directors' colors...

94
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:13,368
are mixed well in the song. I love it.

95
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:17,969
The song suited our team, TEAM RHYTHM, well.

96
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,609
I'm confident in making a cool and great performance.

97
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,549
(Highly satisfied)

98
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,318
- The live... - How do we perform live?

99
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:30,279
Let me bring this up since we have a new member.

100
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,618
The song is completely different...

101
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:34,618
from "Give Me That."

102
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:37,558
Practice a lot.

103
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:41,029
Get the groove of the song as soon as possible.

104
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,628
You need to find the way...

105
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,128
to make it look cool.

106
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:46,169
Understood.

107
00:04:46,498 --> 00:04:48,099
Looking back at Round One,

108
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:51,339
you need to use your facial expressions more.

109
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:52,469
Okay.

110
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:55,839
When practicing dancing,

111
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:58,279
decide on when...

112
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,948
you'll smile and show off your charms.

113
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:07,159
The vibe of the song is a good match with you.

114
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,159
I see.

115
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:10,388
The lyrics...

116
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:12,229
(For the starting lineup)

117
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,258
I wrote it myself.

118
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:14,698
(Honored)

119
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:17,628
TEAM BEAT's future path.

120
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,938
And proving to everyone who we are. That's the theme.

121
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,409
"Rise again" is a part of the lyrics.

122
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:26,909
- Perfect, right? - Rising again is making me cry.

123
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,008
But don't rise again forever.

124
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,909
(But don't rise again forever.)

125
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:33,178
- Of course not. - This is the last time.

126
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:34,479
We must rise for sure this time.

127
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,248
Make this the last time you rise again.

128
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,248
Okay.

129
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:39,049
- Got it? - Yes.

130
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,149
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup prepares to rise again.)

131
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,289
Let's listen to it.

132
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,729
(An advanced choreography from the start)

133
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,359
Who wants to go up there?

134
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:47,698
Isn't it going to be An Yul?

135
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:50,498
Goodness.

136
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,868
(A song portraying a youth's journey...)

137
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:54,299
(to discover who they are...)

138
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:56,469
(while being challenged and finding their path)

139
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,868
Oh, my.

140
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,709
It's right up my alley.

141
00:06:00,438 --> 00:06:01,479
Gosh.

142
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:03,438
(Rise again)

143
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,719
(Our time is coming)

144
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:12,188
(We never stop, bet on everything)

145
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,919
(Even if the end is unknown)

146
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,099
(The players are already in love with the new song.)

147
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,498
(Applauding nonstop)

148
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:30,868
It's a "W."

149
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,339
- "We are." - "We are."

150
00:06:33,878 --> 00:06:35,609
You must give it your all.

151
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:37,649
- Exactly. - I think so too.

152
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,678
We will win...

153
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,219
and defend our song.

154
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:45,289
The lyrics of "MAMMA MIA..."

155
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,089
gave the feeling of...

156
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:50,859
trusting and throwing ourselves out there to achieve our dreams.

157
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,229
It was a song about us.

158
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:54,998
We will do our best...

159
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,768
and not lose the song to anyone.

160
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:01,438
My strategy is for the audience to feel nostalgic...

161
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:04,638
while they watch your performance.

162
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:07,138
That was what I had in mind while creating the song.

163
00:07:07,138 --> 00:07:08,479
- Nostalgic? - Yes.

164
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,508
(TEAM GROOVE starting lineup's new song: "Prison")

165
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:15,248
(An EDM track with lyrical synthesizer sounds,)

166
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:16,979
(expressing the feeling of being trapped...)

167
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,589
(by unavoidable love and obsession,)

168
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:19,818
(using prison as a metaphor)

169
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:24,229
("Prison" starts with an emotional melody.)

170
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,659
(The highlight choreography)

171
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:28,628
Is it a doorknob?

172
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:35,938
The choreography is crazy.

173
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,169
(The chorus choreography is full of groove.)

174
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,568
Look at those moves.

175
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:44,308
I fell in love the moment I heard the song.

176
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,979
It was the song for TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.

177
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:50,849
I was determined to protect it.

178
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:59,058
(It hit the right note.)

179
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:00,058
That was amazing.

180
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,428
Did the song remind you of any singers?

181
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:07,169
BigBang.

182
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:08,938
- Yes. And? - I was reminded of them.

183
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,638
- BEAST. - That's it.

184
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:13,979
- BEAST. - I get it.

185
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,979
- It has "Fiction" vibes. - Yes.

186
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:19,378
It's a mix of BigBang and BEAST.

187
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:21,149
("Prison" will stir up nostalgia.)

188
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:24,049
The song will sound familiar to the audience.

189
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,589
They would've heard it somewhere else.

190
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,459
How about we show off your abs here?

191
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:32,788
With the outfit...

192
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:33,829
(Revealing Kenta's abs?)

193
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,898
Or how about ripping your clothes off...

194
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:38,699
while singing "Feeling stuck and frustrated?"

195
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:41,469
(Sounds nice.)

196
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:44,209
That's going to be so cool. It'll be cool.

197
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:46,069
(TEAM GROOVE has a trump card.)

198
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:48,278
You must do well not to lose the song.

199
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,278
- Okay. - Okay.

200
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,148
The director wrote the song with us in mind.

201
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:55,618
If another team takes it from us and sings it,

202
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,349
I'll feel terrible for the director.

203
00:08:58,449 --> 00:08:59,648
We won't lose it.

204
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:03,888
It's the song the director wrote for us seven players.

205
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:07,528
I can't let another team's bench take it.

206
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:11,929
I won't give up. I'll work hard...

207
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:14,599
and prepare a fine performance.

208
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:16,599
We won't lose it.

209
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:20,739
Lose it. That's your role.

210
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:23,408
There's no problem. We'll intercept it.

211
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:25,778
I plan to ruin the starting lineup.

212
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:29,219
We'll show them the underdog's terror.

213
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:32,518
(The day after Round 1)

214
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:37,329
(The players have gathered in one place.)

215
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:40,359
(The bench will pick the starting lineup to fight against.)

216
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:43,128
(The Bench's Designation)

217
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:44,829
The day has finally come.

218
00:09:45,599 --> 00:09:46,628
Intercept.

219
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,638
(Smiling)

220
00:09:48,038 --> 00:09:50,298
(The starting lineup must defend the songs by the directors.)

221
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:53,408
(The bench teams are trying to intercept the songs.)

222
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,109
Try taking it.

223
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,679
What? Can they even intercept it?

224
00:09:58,748 --> 00:09:59,748
We won't lose it.

225
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,518
We can definitely beat them.

226
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:04,548
I like to steal.

227
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,258
(Then...)

228
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:11,128
I'm worried about how the designation will proceed today.

229
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:18,128
With their designation right, the bench...

230
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:21,969
will pick the starting lineup they want to challenge.

231
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:26,339
The other two benches will automatically fight against...

232
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,008
the other team's starting lineup aside from their team.

233
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:32,048
(Which bench team...)

234
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:36,849
(has the designation right to pick their opponent?)

235
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:38,418
Is it us?

236
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:41,788
The bench to win 1st place in Round 1's Bench Match.

237
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,258
TEAM GROOVE's bench.

238
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:45,888
(TEAM GROOVE's bench)

239
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,388
(Bummed out)

240
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:48,599
We've won.

241
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,628
- We've practically won. - What a relief.

242
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:52,599
I kind of knew it.

243
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:56,069
(Designation candidate: TEAM BEAT's starting lineup)

244
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:58,469
(Designation candidate: TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup)

245
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:00,109
We have to decide now.

246
00:11:00,109 --> 00:11:02,809
Our team gets to pick the other team.

247
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:04,408
Let's discuss.

248
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:05,449
- Do you know... - Which team do you want to pick?

249
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,449
(Jang Kyung Ho scans the starting lineup.)

250
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:16,459
(There's a peculiar suspense among the three teams.)

251
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:17,859
Have you thought about it?

252
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,388
- Yes. - I have as well.

253
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,729
Which team?

254
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:25,569
- I think they'll have a rap... - Yes.

255
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,368
and intense choreography.

256
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:28,898
- TEAM BEAT's song. - TEAM BEAT?

257
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,138
He used to be in TEAM BEAT.

258
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:33,138
- Right. - A song more suitable...

259
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:35,109
- His hometown. - He's aiming for it.

260
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:36,109
It's like a short visit.

261
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:38,378
(TEAM BEAT that he knows well?)

262
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:39,479
I personally think...

263
00:11:40,278 --> 00:11:42,148
an exciting hip-hop song...

264
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:44,888
I'm confident we can kill it best out of the 42 players...

265
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:46,449
with such a song.

266
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:48,689
(Hip-hop performance is their strength.)

267
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:51,189
(TEAM RHYTHM?)

268
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,059
I want to know who they'll pick.

269
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,158
(Peeking)

270
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:58,998
Out of the benches, they have the best lineup.

271
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:01,599
But it's not to the point of scaring us.

272
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:03,599
It's not.

273
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:05,809
- They'll regret it. - Totally.

274
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:12,079
Although we ranked 2nd in Round 1,

275
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:15,918
I still think that our team is the best based on the scores.

276
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,949
Picking our team?

277
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:19,989
Be our guest.

278
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,118
Is that our final decision? Are you happy with it?

279
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,158
- Yes. - Yes.

280
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:27,758
(Which starting lineup...)

281
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:31,998
(will TEAM GROOVE's bench pick?)

282
00:12:36,969 --> 00:12:39,368
(The bench is to pick the starting lineup...)

283
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:45,408
(by intercepting the team jersey each team's MVP is holding.)

284
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:47,548
Kyung Ho.

285
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,278
I'm scared even though we're teammates.

286
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:51,819
It's like he'll take it by force.

287
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,128
(Jang Kyung Ho starts moving toward the starting lineup.)

288
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:00,729
(Holding onto the team jersey tightly)

289
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:01,959
Don't come to us.

290
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,628
- How cool! - Jang Kyung Ho!

291
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,998
It's going to be a challenge if you pick us for sure.

292
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:09,038
Beat them.

293
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:16,479
(Jang Kyung Ho is heading to TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup?)

294
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:17,748
What?

295
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:22,778
If Kyung Ho comes, don't hand it over to him right away.

296
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,989
- Wait until he asks for it. - Okay.

297
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:26,118
- Stay still. - Of course.

298
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,118
I can't just hand it over.

299
00:13:28,618 --> 00:13:30,288
- This is our new song. - Exactly.

300
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:33,459
(We can't let him have our new song!)

301
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:35,658
(Glancing)

302
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:40,469
(Where is Jang Kyung Ho headed to?)

303
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:44,268
(Passing by TEAM BEAT's starting lineup)

304
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,109
(Is he designating TEAM RHYTHM?)

305
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:51,109
(What is TEAM GROOVE bench's decision?)

306
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:52,109
(Fist bump)

307
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:53,109
That scared me.

308
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,319
- What's going on? - I see.

309
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:00,589
(Moving)

310
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:04,559
Are you choosing their song?

311
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:09,959
Do you want us?

312
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:13,599
- Do you want it? - Anything.

313
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:14,898
You don't care?

314
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:18,739
- Okay. - Kyung Ho.

315
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,069
- No. - "No?"

316
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,079
No.

317
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,349
(At that moment)

318
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:34,418
(Jang Kyung Ho charges toward TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.)

319
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,359
- What? - I knew it.

320
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,559
(Intercepting)

321
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,758
I knew it.

322
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:42,559
I'm sorry.

323
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:48,798
I was taken aback.

324
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,008
It hurt my pride a bit.

325
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:54,579
But if I were him, I would've avoided us.

326
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:56,778
Why did he choose the team with me in it?

327
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:58,349
(Why did he choose the team with me in it?)

328
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:00,209
I didn't keep him in check.

329
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,979
Koo Han Seo! Are you out of your mind?

330
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:05,819
- Koo Han Seo! - I'm sorry!

331
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:08,219
- Are you out of your mind? - Calm down.

332
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:10,689
Han Seo is our baby now.

333
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:11,689
(Protecting his player)

334
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,359
You stabbed us in the back.

335
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:16,329
I thought he had lost it.

336
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,599
How could he make such a decision?

337
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:21,668
Really. Our team consists of over half...

338
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,569
of the players he led.

339
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,668
(The competition is merciless.)

340
00:15:27,038 --> 00:15:29,408
(Why did TEAM GROOVE's bench pick TEAM BEAT's starting lineup?)

341
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,248
Our team will be better at...

342
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:35,319
TEAM BEAT starting lineup's song.

343
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:38,449
(Maximum confidence)

344
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:41,888
(Dumbstruck)

345
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:43,989
We'll just let him believe that.

346
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:45,829
(An intense war of nerves)

347
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:46,829
Nice.

348
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,258
- This show is scary. - Goodness.

349
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:52,069
- I know, right? - I'm dead scared.

350
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:53,298
(Day 1 of being on TEAM GROOVE)

351
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:55,368
- I'm glad... - We're on the same team.

352
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,439
It's a relief.

353
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:00,638
From what I see, they didn't talk it out enough.

354
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:05,609
You'll soon realize the solution you came up with...

355
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,918
is a bad one.

356
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:11,449
(Dropping)

357
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,359
(A feisty provocation by TEAM GROOVE's bench)

358
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:21,128
(Shocked)

359
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:26,898
I don't want to stay still, and I don't want to lose as well.

360
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:32,908
(The war of nerves between the two teams is getting intense.)

361
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:37,849
(Which team will take the new song?)

362
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,609
(As TEAM GROOVE's bench chose TEAM BEAT's starting lineup,)

363
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:44,148
(the matchup was automatically settled.)

364
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:47,048
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup versus TEAM RHYTHM's bench)

365
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,258
To be honest,

366
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:51,589
(He was the leader of TEAM RHYTHM's bench until yesterday.)

367
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,089
I do feel quite uncomfortable about this,

368
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:57,229
but since this is a survival, I must bring them down and go up.

369
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:59,628
(I must bring them down and go up.)

370
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:03,268
Oh, my gosh.

371
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:05,268
(TEAM GROOVE's starting player continues to provoke them.)

372
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:07,338
You'll know because you have heard our song.

373
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,409
It's a really hard song.

374
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,409
- So... - Right.

375
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:15,278
I think that the only players that can make this song work...

376
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,679
is us.

377
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:24,588
(We can't stay still.)

378
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:32,068
(He provokes them with the yellow card.)

379
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:35,469
(Nice one, Li Zhinuo!)

380
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:36,699
Go, Li Zhinuo!

381
00:17:37,469 --> 00:17:38,568
"Look at this guy."

382
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:41,679
We can never lose.

383
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,479
TEAM RHYTHM will take first place no matter what.

384
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:47,409
Number one!

385
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:49,979
We should beat them so that they would never think about winning.

386
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:53,088
We should show them a difference in talent.

387
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,159
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup versus TEAM BEAT's bench)

388
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,288
Wouldn't there be a reason...

389
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:01,598
that all seven of us don't have a yellow card?

390
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,028
(Smirking)

391
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:06,869
I just want to apologize because...

392
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:09,798
we might be the reason you're out in the next round.

393
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,338
(We might be the reason you're out in the next round.)

394
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:12,768
(Annoyed)

395
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:14,639
(That was intense.)

396
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,338
(Feeling confident)

397
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:22,048
Just listen to the song sung in our voices.

398
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:27,748
(Glaring)

399
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:29,318
(Hurrying)

400
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:32,889
Go.

401
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:36,129
Everyone thinks that TEAM RHYTHM is a strong team,

402
00:18:36,998 --> 00:18:38,699
but I believe we can surely beat them.

403
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:42,669
(The designation is intense.)

404
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:46,008
(Who will become the owner of the new song?)

405
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:49,838
(Universe League, Round 2)

406
00:18:54,078 --> 00:18:57,018
(The players look nervous.)

407
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,748
After Round One,

408
00:18:58,748 --> 00:19:01,518
there were players who received a yellow card.

409
00:19:01,518 --> 00:19:02,889
(Yellow cards were given out after Round 1.)

410
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,758
Currently, TEAM RHYTHM has two yellow cards,

411
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:09,828
and TEAM BEAT has seven yellow cards.

412
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:12,729
(TEAM BEAT, 7 yellow cards)

413
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:14,369
(Closing his eyes)

414
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:15,768
After today's Round Two,

415
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:18,308
yellow cards will be given based on the ranking.

416
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:20,108
(Yellow cards will be given out again based on team rankings.)

417
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:21,979
The second-place team...

418
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:23,808
will get three yellow cards,

419
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:25,409
and the third-place team...

420
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:27,608
will get six yellow cards.

421
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:28,879
(The 3rd place team will get 6 yellow cards.)

422
00:19:30,778 --> 00:19:33,489
During a league match,

423
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,588
if you get two yellow cards,

424
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:37,619
you will get eliminated right away.

425
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:40,058
(You will get eliminated right away with 2 yellow cards.)

426
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:44,058
Seven members had yellow cards in our team,

427
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,268
so I felt very worried.

428
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,969
Our team can't afford to get more yellow cards.

429
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:49,338
We're in trouble.

430
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:51,869
Today,

431
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,209
the first elimination could happen on Universe League.

432
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,179
- No! - No!

433
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:01,209
One more yellow card meant that I would get eliminated.

434
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:02,919
I felt very worried.

435
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:04,848
I felt really anxious.

436
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:08,258
Placing last would be disastrous for us.

437
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:09,558
Another yellow card,

438
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:12,058
and our team could get wiped out.

439
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:14,588
There were two members on our team...

440
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,058
who had a yellow card.

441
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,598
I thought that we really had to win.

442
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:21,129
I wanted TEAM GROOVE to win again...

443
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:22,998
and avoid getting any yellow cards.

444
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:27,169
The team positions for Round Two...

445
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:31,239
(Team positions for Round 2)

446
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,909
will be decided by adding on-site votes...

447
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:37,278
and online votes.

448
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:38,419
(On-site votes and online votes will be added.)

449
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,248
- That's amazing. - Seriously?

450
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:42,258
(The online voting includes the 1st global fan voting.)

451
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:45,058
The 1st and 2nd-place teams of this round...

452
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:46,929
will be given trade tickets,

453
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:48,328
which allow them to trade players.

454
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:52,429
The 1st-place team will get 2, and the 2nd-place team will get 1.

455
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:55,869
(The 1st-place team will get 2, and the 2nd-place team will get 1.)

456
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:58,469
The theme of Round Two that has the players' fates on the line...

457
00:20:58,639 --> 00:20:59,838
is Intercept.

458
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,909
It's a battle between the bench that has to intercept...

459
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:05,979
the other team's new song...

460
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,709
and the starting lineup that has to protect...

461
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,548
their new song.

462
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,119
The winner of the new song and the Intercept Round...

463
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:14,518
will be decided only by the on-site voting.

464
00:21:14,518 --> 00:21:15,588
(The owner of the new song will be decided by the on-site voting only.)

465
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,459
The song will be released with the voices of the members...

466
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:20,328
- of the winning team. - Gosh.

467
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,028
Our team is stronger than any other team.

468
00:21:23,258 --> 00:21:24,328
We're going to win.

469
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:27,699
Our team losing isn't part of my plan.

470
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:31,709
I believe anyone would think it was our song.

471
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,869
I'm ready to bring them completely down.

472
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,879
(TEAM RHYTHM is getting feedback on their rehearsal.)

473
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,979
I'll mention this right away.

474
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:41,719
Daisuke, when you started,

475
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,719
your shoulders were too curled up.

476
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,949
I think it'll be better to straighten them.

477
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:45,949
Okay.

478
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:49,518
- You can add more gestures here. - Right.

479
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:53,389
I think you should pay attention to the beat more during this part.

480
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:56,028
Zhang Shuaibo, you were a bit too fast here.

481
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,429
We saw TEAM BEAT's bench practice.

482
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,369
Those guys are really...

483
00:22:01,998 --> 00:22:03,169
- full of fire. - Right.

484
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:05,939
It's because they have a lot of yellow cards.

485
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:08,838
We're spot-on with the choreography.

486
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:11,078
- But TEAM BEAT's bench... - Facial expressions.

487
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:13,078
has more soul.

488
00:22:13,078 --> 00:22:15,919
It seems like their characters stand out more,

489
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,389
so I think it'll be better if we could show that as well.

490
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:19,788
- Right. - Right.

491
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,919
Let's just be passionate today.

492
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:22,959
- Okay! - Okay!

493
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:25,258
We know that you've practiced a lot.

494
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:27,358
- Let's go! - Thank you.

495
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:28,358
(TEAM BEAT has to cheer up!)

496
00:22:28,358 --> 00:22:29,429
- Passion! - Let's go!

497
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:31,429
- Tear up the stage! - Okay!

498
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:33,969
- Let's go! - Let's go!

499
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,239
Let's go!

500
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:37,998
- We can't have our song taken away. - Okay.

501
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:39,709
We can't have it taken away.

502
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,038
You guys have to take it from them.

503
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:42,139
- Okay! - Okay!

504
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,879
(The Intercept Round starts in earnest.)

505
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:50,949
(And...)

506
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,788
(MC Jay Park appears.)

507
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,588
(You look great!)

508
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:58,459
Welcome to Universe League. Hello. I'm MC Jay Park.

509
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,659
Take...

510
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:03,659
or have it taken away.

511
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,899
The Intercept Round.

512
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:07,629
Who will become the owner of the new song?

513
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:09,369
Are you ready to enjoy it?

514
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:10,869
- Yes! - Yes!

515
00:23:11,068 --> 00:23:15,239
Are you ready?

516
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:19,209
We placed 2nd last time. Let's take 1st place this time.

517
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:21,518
- Yes! - Do well!

518
00:23:21,778 --> 00:23:23,949
(Of course!)

519
00:23:23,949 --> 00:23:26,248
- Let's go! - Let's go!

520
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:28,288
- Let's go! - Let's go!

521
00:23:28,758 --> 00:23:29,858
Go and have fun.

522
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:30,858
- Okay. - Good luck!

523
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:31,929
- We'll be back. - Let's go!

524
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:33,889
(I trust our players.)

525
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:36,729
- Guys, let's do this! - Yes!

526
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:38,899
- Let's go! - Let's go!

527
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:40,828
- We'll go and have fun. - Make sure to have fun.

528
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:42,338
- Thank you. - Good luck.

529
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,068
- Thank you. - Good luck.

530
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:45,139
- Thank you. - Thank you.

531
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,538
- Give everything you have. - Let's go!

532
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:49,439
This is the first battle of the Intercept Round.

533
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:50,939
(Koo Han Seo)

534
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:54,578
All of its players are all-round players.

535
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:56,179
The owner team of the new song.

536
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,489
TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup, please come out.

537
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:02,389
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup appears.)

538
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,889
The starting lineup can't lose to bench players.

539
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:08,058
We will show you the skills of the starting lineup.

540
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:09,758
The new song is ours.

541
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:16,498
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup enters with a great welcome.)

542
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,568
(Zhang Shuaibo)

543
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:19,209
Steven.

544
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,308
Park Ju Won.

545
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,479
Daisuke.

546
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:25,179
Hiroto.

547
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:26,649
JL.

548
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:28,318
Chih En.

549
00:24:28,518 --> 00:24:29,679
Zhang Shuaibo.

550
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:31,248
They do have strong members.

551
00:24:32,189 --> 00:24:33,219
Right.

552
00:24:33,318 --> 00:24:34,919
This team has a lot of talented players.

553
00:24:35,588 --> 00:24:37,858
The ones who will go against TEAM RHYTHM.

554
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:41,159
TEAM BEAT's bench, please come out.

555
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,729
(TEAM BEAT's bench appears.)

556
00:24:45,328 --> 00:24:47,598
We will really enjoy our performance.

557
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:51,038
We will enjoy it and intercept "IGNITION."

558
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:54,869
Give it up for TEAM BEAT!

559
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:57,679
Make some noise for TEAM BEAT!

560
00:24:58,179 --> 00:24:59,348
(Ji Hun)

561
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:00,449
Park Ji Hun.

562
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:03,518
Kang Jun Hyuk. Royce.

563
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,949
Jiang Fan. Kim Hyo Tae.

564
00:25:06,189 --> 00:25:08,389
Kim Dong Yun. Li Zhiwei.

565
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,858
Let's start with TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.

566
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:13,558
Please greet the audience.

567
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:16,558
All right. In 2, 3.

568
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:20,429
- RHYTHM! Let's go! - RHYTHM! Let's go!

569
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,338
- Let's go! - Let's go!

570
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,909
Hello. This is TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.

571
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,409
We will make sure to show you why we are the starting lineup...

572
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,538
through today's performance.

573
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,679
(That's impressive!)

574
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,709
(Glaring)

575
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:36,379
He's provoking them.

576
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:38,919
- RHYTHM! - Let's go!

577
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:41,758
- RHYTHM! - RHYTHM!

578
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:43,959
BEAT's bench, commence fire!

579
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,129
(Take this!)

580
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:50,058
We're here to snipe down TEAM RHYTHM to take the win. In 2, 3.

581
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,068
- Hello. This is TEAM BEAT's bench. - Hello. This is TEAM BEAT's bench.

582
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,239
(Koo Han Seo, Ji Hun)

583
00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:59,169
(That was nice.)

584
00:25:59,608 --> 00:26:00,808
- We won. - We won.

585
00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:04,379
Tell us about TEAM RHYTHM's new song.

586
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,048
- Please introduce it to us, JL. - Right.

587
00:26:07,479 --> 00:26:09,348
It's a song that suits...

588
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:10,919
TEAM RHYTHM's signature color, red.

589
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:14,419
It's called "IGNITION." It means to set something on fire.

590
00:26:14,588 --> 00:26:18,058
We will try to set your hearts on fire today.

591
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:22,159
His Korean got even better.

592
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,258
- Thank you. - It's great.

593
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:27,298
TEAM BEAT's bench, how are you going to intercept this song?

594
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,498
TEAM RHYTHM's representative color is red,

595
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:34,669
and TEAM BEAT's representative color is blue.

596
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,108
To turn off a fire,

597
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:39,379
you need water to cover it.

598
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:42,619
We will make sure to cover...

599
00:26:42,619 --> 00:26:43,879
TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.

600
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:46,348
(We will make sure to cover TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.)

601
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:48,248
- Nice! - Nice!

602
00:26:48,248 --> 00:26:50,659
(That was a nice line.)

603
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,229
- Gosh. - TEAM BEAT is a bit spicy today.

604
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:54,528
No!

605
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:58,768
Great. Who will become the winner in the battle of fire and water?

606
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:01,229
I'm excited to find out.

607
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:04,869
TEAM BEAT's bench can return to the team seat.

608
00:27:05,108 --> 00:27:06,909
Let's go!

609
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:10,379
(TEAM BEAT's bench will watch from the team seat.)

610
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,538
I feel so nervous.

611
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:16,719
Chih En, you were in TEAM BEAT in the previous round.

612
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:18,248
- Right? - Yes.

613
00:27:18,518 --> 00:27:20,788
Chih En doesn't look sad.

614
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:23,889
(Laughing)

615
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:25,258
What are you doing there, Chih En?

616
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:30,058
How were the two teams different after practicing with them?

617
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:34,268
First of all, they were different when having me and not having me.

618
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,169
TEAM RHYTHM was definitely a team of all-rounders.

619
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:44,209
The members memorized the song and choreography really quickly.

620
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:48,679
I wanted to survive among these really talented members,

621
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,548
so I prepared a special weapon for today.

622
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:55,288
Please be excited about it.

623
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:56,288
Yes, sir.

624
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,858
(What is Chih En's special weapon?)

625
00:27:59,229 --> 00:28:02,528
We decided the team we are going to go against.

626
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:05,169
How do you all feel about TEAM BEAT's bench?

627
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:06,229
(How do you all feel about TEAM BEAT's bench?)

628
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:09,598
(Smiling)

629
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:12,608
I think we can win if we aren't careless.

630
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,439
- Right. - Okay.

631
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,639
Hyo Tae came in front of us.

632
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:19,048
But did you see him? As he was holding it up,

633
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:21,108
his hand was shaking.

634
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:25,489
(He tried to bravely provoke them.)

635
00:28:25,818 --> 00:28:27,719
(Shaking)

636
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,818
Listen to the song sung in our voices.

637
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,028
(Throwing)

638
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:34,429
(Taking it back)

639
00:28:35,998 --> 00:28:38,669
(Finding it ridiculous)

640
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:41,669
- But I feel confident. - Right.

641
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:44,338
Our team can win!

642
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:45,639
Right!

643
00:28:46,338 --> 00:28:48,979
This team has Park Ju Won.

644
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,639
(Our team has Park Ju Won.)

645
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:53,278
Gosh, no.

646
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,449
Our MVP. Right.

647
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:56,818
(Our MVP)

648
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:03,889
(He showed a good performance during Round 1.)

649
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:05,018
It's Park Ju Won.

650
00:29:05,189 --> 00:29:08,798
(He was chosen as the MVP of TEAM RHYTHM.)

651
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:11,298
It's Park Ju Won. Congratulations.

652
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:16,098
(He placed 1st with 287 votes out of 300.)

653
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:19,068
Ju Won is in our team,

654
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:22,879
and the starting lineup has more talented players.

655
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:25,808
I'm 100 percent confident about taking the win.

656
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,709
Even when seen objectively,

657
00:29:27,709 --> 00:29:30,679
I think that our team is very strong.

658
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:34,119
Right. Like this.

659
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,758
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup is confident even before practice.)

660
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:37,689
- I thought... - Us!

661
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,129
(Just rolling his eyes)

662
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:41,758
(Looking)

663
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:45,768
Chih En, you were in TEAM BEAT, right?

664
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:47,469
- Right. - Yes.

665
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,869
(Feeling awkward)

666
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:53,268
(Chih En performed in TEAM BEAT's starting lineup in Round 1.)

667
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,209
(Blue suits you the best, Chih En.)

668
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:59,308
(We all look great in blue.)

669
00:30:00,078 --> 00:30:01,209
(Full of love)

670
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,818
(His peaceful time with the players of TEAM BEAT didn't last long.)

671
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:05,449
The member we will scout...

672
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:08,719
(Chih En got nominated by TEAM RHYTHM.)

673
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:15,358
(Puzzled)

674
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:16,429
What do we do?

675
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:18,729
(Don't leave us!)

676
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:21,229
(He leaves the members of TEAM BEAT whom he got close to...)

677
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:27,239
(and joins TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.)

678
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:30,679
How should I put it?

679
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:35,649
I still don't feel close to them.

680
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:39,248
There were players I haven't worked with.

681
00:30:39,248 --> 00:30:40,619
(He needs to work on adjusting on the 1st day.)

682
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:44,558
We didn't manage to take 1st place in Round 1.

683
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,028
Let's make sure to take first place this time!

684
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:49,229
- Let's go! - Let's go!

685
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:50,328
Let's go and take first place!

686
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:52,268
- Let's go! - Let's go!

687
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:55,838
(They practice for the video...)

688
00:30:55,838 --> 00:31:00,909
(they will send to the directors two days later.)

689
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:04,679
(Working hard)

690
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:09,018
(The two days of practice go by.)

691
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,018
Then...

692
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,288
- this time, I'll go first. - Yes!

693
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:19,828
I'll get my name tag.

694
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:20,889
Let's go!

695
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,328
- Okay. - Let's go.

696
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:26,328
(Steven is filmed first.)

697
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:29,939
(They do well with the filming, just as usual.)

698
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,469
(Doing well as practiced)

699
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:36,078
It was my first time doing this.

700
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:40,048
TEAM BEAT didn't have anything like this.

701
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,649
I wasn't sure what to do.

702
00:31:43,219 --> 00:31:45,248
- Are you ready, Chih En? - Yes.

703
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:47,149
Okay. Let's go.

704
00:31:47,149 --> 00:31:48,219
Let's go.

705
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:49,758
- Let's go! - Let's go!

706
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:51,719
- Good luck! - What do I do?

707
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:54,328
Chih En from BEAT!

708
00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:57,998
Now RHYTHM! Let's go!

709
00:31:57,998 --> 00:31:59,068
(Feeling awkward)

710
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:01,399
It's my first time with this sort of system.

711
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:03,298
You can do it!

712
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:06,239
(You can do well, Chih En!)

713
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:09,209
(He starts singing after overcoming the awkwardness.)

714
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:12,048
(Feeling nervous)

715
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:15,008
(Working hard)

716
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,048
(It was awkward, but he managed to finish his part.)

717
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:19,288
Thank you.

718
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,189
Nice! Great!

719
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:25,558
(You did well.)

720
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:27,229
(He finally feels relieved.)

721
00:32:27,758 --> 00:32:28,929
Raise your hand...

722
00:32:28,929 --> 00:32:31,459
if you weren't satisfied or want another chance. Anyone?

723
00:32:31,858 --> 00:32:33,028
- Next. - Me!

724
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:34,298
- Let's go, Ju Won. - Okay.

725
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:35,969
Let's do this.

726
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:37,038
(He did well earlier.)

727
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,338
I want to show the choreography that I prepared.

728
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,669
- Okay. - Okay.

729
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:43,838
(Even the choreography?)

730
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:47,048
- I also prepared the choreography. - Okay!

731
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:48,308
Nice!

732
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:52,288
(In two days, the choreography...)

733
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:58,219
(and facial expressions were prepared.)

734
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:03,429
(Steven gets it done perfectly as well.)

735
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:05,629
This team definitely felt different.

736
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,729
They memorized the song really quickly...

737
00:33:07,729 --> 00:33:09,139
and in just a short amount of time.

738
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:12,869
It wasn't just the choreography they prepared. The lip-syncing...

739
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:16,808
and facial expressions were perfectly prepared as well.

740
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:19,348
I watched them with my mouth wide open.

741
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:20,879
Yes!

742
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:23,348
You all did a great job in the last two days.

743
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,949
What do we do if all of you are this good?

744
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,489
You all did great.

745
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:30,258
- Thank you. - Thank you.

746
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,288
(What do I do? Can I do well?)

747
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:32,729
(Glancing)

748
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:38,129
(Approaching)

749
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:42,669
(Zhang Shuaibo approaches him and starts talking to him first.)

750
00:33:45,268 --> 00:33:50,778
(They also practice together in the practice room.)

751
00:33:52,308 --> 00:33:56,479
Zhang Shuaibo came to me and talked to me first.

752
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,649
We got close really quickly,

753
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:02,018
and he helped me with all of the details of the choreography,

754
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:04,858
so I felt really grateful.

755
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:11,228
- Power, you know? - Right.

756
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:13,528
Great!

757
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:15,969
After joining TEAM RHYTHM,

758
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:19,668
everyone took great care of me.

759
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:25,239
(They checked how they looked as well.)

760
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:30,048
(How Zhang Shuaibo and Chih En spend their break time)

761
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:35,559
They already feel like...

762
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:38,188
family members to me.

763
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:41,128
I think we can win with this teamwork.

764
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,559
Ju Won and JL know the choreography.

765
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:47,199
(Please step forward, choreographers.)

766
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,568
- Boom! - Toom!

767
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:54,338
Boom and stomp.

768
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:55,878
(Teacher Ju Won and Teacher JL's dance lesson with imitative words)

769
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:58,909
And when you do this part, it should be sticky.

770
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:00,508
(Singing the beat)

771
00:35:00,508 --> 00:35:01,548
(Singing the beat)

772
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:03,048
(Stomping)

773
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:04,048
(Blowing)

774
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:08,289
(Ju Won and JL have similar teaching methods too.)

775
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:09,688
Why are we so good?

776
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:11,688
(The dance practice went smoothly.)

777
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:12,758
Okay.

778
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,659
(Steven is practicing on his own during the break.)

779
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:18,499
I will be doing...

780
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:21,168
the intro and first rap verse.

781
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:25,869
(The intense intro that will start off "IGNITION,")

782
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:31,278
(and the first rap verse that will catch everyone's attention)

783
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:35,648
Our team and the song's color and vibes...

784
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:37,648
must be shown in the intro.

785
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:40,789
I felt quite a lot of pressure because of that.

786
00:35:42,318 --> 00:35:46,659
(During the interim check of Round 1,)

787
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:48,628
Like you've changed

788
00:35:49,499 --> 00:35:53,128
(His voice cracked as he felt nervous.)

789
00:35:56,539 --> 00:35:59,469
(He even made mistakes during the choreography check.)

790
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:04,978
(However, he showed a perfect performance onstage.)

791
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:06,749
(How was your first time seeing them?)

792
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:09,079
(JL and Steven did really well.)

793
00:36:09,778 --> 00:36:12,889
(Steven wasn't a great dancer like this before.)

794
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,818
(Steven's efforts were acknowledged.)

795
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:20,028
What I learned from Round One...

796
00:36:20,188 --> 00:36:22,559
was that hard work never betrays you.

797
00:36:24,858 --> 00:36:26,898
I will, once again, work harder than anyone else...

798
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:31,099
and light up the stage with TEAM RHYTHM's color.

799
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:33,608
- Get fired up, already toasted - Get fired up, already toasted

800
00:36:35,168 --> 00:36:36,539
(Oh, my.)

801
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:40,449
(Why are you so good?)

802
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:47,588
(After lots of practice, TEAM RHYTHM is ready to win.)

803
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:49,818
(During their final spurt of practice)

804
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:52,159
- Hello. - Hello.

805
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,258
- Hello! - Hello!

806
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:55,758
- Hello. - Hello.

807
00:36:55,858 --> 00:36:56,858
Hello.

808
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,199
- Long time no see. - Long time no see!

809
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,199
Have you been well?

810
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,528
- Yes! - Yes, we've been well.

811
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:04,139
(What a surprise.)

812
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,539
Did you practice a lot?

813
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:07,108
- Yes. - Yes, we practiced hard.

814
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,139
Let's see what you've practiced.

815
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:12,579
- Okay. - Okay.

816
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:24,318
Get fired up, already toasted

817
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:27,728
Starting my play

818
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,559
Hey, want to give it a shot

819
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:32,798
Do or die

820
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:35,369
Can you feel the fire?

821
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:37,969
(What?)

822
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:43,778
Can you feel the fire?

823
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,309
(Oh, my.)

824
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:50,148
(Clapping)

825
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:51,978
- Thank you. - Thank you.

826
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,088
Thank you.

827
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:55,548
Oh, my. You practiced a lot.

828
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,258
- What? - Shuaibo improved a lot.

829
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:02,228
- His singing. - His singing and dancing.

830
00:38:02,898 --> 00:38:03,898
- Everything. - He really improved a lot.

831
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:04,898
Thank you.

832
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:07,699
- Good job. - But...

833
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,369
Your facial expressions...

834
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:11,568
Out of the parts I have...

835
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,608
The part you do with Steven?

836
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:16,438
Yes, I changed the choreography for that part.

837
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:19,309
- I see. - The new moves...

838
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:20,608
(Zhang Shuaibo)

839
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:25,949
(Zhang Shuaibo only had to walk up to the center.)

840
00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:32,429
Since I didn't have a lot of parts in this song...

841
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:37,028
(In Round 1, he surprised everyone with his rose performance.)

842
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,568
Like the rose in "Give Me That,"

843
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:42,329
I thought I needed to do something that would be impactful.

844
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,269
(Like this?)

845
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:48,269
I'm confident about facial expressions.

846
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:50,778
I prepared a pair choreography with Steven.

847
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:53,579
(He worked hard to create this part with Steven.)

848
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:55,449
Would it be okay...

849
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:59,548
if I kept the new choreography?

850
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:01,519
Or should we do the original one?

851
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,088
- That was nice. - That was really nice.

852
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,389
Steven.

853
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:08,059
- You should act along with him. - Okay.

854
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:11,228
- And actually grab him. - Okay.

855
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,228
If you're too much like this,

856
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,099
we can't see you.

857
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,409
So I think it'd be better for you to overlap like this.

858
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:21,969
(Feedback received.)

859
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:25,139
I feel like the team atmosphere has gotten better.

860
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,949
You seem even more comfortable with each other than before.

861
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:32,019
Yes, you're right. Back then, we were a bit...

862
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:33,318
(They were awkward around each other then.)

863
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,519
You can do it.

864
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:35,588
Thank you.

865
00:39:35,588 --> 00:39:36,918
- Thank you! - Thank you!

866
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,489
We have a good system in place.

867
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:41,958
The atmosphere when we practice is so nice.

868
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:44,898
We progressed through things very smoothly.

869
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:47,528
So I think we'll be able to get first place.

870
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:52,708
Together, I think we make the strongest team.

871
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:58,639
Okay. TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup, the owners of "IGNITION,"

872
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,849
will perform first.

873
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:03,219
TEAM RHYTHM. Are you ready?

874
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:05,778
(Scream!)

875
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:07,249
- Let's go! - Go! Let's go!

876
00:40:07,249 --> 00:40:09,188
- Let's go! - Let's go, Zhang Shuaibo!

877
00:40:09,188 --> 00:40:11,489
- Our goal is to get first place, - Let's go!

878
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:13,688
- which we didn't get last time. - Let's go!

879
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:17,199
I'm sure we'll get first place.

880
00:40:18,699 --> 00:40:20,728
- I'm curious. - Let's go.

881
00:40:21,499 --> 00:40:22,838
I have never seen it.

882
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,068
Right. I haven't seen it either.

883
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,208
(Nervous)

884
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:31,008
Ready? Go.

885
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,799
Let's go, Steven.

886
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,469
("IGNITION" by Chih En, Daisuke, Hiroto,)

887
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:39,730
(JL, Park Ju Won, Steven, Zhang Shuaibo)

888
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:13,130
(Oh, my.)

889
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:23,279
(Great facial expressions!)

890
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:25,250
JL really does look more relaxed than the others.

891
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,730
(Dumbfounded by how good they are)

892
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,739
Oh, nice.

893
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:08,520
(There we go!)

894
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,290
They looked at each other just now.

895
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,569
- What was that? - That was bold.

896
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:24,569
(That was their secret weapon?)

897
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
What?

898
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,049
Can't they just be a team already?

899
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,449
They're enjoying the performance.

900
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:40,339
(An amazing performance by TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup)

901
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:42,109
- Yes! - Yes.

902
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:43,210
(Going crazy)

903
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,480
- Oh, my gosh! - That was so good.

904
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:48,080
Didn't they do much better than they did during rehearsal?

905
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
- Yes. - Yes.

906
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,679
It had an impact. I like it.

907
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,920
- They were born to be idols. - Seriously.

908
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:55,719
They're so good at making facial expressions.

909
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,560
They ripped it up.

910
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:58,960
(Acknowledging their talent)

911
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,630
Is this "IGNITION?" They burned it up.

912
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,859
- Seriously. - They burned it up.

913
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:02,859
Oh, that's hot!

914
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:05,270
Is it possible to beat that?

915
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,900
What was that?

916
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,239
JL...

917
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:12,339
Right. JL is so good.

918
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:14,580
- I didn't think it'd be this good. - Seriously.

919
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,310
(Nervously biting his lips)

920
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,909
It's okay. We have Jiang Fan.

921
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,250
Our dance break is cooler...

922
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:32,089
(We'll be okay, right?)

923
00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:33,859
(We can do it!)

924
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:35,630
(Anxious)

925
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,830
All right.

926
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:39,830
A round of applause for TEAM RHYTHM!

927
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:44,239
Players, please head to your seats.

928
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,870
- Good job! - Good job!

929
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,109
(Stepping down from the stage with the fans' passionate cheer)

930
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:50,210
Thank you.

931
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,250
I think I gave it my all...

932
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:01,389
for this performance.

933
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,359
I think we did well. I think we gave a good performance.

934
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,029
I'm so happy that I did well...

935
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:09,960
without making any mistakes.

936
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,069
Okay. We will now watch TEAM BEAT's bench...

937
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:17,600
and their attempt to intercept TEAM RHYTHM's song!

938
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,980
- Let's go! - BEAT!

939
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,509
- Jiang Fan! - TEAM BEAT, let's go!

940
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:28,719
(Ju Won)

941
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:34,690
(TEAM BEAT's bench players are sporting a military look.)

942
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,889
(So cute.)

943
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,659
You can do it, guys.

944
00:46:42,029 --> 00:46:43,730
- Let's go. - It's okay.

945
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,900
Don't be scared.

946
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,500
TEAM BEAT...

947
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,940
has many yellow cards.

948
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:55,540
I think they'll work crazily hard this time.

949
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,719
(They expect TEAM BEAT's bench to be very determined.)

950
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,549
Please tell us how you feel, TEAM BEAT's bench.

951
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,690
I think it's an unfair fight to have starting players...

952
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:12,359
and bench players compete with the same song.

953
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,199
But as you can see from watching sports,

954
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,799
teams can come up from behind and win. So...

955
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:19,870
(I like his spirit.)

956
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:20,870
(Koo Han Seo)

957
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:26,270
(A provocative comment from TEAM BEAT's bench)

958
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,839
We'll make you forget the performance you just saw.

959
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,350
(Go, Dong Yun!)

960
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,420
- You can do it! - Let's go.

961
00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:37,790
Let's go!

962
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:43,960
Being an underdog means you have a lower chance of winning.

963
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:49,929
(Underdog: A dog pushed into a corner)

964
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:54,699
Well... I thought it was really unfair.

965
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,469
(This team's yellow cards especially stand out.)

966
00:48:00,009 --> 00:48:02,239
(A whopping 6 out of 7 members received yellow cards.)

967
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:03,339
I think I was too lax...

968
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:07,350
when I was in the starting lineup.

969
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,719
(Three of them came down from the starting lineup.)

970
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,589
(Jiang Fan, Kim Dong Yun, and Park Ji Hun...)

971
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:16,190
(performed together as TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.)

972
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,130
It felt like I ruined everything.

973
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,460
(He was not diligent while practicing for Round 1.)

974
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,600
I was lacking passion.

975
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,139
(It's 5, 6, 7, 8, then 1...)

976
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,409
(After the rhythm issue...)

977
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,139
(Can you give me just 2 minutes?)

978
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:37,850
(Because he didn't practice enough,)

979
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,679
(Ji Hun even made a mistake onstage.)

980
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:46,350
(RHYTHM: 2,257 points, GROOVE: 2,353 points, BEAT: 1,945 points)

981
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:51,259
(TEAM BEAT got 3rd place with a 408-vote difference.)

982
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:55,060
I was very regretful and in despair.

983
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,630
The 11th place, Jiang Fan.

984
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,339
The 12th place, Kim Dong Yun.

985
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:04,909
The 14th place is player Park Ji Hun.

986
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:07,440
I thought...

987
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,839
I should really get it together.

988
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,080
(TEAM BEAT's bench also has players released from other teams.)

989
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,089
To be honest,

990
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:20,120
we don't have anything to lose.

991
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:22,859
So we should just work really hard...

992
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,630
and beat whatever team...

993
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,859
we go up against, right?

994
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,199
(Burning with passion)

995
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,770
I trust myself.

996
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,830
In the next round,

997
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,400
I'm going to take the yellow card off.

998
00:49:36,299 --> 00:49:38,239
I really don't like this guy.

999
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,270
It keeps falling off.

1000
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:43,009
I really don't like this guy. I'm going to take it off soon.

1001
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:45,380
I really don't like this guy.

1002
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,020
(This player's energy is definitely extraordinary.)

1003
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,949
(Kim Dong Yun was different, even at the audition.)

1004
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,150
(A baseball bat?)

1005
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:53,690
I'll show you a kick.

1006
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,089
(Determined)

1007
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:02,799
(A serious attitude and a not-so-serious body...)

1008
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,130
(Embarrassed)

1009
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,199
I'll do my best.

1010
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:07,199
(Kim Dong Yun is positive, even after making a mistake.)

1011
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:08,199
Good job.

1012
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,670
(Even when everyone was nervous during the draft)

1013
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,980
You can do it.

1014
00:50:16,009 --> 00:50:17,009
You can do it.

1015
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:19,409
We can do it.

1016
00:50:20,009 --> 00:50:22,980
(Positive Dong Yun always smiles, even when covered in sweat.)

1017
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,389
This keeps falling off. It doesn't get along with me.

1018
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,219
I really need to take it off soon.

1019
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,290
(Pressing it on again)

1020
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,359
(What a cute guy.)

1021
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,029
It would be upsetting...

1022
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:36,659
to get yellow cards again from this performance.

1023
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,469
And we will get eliminated, so...

1024
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,730
No going back home.

1025
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:43,199
We don't have a choice. We can only win.

1026
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:47,139
The truth is that we're competing against TEAM RHYTHM.

1027
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:49,210
What should we do?

1028
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:52,080
(What should we do to beat them?)

1029
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:57,319
(Hold on!)

1030
00:50:57,319 --> 00:50:59,020
We have Royce from TEAM RHYTHM.

1031
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,389
The other team.

1032
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,560
When you were on TEAM RHYTHM,

1033
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,859
did you notice any weaknesses or strengths?

1034
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:07,489
(Curious)

1035
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:09,560
(Focused)

1036
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:12,469
(TEAM RHYTHM's weakness...)

1037
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,870
I was their only weakness.

1038
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,100
- What? - No!

1039
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:18,609
No!

1040
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:23,080
(TEAM RHYTHM's only weakness is here.)

1041
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:24,880
No.

1042
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,009
I'm joking.

1043
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:29,219
I think their good dancer is Park Ju Won.

1044
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,350
And JL.

1045
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,049
Their expression is their strength.

1046
00:51:35,319 --> 00:51:37,420
Their facial expressions are so nice.

1047
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:39,929
(They're good at dancing?)

1048
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:42,529
We have a lot of good dancers.

1049
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,600
So, in terms of choreography,

1050
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,799
I think we could dominate.

1051
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:49,170
(TEAM RHYTHM's strength is dancing, but we're not bad either.)

1052
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,940
We have the dancing machine, Jiang Fan.

1053
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:57,080
(He dominates every performance with his flashy moves.)

1054
00:51:57,339 --> 00:51:58,350
Who is he?

1055
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,009
(It's me, Jiang Fan.)

1056
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:08,259
(Jiang Fan is in charge of TEAM BEAT's dance breaks.)

1057
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,020
Leave it up to me.

1058
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,460
Of course.

1059
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,130
(Our team has Jiang Fan!)

1060
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,529
- Just do it! - Let's go.

1061
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,170
Anyway, we need to beat all of TEAM RHYTHM's players.

1062
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:21,569
We really have to this time. Let's go up together.

1063
00:52:21,569 --> 00:52:23,199
- Let's all go up together. - Let's go up together.

1064
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:25,670
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1065
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,940
I think it was the result of my actions.

1066
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,609
I plan to do this with a different mindset.

1067
00:52:33,009 --> 00:52:34,580
(Full of passion)

1068
00:52:34,949 --> 00:52:35,949
Go.

1069
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:40,150
(Practicing each move under Jiang Fan's lead)

1070
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:41,190
And...

1071
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:42,819
more power.

1072
00:52:43,219 --> 00:52:44,290
And this.

1073
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:46,359
(Something is missing...)

1074
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:49,859
(Jiang Fan checks the choreography video again.)

1075
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:52,529
I think we could make the dance break...

1076
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:57,040
and the ending part a bit cooler.

1077
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:02,739
(That night)

1078
00:53:02,739 --> 00:53:04,339
I think we need...

1079
00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:07,449
- one last powerful blow. - Totally.

1080
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:08,880
Maybe something performance-wise.

1081
00:53:09,449 --> 00:53:11,420
If we can add something of our own,

1082
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:14,190
we could understand the feeling of the performance...

1083
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,989
- and do even better. - Right.

1084
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,730
We could use a flag...

1085
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,659
and do something really big and impactful.

1086
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,230
Something like that could be nice.

1087
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:26,469
- Take these and burn them up. - Fire?

1088
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,569
That could be nice to do onstage.

1089
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,770
- TEAM BEAT is blue, right? - Right.

1090
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,040
We could use handkerchiefs with our team slogan on it...

1091
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,679
and make people remember we're the blue TEAM BEAT.

1092
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:39,380
- Emphasize that one more time. - Emphasize it. Right.

1093
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,310
How about we dance using the slogan,

1094
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,380
and then throw them for the ending?

1095
00:53:43,949 --> 00:53:46,620
Then people could feel, "That ending is so cool."

1096
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,190
I really like that idea.

1097
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,589
So I'd like those ideas...

1098
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:52,830
to be reflected in our choreography.

1099
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:54,759
Something big for the ending.

1100
00:53:54,759 --> 00:53:57,500
Or we could link our handkerchiefs, and then untie them.

1101
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,969
We plan to face them...

1102
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,299
with a more impactful performance.

1103
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,739
I want to make a cool performance...

1104
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:07,639
that many people remember.

1105
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:14,609
(Someone has come to TEAM BEAT's practice room.)

1106
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:17,819
(A surprise visit from TEAM RHYTHM's directors)

1107
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,719
- Hello! - Hello.

1108
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:23,520
(What's going on?)

1109
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,330
We came to watch a little.

1110
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:28,460
- Okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

1111
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,060
We watched a bit from outside.

1112
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,069
Don't feel too much pressure. Just enjoy yourselves.

1113
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:34,230
- Okay. - Okay.

1114
00:54:40,909 --> 00:54:42,909
(Let's go, TEAM BEAT.)

1115
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,609
As I want, go up 1 by 1, stack it

1116
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,080
It's too late to catch up to my level

1117
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:51,690
So you can just watch me from now

1118
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,819
(Exploding with energy)

1119
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,960
It will ring in your ear, this sound

1120
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,489
(3 seconds before the secret weapon part)

1121
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:03,859
Can you feel the fire?

1122
00:55:03,859 --> 00:55:06,500
(Surprised)

1123
00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:12,909
(Impressed)

1124
00:55:13,509 --> 00:55:15,639
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1125
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,080
Our team...

1126
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,279
- should be worried. - Tell me about it.

1127
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:23,179
- No way. That left an impact. - Thank you.

1128
00:55:23,179 --> 00:55:24,920
Royce, you've improved a lot.

1129
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:27,489
Thank you.

1130
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:29,219
The bench did better than I thought.

1131
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:30,759
If our team doesn't step up,

1132
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:33,589
they might lose this song to TEAM BEAT.

1133
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:40,000
The underdog is a team that has a low chance of winning.

1134
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
(Underdog: A dog pushed into a corner)

1135
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,469
But if we beat TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup,

1136
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:44,540
that will be an upset.

1137
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,139
(Upset: The favorite losing to an underdog)

1138
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:50,239
You never know what'll happen until one is declared the winner.

1139
00:55:51,509 --> 00:55:54,150
(What will be the fate of the underdogs?)

1140
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,219
Can TEAM BEAT's bench...

1141
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,690
go from underdog to top dog?

1142
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:02,020
Are you ready?

1143
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:03,620
(Kim Dong Yun)

1144
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,060
(Ji Hun)

1145
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:06,359
Let's do this.

1146
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,529
- Their slogan is cool. - I know.

1147
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:10,560
- It's the kick of this performance. - Exactly.

1148
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,429
- It'll leave an impact. - Here we go.

1149
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,529
- Get ready to dance. - I heard that Jiang Fan...

1150
00:56:14,529 --> 00:56:15,799
was the one to look out for.

1151
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:16,870
- Really? - Yes.

1152
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:18,810
How well will they do?

1153
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,409
(Koo Han Seo)

1154
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:25,009
We have nothing more to lose.

1155
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:28,650
There's no one to bring down the level of passion...

1156
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:29,949
we currently have.

1157
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:32,920
We'll show you why you should fear the underdog.

1158
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:37,960
I'm super nervous.

1159
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,960
Ready?

1160
00:56:39,489 --> 00:56:40,489
Go.

1161
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:48,940
("IGNITION" by Jiang Fan, Kang Jun Hyuk, Kim Dong Yun,)

1162
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,069
(Kim Hyo Tae, Li Zhiwei, Park Ji Hun, Royce)

1163
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,449
Nice.

1164
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:11,929
They said they were like water earlier.

1165
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,589
- The performance is smooth. - I agree.

1166
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:21,199
Nice. Look at that.

1167
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:29,839
He has such a great voice.

1168
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:34,949
Jiang Fan did amazingly.

1169
00:58:00,139 --> 00:58:01,170
(Ji Hun, Make a heart.)

1170
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,589
- Yes! - Go, Jiang Fan!

1171
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:18,790
Jiang Fan!

1172
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,270
He's so good.

1173
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:30,670
- Nice. - All right!

1174
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:32,009
Check Li Zhiwei out.

1175
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,310
Li Zhiwei's rocking it.

1176
00:58:53,859 --> 00:58:55,659
He's killing it.

1177
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,000
Look at him dance.

1178
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,429
He has great facial expressions too.

1179
00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:18,850
Goodness.

1180
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:22,659
Let's go.

1181
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,359
Look at Jiang Fan.

1182
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,900
Gosh, he's really good.

1183
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:38,670
Hyo Tae, go for it.

1184
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:52,319
Let's go!

1185
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:58,219
(Their secret weapon, the slogan dance)

1186
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,290
(In awe)

1187
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,029
He's incredible.

1188
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:17,710
Nice.

1189
01:00:18,509 --> 01:00:19,580
They nailed it.

1190
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:21,750
- That was great. - They were amazing.

1191
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,819
They put forth their best performance,

1192
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:26,219
considering their situation.

1193
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:30,219
(Seriously?)

1194
01:00:35,659 --> 01:00:37,730
- I still think... - Good job, TEAM BEAT.

1195
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:39,630
- we did better. - Thank you.

1196
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,940
After watching them perform, we knew we'd win.

1197
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:46,440
I was confident.

1198
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:48,880
(Smirking)

1199
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,040
TEAM BEAT's bench did a good job,

1200
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,380
but our performance was definitely better.

1201
01:00:55,009 --> 01:00:57,819
- Our team was more... - Exactly.

1202
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:59,489
dynamic.

1203
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,690
- Our performance was clean. - Right.

1204
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:04,319
(You're right!)

1205
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,230
We saw the performance of "IGNITION" from both teams.

1206
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:10,230
TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup will also join me onstage.

1207
01:01:11,159 --> 01:01:13,130
Kim Dong Yun, you did great!

1208
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:17,670
(It's time to see who will win the right to "IGNITION.")

1209
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:23,509
The bench members had to intercept...

1210
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:26,679
an opponent's new song while the starting lineup...

1211
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:28,880
had to secure its right to the song.

1212
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,819
(First battle of the Intercept Round)

1213
01:01:30,819 --> 01:01:33,719
The winner of the Intercept Round...

1214
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:36,520
will be decided only by the votes...

1215
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,029
given to the teams by the audience.

1216
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:43,330
Out of the two teams that performed the same song,

1217
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:45,730
vote for the team you think did better.

1218
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:50,440
(The winning team will get to release the song!)

1219
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:52,909
The voting will begin.

1220
01:01:54,069 --> 01:01:56,909
(The 20-second countdown begins.)

1221
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:58,650
(The audience...)

1222
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:02,679
(will decide who gets to release the song!)

1223
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,719
What? No way!

1224
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:09,159
(The players charm the audience to secure the song for themselves.)

1225
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:11,359
(I will light a fire in your hearts!)

1226
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,429
(I love you, Daisuke!)

1227
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:16,529
(My gosh)

1228
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,170
- The ladies probably loved that. - That was adorable.

1229
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,330
I'd love to treat him to a meal.

1230
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,339
(Daisuke, the younger man you wish to treat to a meal)

1231
01:02:24,339 --> 01:02:25,339
(The winning move: Showing off his abs)

1232
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:26,670
(Making sure Chih En is decent)

1233
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,540
(No! Preserve Chih En's image!)

1234
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,179
(After showing off his abs, he makes hearts.)

1235
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:32,609
(Embarrassed)

1236
01:02:32,609 --> 01:02:34,179
(Chih En's adorable.)

1237
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:35,179
He's adorable.

1238
01:02:35,179 --> 01:02:37,779
Everyone, press the button of your choice.

1239
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:40,690
- Number 1. - Press Number 1.

1240
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,020
- Number Two. - Have you pressed it?

1241
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:46,560
Five, four, three...

1242
01:02:48,089 --> 01:02:49,630
Press the button. There isn't much time.

1243
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:51,429
Please. Please vote for us.

1244
01:02:51,429 --> 01:02:54,400
I'm begging you. Please vote for us.

1245
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,739
(Dropping)

1246
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:56,739
Dong Yun, come on.

1247
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,670
(Gosh, Dong Yun.)

1248
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,239
(The members of TEAM GROOVE laugh since it's not their business yet.)

1249
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,739
I love you.

1250
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:05,580
(I love you. Please vote for us.)

1251
01:03:06,009 --> 01:03:11,420
(Did their desperation sway the audience?)

1252
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,489
The voting is now over.

1253
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,790
Oh, no.

1254
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:20,190
Wouldn't TEAM RHYTHM win, considering their momentum?

1255
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:23,730
I think TEAM BEAT came ready.

1256
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:24,759
- Right. - Right.

1257
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:27,730
(The first battle is difficult to predict.)

1258
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,500
The match result will now be revealed.

1259
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,500
Gosh.

1260
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:36,310
(Extremely nervous)

1261
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:39,009
Out of all of them, Jiang Fan was the best dancer.

1262
01:03:39,009 --> 01:03:40,310
- He outclassed them. - Right.

1263
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,679
I believe we'll be able to secure "IGNITION."

1264
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,150
It'll be released by TEAM RHYTHM.

1265
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,250
- Right. - Of course.

1266
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,690
I feel like the seven of them have become a true team.

1267
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:50,690
(I feel like the 7 of them have become a true team.)

1268
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:55,630
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup...)

1269
01:03:55,630 --> 01:04:01,799
(presented a flawless group dance and a fierce performance.)

1270
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:04,170
(TEAM BEAT's bench members...)

1271
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,440
(came out strong as underdogs with their killer move.)

1272
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,810
(came out strong as underdogs with their killer move.)

1273
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:15,480
Who will get to release "IGNITION" as their own?

1274
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,520
(Who will release "IGNITION?")

1275
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,190
The song was written for us,

1276
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,850
so who could possibly steal it?

1277
01:04:21,219 --> 01:04:24,359
There's no way we'll let them steal "IGNITION."

1278
01:04:27,589 --> 01:04:31,960
The chemistry we presented onstage was way better...

1279
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,170
than how it was during practice.

1280
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:36,969
I'd love to steal "IGNITION" from them.

1281
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:40,239
This is too nerve-racking to watch.

1282
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:41,239
Oh, no.

1283
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,179
(Whoever wins Round 2 will get to release the new song.)

1284
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:49,319
Who will get to release "IGNITION" as their own?

1285
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,049
It's TEAM...

1286
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,719
(Will they secure it?)

1287
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:56,620
(Will they steal it?)

1288
01:04:56,881 --> 01:05:01,122
(Who won the first match?)

1289
01:05:01,237 --> 01:05:03,407
Who will get to release "IGNITION..."

1290
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:05,476
as their own?

1291
01:05:05,876 --> 01:05:07,836
(Will they secure it?)

1292
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:09,706
(Will they steal it?)

1293
01:05:10,646 --> 01:05:11,646
It's TEAM...

1294
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:15,416
(Who won the first match?)

1295
01:05:15,416 --> 01:05:17,246
It's TEAM RHYTHM. Congratulations.

1296
01:05:18,217 --> 01:05:19,217
Thank you!

1297
01:05:19,217 --> 01:05:20,786
(TEAM RHYTHM wins the first match.)

1298
01:05:20,786 --> 01:05:22,487
It's TEAM RHYTHM. Congratulations.

1299
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:26,697
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup was able to secure "IGNITION.")

1300
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:28,657
- Thank you! - Good job.

1301
01:05:29,027 --> 01:05:30,496
You did great!

1302
01:05:30,496 --> 01:05:32,367
(Over the moon)

1303
01:05:32,367 --> 01:05:36,306
(TEAM RHYTHM, congratulations.)

1304
01:05:36,737 --> 01:05:38,836
(We secured the song!)

1305
01:05:39,237 --> 01:05:40,976
(TEAM RHYTHM's directors and bench members...)

1306
01:05:40,976 --> 01:05:43,106
(show how thrilled they are.)

1307
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,106
RHYTHM!

1308
01:05:46,717 --> 01:05:49,387
(Sighing)

1309
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:51,786
- They did great, though. - Was there a huge difference?

1310
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:52,786
Their performance was amazing.

1311
01:05:52,786 --> 01:05:53,817
They lost, but they put up a fight.

1312
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:54,817
Right.

1313
01:05:55,927 --> 01:06:01,657
(TEAM BEAT suffers another defeat.)

1314
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:04,627
Guys, we also did great. We were amazing.

1315
01:06:05,537 --> 01:06:07,367
Good job, guys.

1316
01:06:08,636 --> 01:06:10,837
It's all right, guys.

1317
01:06:10,837 --> 01:06:11,837
(They don't have regrets,)

1318
01:06:11,837 --> 01:06:12,837
It's okay.

1319
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,976
(but they weren't able to defeat the starting lineup.)

1320
01:06:14,976 --> 01:06:16,407
- It's all right. - Thank you.

1321
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:18,447
- You did great. - Good job.

1322
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:19,817
(You did great!)

1323
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:21,646
I love you.

1324
01:06:22,287 --> 01:06:25,716
I was worried about joining a new team and disrupting...

1325
01:06:26,056 --> 01:06:27,216
their dynamic.

1326
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:32,157
Thanks to the help from my teammates,

1327
01:06:32,157 --> 01:06:33,856
we were able to secure our song.

1328
01:06:35,396 --> 01:06:37,966
Thank you, guys. I love you.

1329
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:41,197
- RHYTHM! - RHYTHM!

1330
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:42,806
- RHYTHM! - RHYTHM!

1331
01:06:42,806 --> 01:06:46,077
- RHYTHM! - We are the champions

1332
01:06:46,077 --> 01:06:48,476
- Good job. - That was great.

1333
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:49,777
Good job, Daisuke.

1334
01:06:49,777 --> 01:06:51,046
- You did great. - Nice job.

1335
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:55,377
(They know better than anyone how hard the starting lineup worked.)

1336
01:06:55,587 --> 01:06:58,487
It's all right. You did great.

1337
01:06:58,487 --> 01:06:59,487
Good job.

1338
01:06:59,487 --> 01:07:00,856
(Proud)

1339
01:07:01,186 --> 01:07:02,527
How was the performance?

1340
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:04,426
- Did you have fun? - Did you have fun performing?

1341
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:07,926
To be honest, it feels like a dream...

1342
01:07:07,926 --> 01:07:10,896
to have a song released in our voices.

1343
01:07:11,426 --> 01:07:14,396
Just like we have been doing so far,

1344
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:17,737
we only have to keep working hard as a team.

1345
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,006
Good job, TEAM RHYTHM.

1346
01:07:19,006 --> 01:07:22,907
(Look forward to their new song, "IGNITION.")

1347
01:07:22,907 --> 01:07:25,777
(TEAM GROOVE awaits to perform next.)

1348
01:07:25,777 --> 01:07:27,176
- Are we next? - Okay.

1349
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,476
- Okay. - We're ready.

1350
01:07:28,987 --> 01:07:31,046
- Bench, gather around. - Gather around.

1351
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,556
There's no other reason. Just bring it home.

1352
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:37,556
- Got it? - Sure.

1353
01:07:37,556 --> 01:07:38,926
- Got it. - Do as you have practiced.

1354
01:07:38,926 --> 01:07:39,957
- Sure. - Of course.

1355
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,056
One, two, three.

1356
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:42,367
- Go, team! - Go, team!

1357
01:07:42,367 --> 01:07:44,426
(Go, TEAM GROOVE.)

1358
01:07:44,726 --> 01:07:46,766
TEAM BEAT, lose your song to us.

1359
01:07:47,037 --> 01:07:48,096
That is your role today.

1360
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:52,106
(Meanwhile, silence fills TEAM BEAT's waiting room.)

1361
01:07:55,646 --> 01:07:59,646
I was deeply worried.

1362
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:01,917
(The starting lineup feels the pressure,)

1363
01:08:01,917 --> 01:08:04,346
(now that the bench members have lost their match.)

1364
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,686
If we lose our song, I'll get up and go home.

1365
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,327
I'll join you.

1366
01:08:09,327 --> 01:08:10,856
- Guys, warm up. - Warm up.

1367
01:08:12,186 --> 01:08:15,667
We don't have another choice but to win this match.

1368
01:08:16,266 --> 01:08:17,867
I was confident that we could win.

1369
01:08:18,926 --> 01:08:22,636
TEAM BEAT is the owner of this song, and we'll keep it that way.

1370
01:08:24,306 --> 01:08:26,676
Tear up the stage. Be confident.

1371
01:08:26,676 --> 01:08:27,676
- Good luck. - Thanks.

1372
01:08:27,676 --> 01:08:29,447
- Leave no regrets. - Got it.

1373
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:34,476
I'll do my best up there.

1374
01:08:34,476 --> 01:08:36,186
- Show them. Tear up the stage. - Got it.

1375
01:08:36,186 --> 01:08:37,346
(Reliable and dependable)

1376
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:38,417
We'll secure the song.

1377
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:42,186
Let us move on to the second match of the Intercept Round.

1378
01:08:42,317 --> 01:08:43,386
(Koo Han Seo)

1379
01:08:43,386 --> 01:08:46,327
The original owner of this song is TEAM BEAT.

1380
01:08:46,327 --> 01:08:47,327
Come on out.

1381
01:08:49,827 --> 01:08:51,697
Go, TEAM BEAT!

1382
01:08:55,436 --> 01:08:57,167
I was confident we could win,

1383
01:08:57,167 --> 01:08:58,306
and I wanted to show that to everyone.

1384
01:08:59,377 --> 01:09:01,806
TEAM GROOVE's bench won't be our competition.

1385
01:09:05,506 --> 01:09:08,747
(The young and fresh TEAM BEAT starting lineup enters.)

1386
01:09:08,747 --> 01:09:10,087
You're so pretty!

1387
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,046
(It's good to see you.)

1388
01:09:12,046 --> 01:09:15,216
- No way. - Are you kidding me?

1389
01:09:15,216 --> 01:09:16,226
Nam Do Yoon.

1390
01:09:17,556 --> 01:09:18,556
Kairi.

1391
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:22,096
Keum Jin Ho. Park Yeon Jun.

1392
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:24,796
An Yul. Yuito.

1393
01:09:25,567 --> 01:09:26,567
Cha Woong Ki.

1394
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,537
- Woong Ki's sparkling today. - He looks amazing.

1395
01:09:30,867 --> 01:09:32,237
Woong Ki.

1396
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,476
- He's so pretty. - How adorable.

1397
01:09:35,277 --> 01:09:37,377
(Be fond of us.)

1398
01:09:37,976 --> 01:09:40,417
Here's the team going up against TEAM BEAT.

1399
01:09:40,546 --> 01:09:42,277
(Nervous)

1400
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,447
A force to be reckoned with.

1401
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,657
Please welcome TEAM GROOVE's bench.

1402
01:09:46,657 --> 01:09:48,987
(Kwon Hee Jun)

1403
01:09:55,296 --> 01:09:58,027
We were blinded by our desperation to win.

1404
01:09:58,466 --> 01:10:01,737
I wanted to win no matter what.

1405
01:10:02,436 --> 01:10:04,207
We'll tear the starting lineup apart.

1406
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:07,377
(Looking formidable)

1407
01:10:07,377 --> 01:10:08,636
You look great!

1408
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:10,976
- Who dressed you like that? - Go, team!

1409
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,476
Jang Kyung Ho.

1410
01:10:13,716 --> 01:10:15,716
Kim Dae Yun. Zen Zen.

1411
01:10:16,117 --> 01:10:18,287
James. Kim Joo Hyoung.

1412
01:10:19,016 --> 01:10:20,087
He Junjin.

1413
01:10:20,856 --> 01:10:22,317
Koo Han Seo.

1414
01:10:23,226 --> 01:10:24,726
- Show them. - Nice.

1415
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:26,726
They're relaxed.

1416
01:10:26,726 --> 01:10:28,556
- Looking good, boys. - Let's go.

1417
01:10:28,856 --> 01:10:30,867
- This is a big one. - I know.

1418
01:10:31,197 --> 01:10:32,667
I can't tell which team will win.

1419
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:33,667
Exactly.

1420
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:39,737
(During the intense designation)

1421
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:42,877
(TEAM GROOVE's bench challenged TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.)

1422
01:10:50,016 --> 01:10:51,716
I was taken aback.

1423
01:10:52,087 --> 01:10:54,317
It hurt my pride a little,

1424
01:10:54,856 --> 01:10:56,756
and I wondered why he chose the team I was on.

1425
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:59,957
All you have to do...

1426
01:11:00,627 --> 01:11:02,867
is lose your song to us.

1427
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:05,096
If you are that talented,

1428
01:11:05,096 --> 01:11:06,936
why are we the ones in bright-colored uniforms?

1429
01:11:06,936 --> 01:11:09,936
(Why are we the ones in bright-colored uniforms?)

1430
01:11:09,936 --> 01:11:11,567
I wasn't that conscious of him.

1431
01:11:16,747 --> 01:11:19,947
(A war of nerves continues onstage.)

1432
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:23,317
(Walking on eggshells)

1433
01:11:23,317 --> 01:11:25,856
- Oh, dear. - What now?

1434
01:11:26,117 --> 01:11:28,487
Things are intense. Did something happen between them?

1435
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:31,527
We don't know the whole story, but...

1436
01:11:31,527 --> 01:11:34,027
- Was there a tense moment? - In a way, yes.

1437
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:35,966
Something's up with them.

1438
01:11:35,966 --> 01:11:38,667
How they look at each other is intense.

1439
01:11:39,266 --> 01:11:40,337
(Glancing)

1440
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,337
TEAM GROOVE!

1441
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:46,407
- TEAM GROOVE! Move over. - Move over.

1442
01:11:46,407 --> 01:11:48,806
- Beat, beat. - Beat, beat.

1443
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:49,806
(Flustered)

1444
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:50,806
In 2, 3.

1445
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,917
- Hi, we're TEAM BEAT's... - Hi, we're TEAM BEAT's...

1446
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,016
- starting lineup. - starting lineup.

1447
01:11:54,317 --> 01:11:57,516
(That was adorable.)

1448
01:11:58,016 --> 01:12:01,516
(The cute provocation by TEAM BEAT's starting lineup)

1449
01:12:02,657 --> 01:12:04,327
(They suddenly put on straight faces.)

1450
01:12:04,327 --> 01:12:05,386
In 2, 3.

1451
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:07,726
- Beat drop. It's time to groove. - Beat drop. It's time to groove.

1452
01:12:08,027 --> 01:12:09,027
- Hi. - TEAM...

1453
01:12:09,027 --> 01:12:12,936
- We're TEAM GROOVE's bench. - We're TEAM GROOVE's bench.

1454
01:12:12,936 --> 01:12:13,936
(Laughing)

1455
01:12:14,136 --> 01:12:16,606
(TEAM GROOVE's bench botched their introduction.)

1456
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,537
(Glancing)

1457
01:12:20,407 --> 01:12:21,877
To be honest, I was scared.

1458
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:25,947
The tension between those two was visible.

1459
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,417
I don't know how much they have prepared,

1460
01:12:31,417 --> 01:12:34,587
but we had to win no matter what.

1461
01:12:35,287 --> 01:12:36,327
No way.

1462
01:12:36,327 --> 01:12:39,726
(What happened between those two?)

1463
01:12:39,926 --> 01:12:42,726
Woong Ki, are you confident you can secure your song?

1464
01:12:43,796 --> 01:12:47,197
Me and the leader of TEAM GROOVE...

1465
01:12:49,167 --> 01:12:50,266
He's bringing it up.

1466
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:54,837
I used to be a member of a group called TO1,

1467
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,546
which I left.

1468
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:57,546
(Woong Ki and Kyung Ho were members of TO1.)

1469
01:12:57,546 --> 01:12:59,377
The group's songs never did well,

1470
01:12:59,377 --> 01:13:03,346
and I knew that since I wasn't blind.

1471
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:07,787
I guess I was always ready to go another way.

1472
01:13:07,787 --> 01:13:09,886
(Worried about his dim future, he left the group.)

1473
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:11,556
(After the group disbanded, they met again during the draft.)

1474
01:13:12,896 --> 01:13:16,726
(They didn't acknowledge one another.)

1475
01:13:18,096 --> 01:13:20,896
Do you know any of the players?

1476
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:25,306
I know one of them,

1477
01:13:26,476 --> 01:13:28,837
but I don't want to talk about him.

1478
01:13:28,976 --> 01:13:30,006
Let's say I don't know anyone here.

1479
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,877
(Let's say I don't know anyone here.)

1480
01:13:31,976 --> 01:13:33,947
Naturally, we...

1481
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:37,787
We're not exactly on bad terms,

1482
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:41,556
but I can't say I'm close to anyone here.

1483
01:13:41,957 --> 01:13:42,957
I don't even know his number.

1484
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:44,327
(After he left the group, the two naturally drifted apart.)

1485
01:13:44,327 --> 01:13:48,856
(They went from teammates to opponents.)

1486
01:13:48,856 --> 01:13:50,867
I will prove to you...

1487
01:13:50,867 --> 01:13:52,426
that I have improved since then.

1488
01:13:54,537 --> 01:13:55,697
It was cute.

1489
01:13:56,337 --> 01:13:59,476
I don't know what he has worked on, but I didn't mind taking a look.

1490
01:14:00,707 --> 01:14:01,737
Should our team go easy on you?

1491
01:14:02,077 --> 01:14:03,377
There's no need for that.

1492
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,676
(Surprised)

1493
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,417
I could sense their power play.

1494
01:14:09,417 --> 01:14:10,987
It got a bit scary at that moment.

1495
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:17,657
Will the starting lineup keep it, or will the bench intercept it?

1496
01:14:17,657 --> 01:14:20,296
Let's start the second Intercept Match.

1497
01:14:20,296 --> 01:14:21,497
(Who will own the new song?)

1498
01:14:21,497 --> 01:14:22,596
No.

1499
01:14:23,466 --> 01:14:24,527
They must not lose it.

1500
01:14:26,436 --> 01:14:28,436
- Bench players can win. - We can win!

1501
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:31,506
Bench players of TEAM GROOVE, please move to your team seats.

1502
01:14:33,676 --> 01:14:35,436
(You can do it.)

1503
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:39,577
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup will perform first.)

1504
01:14:39,577 --> 01:14:40,676
Do Yoon!

1505
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:42,377
(Nam Do Yoon)

1506
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:45,516
(TEAM GROOVE's bench players take their seats.)

1507
01:14:45,716 --> 01:14:47,157
The director...

1508
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:49,426
wrote this song with us in mind,

1509
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,127
so it suits us perfectly.

1510
01:14:52,386 --> 01:14:53,556
I'm confident that we won't lose.

1511
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:55,256
Good.

1512
01:14:57,027 --> 01:14:59,466
(TEAM BEAT: Starting lineup's practice room)

1513
01:14:59,766 --> 01:15:02,296
Did you predict which team...

1514
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:03,606
we would go up against?

1515
01:15:04,436 --> 01:15:06,237
- I predicted TEAM GROOVE. - Me too.

1516
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:09,176
They were constantly looking at us during their meeting.

1517
01:15:09,577 --> 01:15:11,277
Like this.

1518
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:13,676
They gave us a signal.

1519
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,917
(TEAM GROOVE, which aimed at TEAM BEAT, gave signals.)

1520
01:15:15,917 --> 01:15:18,747
- TEAM RHYTHM was looking at us too. - Yes.

1521
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:20,756
- Why were they staring at us? - Exactly.

1522
01:15:20,756 --> 01:15:22,957
Eito even pointed his finger at me.

1523
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:25,787
(Intercept.)

1524
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:30,127
(Everyone chose TEAM BEAT's starting lineup as the weakest.)

1525
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:31,667
Why are we so popular?

1526
01:15:32,497 --> 01:15:33,667
Do we look weak?

1527
01:15:34,396 --> 01:15:38,106
(Discouraged)

1528
01:15:38,407 --> 01:15:39,537
Are we really weak?

1529
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:43,207
They said, "All you can do is lose it."

1530
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:45,806
- Lose what? - The song.

1531
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:46,917
The third place?

1532
01:15:47,346 --> 01:15:48,617
(Reassured)

1533
01:15:48,617 --> 01:15:49,686
This is it!

1534
01:15:49,686 --> 01:15:52,016
(Woong Ki is the best!)

1535
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:54,186
- We can lose that. - Of course, we can.

1536
01:15:54,186 --> 01:15:55,657
- We can let go of the third place. - Let them have it.

1537
01:15:55,657 --> 01:15:56,787
(Relaxed)

1538
01:15:56,787 --> 01:15:58,356
I'm very confident about winning.

1539
01:15:59,327 --> 01:16:00,396
My heart is...

1540
01:16:01,327 --> 01:16:02,396
burning.

1541
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:04,067
I want to show them.

1542
01:16:06,237 --> 01:16:08,867
Anyhow, we're starting players, and they are bench players.

1543
01:16:09,436 --> 01:16:12,167
They already lost once.

1544
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,237
Right.

1545
01:16:15,006 --> 01:16:16,277
Let's show them the confidence of a winner.

1546
01:16:20,377 --> 01:16:21,377
So...

1547
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:24,817
let's talk about the current bench players of TEAM GROOVE.

1548
01:16:25,216 --> 01:16:27,516
Since they are our opponents.

1549
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:31,287
Is there anyone who was on the same team as them?

1550
01:16:33,726 --> 01:16:35,027
(Grinning)

1551
01:16:35,027 --> 01:16:36,226
- You too? - Me too.

1552
01:16:36,226 --> 01:16:37,226
Is your ear itching?

1553
01:16:37,226 --> 01:16:39,027
(Cha Woong Ki can't raise his hand properly.)

1554
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,067
There are many people.

1555
01:16:40,067 --> 01:16:44,436
Actually, the leader of TEAM BEAT's bench...

1556
01:16:44,436 --> 01:16:46,067
- was Han Seo. - It was Han Seo, right?

1557
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:52,006
(Koo Han Seo and Kairi showed a powerful performance...)

1558
01:16:52,006 --> 01:16:56,077
(with the song, "Hard Carry.")

1559
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,617
Yul and I performed...

1560
01:16:58,617 --> 01:17:00,917
together with Zen Zen.

1561
01:17:03,657 --> 01:17:07,827
(The three performed "THRILL RIDE" together.)

1562
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:11,766
(The three performed "THRILL RIDE" together.)

1563
01:17:11,766 --> 01:17:13,096
- Oh, "THRILL RIDE?" - Yes.

1564
01:17:14,636 --> 01:17:17,466
- We all have experience then. - Woong Ki, you have too, right?

1565
01:17:18,636 --> 01:17:20,537
I debuted together.

1566
01:17:22,306 --> 01:17:24,407
- We were on the same team. - They're on another level.

1567
01:17:26,377 --> 01:17:28,476
They're on another level.

1568
01:17:30,247 --> 01:17:31,317
He knows better.

1569
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:33,617
Of course.

1570
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:41,426
I left the team first,

1571
01:17:41,426 --> 01:17:43,766
so I wanted to subtly show that...

1572
01:17:43,766 --> 01:17:46,167
I was doing well.

1573
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:47,896
But...

1574
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,966
(But...)

1575
01:17:50,506 --> 01:17:52,006
Jang Kyung Ho!

1576
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:57,006
(The two met after leaving the team.)

1577
01:17:57,346 --> 01:17:58,976
You saw someone...

1578
01:17:58,976 --> 01:18:01,216
from your previous group.

1579
01:18:04,216 --> 01:18:05,787
"He wants to perform too."

1580
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:09,417
That's what I thought.

1581
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:13,796
By chance,

1582
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:16,997
we ended up appearing in the same show.

1583
01:18:19,226 --> 01:18:20,436
But if not,

1584
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:25,936
we wouldn't be seeing each other.

1585
01:18:28,976 --> 01:18:30,046
And...

1586
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:33,476
I didn't want to...

1587
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:35,247
meet him.

1588
01:18:36,176 --> 01:18:37,216
So...

1589
01:18:38,016 --> 01:18:41,457
(Woong Ki was anxious during the designation.)

1590
01:18:42,256 --> 01:18:44,256
(He wasn't able to meet Kyung Ho's eyes.)

1591
01:18:44,256 --> 01:18:46,327
- Look at him. - Look at him.

1592
01:18:46,327 --> 01:18:48,957
(He wasn't able to meet Kyung Ho's eyes.)

1593
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,497
- He... - My heart breaks.

1594
01:18:56,606 --> 01:19:01,277
(He wanted to avoid having Kyung Ho as his opponent.)

1595
01:19:01,277 --> 01:19:04,146
(He wanted to avoid having Kyung Ho as his opponent.)

1596
01:19:08,216 --> 01:19:11,417
I was thinking, "Why did he choose my team?"

1597
01:19:14,356 --> 01:19:17,356
If I were him, I would've avoided this.

1598
01:19:17,356 --> 01:19:18,527
Why would he choose the team that I was in?

1599
01:19:20,627 --> 01:19:23,667
It would've been better if another player had come to me.

1600
01:19:23,997 --> 01:19:27,167
(A match that he didn't want)

1601
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:31,266
If I lose in this match,

1602
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:34,306
it will be really humiliating.

1603
01:19:36,506 --> 01:19:39,716
(A match where the pride of both people is on the line)

1604
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:42,617
I think he thinks I'm still...

1605
01:19:42,617 --> 01:19:44,186
in high school.

1606
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:50,386
- I need to show how I changed. - You should.

1607
01:19:51,886 --> 01:19:53,827
(Hesitating)

1608
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:56,466
How is he?

1609
01:19:56,466 --> 01:19:57,466
(How is Kyung Ho?)

1610
01:19:58,766 --> 01:19:59,837
Well,

1611
01:20:00,096 --> 01:20:01,136
he's a great dancer.

1612
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:03,367
He's a great dancer,

1613
01:20:04,006 --> 01:20:06,337
- but we want to be singers. - Yes.

1614
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:08,077
I'm better at singing.

1615
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,577
In Round Two,

1616
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:15,277
we absolutely can't lose.

1617
01:20:19,216 --> 01:20:20,686
I would rather die than lose.

1618
01:20:22,356 --> 01:20:25,856
Mamma mia, hot like a fever

1619
01:20:26,926 --> 01:20:28,127
This is our lyric sheet.

1620
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:32,027
The red parts are mine.

1621
01:20:32,766 --> 01:20:34,237
There's a lot of red, right?

1622
01:20:36,537 --> 01:20:39,777
I'm taking the important parts.

1623
01:20:39,777 --> 01:20:40,936
(Woong Ki became the center of the team as the main vocalist.)

1624
01:20:41,077 --> 01:20:42,936
Mamma mia

1625
01:20:42,936 --> 01:20:44,106
If I make a mistake,

1626
01:20:44,106 --> 01:20:46,976
I'll ruin the whole song.

1627
01:20:48,247 --> 01:20:50,287
It's time to trust me

1628
01:20:50,686 --> 01:20:56,317
It's a song I refused to sell, even when offered a high price.

1629
01:20:56,317 --> 01:20:57,686
I've become greedy.

1630
01:20:58,957 --> 01:21:01,627
I feel more pressured.

1631
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:03,497
During "Boys Never Die,"

1632
01:21:03,766 --> 01:21:05,596
the lyrics were "Shall I try again? Let's try again."

1633
01:21:05,697 --> 01:21:07,197
There were key points like that.

1634
01:21:08,136 --> 01:21:10,606
For the song, "MAMMA MIA,"

1635
01:21:10,606 --> 01:21:13,907
one of the lyrics is, "Rise again."

1636
01:21:14,306 --> 01:21:15,306
I love it.

1637
01:21:15,306 --> 01:21:16,777
(The lyrics match his story.)

1638
01:21:17,106 --> 01:21:19,247
(The scars from bumping into obstacles and getting lost)

1639
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:22,146
(No more pain, only shining moments)

1640
01:21:22,516 --> 01:21:26,046
(Rise again, go, chasing the higher light)

1641
01:21:26,617 --> 01:21:28,556
(We never stop)

1642
01:21:28,756 --> 01:21:31,987
(We never stop, try walking through it all)

1643
01:21:32,256 --> 01:21:33,997
(Even if you don't know where the end is)

1644
01:21:34,926 --> 01:21:38,367
This song also contains...

1645
01:21:38,367 --> 01:21:40,596
the message I wanted to express.

1646
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:43,207
That's why I was able to immerse myself even more.

1647
01:21:43,306 --> 01:21:46,606
Let us be engraved on this path, show them who we are

1648
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,377
I hope this is the last time I try again.

1649
01:21:52,476 --> 01:21:53,516
Get up, An Yul.

1650
01:21:53,516 --> 01:21:54,577
(The practice room that night)

1651
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:55,917
Okay.

1652
01:21:58,686 --> 01:21:59,686
Yul!

1653
01:21:59,856 --> 01:22:01,957
In 5, 6, 7, 8!

1654
01:22:01,957 --> 01:22:04,226
One, two, three, four, five,

1655
01:22:04,226 --> 01:22:05,627
- Yul, you're a bit fast. - six, seven, eight.

1656
01:22:05,856 --> 01:22:07,027
- A single sprint - A single sprint

1657
01:22:07,027 --> 01:22:08,657
(He misses the beat.)

1658
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,497
- An Yul, you keep making mistakes. - An Yul.

1659
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:14,667
(An Yul isn't able to focus even though it's a group practice.)

1660
01:22:15,237 --> 01:22:16,266
What's going on?

1661
01:22:17,436 --> 01:22:19,337
(Frustrated)

1662
01:22:19,837 --> 01:22:20,877
I'm sorry.

1663
01:22:21,577 --> 01:22:24,377
(He's sensitive.)

1664
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:26,947
(Practicing the group choreography with Woong Ki at the center)

1665
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:28,016
Oh, here.

1666
01:22:28,516 --> 01:22:31,487
The balls of your feet. Please push off with the balls of your feet.

1667
01:22:31,487 --> 01:22:32,546
- Yes. - Okay.

1668
01:22:32,546 --> 01:22:34,386
As soon as you go up, boom. Go down.

1669
01:22:34,386 --> 01:22:36,987
(Woong Ki fine-tunes every detail with precision.)

1670
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:38,926
Our strategy was, quite literally,

1671
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:42,197
to have more time to synchronize...

1672
01:22:42,197 --> 01:22:43,367
as a group during this round.

1673
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:46,537
Fix your legs! Why do they keep going down?

1674
01:22:46,737 --> 01:22:48,766
It's because you don't have enough strength.

1675
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:52,136
Do Yoon, don't spread your legs.

1676
01:22:52,136 --> 01:22:53,136
(Frustrated)

1677
01:22:53,377 --> 01:22:55,806
Your shoulders need to move back.

1678
01:22:55,806 --> 01:22:56,846
(Copying and pasting Do Yoon's posture)

1679
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:57,877
But your posture is like this.

1680
01:22:58,407 --> 01:22:59,707
It won't work if you keep doing that.

1681
01:23:00,577 --> 01:23:02,377
Your chest needs to be more forward than your stomach.

1682
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,747
No, that's weird.

1683
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,587
Your chest needs to be more forward than your stomach.

1684
01:23:06,587 --> 01:23:08,886
No, that's weird.

1685
01:23:09,087 --> 01:23:11,587
- Again! - But given the time, let's move on.

1686
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:14,157
Okay. Go there and practice. We're almost there.

1687
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,926
(Woong Ki's feedback continues.)

1688
01:23:17,627 --> 01:23:20,867
The beat during "A single sprint..."

1689
01:23:21,266 --> 01:23:22,296
changes.

1690
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:23,867
(He misses the beat as he loses focus.)

1691
01:23:23,867 --> 01:23:24,936
You know that, right?

1692
01:23:25,737 --> 01:23:27,806
- I don't know. - You don't? That's even worse.

1693
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:29,077
- You need to know. - Okay!

1694
01:23:29,077 --> 01:23:30,077
I'll work on it from today.

1695
01:23:30,077 --> 01:23:31,106
(He is decisive.)

1696
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,516
When we hold hands...

1697
01:23:34,377 --> 01:23:35,447
and make a move,

1698
01:23:36,146 --> 01:23:37,747
you're weaker than me.

1699
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,487
(Woong Ki's radar caught him.)

1700
01:23:40,487 --> 01:23:41,516
It shouldn't be like that.

1701
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,756
(Woong Ki's radar caught him.)

1702
01:23:43,756 --> 01:23:45,726
(Who's the next target?)

1703
01:23:45,726 --> 01:23:48,256
(There's no exception even if you're older than him.)

1704
01:23:48,497 --> 01:23:49,556
Jin Ho,

1705
01:23:51,096 --> 01:23:53,867
I don't think you'll have trouble hitting the right pitch...

1706
01:23:53,867 --> 01:23:54,936
before the main stage.

1707
01:23:55,266 --> 01:23:58,237
But your voice cracks often.

1708
01:23:58,806 --> 01:24:00,136
To this path, we're

1709
01:24:00,606 --> 01:24:02,006
(Reading the room)

1710
01:24:03,077 --> 01:24:09,617
(Keum Jin Ho's voice often cracked.)

1711
01:24:10,216 --> 01:24:11,487
Honestly,

1712
01:24:11,487 --> 01:24:13,787
rather than singing a lot, don't you think listening more...

1713
01:24:13,787 --> 01:24:15,886
will help you match the pitch better?

1714
01:24:17,287 --> 01:24:18,327
Listening more...

1715
01:24:19,256 --> 01:24:21,127
Focus more on your vocals.

1716
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:23,766
I know you want to perform better.

1717
01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:25,127
- Yes. - You'll do well.

1718
01:24:25,497 --> 01:24:26,527
Okay.

1719
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:30,567
(The most notable figure, Nam Do Yoon)

1720
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:32,266
Rather than asking you...

1721
01:24:33,006 --> 01:24:35,136
to be perfect in everything,

1722
01:24:35,707 --> 01:24:38,407
I think at least the parts that focus on you...

1723
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:39,806
should be perfect.

1724
01:24:40,077 --> 01:24:42,346
That way, your weaknesses won't show.

1725
01:24:42,346 --> 01:24:45,287
You need to be the center of those parts.

1726
01:24:45,287 --> 01:24:47,056
Yes, understood.

1727
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:50,127
You keep getting faster and slower on your own.

1728
01:24:51,027 --> 01:24:53,657
I used to joke around a lot,

1729
01:24:53,856 --> 01:24:55,957
but this was the first time I'd seen him so serious.

1730
01:24:58,226 --> 01:24:59,567
Our choreography is...

1731
01:24:59,567 --> 01:25:00,567
(A vigorous choreography for a live performance)

1732
01:25:00,567 --> 01:25:02,296
- too difficult. - Right.

1733
01:25:02,567 --> 01:25:06,106
TEAM GROOVE's bench might be more stable...

1734
01:25:06,806 --> 01:25:09,306
when showing their vocals. That's what I thought.

1735
01:25:09,306 --> 01:25:11,207
We have to practice singing live.

1736
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:14,146
(The anxiety about the live singing grows as they practice more)

1737
01:25:14,947 --> 01:25:16,917
- Are you all doing well? - Yes!

1738
01:25:17,046 --> 01:25:18,487
Do we have a week left?

1739
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:20,287
- Yes. - Right?

1740
01:25:20,287 --> 01:25:21,356
(Round 2 will start in a week.)

1741
01:25:21,356 --> 01:25:23,056
Can I see your performance?

1742
01:25:23,087 --> 01:25:24,087
- Yes. - Yes.

1743
01:25:24,087 --> 01:25:25,087
Let's go.

1744
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:34,596
Go, chasing the higher light

1745
01:25:37,037 --> 01:25:40,077
Since when have I been running nonstop?

1746
01:25:43,907 --> 01:25:48,046
(Keum Jin Ho isn't stable from the first part.)

1747
01:25:48,046 --> 01:25:50,987
Mamma mia, hot like a fever

1748
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:54,216
(It's becoming more difficult to sing.)

1749
01:25:54,216 --> 01:25:56,657
Keep rising, rise higher

1750
01:25:56,756 --> 01:25:58,327
A single sprint

1751
01:25:58,327 --> 01:26:00,957
- We are - We are

1752
01:26:02,096 --> 01:26:04,466
(They're too focused on the intense choreography...)

1753
01:26:04,466 --> 01:26:07,296
(that they're unable to sing properly.)

1754
01:26:07,296 --> 01:26:10,707
Let us be engraved on this path, show them who we are

1755
01:26:13,266 --> 01:26:15,676
(Sighing)

1756
01:26:19,777 --> 01:26:25,817
(Only heavy breathing fills the air)

1757
01:26:26,287 --> 01:26:30,016
Honestly, is it possible to sing this while doing it?

1758
01:26:32,556 --> 01:26:35,926
You can tell by the heavy breathing...

1759
01:26:35,926 --> 01:26:38,167
that it’s hard to hear the song.

1760
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,197
(The breathing was louder than the vocals)

1761
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:44,606
I've been wandering and lost

1762
01:26:44,707 --> 01:26:45,936
Your breathing is all I can hear.

1763
01:26:46,466 --> 01:26:49,277
(YUGYEOM's honest feedback)

1764
01:26:49,277 --> 01:26:52,306
The thing about an idol group...

1765
01:26:52,306 --> 01:26:54,377
is that we sing while dancing.

1766
01:26:55,817 --> 01:26:56,846
But...

1767
01:26:57,247 --> 01:27:01,016
it shouldn't be obvious that you're out of breath and struggling.

1768
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,457
- Yes. - Right.

1769
01:27:02,457 --> 01:27:03,487
Yes.

1770
01:27:03,487 --> 01:27:06,056
(The vocals were criticized because the focus was on the choreography.)

1771
01:27:07,896 --> 01:27:11,266
The director was worried about our vocals.

1772
01:27:11,266 --> 01:27:12,926
He was on point.

1773
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:14,766
I'm the main vocalist.

1774
01:27:15,266 --> 01:27:17,737
It means that he's worried about me.

1775
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,176
I'm worried about me too.

1776
01:27:20,636 --> 01:27:23,646
The director is saying that he's worried about the vocals.

1777
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:27,077
My anxiousness is multiplying constantly.

1778
01:27:27,077 --> 01:27:31,247
(As the main vocalist, his anxiety and pressure are growing.)

1779
01:27:31,516 --> 01:27:35,657
I heard Woong Ki is in a rivalry with TEAM GROOVE.

1780
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,157
- Yes. - I heard you must win.

1781
01:27:38,157 --> 01:27:39,186
- Yes. - Yes.

1782
01:27:39,627 --> 01:27:42,997
As a team, you know Woong Ki's situation.

1783
01:27:42,997 --> 01:27:45,096
And of course, everyone needs to win,

1784
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:47,567
but as a friend,

1785
01:27:47,567 --> 01:27:49,837
let's keep the friendship...

1786
01:27:50,506 --> 01:27:52,766
and ignite our competitive spirit.

1787
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:53,936
- Yes. - Yes.

1788
01:27:54,337 --> 01:27:55,337
Let's not lose.

1789
01:27:55,337 --> 01:27:56,337
- Yes. - Yes.

1790
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:02,117
(They try their best until the end before the stage.)

1791
01:28:03,016 --> 01:28:05,087
I'm someone who can do better...

1792
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:06,747
than you think.

1793
01:28:07,087 --> 01:28:08,417
Anyone, come and challenge me.

1794
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:10,457
Sure.

1795
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:13,087
- We are, we are - We are, we are

1796
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,396
- We are, we are - We are, we are

1797
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:18,426
We'll start with TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.

1798
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:22,037
TEAM BEAT, are you ready?

1799
01:28:22,037 --> 01:28:23,237
- My goodness. - Let's go!

1800
01:28:23,237 --> 01:28:25,067
- Let's go! - Go!

1801
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:27,377
- Let's go! You can do it! - Okay!

1802
01:28:27,806 --> 01:28:28,837
You can do it.

1803
01:28:28,837 --> 01:28:30,306
Let's go!

1804
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:35,176
Is sentimentality needed in this match?

1805
01:28:36,046 --> 01:28:37,117
I'm giving it my all.

1806
01:28:37,987 --> 01:28:40,516
I really have to give it my all, no matter what.

1807
01:28:42,157 --> 01:28:44,027
We need to watch them carefully.

1808
01:28:48,096 --> 01:28:49,157
Ready?

1809
01:28:49,527 --> 01:28:50,527
Go.

1810
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:58,666
("MAMMA MIA (WHO WE ARE)" by An Yul, Cha Woong Ki, Kairi,)

1811
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:00,135
(Keum Jin Ho, Nam Do Yoon, Park Yeon Jun, Yuito)

1812
01:29:03,135 --> 01:29:04,265
Oh, my.

1813
01:29:05,935 --> 01:29:07,835
- My goodness. Cha Woong Ki! - Oh, my.

1814
01:29:07,835 --> 01:29:08,906
They won.

1815
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:34,765
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

1816
01:30:01,755 --> 01:30:02,795
Let's go.

1817
01:30:14,805 --> 01:30:17,706
This song suits Woong Ki so well.

1818
01:30:17,946 --> 01:30:19,406
- It suits him so well. - Yes.

1819
01:30:46,736 --> 01:30:47,975
He improved a lot.

1820
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:10,925
Oh, my goodness!

1821
01:31:59,206 --> 01:32:00,246
They're good.

1822
01:32:08,385 --> 01:32:09,755
This is crazy!

1823
01:32:10,156 --> 01:32:11,385
You're amazing!

1824
01:32:12,185 --> 01:32:14,725
(You did well, our starting players.)

1825
01:32:14,725 --> 01:32:16,896
- My goodness. - Kairi!

1826
01:32:16,996 --> 01:32:18,125
We won!

1827
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,965
Look at Kairi holding his breath.

1828
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:23,265
(They nailed it.)

1829
01:32:23,965 --> 01:32:25,736
- They did well. - It was so good.

1830
01:32:25,736 --> 01:32:26,935
The starting lineup sure is different.

1831
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:30,146
(TEAM GROOVE watched the starting players' performance by TEAM BEAT.)

1832
01:32:31,446 --> 01:32:33,746
TEAM BEAT prepared very well.

1833
01:32:33,946 --> 01:32:35,146
(Feeling nervous)

1834
01:32:35,146 --> 01:32:36,845
- Really? - We can do it!

1835
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:38,146
We can win.

1836
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:40,356
We can do it. Our team can make it.

1837
01:32:40,356 --> 01:32:42,616
- Thank you. - You're amazing!

1838
01:32:42,616 --> 01:32:43,755
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup finished its performance.)

1839
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:48,055
It wasn't the same Woong Ki I knew.

1840
01:32:48,055 --> 01:32:49,765
"MAMMA MIA" by Woong Ki's team...

1841
01:32:49,765 --> 01:32:53,366
had good teamwork as if it were one person moving.

1842
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:57,166
I thought it would be a tough match.

1843
01:32:58,166 --> 01:32:59,206
Thank you.

1844
01:33:01,536 --> 01:33:02,536
Thank you.

1845
01:33:02,536 --> 01:33:05,875
TEAM GROOVE's bench is here to intercept...

1846
01:33:05,975 --> 01:33:07,576
TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.

1847
01:33:08,146 --> 01:33:12,616
(Will TEAM BEAT keep it, or will TEAM GROOVE steal it?)

1848
01:33:17,385 --> 01:33:18,456
(Tapping)

1849
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:21,125
(On eggshells)

1850
01:33:23,425 --> 01:33:25,625
Intercept!

1851
01:33:25,625 --> 01:33:29,736
(Will TEAM GROOVE's bench be able to intercept the song?)

1852
01:33:30,406 --> 01:33:33,276
Anyone would agree that it's our song.

1853
01:33:33,875 --> 01:33:34,875
I don't want to lose.

1854
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:40,375
I don't plan to lose today.

1855
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:47,015
There's something I want to say to Woong Ki.

1856
01:33:49,316 --> 01:33:51,156
(To me?)

1857
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:54,425
(Today is...)

1858
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,725
(I'm ready...)

1859
01:33:57,725 --> 01:34:00,295
(to open Pandora's box.)

1860
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:03,965
(Kyung Ho looks serious.)

1861
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:05,935
(It's finally revealed.)

1862
01:34:06,935 --> 01:34:10,375
(I'm worried that it might appear bad on TV.)

1863
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:13,215
(The true story between the two)

1864
01:34:14,076 --> 01:34:15,076
Actually...

1865
01:34:18,215 --> 01:34:19,585
(This place is no joke.)

1866
01:34:19,585 --> 01:34:20,585
(This is brutal.)

1867
01:34:20,786 --> 01:34:22,885
(Is it okay to say this?)

1868
01:34:24,685 --> 01:34:27,425
(When I performed with Woong Ki...)

1869
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:32,326
(They get it off their chest onstage.)

1870
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:37,706
When I heard that,

1871
01:34:39,505 --> 01:34:41,475
I felt sorry and burst into tears.

1872
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:52,045
(Universe League)
