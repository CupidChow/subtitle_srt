please tell us your resolution to win?

127
00:09:27,744 --> 00:09:30,114
Let's start with TEAM RHYTHM's director.

128
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:34,284
Okay. From what I see, TEAM RHYTHM...

129
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:37,955
has the talent a K-pop artist...

130
00:09:38,384 --> 00:09:39,925
needs to have.

131
00:09:40,325 --> 00:09:42,954
And with each performance,

132
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:46,493
I could see each player improving.

133
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:49,565
And what everyone loves...

134
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:53,904
Visuals, performance, and music. The players have all three.

135
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:56,405
They have great potential.

136
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:01,744
And so, TEAM RHYTHM will win today at any cost.

137
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:04,274

138

Great. Director Chang Sub, please.

142
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:18,195
All right.

143
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,065
Through Universe League,

144
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:25,664
I've met many players with amazing talent.

145
00:10:25,665 --> 00:10:29,134
Watching them has helped me return to my original resolution.

146
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:33,574
I think the director's job is to have the players debut.

147
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,643
And with today's performances,

148
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:39,243
I hope my team debuts on a great note.

149
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:40,884

while teaching the players,

155
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:00,205
we learned a lot more from them.

156
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:04,535
It gave us the opportunity to reflect on ourselves.

157
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:09,205
That helped us become more earnest with the players.

158
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:12,344
I kept thinking we were really like a team.

159
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:15,945
I hope the players perform without any regrets today...

160
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,614

we made the songs together with TEAM BEAT players.

165
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:37,935
As today is the last performance,

166
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:41,503
the players' sincere hearts have been...

167
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:43,815
put into the songs.

168
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:47,613
I hope their sincerity is passed on...

169
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:50,184
to the audience here...

170
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:52,415

- All right. - Nice job.

176
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:05,133
We can feel the directors' warm hearts...

177
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:06,904
and confidence.

178
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:07,905
Nice.

00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:42,034
(TEAM RHYTHM...)

190
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:44,935
(put together elite members to aim for victory.)

191
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:48,445
(League Match Final Team Score, Total)

192
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:49,914
(TEAM RHYTHM finished the league match in 1st place.)

193
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:51,474
The winner of the league match...

194
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:53,514
is TEAM RHYTHM.

195
00:12:53,614 --> 00:12:56,285
- Good job. - Good job, guys.

196
00:12:56,585 --> 00:12:59,484
Fans have chosen you to advance to the finals.

197
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,724
The youngest member of TEAM RHYTHM.

198
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:07,325
(Additionally, the directors chose Daisuke and Seo Jeong Woo.)

199
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:10,834
(TEAM RHYTHM is ready to take home the win.)

200
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:13,034
Come to think of it, this is our last performance.

201
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:14,604
- Yes. - Right.

202
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:18,035
That's why I don't want to have any regrets.

203
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:21,575
I want it to be perfect. A performance...

204
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:23,144
- I'd love that. - that amazes everyone.

205
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:26,743
This is the last time, so it should be more like,

206
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:29,854
"Okay, this is really TEAM RHYTHM."

207
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:33,455
I want to make my debut as TEAM RHYTHM.

208
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:35,124
- Nice. - How cute.

209
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:36,955
- Same here. - He's adorable.

210
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:39,724
Jeong Woo, what's your take?

211
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:41,994
Either way,

212
00:13:42,494 --> 00:13:44,264
this is the finals and our last performance.

213
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,705
Since I survived until this moment,

214
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:48,205
I want...

215
00:13:48,504 --> 00:13:52,075
to keep going so that I can make my debut.

216
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:54,773
- Are you craving the win? - Incredibly.

217
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:55,904
(A burning desire to win)

218
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:57,744
Then, let's go ahead and listen...

219
00:13:58,514 --> 00:13:59,684
to our song for the finals.

220
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:01,143
- Sounds good. - I'd love that.

221
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,215
I'm nervous.

222
00:14:03,155 --> 00:14:08,024
(Listening to "TAG," TEAM RHYTHM's song for the finals)

223
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:14,024
(The performance that utilizes a prop catches the eye.)

224
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,094
(I love the armband.)

225
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:19,565
(The armband is used like a relay baton.)

226
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:22,035
There's a kick to the performance of "TAG."

227
00:14:22,504 --> 00:14:23,935
It's the armband.

228
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:27,044
By utilizing the armband, TEAM RHYTHM will show...

229
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:30,114
that we're different from the other teams.

230
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:33,014
(That's so cool!)

231
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:37,055
(A pair dance that catches the eye)

232
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:40,425
(The ultimate performance that is the human tower)

233
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:42,123
(No way!)

234
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:43,994
- We'll be making a tower? - Seriously?

235
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:46,893
It's a song that can showcase TEAM RHYTHM's strength,

236
00:14:46,894 --> 00:14:48,165
dance performance,

237
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:52,035
so I'm sure we'll win.

238
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:54,165
We use an armband as a prop.

239
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:58,074
By throwing it around, we'll put on...

240
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:00,705
a well-executed performance that your eyes will be glued to.

241
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:04,045
I believed the performance itself would leave quite the impact.

242
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:05,944
So by doing this right,

243
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:09,014
it could lead us to a victory.

244
00:15:09,415 --> 00:15:11,314
(TEAM RHYTHM announces a performance like no other.)

245
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,383
- No way. - That's insane.

246
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:14,455
That was so cool.

247
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:15,984
It looks tricky, though.

248
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:17,195
(However, they have a tough road ahead.)

249
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:19,154
Until the finals,

250
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:21,523
we'll have to sleep in the practice room.

251
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:22,994
(Until the finals, we shouldn't go home.)

252
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,593
Jeong Woo, don't worry.

253
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:26,665
Don't worry

254
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,205
You have us.

255
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:30,804
(Reliable JL)

256
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,503
- That's reassuring. - Our team has Mr. Three-picks.

257
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:34,574
(Our team has Mr. 3-picks, so don't worry.)

258
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:35,604
Three Picks.

259
00:15:35,945 --> 00:15:37,774
(The lights are still on late at night in the practice room.)

260
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:40,215
(TEAM RHYTHM's working hard on the choreography.)

261
00:15:40,744 --> 00:15:41,883
(Despite all the worrying,)

262
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:43,614
(there doesn't seem to be any hitches.)

263
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:46,825
(Showing finesse)

264
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:49,483
(What about Jeong Woo who's new to TEAM RHYTHM?)

265
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:51,555
I worked with him on TEAM GROOVE,

266
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:54,264
so I thought...

267
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:56,633
he'd have some trouble...

268
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,894
keeping up with TEAM RHYTHM's style.

269
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:02,364
What worried me the most was the dancing.

270
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:05,234
Back on TEAM GROOVE,

271
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:07,743
when I had to be in the center,

272
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:10,144
I was allowed to tone down the dancing a bit.

273
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,574
I can't avoid the matter forever,

274
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:15,044
so I'm excited about my progress in a way.

275
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,285
(I'm excited about the change.)

276
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,815
(Despite the concern,)

277
00:16:19,185 --> 00:16:20,883
(Jeong Woo's keeping up,)

278
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:23,254
(even though it's the first day of practice.)

279
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:26,724
(Later, in the part where he is in the center)

280
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,733
(He melts into the team as if he was always one of them.)

281
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,905
It was our first time practicing with Jeong Woo,

282
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:36,675
and he kept up better than I had expected.

283
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:40,104
He seemed to only get better and better,

284
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:43,915
which was quite admirable.

285
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:45,715
The second verse is harder for me.

286
00:16:46,014 --> 00:16:48,044
- It's harder. - Because we switch it up, right?

287
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:49,285
How will you do it?

288
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,215
Here's what I think. I thought...

289
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:53,224
I'd move to the back like this.

290
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:55,353
- And then... - Hold on.

291
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:56,894
- It's not that. - Make your exit even faster.

292
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:59,224
Immediately move to the back after the moves on the floor.

293
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,895
(Like this?)

294
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:04,763
(Jeong Woo, you're the best!)

295
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:06,194
- Are you good? - Yes.

296
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:08,205
Before, I would continue to repeat the moves.

297
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:11,774
But now I know which moves I need to work on more.

298
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,503
It's progress if you ask me.

299
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:15,573
("It's progress if you ask me.")

300
00:17:15,574 --> 00:17:16,615
That's what I believe.

301
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:20,845
(Two other players are working hard during the break.)

302
00:17:21,744 --> 00:17:24,813
(Zhang Shuaibo and Chih En)

303
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:26,684
- Hold on. - Don't you think...

304
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:28,155
we have to cover too much distance?

305
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:30,694
Why don't you take my hand...

306
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:32,753
and move your head this way?

307
00:17:32,754 --> 00:17:35,395
(What are they up to?)

308
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:38,493
Zhang Shuaibo and I...

309
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:41,435
perform a pair dance during the song.

310
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:48,645
(The powerful pair dance by Zhang Shuaibo and Chih En)

311
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:51,274
This is our first time performing a pair dance.

312
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,784
We were exchanging ideas...

313
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:56,584
to elevate the level of the performance.

314
00:17:57,655 --> 00:18:01,685
(To present a performance that is closer to perfection,)

315
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:08,395
(the two work on their chemistry rather than take a break.)

316
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:09,935
Never

317
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:11,494
(Screaming)

318
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,605
(What they couldn't execute can now be done perfectly.)

319
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:21,444
(We can't wait for Zhang Shuaibo and Chih En's pair dance.)

320
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:24,013
I'm confident about the performance we'll create together.

321
00:18:24,014 --> 00:18:25,244
It'll leave an impact.

322
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:27,845
Guys, I...

323
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:29,715
Guys?

324
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:30,783
(Zhang Shuaibo gathers them to suggest an idea.)

325
00:18:30,784 --> 00:18:33,214
- I have an idea. - An idea?

326
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:34,223
- What is it? - Well...

327
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:35,283
(Round and round)

328
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:36,894
- The armband. - The armband?

329
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:38,554
- How about we make one? - He's adorable.

330
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:40,194
- What do you think? - You think we should make one?

331
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:43,264
- Zhang Shuaibo, you're the best! - Zhang Shuaibo, you're so clever.

332
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:45,865
- I love it. Big brain. - Let's do it.

333
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:48,064
There are...

334
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,774
seven of us on TEAM RHYTHM,

335
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:53,874
and I thought...

336
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,705
there should be something...

337
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,145
that represented the seven of us.

338
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:02,844
I wanted to display our determination...

339
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:03,984
regarding our desire to debut.

340
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,253
(The players of TEAM RHYTHM...)

341
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:08,753
(decorate the armband with their autographs.)

342
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,494
Nice. That's cool.

343
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:12,494
Let's stick these on, guys.

344
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,864
(Lastly, they decorate it with the team name...)

345
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:16,493
(and make a promise to win.)

346
00:19:16,494 --> 00:19:17,534
Good.

347
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:18,793
All done!

348
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:21,405
(Finally, it's done.)

349
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:25,474
- On the back are our autographs. - Our autographs.

350
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,744
I don't know who'll get to keep it, but...

351
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,115
We decorated the armband with the team name...

352
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:33,513
and all seven of our autographs.

353
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:36,915
That being said, every one of us will get to dance...

354
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,014
wearing the armband.

355
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:40,685
In that sense,

356
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:43,283
it was quite meaningful to us.

357
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:45,724
The moment we put the armband on,

358
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:49,263
it'll be like seeing the captain of a soccer team.

359
00:19:49,264 --> 00:19:51,733
You'll be able to trust the performance...

360
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:53,234
by TEAM RHYTHM.

361
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:55,264
Once you see our first performance,

362
00:19:55,365 --> 00:19:57,205
you'll know we'll be the ones debuting.

363
00:19:57,334 --> 00:20:00,875
I want to end on a high note that arouses such thoughts.

364
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:03,814
We'll be victorious over TEAM GROOVE and TEAM BEAT.

365
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:05,774
TEAM RHYTHM will debut.

366
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:18,993
- Let's go, JL! - Go, Jeong Woo!

367
00:20:18,994 --> 00:20:21,194
("TAG" by JL, Steven, Zhang Shuaibo,)

368
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:23,534
(Chih En, Park Ju Won, Daisuke, Seo Jeong Woo)

369
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:57,034
(Seo Jeong Woo)

370
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:40,274
(Master of expressions, Zhang Shuaibo)

371
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:15,965
Zhang Shuaibo!

372
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:19,504
Zhang Shuaibo!

373
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:21,773
Well done!

374
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:24,744
That was "TAG" by TEAM RHYTHM.

375
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:32,814
Good job, guys.

376
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:37,455
First, we'll hear from Director YANGYANG.

377
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:40,195
What did you think of the performance?

378
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:44,733
That was definitely TEAM RHYTHM's style.

379
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:45,834
You did great.

380
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:52,473
I saw a lot of videos of them practicing,

381
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,374
and today's performance was perfect.

382
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,514
Everything was smooth,

383
00:23:57,945 --> 00:24:00,615
and you guys improved a lot. It was great.

384
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:02,544
Good work, everyone.

385
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:05,185
You did great.

386
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:07,925
We'll move on to Director Chang Sub.

387
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:10,624
What did you think of TEAM RHYTHM's performance?

388
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,894
They had me mesmerized.

389
00:24:12,895 --> 00:24:16,763
First of all, I love...

390
00:24:16,764 --> 00:24:19,095
how you're wearing shoulder pads.

391
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:21,233
And like we saw in the video,

392
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:23,935
Jeong Woo has shown a lot of progress.

393
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:27,705
It was amazing. Also,

394
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:30,944
it was a performance that had me bouncing to the beat...

395
00:24:30,945 --> 00:24:33,273
without me realizing it.

396
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:35,384
You guys did great.

397
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:37,084
This isn't my team,

398
00:24:37,284 --> 00:24:39,114
but I feel proud for some reason.

399
00:24:39,115 --> 00:24:41,554
You all did great.

400
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:45,224
- Good job, guys. - Jeong Woo, you did great!

401
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:46,993
That was high praise.

402
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:51,064

417
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:28,534
Next up is TEAM GROOVE.

418
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:32,205
Let's take a look.

419
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:36,543
First of all, congratulations.

420
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:37,674
- Thank you. - Thank you.

421
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:40,384
Congratulations on making it as the final seven.

422
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:41,783
(TEAM GROOVE gathered in the locker room...)

423
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:43,145
(after the finalists were announced.)

424
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:45,214
(League match, Round 1)

425
00:25:45,215 --> 00:25:46,283
(Starting lineup, Bench)

426
00:25:46,284 --> 00:25:47,483
(Total)

427
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:48,583
(Starting lineup, Bench, Total)

428
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:51,924
(Round 1: 1st place, TEAM GROOVE)

429
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,925
(League match, Round 2)

430
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:57,634
(Round 2: 1st place, TEAM GROOVE)

431
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:59,164
(League match, Round 3)

432
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:02,763
(Round 3 on-site voting: 1st place, TEAM GROOVE)

433
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:05,834
(TEAM GROOVE is a favorite to win the competition.)

434
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:10,845
(Park Han, Kim Joo Hyoung, and Kenta were chosen by the fans.)

435
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:13,374
(Along with the members chosen by Director Lee Chang Sub,)

436
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:18,013
(TEAM GROOVE formed a formidable team.)

437
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:22,984
(Aiming for victory with its elite members)

438
00:26:23,224 --> 00:26:26,723
Let's give everything we have in this final performance.

439
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:28,665
- Got it. - Okay?

440
00:26:29,024 --> 00:26:31,135
Here's the song you'll perform...

441
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:33,493
in the finals.

442
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:34,904
(Excited)

443
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:36,935
(Nervous)

444
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:38,904
It's called "Universe."

445
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:39,973
- "Universe?" - "Universe."

446
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:41,803
- "Universe." - "Universe."

447
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:45,814
A final song with that title seems cool.

448
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:47,384
(What can we expect from Director Lee's secret weapon?)

449
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:48,983
Okay. Let's listen to it.

450
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,014
- Okay. - Okay.

451
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:52,615
("Universe (A Message that Will Reach Once the Curtain Rises):")

452
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:53,615
(A song about delivering one's burning desire)

453
00:26:53,616 --> 00:26:55,283
(to someone who has been chosen for you by fate)

454
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:57,023
(Delight, determination, and intense emotions...)

455
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:58,595
(express the heart in a colorful way.)

456
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:04,834
It's a pair dance.

457
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:09,364
I can already hear Han.

458
00:27:09,365 --> 00:27:11,834
(This part features charming high notes.)

459
00:27:14,044 --> 00:27:15,273
There are a lot of high notes.

460
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:16,574
I agree.

461
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:24,615
It was a song that we had to deliver with our vocals.

462
00:27:24,715 --> 00:27:27,253
I think it's a song that can highlight...

463
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:29,584
the vocal ability of TEAM GROOVE which is our strength.

464
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:32,994
This is Universe League, and we're singing "Universe."

465
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,365
That makes us the men of the hour.

466
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:40,803
(We love it.)

467
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:41,864
(My gosh)

468
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:44,273
The song is very high.

469
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:46,804
It's higher than any other song we've sung.

470
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:49,974
The songs by TEAM GROOVE...

471
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:52,644
generally require a high vocal register.

472
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:54,814
That's why it's a challenge for you.

473
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:58,614
I'll assign the sections you're going to perform.

474
00:27:58,615 --> 00:27:59,684
- Okay. - Okay.

475
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:00,753
Let's practice.

476
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:01,754
(Will the challenging song be TEAM GROOVE's weapon?)

477
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:02,754
Okay.

478
00:28:04,155 --> 00:28:08,165
I'll be checking your vocals individually for this one.

479
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:10,733
I was wondering if I'd get the chance...

480
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:12,694
to receive a 1-on-1 lesson from the director.

481
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:15,405
My guess is that this was him playing the ace up his sleeve.

482
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:18,974
(The ace up Director Lee Chang Sub's sleeve, 1-on-1 vocal lessons)

483
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:21,474
If you still can't hit it, bend over some more.

484
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:25,773
I won't let you go

485
00:28:25,774 --> 00:28:27,444
Okay. Good. Let's try that again.

486
00:28:27,445 --> 00:28:29,313
(A special measure of his that will allow his players...)

487
00:28:29,314 --> 00:28:30,983
(to sing the secret weapon that is "Universe")

488
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:33,154
This was your best attempt yet.

489
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:34,223
Bite down on your teeth, and...

490
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:38,094
(He shows the main vocalist Park Han how to protect his vocal cords.)

491
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:39,194
Yes, like that.

492
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:40,293
That drill will help...

493
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:42,563
- keep your vocal cords apart, - Right.

494
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:43,895
so do that often.

495
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:45,394
Too thrilling

496
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:47,404
Hold me tighter than a roller coaster

497
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:49,303
What I only did with you here

498
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:52,033
(For Kenta, who isn't fluent in Korean,)

499
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:55,074
(he records the pronunciation of the words.)

500
00:28:56,205 --> 00:28:58,114
- You can practice like that. - Okay.

501
00:28:58,115 --> 00:28:59,415
(Director Lee's special vocal lesson is over.)

502
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:01,185
There's a flu going around,

503
00:29:01,484 --> 00:29:03,615
and it's hard to be in your best condition this time of year.

504
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:06,155
- Make sure to stay healthy. - Okay.

505
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:08,784
I said we'd have meat if you won.

506
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:11,053
You did win with the on-site voting.

507
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:13,523
(Director Lee, you're the best.)

508
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,064
- Pork belly. - Pork belly.

509
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:16,794
Let's enjoy meat.

510
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:21,263
(Yes, we're having meat!)

511
00:29:21,264 --> 00:29:23,003
- Meat. - Really?

512
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:24,204
(A meat feast!)

513
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:27,004
I didn't see this coming.

514
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:32,474
Is this our last supper?

515
00:29:33,115 --> 00:29:34,483
(The pork belly looks delicious.)

516
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:35,845
(Focused)

517
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:40,054
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

518
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,723
- Thank you. - Thank you.

519
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:45,155
- Thank you. - Gosh.

520
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,293
(The meat tastes even better...)

521
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:50,394
(after the special training they had to endure.)

522
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:51,465
- Gosh. - It's good.

523
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:55,564
(Kenta has a bite as well.)

524
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:59,333
(That reminds me...)

525
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:00,944
(Director Lee Chang Sub suddenly pulls something out.)

526
00:30:00,945 --> 00:30:02,004
Guys.

527
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:04,644
(What is it?)

528
00:30:04,645 --> 00:30:08,813
(A letter?)

529
00:30:08,814 --> 00:30:09,885
Goodness.

530
00:30:10,284 --> 00:30:12,483
- What's this? - My gosh.

531
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:14,885
- Han. - Thank you.

532
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:16,723
- Gi Joong. - Thank you.

533
00:30:16,724 --> 00:30:17,924
(He calls out their names, 1 by 1.)

534
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,694
- Hee Jun. - No way. What's this?

535
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,293
- My gosh. - Joo Hyoung.

536
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:22,395
Thank you.

537
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:24,064
What?

538
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:26,934
- Han Seo. - No way.

539
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:28,104
(Director Lee gave each of them kind words as a gift.)

540
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,803
I was surprised by it.

541
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:33,674
He gave us a short letter and a scarf as a gift.

542
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:35,774
We had to maintain good vocal health,

543
00:30:36,145 --> 00:30:38,675
and he thought of that too with his gift.

544
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:41,214
I could tell he cared about us a lot,

545
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,345
which warmed up my heart.

546
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:46,813
I thought about what we could do...

547
00:30:46,814 --> 00:30:48,155
to give back all that we had received.

548
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:51,554
To win in the finals...

549
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:55,164
so that we could dedicate the victory to him,

550
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:56,523
I will give it my all.

551
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:57,695
We will win.

552
00:30:58,264 --> 00:31:00,164
(After their time with Director Lee Chang Sub,)

553
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:03,165
(the players of TEAM GROOVE show their determination.)

554
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:06,604
Since it's the finals,

555
00:31:06,605 --> 00:31:08,773
I will make sure not to have any regrets.

556
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:12,415
So that we can end the show with a smile,

557
00:31:12,544 --> 00:31:14,715
let's work hard until the very end.

558
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,044
Honestly, I have confidence in us.

559
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:18,685
We'll show you...

560
00:31:19,155 --> 00:31:22,054
what kind of players are on TEAM GROOVE.

561
00:31:22,685 --> 00:31:25,954
I want to make my debut...

562
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:27,355
with my teammates on TEAM GROOVE.

563
00:31:38,034 --> 00:31:42,405
("Universe (A Message that Will Reach Once the Curtain Rises)")

564
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,614
("Universe" by Park Han, Kim Joo Hyoung, Kenta,)

565
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:47,784
(Koo Han Seo, Kwon Hee Jun, Jang Kyung Ho, Kim Gi Joong)

566
00:31:58,254 --> 00:31:59,524
(Park Han)

567
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:29,455
(Gi Joong, Cha Woong Ki)

568
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:48,905
(Koo Han Seo)

569
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:34,615
(Kenta)

570
00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:10,684
(Kwon Hee Jun, Park Han)

571
00:35:13,385 --> 00:35:14,624
(Jang Kyung Ho)

572
00:35:25,995 --> 00:35:27,703
You're amazing!

573
00:35:27,704 --> 00:35:29,334
- Kenta! - Kenta!

574
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:32,304
- Kenta! - Kenta!

575
00:35:32,305 --> 00:35:34,603
You're so pretty!

576
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:39,215
That was TEAM GROOVE's performance of "Universe."

577
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:41,885
Kenta!

578
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:43,413
It was amazing!

579
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:44,414
Well done.

580
00:35:44,415 --> 00:35:45,454
Kenta!

581
00:35:46,184 --> 00:35:47,824
You did well!

582
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:49,784
You did well!

583
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:50,925
Director Lee Chang Sub.

584
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:54,225
You look more nervous than the players.

585
00:35:54,325 --> 00:35:55,394
How was their performance?

586
00:35:58,234 --> 00:36:00,233
I've never felt this way...

587
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:02,764
while filming Universe League.

588
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:04,874
I really got choked up today while watching their performance.

589
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:08,773
Our teammates have gone through so much...

590
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:10,043
and have worked so hard.

591
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:14,115
I really enjoyed their performance.

592
00:36:14,414 --> 00:36:17,043
You all went through so much and did a great job.

593
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:20,215
You still have the next performance, so stay alert.

594
00:36:20,584 --> 00:36:22,454
Let's continue to work hard. Great job!

595
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:25,624
Thank you.

596
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:26,995
You did so well.

597
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:29,195
- You did so well. - Director YUGYEOM.

598
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:33,035
TEAM BEAT is preparing for the next performance.

599
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:34,934
How was TEAM GROOVE's performance?

600
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:40,174
First of all, TEAM GROOVE's strength is in their singing.

601
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:42,805
Director Chang Sub did a great job instructing them.

602
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,914
I really enjoyed their singing.

603
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,785
It sounded very stable.

604
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:49,745
What surprised me...

605
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:54,754
was TEAM GROOVE's unexpected energy from the dancing.

606
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:56,055
It really surprised me.

607
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:58,495
I want to compliment them for doing a great job.

608
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:02,394
But get excited for TEAM BEAT as well.

609
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:04,965
- Yes! - You all really did a great job.

610
00:37:07,695 --> 00:37:09,734

00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:36,364
- Let's go! - Up next, TEAM BEAT...

624
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:37,934
is getting ready to perform.

625
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:41,603
Let's meet them right after the break!

626
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:42,415
Kenta!

627
00:37:43,025 --> 00:37:45,227
(Final league match ranking,)

628
00:37:45,274 --> 00:37:47,044
(3rd place)

629
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:51,914
(TEAM BEAT wasn't able to escape from 3rd place until the end.)

630
00:37:52,443 --> 00:37:54,854
(For a come-from-behind victory in the finals,)

631
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,454
(TEAM BEAT strengthened the team.)

632
00:37:58,783 --> 00:38:02,552
(Cha Woong Ki advanced to the finals by the fans' choice.)

633
00:38:02,553 --> 00:38:03,592
Kairi.

634
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:05,394
(With the directors' selection,)

635
00:38:05,794 --> 00:38:07,894
(TEAM BEAT's original 3 members advanced to the finals.)

636
00:38:08,794 --> 00:38:11,203
(They selected Zen Zen...)

637
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:14,204
(and Sirin to create a new vocal line.)

638
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:16,132
(Dong Yun, who was a former TEAM BEAT member,)

639
00:38:16,133 --> 00:38:17,673
(was brought back in as well!)

640
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:21,742
(A new TEAM BEAT was formed with a shocking lineup.)

641
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:25,813
- Hello. - Hello.

642
00:38:25,814 --> 00:38:27,283
Hi. Welcome.

643
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,183
Take your seats.

644
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:31,922
(What will the new TEAM BEAT sing in the finals?)

645
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:33,624
EL CAPITXN...

646
00:38:34,024 --> 00:38:36,153
always provides us with great songs.

647
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:42,263
(Director EL CAPTIXN always provided the best songs to TEAM BEAT.)

648
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:43,664
(It was because I felt ambitious!)

649
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:59,442
(What song did he bring this time?)

650
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:01,353
To be honest, I was really torn...

651
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:03,954
as it was the final performance and final song.

652
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:06,254
He brought another great song.

653
00:39:06,423 --> 00:39:08,193
(Very excited)

654
00:39:08,493 --> 00:39:10,524
It's a song that you can cry with or laugh to.

655
00:39:11,193 --> 00:39:13,422
(What kind of song is it?)

656
00:39:13,423 --> 00:39:16,664
I really wanted to express TEAM BEAT's story...

657
00:39:17,363 --> 00:39:19,434
through this song.

658
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:21,434
It's an emotional song...

659
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:23,774
that you can express your individual stories with.

660
00:39:24,243 --> 00:39:26,442
As it's about all of you,

661
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:28,144
you are the only ones who can express this song.

662
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:32,283
It will be the best if you guys can just...

663
00:39:32,644 --> 00:39:33,854
immerse in your own message.

664
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:38,354
(What is the final song that contains TEAM BEAT's message?)

665
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:40,592
("Sunset in the Sky:" "The world is filled with you,")

666
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:41,893
("and there will be no fear when we are together.")

667
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:43,524
(This sentiment is expressed like a panoramic view of the sunset.)

668
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:47,734
(TEAM BEAT members focus on the lyrics of the song.)

669
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:52,963
(The dream we dreamt of while looking at each other)

670
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:58,902
(I'm lost in you)

671
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:01,044
(The panorama that has spread out)

672
00:40:06,713 --> 00:40:10,684
(Remember that moment)

673
00:40:12,184 --> 00:40:13,184
That's amazing.

674
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:14,223
(The moment we got together)

675
00:40:14,224 --> 00:40:15,323
It's sad.

676
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:20,192
(I want to fill it up with you)

677
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:23,394
This is my third survival show.

678
00:40:23,803 --> 00:40:27,633
"The panorama that has spread out." I think this part...

679
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:31,604
can represent the long journey...

680
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:33,474
of the Universe League players.

681
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:38,013
If was as if everything that had happened until now...

682
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:41,513
had flashed through my head like a highlight.

683
00:40:41,854 --> 00:40:43,613
(TEAM BEAT's practice room a few days later)

684
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:46,883
(TEAM BEAT is practicing the final song.)

685
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:54,192
(The players are focused on the song more than on any other song.)

686
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:57,104
Director EL CAPITXN said this song was about us.

687
00:40:57,504 --> 00:41:01,434
He said that we could express the things we wanted to freely.

688
00:41:01,874 --> 00:41:03,774
We went through a lot of ups and downs, to be honest.

689
00:41:04,343 --> 00:41:08,914
I wanted to express the longing emotions I felt.

690
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:15,283
The members felt like family members.

691
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:17,323
I really want to make my debut with these members.

692
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:20,553
I wanted to express things brightly...

693
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:22,894
while imagining those dreamlike moments.

694
00:41:23,593 --> 00:41:28,262
I believe I've lived for this dream.

695
00:41:28,263 --> 00:41:32,434
(The players each express his own story with facial expressions.)

696
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:35,673
During the final performance, I will express my desperate heart...

697
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:37,743
and sincerity.

698
00:41:39,573 --> 00:41:43,273
(They prepare even their expressions perfectly...)

699
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:45,713
(for the final performance.)

700
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:49,553
(Looking emotional even with their backs)

701
00:41:54,894 --> 00:41:57,423
- Okay. Let's sit down. - Right.

702
00:41:58,124 --> 00:42:00,193
(Time for a short break)

703
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:02,263
This was something I thought about...

704
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:04,263
while dancing to this song.

705
00:42:04,763 --> 00:42:06,604
The song is called "Sunset in the Sky."

706
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:09,433
I thought that it would be great...

707
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:11,902
if we could sing this song under the sunset.

708
00:42:11,903 --> 00:42:13,003
(Impressed)

709
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:14,814
By the way,

710
00:42:15,343 --> 00:42:17,283
there's a place I really want to go.

711
00:42:18,044 --> 00:42:20,282
After coming to Korea,

712
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:22,382
I never was able to visit the Han River.

713
00:42:22,383 --> 00:42:23,823
(We haven't been there either.)

714
00:42:24,283 --> 00:42:25,724
- You never went to the Han River? - No.

715
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:27,954
- You too, Zen Zen? - Never.

716
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:30,823
Then should we all go to the Han River?

717
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:32,693
Let's get dressed and go to the Han River.

718
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:34,833
(Let's go to the Han River to see the sunset!)

719
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:36,363
- Let's go! - Let's go.

720
00:42:37,664 --> 00:42:40,433
- The sun is going down, guys. - It's so pretty!

721
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:41,533
Right. It's so pretty!

722
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:43,734
That is literally the "Sunset in the Sky."

723
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:48,173
(Singing...)

724
00:42:48,843 --> 00:42:51,442
(automatically)

725
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,983
(The final song pops out right away after seeing the sunset.)

726
00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:56,184
How was it being in Universe League?

727
00:42:56,584 --> 00:42:59,084
I'm having a lot more fun and happy...

728
00:43:00,184 --> 00:43:02,653
that I had imagined.

729
00:43:03,093 --> 00:43:04,124
It's because...

730
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:07,863
all of us here share the same dream.

731
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:11,063
Singing and dancing with people...

732
00:43:11,064 --> 00:43:14,533
who are working hard to chase that dream...

733
00:43:14,974 --> 00:43:16,073
is a lot of fun for me.

734
00:43:16,874 --> 00:43:17,902
That's what it's like for me.

735
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:19,442
I think I felt...

736
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:21,813
a lot more joy...

737
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:25,283
than suffering.

738
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:29,954
(We have all gathered to make our debut.)

739
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,853
(Connected with the same dream,)

740
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:37,822
(we have paced through our happy moments.)

741
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,524
When I see the sunset in the future,

742
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:41,963
I think it will remind me of these times.

743
00:43:43,263 --> 00:43:47,604
(The finish line has come before their eyes.)

744
00:43:48,633 --> 00:43:55,212
(They sing "Sunset in the Sky" under the sunset.)

745
00:43:55,213 --> 00:43:56,543
Until now,

746
00:43:56,544 --> 00:43:59,414
it was a panorama of the journey to my dream.

747
00:43:59,843 --> 00:44:01,984
I now wish to create a new panorama...

748
00:44:02,383 --> 00:44:03,553
that is called "debut."

749
00:44:04,084 --> 00:44:05,854
During this final performance,

750
00:44:06,954 --> 00:44:08,923
I wish all of us could be free from pressure.

751
00:44:09,823 --> 00:44:10,863
I wish for us to really enjoy it.

752
00:44:11,363 --> 00:44:14,693
I will write a page in my life that I will have no regrets about.

753
00:44:15,294 --> 00:44:16,533
I wish to express...

754
00:44:17,763 --> 00:44:19,962
"Sunset in the Sky" in our own ways.

755
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:21,234

Great work.

762
00:47:53,714 --> 00:47:55,414
You did well!

763
00:47:57,653 --> 00:47:58,653
Let's hear...

764
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,024
from the one who made this song.

765
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:04,164
Director EL CAPITXN, what did you think of their performance?

766
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:07,794
Gosh.

767
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:13,803
Personally,

768
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:17,172
I've been known to be someone...

769
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:19,474
who is dull with my emotions.

770
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:22,212
And I do agree with that myself.

771
00:48:22,213 --> 00:48:24,113
But after seeing this performance,

772
00:48:24,213 --> 00:48:25,984
I almost burst into tears.

773
00:48:27,044 --> 00:48:29,612
Well, I'm here with my mic...

774
00:48:29,613 --> 00:48:30,984
to assess the performance.

775
00:48:32,684 --> 00:48:34,394
But to be honest,

776
00:48:35,224 --> 00:48:37,024
I met these guys through this show,

777
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:41,733
but it didn't feel like a producer-participant relationship.

778
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:43,593
They felt like family members.

779
00:48:45,004 --> 00:48:46,434
Right.

780
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:49,032
They just showed...

781
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:50,774
an excellent performance,

782
00:48:50,903 --> 00:48:52,742
but even if they did make a huge mistake,

783
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:54,814
I would've adored them and said they did a great job.

784
00:48:56,414 --> 00:48:57,473
So...

786
00:48:59,113 --> 00:49:01,283
You guys did a great job and were adorable.

00:49:01,854 --> 00:49:02,883
I was able...

788
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:04,553
to feel...

00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,822
the moments...

TEAM BEAT's performance,

800
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:35,213
I thought they always performed with sincerity.

801
00:49:35,314 --> 00:49:37,782
I was able to really feel their sincerity again today.

802
00:49:37,783 --> 00:49:39,323

Singing.

I knew Yuito's Korean had improved a lot,

1038
01:00:07,383 --> 01:00:09,882
but I didn't know he'd show us this side of him.

(I Have Everything Like A Peddler, Zhang Shuaibo)

1066
01:01:12,713 --> 01:01:15,112
Zhang Shuaibo used his pockets...

to hold things such as roses and flower petals...

1068

01:01:52,624 --> 01:01:53,983
- What? - What was that?

1083
01:01:53,984 --> 01:01:55,254
Where did it come from?

1084
01:01:56,524 --> 01:01:59,394
(Endless items are coming out of Zhang Shuaemon's pockets.)

1085
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:01,863
Beauty.

1086
01:02:01,864 --> 01:02:03,593
When did he prepare that?

1087
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:05,533
(He even has more in the back pocket.)

1088
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:07,564
Pretty!

1089
01:02:08,234 --> 01:02:10,934
(Acknowledging he's a peddler)

1090
01:02:12,974 --> 01:02:15,474
(Flower petals as the finale)

1091
01:02:15,943 --> 01:02:17,873
(Zhang Shuaemon will continue to grow.)

1092
01:02:17,874 --> 01:02:20,383
Moving on, I will announce the next award.

1093
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:22,783
Awarded to the player who makes ladies' hearts flutter,

1094
01:02:23,383 --> 01:02:25,823
it's the "Imagine Dating You" Award.

1095
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:28,754
- Isn't it me? - I think it's me.

1096
01:02:29,394 --> 01:02:30,422
No, it's mine.

1097
01:02:30,423 --> 01:02:32,463
(All the players want the award.)

1098
01:02:33,164 --> 01:02:34,523
(Who is the icon of sweet and fluttering?)

1099
01:02:34,524 --> 01:02:36,993
The winner of the "Imagine Dating You" Award is...

1100
01:02:38,704 --> 01:02:41,203
Seo Jeong Woo.

1101
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:43,103
Okay.

1102
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:44,773
(Jeong Woo is surprised by his first award.)

1103
01:02:44,774 --> 01:02:46,443
- Congratulations. - I had no idea.

1104
01:02:48,774 --> 01:02:51,173
Seo Jeong Woo is given this award for making the ladies...

1105
01:02:51,274 --> 01:02:54,144
fall in love with him and becoming everyone's ideal type...

1106
01:02:54,443 --> 01:02:57,713
with his sweet tone and heart-fluttering smile.

1107
01:02:58,684 --> 01:03:01,052
(His smile is warm like the spring sunshine.)

1108
01:03:01,053 --> 01:03:02,053
I'm jealous.

1109
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:05,423
You won't vote for me? Then you can't see me anymore.

1110
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:07,363
(Hit with reality)

1111
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:10,064
(They can't help but laugh at their colleague's work.)

1112
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:12,333
I can't watch him.

1113
01:03:12,334 --> 01:03:14,033
Thank you for choosing me.

1114
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:17,504
The next award, the "Good At Everything" Award,

1115
01:03:17,604 --> 01:03:20,803
is for the player who is an all-rounder.

1116
01:03:21,474 --> 01:03:23,544
- Me? - I bet it's me.

1117
01:03:24,474 --> 01:03:27,044
(This time, it's me.)

1118
01:03:27,443 --> 01:03:28,953
The winner is...

1119
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:32,023
(Which all-rounder player will win the award?)

1120
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:36,492
- JL! - What?

1121
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:37,822
- What? - What?

1122
01:03:37,823 --> 01:03:38,894
- JL? - Are you sure?

1123
01:03:40,193 --> 01:03:41,322
(Upset)

1124
01:03:41,323 --> 01:03:43,294
- Why? - No, my name is Zhang Shuaibo.

1125
01:03:44,794 --> 01:03:47,902
You guys are so mean. Really.

1126
01:03:47,903 --> 01:03:48,974
(We're just joking.)

1127
01:03:49,934 --> 01:03:52,572
Skilled in singing, performing,

1128
01:03:52,573 --> 01:03:55,172
visuals, and languages, JL is given this award...

1129
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:59,013
for putting on an all-time legendary performance.

1130
01:04:00,914 --> 01:04:04,613
(The camera flashes are too much for JL.)

1131
01:04:05,684 --> 01:04:06,783
Congratulations.

1132
01:04:07,354 --> 01:04:10,423
Give us an acceptance speech, showing off your all-roundedness.

1133
01:04:11,294 --> 01:04:14,323
I shall prove it with my singing.

1134
01:04:14,923 --> 01:04:15,934
As expected.

1135
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:20,533
I will sing "The Little Prince" in five different languages.

1136
01:04:20,704 --> 01:04:22,903
- Nice. - What? In five languages?

1137
01:04:23,934 --> 01:04:27,704
(The little prince told me)

1138
01:04:27,874 --> 01:04:32,943
(Having someone like you)

1139
01:04:33,213 --> 01:04:35,754

1140
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:39,553

- Nice. - Thank you.

1147
01:05:00,243 --> 01:05:02,544

1148

the hearts of the fans with his lovely smile and cuteness.

Steven is given this award for spreading healthy energy...

1161
01:05:41,343 --> 01:05:45,354
with his solid muscles by working out regularly.

1162
01:05:46,053 --> 01:05:47,053
(Everyone is shocked.)

1163
01:05:47,053 --> 01:05:48,053
Those veins.

1164
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:51,124
It's thanks to these veins I won the award.

1165
01:05:51,524 --> 01:05:54,663

01:06:04,874 --> 01:06:06,273
- What? - What?

1170
01:06:06,274 --> 01:06:08,274
- What? Sit down. - What?

1171
01:06:08,374 --> 01:06:11,043
Everyone is expecting to get it.

1172
01:06:11,044 --> 01:06:12,084
Sit down.

I knew it.

1176
01:06:18,153 --> 01:06:20,224
Deep eyes...

1177
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:22,653
and a sharp nose.

1178
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:26,624

TEAM BEAT will perform first.

1236
01:09:26,944 --> 01:09:28,713
Let's check it out together.

1237
01:09:30,814 --> 01:09:32,883
- It's hard. - It's so difficult.

1238
01:09:33,213 --> 01:09:35,684
(TEAM BEAT members are writing something?)

1239
01:09:36,013 --> 01:09:37,683
I should write it pretty.

1240
01:09:37,684 --> 01:09:39,923
(What are they writing?)

1241
01:09:41,753 --> 01:09:45,153
The director wanted our story to be included...

1242
01:09:45,154 --> 01:09:46,694
in the song.

1243
01:09:46,864 --> 01:09:49,364
Writing lyrics is a first for me.

1244
01:09:49,734 --> 01:09:52,034
When we provide the ingredients,

1245
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,703
the director is going to cook with it.

1246
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:57,632
It's our team's last performance.

1247
01:09:57,633 --> 01:09:59,073
(TEAM BEAT's locker room on the day of the song reveal)

1248
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:00,373
I want this song...

1249
01:10:01,203 --> 01:10:03,843
to be about your story.

1250
01:10:04,314 --> 01:10:06,912
I think it will be most sincere...

1251
01:10:06,913 --> 01:10:10,513
when you write your own story.

1252
01:10:10,913 --> 01:10:14,583
My hope is that you would write the lyrics of this song.

1253
01:10:15,354 --> 01:10:16,953
Go write it right now.

1254
01:10:17,053 --> 01:10:18,354
- Understood. - Let's go.

1255
01:10:18,753 --> 01:10:22,894
Director EL CAPITXN gave us a chance to write the lyrics.

1256
01:10:23,494 --> 01:10:25,803
The title of this song is "Dreaming."

1257
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:28,662
("Dreaming:" A warm, wintery pop song,)

1258
01:10:28,663 --> 01:10:31,002
(capturing the excitement of the first snowfall...)

1259
01:10:31,003 --> 01:10:33,843
(and a special moment that came after a long wait)

1260
01:10:34,043 --> 01:10:36,813
Through Universe League...

1261
01:10:36,814 --> 01:10:38,813
and performing on many stages,

1262
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:41,583
we've had many dreamlike moments.

1263
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:45,113
Writing about the happy moments...

1264
01:10:45,114 --> 01:10:47,253
on Universe League is a good idea.

1265
01:10:47,724 --> 01:10:49,694
I have one unbelievable moment.

1266
01:10:49,793 --> 01:10:50,894
The most impressive moment.

1267
01:10:51,253 --> 01:10:52,263
When you met me?

1268
01:10:52,864 --> 01:10:54,262
When they took "MAMMA MIA."

1269
01:10:54,263 --> 01:10:56,994
(The song for Round 2)

1270
01:10:57,293 --> 01:10:59,762
(The very person who intercepted "MAMMA MIA")

1271
01:10:59,763 --> 01:11:00,864
I'll put that down in my lyrics.

1272
01:11:00,963 --> 01:11:01,963
Zen Zen.

1273
01:11:02,274 --> 01:11:04,274
Why did you do it, Zen Zen?

1274
01:11:04,774 --> 01:11:08,042
(Getting "MAMMA MIA" stolen was like a dream)

1275
01:11:08,043 --> 01:11:09,774
(Joking around)

1276
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,644
He can really hold a grudge.

1277
01:11:12,074 --> 01:11:14,343
(On mean leader mode)

1278
01:11:14,713 --> 01:11:18,984
Season-wise, winter popped up in my head.

1279
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:23,194
This show itself started in winter.

1280
01:11:23,724 --> 01:11:26,494
When winter started, we met our fans...

1281
01:11:26,894 --> 01:11:30,734
and made diverse memories together.

1282
01:11:31,034 --> 01:11:32,904
If we sing it in the final,

1283
01:11:33,503 --> 01:11:35,833
it'll be a special performance.

1284
01:11:36,404 --> 01:11:38,034
I wish...

1285
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:41,404
I could...

1286
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:43,114
debut...

1287
01:11:43,574 --> 01:11:44,614
with this team.

1288
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:47,212
That is my...

1289
01:11:47,213 --> 01:11:49,953
biggest goal.

1290
01:11:51,684 --> 01:11:52,753
My dream is...

1291
01:11:54,154 --> 01:11:56,994
to become an idol in Korea.

1292
01:11:57,894 --> 01:11:58,922
That's my dream.

1293
01:11:58,923 --> 01:12:00,922
(They all want to debut desperately.)

1294
01:12:00,923 --> 01:12:03,494
All seven of us...

1295
01:12:04,093 --> 01:12:05,393
want to debut...

1296
01:12:05,394 --> 01:12:07,463
- the most. - Yes.

1297
01:12:07,803 --> 01:12:10,203
- Are you ready to write it down? - Let's write...

1298
01:12:11,074 --> 01:12:12,074
about our hearts.

1299
01:12:12,974 --> 01:12:16,843
I was told to write about my own story.

1300
01:12:17,314 --> 01:12:19,483
It's hard,

1301
01:12:19,484 --> 01:12:22,952
but I think it's a good opportunity...

1302
01:12:22,953 --> 01:12:25,413
to deliver our honest opinions.

1303
01:12:27,253 --> 01:12:28,283
(Writing my story toward debut)

1304
01:12:28,284 --> 01:12:31,453
I wrote about "dreaming..."

1305
01:12:31,753 --> 01:12:35,093
with my own sentiment.

1306
01:12:35,864 --> 01:12:38,494
My lyrics say...

1307
01:12:39,404 --> 01:12:41,104
it feels like a dream, but it's not a dream.

1308
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,474
So I will cherish it.

1309
01:12:43,934 --> 01:12:45,873
And it also talks about...

1310
01:12:46,774 --> 01:12:48,644
my fans...

1311
01:12:49,673 --> 01:12:50,974
and how they see me.

1312
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:53,944
So...

1313
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:56,082
that makes my dream to debut.

1314
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:58,252
(My dream is to debut.)

1315
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,452
(Debut)

1316
01:13:00,453 --> 01:13:02,792
(They had a long journey on Universe League to debut.)

1317
01:13:02,793 --> 01:13:05,422
I'm Keum Jin Ho. I was born in 2000. Nice to meet you.

1318
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:06,922
(They had a long journey on Universe League to debut.)

1319
01:13:06,923 --> 01:13:09,863
Hello. I was born in 2003. I'm Japanese. I'm Kairi.

1320
01:13:09,864 --> 01:13:12,093
- Jin Ho, Kairi, Yuito, and I... - Hello.

1321
01:13:12,303 --> 01:13:15,703
went for this dream for a long time.

1322
01:13:16,173 --> 01:13:19,303
Zen Zen, Dong Yun, and Sirin...

1323
01:13:19,703 --> 01:13:22,512
just took...

1324
01:13:22,513 --> 01:13:24,813
their first steps.

1325
01:13:24,814 --> 01:13:27,144
Hello. I'm Sirin.

1326
01:13:27,213 --> 01:13:30,284
Still, our goals...

1327
01:13:32,213 --> 01:13:33,724
and our wishes...

1328
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:35,453
are...

1329
01:13:36,293 --> 01:13:38,553
bigger than those of other teams.

1330
01:13:39,564 --> 01:13:42,592
(People with the same goal...)

1331
01:13:42,593 --> 01:13:46,003
(gathered and sweated to practice together.)

1332
01:13:46,434 --> 01:13:51,303
(They laughed, had fun,)

1333
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:55,503
(and went for their dreams together.)

1334
01:13:55,873 --> 01:14:02,814
(Sometimes they were in despair after failing...)

1335
01:14:03,684 --> 01:14:07,422
(and shed painful tears.)

1336
01:14:07,423 --> 01:14:12,663
(and shed painful tears.)

1337
01:14:14,994 --> 01:14:18,762
(Yet, TEAM BEAT became one even before they knew it.)

1338
01:14:18,763 --> 01:14:21,463
(Yet, TEAM BEAT became one even before they knew it.)

1339
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:24,904
This was...

1340
01:14:25,574 --> 01:14:26,944
the first time...

1341
01:14:28,303 --> 01:14:29,373
I realized...

1342
01:14:29,744 --> 01:14:31,413
that I could rely...

1343
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,083
on my teammates.

1344
01:14:34,413 --> 01:14:37,313
TEAM BEAT is as precious...

1345
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:40,553
as my family.

1346
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:44,593
We didn't only get closer. We became one.

1347
01:14:46,163 --> 01:14:50,132
(You came like the first snow, it's really you)

1348
01:14:50,133 --> 01:14:52,533
(It feels like a dream)

1349
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:54,833
(To sing this song for you)

1350
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:59,002
(This day feels like a gift)

1351
01:14:59,003 --> 01:15:01,373
(Dreaming in midwinter)

1352
01:15:02,274 --> 01:15:03,513
This is the final.

1353
01:15:04,173 --> 01:15:07,343
I want to debut with the other guys.

1354
01:15:08,843 --> 01:15:10,383
This is the last chance.

1355
01:15:10,814 --> 01:15:12,083
They know how desperate we are...

1356
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,953
more than anyone else.

1357
01:15:15,854 --> 01:15:16,854
TEAM BEAT...

1358
01:15:17,253 --> 01:15:20,293
plans to prove ourselves once again after Round Three.

1359
01:15:20,963 --> 01:15:22,934
We'll put on a performance...

1360
01:15:23,093 --> 01:15:25,734
where both the audience and performers are happy.

1361
01:15:26,604 --> 01:15:27,662
Please vote for us.

1362
01:15:27,663 --> 01:15:28,702
(Please vote for us.)

1363
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:29,703
Please vote for us.

1364
01:15:31,003 --> 01:15:32,773
TEAM BEAT, let's debut!

1365
01:15:32,774 --> 01:15:34,873
(How's the earnest "Dreaming" performance by TEAM BEAT?)

1366
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,323
("Dreaming" by Cha Woong Ki, Zen Zen, Kairi, Sirin,)

1367
01:15:50,324 --> 01:15:51,894
(Kim Dong Yun, Keum Jin Ho, Yuito)

1368
01:16:02,503 --> 01:16:03,703
(Cha Woong Ki)

1369
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:06,123
Cha Woong Ki!

1370
01:19:06,984 --> 01:19:09,394
"Dreaming" by TEAM BEAT.

1371
01:19:14,994 --> 01:19:17,564
Director YUGYEOM.

1372
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,133
What did you think of their performance?

1373
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:23,103
I said this...

1374
01:19:23,104 --> 01:19:24,673
to them before.

1375
01:19:25,034 --> 01:19:26,303
The audience can see and feel...

1376
01:19:26,604 --> 01:19:29,713
how much they practiced.

1377
01:19:29,814 --> 01:19:30,873
Once again,

1378
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:33,883
they had perfect teamwork.

1379
01:19:34,284 --> 01:19:36,013
Their teamwork...

1380
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:39,684
stood out. They're very kind...

1381
01:19:41,724 --> 01:19:44,224
and lovely. Please...

1382
01:19:44,593 --> 01:19:45,593
help them.

1383
01:19:50,434 --> 01:19:52,702

1386

1388
01:20:14,053 --> 01:20:16,052
- Let's go. - Good luck.

1389
01:20:16,053 --> 01:20:18,894
Next up is TEAM GROOVE.

1390
01:20:20,694 --> 01:20:23,564
Let's meet them soon.

1391
01:20:25,248 --> 01:20:28,439
(Where is the warm melody coming from on this cold winter day?)

1392
01:20:28,999 --> 01:20:32,409
(TEAM GROOVE is practicing for the finals.)

1393
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,550
Okay.

1394
01:20:40,279 --> 01:20:44,119
The sign language at the end is the highlight.

1395
01:20:44,419 --> 01:20:48,050
What should we do to make it stand out?

1396
01:20:48,459 --> 01:20:50,390
"You In The Same Place" has...

1397
01:20:50,659 --> 01:20:53,590
sign language in the choreography.

1398
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,158
We need a song...

1399
01:20:55,159 --> 01:20:58,328
to touch everyone in the finals.

1400
01:20:58,329 --> 01:20:59,829
And only TEAM GROOVE can do that.

1401
01:21:00,369 --> 01:21:01,429
The second song is...

1402
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,439
(TEAM GROOVE's locker room)

1403
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:06,668
"You In The Same Place."

1404
01:21:06,669 --> 01:21:07,708
"You In The Same Place."

1405
01:21:07,709 --> 01:21:11,879
We watch our fans from the stage.

1406
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,748
It means you want them to be in the same place...

1407
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:17,050
wherever you are.

1408
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,749
There's sign language in the choreography.

1409
01:21:20,749 --> 01:21:22,919
There's sign language in the choreography.

1410
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:29,859
(The sign language means "You In The Same Place.")

1411
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:32,529
I guess that means "you."

1412
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:34,270
This means "you."

1413
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,868
"Missing You" by BTOB also has sign language.

1414
01:21:36,869 --> 01:21:38,340
This is sign language.

1415
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:40,269
(Sign language is also in "Missing You.")

1416
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,440
It means "missing you."

1417
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,549
When I was performing "Missing You,"

1418
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:49,618
someone was watching TV with her hearing-impaired sister.

1419
01:21:49,619 --> 01:21:50,818
And her sister cried so much...

1420
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:52,419
while watching "Missing You."

1421
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:54,149
Because this was sign language.

1422
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:55,559
(Director Chang Sub was impressed by the lyrics in sign language.)

1423
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,319
So she was touched.

1424
01:21:57,690 --> 01:21:58,858
I hope...

1425
01:21:58,859 --> 01:22:01,998
someone finds your choreography touching.

1426
01:22:01,999 --> 01:22:03,158
(Prepared with a wish for them to be singers of positive influence)

1427
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:05,060
The choreography involves sign language.

1428
01:22:05,869 --> 01:22:07,770
And I found it...

1429
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:11,169
touching.

1430
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,840
I will focus on my fingertips...

1431
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:16,940
when I dance.

1432
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:24,319
(TEAM GROOVE is practicing the sign language.)

1433
01:22:25,249 --> 01:22:27,049
Even the slightest difference in the fingertips...

1434
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:29,390
felt like a different story.

1435
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:32,328
So I focused on it so much.

1436
01:22:32,329 --> 01:22:34,690
We don't only sing with our voices...

1437
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:36,759
but with our hands too.

1438
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,669
It's more touching...

1439
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,099
and overwhelming.

1440
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,038
(We hope our song touches everyone.)

1441
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:45,810
(5 days before the finals)

1442
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:47,668
This and this...

1443
01:22:47,669 --> 01:22:49,339
- This is nice and simple. - Yes.

1444
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,809
- This... - Han Seo, do you like this?

1445
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:52,479
- That, and... - Then I'll choose this.

1446
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,549
No.

1447
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:54,708
- I choose this. - The circle.

1448
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:58,219
Since the choreography has sign language...

1449
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:01,288
and involves a lot of hand gestures,

1450
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:04,289
we decided to choose a design for that.

1451
01:23:04,489 --> 01:23:07,729
We thought about a way to make it stand out more.

1452
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:09,998
And we decided to get matching bracelets.

1453
01:23:09,999 --> 01:23:10,999
(They decided to get matching bracelets.)

1454
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,429
If we make them,

1455
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:14,230
- there are only seven in the world. - Yes.

1456
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,568
(That's a crazy approach!)

1457
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:18,640
I choose this.

1458
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:20,309
- Me too. - Yes? Then...

1459
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:21,879
- I think this is the best. - Not bad.

1460
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:23,479
You can try it on if you want.

1461
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,680
(They decided to engrave GROOVE on a simple bracelet.)

1462
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:26,379
- Here we go. - Yes.

1463
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,109
- What? Are we starting? - Let's go.

1464
01:23:28,209 --> 01:23:29,448
Let us debut.

1465
01:23:29,449 --> 01:23:32,090
(Engraving the first letter in excitement)

1466
01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:34,090
What?

1467
01:23:34,289 --> 01:23:35,289
I did it.

1468
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:37,089
Nice.

1469
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:39,089
- I did it. - Yes.

1470
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:41,789
- We'll use this as an example. - Please.

1471
01:23:42,859 --> 01:23:45,198
(The players engrave...)

1472
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:51,039
(each letter carefully.)

1473
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:54,269
The result isn't what I expected.

1474
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,778
- Hey. - This is the worst one.

1475
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:58,510
- It means a lot because we made it. - Yes.

1476
01:23:59,449 --> 01:24:01,349
TEAM GROOVE.

1477
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,318
Why don't we make one more for our director?

1478
01:24:03,319 --> 01:24:04,350
- Sure. - Sounds good.

1479
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,919
Let's make the same one.

1480
01:24:06,789 --> 01:24:09,089
(Good idea!)

1481
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:10,618
Simple is the best.

1482
01:24:10,619 --> 01:24:12,289
It'll be a surprise.

1483
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:15,799
(With memories of TEAM GROOVE,)

1484
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,430
(they make bracelets.)

1485
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,869
Meticulously.

1486
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:32,310
(The one and only TEAM GROOVE made its bracelets.)

1487
01:24:32,779 --> 01:24:37,079
(There's one for Director Chang Sub as well.)

1488
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,519
Isn't this nice?

1489
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,649
(Feeling proud)

1490
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:43,789
We took this chance...

1491
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:46,988
to make a team bracelet.

1492
01:24:46,989 --> 01:24:50,930
This represents our friendship.

1493
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,829
I'm proud of it.

1494
01:24:55,169 --> 01:24:57,440
Just like the title,

1495
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,538
wherever we are,

1496
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:02,908
I hope we're always together.

1497
01:25:02,909 --> 01:25:04,778
We shed tears together.

1498
01:25:04,779 --> 01:25:05,779
(While they ran toward their dream together...)

1499
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:08,408
We sweated together. I'm grateful.

1500
01:25:08,409 --> 01:25:10,050
I want to say I love them.

1501
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,589
Let's do our best until the end,

1502
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,789
so we can win and debut together.

1503
01:25:16,289 --> 01:25:18,019
- Gi Joong of TEAM GROOVE. - Joo Hyoung of TEAM GROOVE.

1504
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:19,828
- Han Seo of TEAM GROOVE. - Park Han of TEAM GROOVE.

1505
01:25:19,829 --> 01:25:20,829
Kenta of TEAM GROOVE.

1506
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,698
- Kyung Ho of TEAM GROOVE. - Hee Jun of TEAM GROOVE.

1507
01:25:22,699 --> 01:25:25,299
(How is "You In The Same Place" by TEAM GROOVE?)

1508
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:28,899
- Wait for us, finals. We're coming! - We're coming!

1509
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,440
(How is "You In The Same Place" by TEAM GROOVE?)

1510
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:42,179
("You In The Same Place")

1511
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:44,418
Kim Joo Hyoung, you're so pretty.

1512
01:25:44,419 --> 01:25:45,918
- Kenta, you're the best. - Kim Joo Hyoung.

1513
01:25:45,919 --> 01:25:47,248
("You In The Same Place" by Park Han, Kim Joo Hyoung,)

1514
01:25:47,249 --> 01:25:48,789
(Kenta, Koo Han Seo, Kwon Hee Jun, Jang Kyung Ho, Kim Gi Joong)

1515
01:26:50,449 --> 01:26:52,020
(Park Han)

1516
01:28:12,699 --> 01:28:13,800
(Joo Hyoung)

1517
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,190
(Park Han)

1518
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:37,279
Joo Hyoung!

1519
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:39,220
So cool!

1520
01:29:39,819 --> 01:29:41,719
Koo Han Seo, you're so pretty.

1521
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:45,119
"You In The Same Place" by TEAM GROOVE.

1522
01:29:45,959 --> 01:29:47,488
- Awesome. - Kenta.

1523
01:29:47,489 --> 01:29:49,600
Good job, Jang Kyung Ho!

1524
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:54,869
Director Lee Chang Sub, what did you think of their performance?

1525
01:29:55,529 --> 01:29:58,569
It was touching.

1526
01:29:58,770 --> 01:29:59,810
And...

1527
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:02,809
it's sad that...

1528
01:30:02,810 --> 01:30:04,879
that's our last performance...

1529
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:06,709
on Universe League.

1530
01:30:09,449 --> 01:30:10,520
I hope you win...

1531
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,689
so we'll one day...

1532
01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:16,090
perform together on the same stage.

1533
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,190
Well done. Good job.

1534
01:30:19,459 --> 01:30:20,459
Well done.

1535
01:30:20,630 --> 01:30:22,658
Kyung Ho, good job!

1536
01:30:22,659 --> 01:30:24,498
- Well done. - Good job!

1537
01:30:24,499 --> 01:30:26,669
- Don't cry, Jang Kyung Ho. - Good job.

1538
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,039
Now, if you root for TEAM GROOVE,

1539
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,909
join the final vote.

1540
01:30:33,609 --> 01:30:34,739
Koo Han Seo!

1541
01:30:35,069 --> 01:30:36,078
So cute.

1542
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:37,379
You're so cute!

1543
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:40,108
- Koo Han Seo! - Jang Kyung Ho!

1544
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:41,278
Kenta!

1545
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:43,049
- Well done. - Kenta.

1546
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,578
- You're good. - So cute.

1547
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:45,889
- Koo Han Seo. - You can do it.

1548
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:46,890
Kenta!

1549
01:30:46,891 --> 01:30:49,219
Kyung Ho, you're the best.

1550
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,720
- First place! - Kenta.

1551
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,889
- So cute. - Kyung Ho, don't cry.

1552
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,488
Kenta, you're so cute.

1553
01:30:55,489 --> 01:30:57,300
Universe League, debut war.

1554
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:00,498
The last performance in the second half...

1555
01:31:00,499 --> 01:31:02,299
is by TEAM RHYTHM.

1556
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:05,099
- Kyung Ho, you're so cute. - Let's watch it together.

1557
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:06,440
So cute.

1558
01:31:07,209 --> 01:31:09,909
(After the finalist announcement)

1559
01:31:10,209 --> 01:31:12,480
(In awe)

1560
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:15,650
(Smiling)

1561
01:31:18,949 --> 01:31:21,819
(TEAM RHYTHM's directors are practicing with the players?)

1562
01:31:22,489 --> 01:31:25,730
(Focused)

1563
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:28,130
Is this real?

1564
01:31:28,329 --> 01:31:32,429
We're doing the choreography with them.

1565
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:35,940
They wanted to support us for the finals.

1566
01:31:36,270 --> 01:31:38,600
When I heard they were going to give us a one-point lesson,

1567
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,840
I felt reassured and honored.

1568
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,608
Everyone in a different angle.

1569
01:31:44,609 --> 01:31:45,609
(Two directors' special lesson for TEAM RHYTHM)

1570
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:49,249
Our song is cheerful and bright. It's nice, but...

1571
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:53,219
I was worried about the details...

1572
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:54,749
we had to work on.

1573
01:31:55,859 --> 01:31:59,019
("La Fiesta: A song about boys' expectations...)

1574
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:01,158
(about their new start after a long journey.)

1575
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:03,359
(An exciting Nu-disco-style dance pop song)

1576
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:14,510
(TEAM RHYTHM has a complex choreography as expected.)

1577
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:19,079
("La Fiesta" will complete TEAM RHYTHM's last journey.)

1578
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:21,009
- I was a little worried. - This is...

1579
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:22,479
Then, Directors TEN and YANGYANG were...

1580
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,579
- It's different from this. - going to help us.

1581
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,089
They felt reliable.

1582
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:28,619
(Reliable)

1583
01:32:28,919 --> 01:32:30,488
Here,

1584
01:32:30,489 --> 01:32:33,529
you should draw a big circle.

1585
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:38,300
(He looks cool when he's doing his job.)

1586
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:40,499
(Exclaiming endlessly)

1587
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:44,069
They're really good.

1588
01:32:44,739 --> 01:32:47,310
One of my role models in dancing.

1589
01:32:47,569 --> 01:32:51,538
I'm really happy that we made it with our directors.

1590
01:32:51,539 --> 01:32:52,708
(Focusing)

1591
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:55,380
I thought K-pop stars were amazing.

1592
01:32:56,419 --> 01:32:58,219
- Ready to try? - Yes.

1593
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,650
- Yes. - Let's go slowly. First. Here.

1594
01:33:01,419 --> 01:33:02,419
Here.

1595
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:04,889
Hit and circle.

1596
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:06,959
(Going slowly so everyone can follow)

1597
01:33:07,289 --> 01:33:09,300
Open your hand.

1598
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:11,199
As if you're pushing.

1599
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,800
(The advanced dancers catch up without a problem.)

1600
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:14,769
Push and catch.

1601
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:17,840
Here, kick.

1602
01:33:18,569 --> 01:33:19,569
(Turn!)

1603
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,608
(Like this?)

1604
01:33:22,609 --> 01:33:23,609
This is going to be hard.

1605
01:33:24,779 --> 01:33:26,179
(Catching sharply)

1606
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:29,480
When you do this, keep it sharp.

1607
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:31,919
As if you're the tough guy in the last festival.

1608
01:33:32,449 --> 01:33:33,449
"I'll take you."

1609
01:33:33,450 --> 01:33:36,159
- With that impression. - "It's you."

1610
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:38,390
"It's you."

1611
01:33:38,959 --> 01:33:42,329
Hit your hands like this.

1612
01:33:43,329 --> 01:33:46,400
(The director's special lesson is easy to understand.)

1613
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,669
At first, I was thinking...

1614
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:51,139
of going like this.

1615
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:53,840
As if you were sending a kiss.

1616
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,680
If you have any other ideas, share them with us.

1617
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:00,850
This...

1618
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:04,318
Or you could do this.

1619
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:07,190
(Ju Won works on the choreography alone.)

1620
01:34:07,919 --> 01:34:11,159
(Enthusiastic)

1621
01:34:11,459 --> 01:34:12,788
Can you play the music?

1622
01:34:12,789 --> 01:34:13,789
(As soon as the director plays the music,)

1623
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,800
(Ju Won practices his idea to the music.)

1624
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,069
(Impressed)

1625
01:34:24,499 --> 01:34:26,209
(The last chorus in "La Fiesta")

1626
01:34:26,909 --> 01:34:28,270
(Instead of pointing inside the jacket,)

1627
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,778
(he shakes his hand near the shoulder.)

1628
01:34:34,779 --> 01:34:36,219
Do you want to go with that? I like it.

1629
01:34:36,220 --> 01:34:37,279
- Sorry? - I like it.

1630
01:34:37,619 --> 01:34:38,850
- Do you? - I like it.

1631
01:34:40,789 --> 01:34:43,859
If you get to debut,

1632
01:34:43,989 --> 01:34:46,430
sometimes, you have to share your ideas.

1633
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,630
It's never wrong to share your ideas.

1634
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:51,559
Share it, try it,

1635
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:55,669
- and use the best idea. - Okay.

1636
01:34:56,039 --> 01:34:57,039
That's my opinion.

1637
01:34:57,239 --> 01:34:58,799
If you're scared, you can't do it.

1638
01:34:58,800 --> 01:34:59,810
Don't hesitate to do it.

1639
01:34:59,909 --> 01:35:02,068
Can I face JL...

1640
01:35:02,069 --> 01:35:03,908
- and try it together? - Let's see.

1641
01:35:03,909 --> 01:35:06,980
(Ju Won enthusiastically shares his idea.)

1642
01:35:07,180 --> 01:35:09,350
Something like that. After facing each other.

1643
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,788
How about this?

1644
01:35:12,789 --> 01:35:14,449
Let's try that. I like it.

1645
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:17,358
I shared a lot of my ideas,

1646
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:19,730
and they let us choose.

1647
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:22,329
I was grateful.

1648
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:24,459
Okay. Let's try it with the music.

1649
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:33,869
(Everyone focuses on the director's lesson.)

1650
01:35:34,069 --> 01:35:35,708
It was already an honor...

1651
01:35:35,709 --> 01:35:38,779
to dance with Directors TEN and YANGYANG.

1652
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:43,119
I was grateful when they taught us in person.

1653
01:35:43,619 --> 01:35:45,079
To make up for their support,

1654
01:35:45,579 --> 01:35:47,749
I must place first.

1655
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:51,690
- Yes. There. - Two, and...

1656
01:35:52,119 --> 01:35:53,129
- Yes. - Yes.

1657
01:35:53,130 --> 01:35:54,130
(Directors TEN and YANGYANG's one-point lesson is over.)

1658
01:35:56,230 --> 01:36:01,668
(Practicing hard to remember the directors' lesson)

1659
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:06,238
Everyone is focusing on the rhythm.

1660
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:08,668
We're working to put on the best performance...

1661
01:36:08,669 --> 01:36:10,440
without wasting our time.

1662
01:36:11,239 --> 01:36:15,748
All seven of us are practicing hard...

1663
01:36:15,749 --> 01:36:20,590
to pull off the last performance.

1664
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:26,559
(Practicing every day...)

1665
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,459
(for the last festival and the new start)

1666
01:36:30,499 --> 01:36:36,400
(The final day is drawing near.)

1667
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,869
(Their last practice for the final ends.)

1668
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:42,470
Let's go.

1669
01:36:42,609 --> 01:36:44,439
- Let's go, everyone. - Yes.

1670
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,479
- Let's go. Get your stuff. - We're off.

1671
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,948
- Bye. - Bye.

1672
01:36:48,949 --> 01:36:50,278
Let's pull it off tomorrow.

1673
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:51,279
- We're off. - Bye.

1674
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,889
- Bye. - Bye.

1675
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,288
- Bye. - Bye.

1676
01:36:54,289 --> 01:36:55,289
- Bye. - Bye.

1677
01:36:55,290 --> 01:36:58,520
(Leaving the practice room for the last time)

1678
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,930
- It's cold. - It's cold.

1679
01:37:02,959 --> 01:37:04,659
This is our first time going home together.

1680
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,400
- Right? - This is the first time.

1681
01:37:06,499 --> 01:37:07,499
Yes.

1682
01:37:08,169 --> 01:37:09,230
So nice.

1683
01:37:09,669 --> 01:37:12,100
- Yes. - It's nice. It's pretty.

1684
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:14,639
- I... - It's N Seoul Tower.

1685
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,709
(The members stopped to see the night view.)

1686
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:17,880
Is that N Seoul Tower?

1687
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:19,880
I've never seen it before.

1688
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:23,119
I've never visited it before. I want to go.

1689
01:37:23,919 --> 01:37:27,590
I hope to make more memories with you.

1690
01:37:27,989 --> 01:37:31,759
This could be our last time going home together.

1691
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,130
(Sad)

1692
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:36,159
If we get to debut together,

1693
01:37:38,230 --> 01:37:39,899
we can debut...

1694
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,630
No, go home together.

1695
01:37:44,169 --> 01:37:47,140
We'll pull it off. We've been doing our best.

1696
01:37:49,579 --> 01:37:51,709
I don't know if we can debut or not,

1697
01:37:52,039 --> 01:37:56,818
but when I go back to the agency after the finals tomorrow,

1698
01:37:56,819 --> 01:37:59,819
I hope everyone is there.

1699
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:03,419
I don't have a choice. I have to debut with them.

1700
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:06,889
This isn't the end.

1701
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:08,430
It's only the beginning of TEAM RHYTHM.

1702
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:09,800
- Yes. - That's true.

1703
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:11,230
Good.

1704
01:38:11,231 --> 01:38:14,130
Let's turn the final into our festival.

1705
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:15,770
Let's win.

1706
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:18,340
- TEAM RHYTHM, let's debut! - TEAM RHYTHM.

1707
01:38:19,169 --> 01:38:20,169
Scream!

1708
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:21,569
Let's debut.

1709
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:33,289
Let's go!

1710
01:38:34,390 --> 01:38:37,059
("La Fiesta" by JL, Steven, Zhang Shuaibo, Chih En,)

1711
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:39,190
(Park Ju Won, Daisuke, Seo Jeong Woo)

1712
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:51,770
(Chih En)

1713
01:39:08,489 --> 01:39:09,489
(JL)

1714
01:40:16,659 --> 01:40:17,890
(JL)

1715
01:41:05,169 --> 01:41:06,239
(Park Ju Won)

1716
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,238
So cool!

1717
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:49,310
This was "La Fiesta" by TEAM RHYTHM!

1718
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:55,619
Director TEN,

1719
01:41:56,249 --> 01:41:57,390
how was it?

1720
01:41:57,959 --> 01:41:59,520
Yes, today...

1721
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:01,630
You've worked so hard...

1722
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:03,998
over the past few months.

1723
01:42:03,999 --> 01:42:06,699
The performance was especially amazing today.

1724
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:10,100
Watching everyone enjoy themselves...

1725
01:42:10,340 --> 01:42:12,698
onstage today...

1726
01:42:12,699 --> 01:42:14,970
made me so happy as well.

1727
01:42:15,310 --> 01:42:17,739
- You're awesome. - Thanks for your efforts.

1728
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:21,608
(JL)

1729
01:42:21,609 --> 01:42:23,979
If you support TEAM RHYTHM,

1730
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:26,079
cast your final vote right now.

1731
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:31,589
(Final On Air Voting: Enter the QR code through...)

1732
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:37,229
(KTOPSTAR, SBS, and H1GHER and participate in the vote.)

1733
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:43,270
(KTOPSTAR, SBS, and H1GHER and participate in the vote.)

1734
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:46,340
- You did well. - You can do this!

1735
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:48,408
- You can do it! - JL!

1736
01:42:48,409 --> 01:42:50,510
Universe League, final war.

1737
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:54,278
We've now seen all the performances.

1738
01:42:54,279 --> 01:42:55,350
You did well!

1739
01:42:56,350 --> 01:42:59,380
Which team among TEAM RHYTHM,

1740
01:42:59,919 --> 01:43:00,989
TEAM GROOVE,

1741
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:03,659
and TEAM BEAT will debut?

1742
01:43:05,619 --> 01:43:07,390
The voting will now close.

1743
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:29,449
(The voting is now closed.)

1744
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:40,028
(First shoot of Universe League)

1745
01:43:40,029 --> 01:43:42,358
- BEAT, GROOVE, RHYTHM. - Oh, RHYTHM.

1746
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:45,099
- There are uniforms! - They're gorgeous.

1747
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:48,100
BEAT, GROOVE, RHYTHM. Oh, it's a different team.

1748
01:43:48,230 --> 01:43:49,328
(The first moment with excitement and nervousness)

1749
01:43:49,329 --> 01:43:51,239
Do we need to wear it once our team gets decided?

1750
01:43:51,499 --> 01:43:53,469
- I want to go to TEAM RHYTHM. - I see.

1751
01:43:53,470 --> 01:43:54,868
(The first moment with excitement and nervousness)

1752
01:43:54,869 --> 01:43:56,810
- I'll choose TEAM GROOVE. - Okay.

1753
01:43:59,010 --> 01:44:00,079
(Park Han)

1754
01:44:00,409 --> 01:44:01,880
Please wear your uniforms.

1755
01:44:02,709 --> 01:44:07,049
(We became a team once we wore the team uniform.)

1756
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:08,119
Let's go.

1757
01:44:15,529 --> 01:44:18,599
(And now, my name is engraved on that uniform.)

1758
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,970
I think the only thing I can say is...

1759
01:44:21,369 --> 01:44:24,039
TEAM RHYTHM will win the Prism Cup.

1760
01:44:25,539 --> 01:44:29,209
To show why I've been chasing my dream all this time...

1761
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,980
I'll show you everything I have in the finals.

1762
01:44:33,779 --> 01:44:34,850
I put my life on the line.

1763
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:37,679
I'm going to give it my all, no matter what.

1764
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,118
I want to...

1765
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:41,889
debut as TEAM BEAT.

1766
01:44:41,890 --> 01:44:46,389
(Facing the uniform...)

1767
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:51,699
(that carries our name and story)

1768
01:44:55,029 --> 01:44:56,100
"Seo Jeong Woo."

1769
01:44:56,270 --> 01:45:00,270
(My own uniform with my name, "Seo Jeong Woo")

1770
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:01,769
"JL."

1771
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:03,408
(My own uniform with my name, "JL")

1772
01:45:03,409 --> 01:45:04,480
Gosh, what's this?

1773
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,749
(Reading the room)

1774
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,578
The close calls and tense moments flashed through my mind.

1775
01:45:11,579 --> 01:45:12,649
(Seeing the uniform with his name on it fills him with excitement)

1776
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:13,650
I love it.

1777
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:22,760
(What's this?)

1778
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:28,970
(The fans' messages written beside the uniform)

1779
01:45:34,539 --> 01:45:37,709
Did the fans send these messages themselves?

1780
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:41,079
My goodness. This is amazing.

1781
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:44,520
They're messages from the fans.

1782
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:46,819
(Hello. I'm Ju Won's fan in Japan. I'm also a senior in high school.)

1783
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,720
(Touched)

1784
01:45:54,789 --> 01:45:55,789
There's my name here.

1785
01:46:00,669 --> 01:46:02,399
"Han, I hope the final is yours..."

1786
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,569
"as you've waited so long for it. I love you so much."

1787
01:46:09,709 --> 01:46:11,310
I feel...

1788
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:13,109
It's a bit strange.

1789
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:17,279
Thank you for the support.

1790
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:21,749
"You don't have to dance alone in front of the mirror anymore."

1791
01:46:22,119 --> 01:46:24,090
"Please debut and let us hear you sing."

1792
01:46:31,959 --> 01:46:32,999
I've realized now...

1793
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:35,828
that it's truly happy...

1794
01:46:35,829 --> 01:46:39,300
to stand onstage...

1795
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,739
and show myself to others.

1796
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:45,380
So I won't give up, and I'll debut.

1797
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:48,949
"To Kyung Ho, whom I miss so much."

1798
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:52,249
"Thank you for not giving up and doing so well."

1799
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:55,720
"You didn't let the world defeat you. You kept yourself strong."

1800
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:58,760
Thank you so much.

1801
01:47:00,989 --> 01:47:03,560
I didn't give up...

1802
01:47:04,699 --> 01:47:07,669
because of the fan that wrote this message to me.

1803
01:47:08,329 --> 01:47:10,069
I seriously didn't give up...

1804
01:47:10,539 --> 01:47:12,640
thanks to the fans.

1805
01:47:13,909 --> 01:47:14,909
So I thank you.

1806
01:47:15,739 --> 01:47:18,709
I'm all teary now. I'm in trouble.

1807
01:47:19,810 --> 01:47:21,680
Hee Jun must've cried reading this.

1808
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:24,078
"To Hee Jun, who said this was your last challenge,"

1809
01:47:24,079 --> 01:47:27,050
"I hope this becomes a new start, not the end. Cheering for you."

1810
01:47:28,119 --> 01:47:31,190
One, two, three, tears!

1811
01:47:31,919 --> 01:47:32,959
"Kwon Hee Jun."

1812
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:35,629
"I think it's time for you to debut now."

1813
01:47:35,630 --> 01:47:37,759
(He sobs uncontrollably.)

1814
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,600
"You shine onstage now."

1815
01:47:42,529 --> 01:47:45,039
"You must debut, Hee Jun. You can do it!"

1816
01:47:48,909 --> 01:47:52,340
"Hee Jun, thank you for enduring until now."

1817
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:55,010
"I love you so much,"

1818
01:47:55,909 --> 01:47:57,550
"and let's walk on a path of flowers from now on."

1819
01:47:58,919 --> 01:47:59,919
I'll...

1820
01:48:00,789 --> 01:48:01,850
debut no matter what...

1821
01:48:03,090 --> 01:48:04,418
and repay all this love.

1822
01:48:04,419 --> 01:48:06,220
(I'll debut no matter what and repay all this love.)

1823
01:48:06,859 --> 01:48:08,630
I can't do this anymore.

1824
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:16,198
"The strongest center, Kenta."

1825
01:48:16,199 --> 01:48:18,668
(The strongest center, Kenta)

1826
01:48:18,669 --> 01:48:20,470
Will I suit the center?

1827
01:48:21,869 --> 01:48:24,379
"Kenta, you're an awesome singer..."

1828
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:27,509
"and performer. I like your deep voice..."

1829
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:29,209
"when you sing 'Prison.'"

1830
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:33,350
"Prison" is really...

1831
01:48:33,789 --> 01:48:34,919
My voice is low,

1832
01:48:35,249 --> 01:48:37,619
but I love it.

1833
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:41,529
Please give lots of love to "Prison,"

1834
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:45,029
and listen to it often.

1835
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,970
Promise me, everyone.

1836
01:48:47,869 --> 01:48:49,470
Oh, is this the hand gesture in Korea?

1837
01:48:50,699 --> 01:48:52,100
In Japan, we do it like this.

1838
01:48:52,999 --> 01:48:55,839
What's this? "Even if your voice cracks, you're still the best."

1839
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,479
(Even if your voice cracks, you're still the best, Kim Gi Joong.)

1840
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:01,510
"Even if your voice cracks, you're still the best, Kim Gi Joong."

1841
01:49:02,109 --> 01:49:04,149
I'll practice harder...

1842
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:07,020
for my voice not to crack.

1843
01:49:10,489 --> 01:49:11,489
"Koo Han Seo,"

1844
01:49:11,989 --> 01:49:13,319
"go get that trophy!"

1845
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:16,390
"Joo Hyoung, make history."

1846
01:49:18,029 --> 01:49:19,230
"Make history."

1847
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:22,999
I'll be together with TEAM GROOVE.

1848
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:26,469
I'll make history with them. Please stay tuned.

1849
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:28,209
(I'll make history with TEAM GROOVE.)

1850
01:49:29,109 --> 01:49:30,109
"How are you?"

1851
01:49:31,010 --> 01:49:33,179
"It must've been hard for you to be the eldest on the team."

1852
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:34,980
"Thank you for always being by TEAM BEAT."

1853
01:49:35,180 --> 01:49:37,449
"I was happy to see you every week."

1854
01:49:37,819 --> 01:49:39,720
"I hope I can see you more often."

1855
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:42,389
It wasn't hard at all to be the eldest on the team.

1856
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:44,390
There was no such hardship.

1857
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:46,318
The members gave back...

1858
01:49:46,319 --> 01:49:48,430
as much as I put in.

1859
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:50,930
"Thank you for always being by TEAM BEAT."

1860
01:49:51,359 --> 01:49:53,260
This is what I want to say to the members.

1861
01:49:53,999 --> 01:49:55,028
Thank you.

1862
01:49:55,029 --> 01:49:56,099
(Thank you, everyone.)

1863
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:59,100
"Even when I couldn’t hear anything about you,"

1864
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,640
"I always waited for you."

1865
01:50:02,209 --> 01:50:03,880
"Now, I want to become a strong fan..."

1866
01:50:04,109 --> 01:50:07,150
"you can always rely on..."

1867
01:50:07,579 --> 01:50:08,980
Meeting you all...

1868
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:12,380
made me rely on you and be happy.

1869
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:15,949
I could have this bright energy...

1870
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:18,759
thanks to you all.

1871
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:20,060
(All thanks to the fans)

1872
01:50:20,390 --> 01:50:21,390
"Sirin, baby,"

1873
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:23,389
"we saw your efforts."

1874
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:26,260
"Don't give up on your dreams. Your voice is amazing."

1875
01:50:29,829 --> 01:50:32,239
Everyone knows that this is my dream.

1876
01:50:32,569 --> 01:50:34,640
Thank you to everyone who supports me.

1877
01:50:34,869 --> 01:50:36,640
"You can do it! I love you."

1878
01:50:36,770 --> 01:50:38,880
Thank you so much.

1879
01:50:39,209 --> 01:50:42,379
I love my fans too.

1880
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:46,618
I'm grateful and feel strengthened...

1881
01:50:46,619 --> 01:50:48,248
by the fact...

1882
01:50:48,249 --> 01:50:50,818
that I can continue to receive support from someone.

1883
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:53,389
"Zen Zen, you're seriously talented,"

1884
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:55,759
"positive, and funny."

1885
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,229
"You're doing so well."

1886
01:50:58,230 --> 01:51:00,899
"I'll vote for you until the end."

1887
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,470
My goodness.

1888
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:05,440
This message is...

1889
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,869
I feel like I'm going to cry.

1890
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:09,909
My gosh.

1891
01:51:10,209 --> 01:51:12,380
(Choked up)

1892
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:15,650
Oh, my.

1893
01:51:18,119 --> 01:51:21,119
My favorite performance so far...

1894
01:51:21,650 --> 01:51:22,988
was...

1895
01:51:22,989 --> 01:51:24,159
(What was your favorite performance on Universe League?)

1896
01:51:24,789 --> 01:51:27,329
"Give Me That."

1897
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:30,529
It was a stage we worked so hard to prepare for...

1898
01:51:30,829 --> 01:51:34,100
when TEAM RHYTHM first came together,

1899
01:51:34,499 --> 01:51:36,369
and the energy...

1900
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:39,739
Everything we felt during that performance...

1901
01:51:39,940 --> 01:51:42,668
will be something I'll never forget.

1902
01:51:42,669 --> 01:51:45,140
That stage is my all-time favorite.

1903
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:51,949
"When your name was called by Directors TEN and YANGYANG,"

1904
01:51:52,949 --> 01:51:57,288
"you cried, and I can't forget that."

1905
01:51:57,289 --> 01:51:59,818
"I thought about the difficulty..."

1906
01:51:59,819 --> 01:52:04,429
"you must've faced after coming to Korea at the age of 14."

1907
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:07,069
"Still, I’m proud of how you've been persevering,"

1908
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:11,770
"working hard, and staying bright."

1909
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:14,069
"Let's debut, Daisuke. I love you."

1910
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:18,708
"Jeong Woo, you turned..."

1911
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:20,949
"a world that was hard to live in into one we want to live in."

1912
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:22,709
"You're like Superman."

1913
01:52:23,619 --> 01:52:25,479
"Seeing you work hard, even when it’s tough,"

1914
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,090
"to become an idol made me think,"

1915
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,549
"'I should work hard too.'"

1916
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:32,189
"'I need to live so that one day...'"

1917
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:33,789
"'I can meet you.'"

1918
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:36,230
"Seo Jeong Woo, you can do it! I love you."

1919
01:52:40,199 --> 01:52:43,229
"Thank you for not giving up on your dreams."

1920
01:52:43,230 --> 01:52:46,640
"Let's debut in Universe League," Steven!"

1921
01:52:46,739 --> 01:52:49,368
"Don't be stressed. You're already amazing."

1922
01:52:49,369 --> 01:52:51,879
"Don't compare yourself to others."

1923
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,809
"Because you're already perfect the way you are."

1924
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:57,118
"You just need to enjoy the journey..."

1925
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:59,650
"with TEAM RHYTHM."

1926
01:53:00,619 --> 01:53:04,458
(The love of their fans are engraved deeply in their heats.)

1927
01:53:04,459 --> 01:53:08,488
(The love of their fans are engraved deeply in their heats.)

1928
01:53:08,489 --> 01:53:09,789
I think I'll cry.

1929
01:53:10,190 --> 01:53:11,828
(If you could frame one moment from Universe League,)

1930
01:53:11,829 --> 01:53:13,060
(what would it be?)

1931
01:53:13,529 --> 01:53:15,470
Why is this so sad?

1932
01:53:15,999 --> 01:53:17,499
I feel sad all of a sudden.

1933
01:53:18,039 --> 01:53:19,270
Seriously.

1934
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:32,979
(He holds back his tears and reads the messages from the fans.)

1935
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:37,190
(He holds back his tears and reads the messages from the fans.)

1936
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:38,459
Seriously.

1937
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,589
"JL, you should know that..."

1938
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:45,998
(JL, you made my life better.)

1939
01:53:45,999 --> 01:53:48,799
"You should know that you made my life so much better."

1940
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,139
"You inspire me to be a better version of myself."

1941
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:52,140
"I feel..."

1942
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:55,439
"I feel like I can do it too."

1943
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,440
"You're such a ray of sunshine."

1944
01:53:57,640 --> 01:54:00,449
"Don't ever lose that beautiful smile of yours."

1945
01:54:00,779 --> 01:54:03,448
"I wish you all the best in life. I'm always..."

1946
01:54:03,449 --> 01:54:05,720
(I hope your life is always full of luck.)

1947
01:54:06,050 --> 01:54:07,090
Seriously.

1948
01:54:13,619 --> 01:54:14,858
(The reason behind JL's tears)

1949
01:54:14,859 --> 01:54:17,329
This is because...

1950
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:20,528
before I came to Universe League,

1951
01:54:20,529 --> 01:54:22,528
I worried a lot.

1952
01:54:22,529 --> 01:54:24,600
(I was worried about whether I could do well.)

1953
01:54:25,470 --> 01:54:30,309
Looking at this comment,

1954
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:31,879
(The warm words from the fans comforted him and made him cry.)

1955
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:34,480
I feel so happy.

1956
01:54:41,150 --> 01:54:47,590
"We know your wounds well."

1957
01:54:48,190 --> 01:54:53,230
"I wanted to say this to you."

1958
01:54:53,869 --> 01:54:59,139
"I'm truly grateful for your courage."

1959
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:01,709
(I wanted to say this to you. I'm truly grateful for your courage.)

1960
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:05,908
"I'm so excited to see how your smile will..."

1961
01:55:05,909 --> 01:55:08,010
"warm the hearts of so many people."

1962
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:11,479
"I hope your future is filled with shining days."

1963
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:14,049
"I’ll always be by your side."

1964
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:15,118
"Please keep going."

1965
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,189

2136
02:10:28,328 --> 02:10:29,758
Hi.

2137
02:10:30,599 --> 02:10:31,599
I'm...

2138
02:10:32,429 --> 02:10:34,599
RHYTHM... Am I no longer in TEAM RHYTHM?

2139
02:10:35,269 --> 02:10:37,239
JL of AHOF.

2140
02:10:39,468 --> 02:10:40,868
First off...

2141
02:10:42,069 --> 02:10:45,038
First off, thank you very much...

2142
02:10:45,338 --> 02:10:47,809
to everyone who made this happen.

2143
02:10:49,748 --> 02:10:52,479
Actually, before coming to Korea,

2144
02:10:52,718 --> 02:10:56,118
I was extremely worried.

2145
02:10:56,519 --> 02:10:58,888
Little did I know I'd receive...

2146
02:10:58,889 --> 02:11:01,889
so much love and attention from many of you...

2147
02:11:02,359 --> 02:11:03,758
onstage.

2148
02:11:05,729 --> 02:11:08,368
I want to thank everyone...

2149
02:11:09,168 --> 02:11:11,038
who has joined me...

2150
02:11:11,868 --> 02:11:13,868
in my journey on Universe League.

2151
02:11:14,208 --> 02:11:16,378
I love you, my directors.

2152
02:11:17,109 --> 02:11:18,508
My friends.

2153
02:11:19,708 --> 02:11:22,279
Especially my new family.

2154
02:11:22,878 --> 02:11:24,718
I love you, AHOF.

2155
02:11:25,878 --> 02:11:26,949
And...

2156
02:11:27,618 --> 02:11:31,359
I love you all so much.

2157
02:11:32,758 --> 02:11:35,998
I love you.

2158
02:11:36,359 --> 02:11:39,429
I will work harder from now on. Thank you.

2159
02:11:40,029 --> 02:11:41,769
JL!

2160
02:11:43,968 --> 02:11:46,269
Please hand the mic over to the next player. Thanks.

2161
02:11:48,468 --> 02:11:49,479
Let's hear it from Steven.

2162
02:11:50,809 --> 02:11:53,008
- Hi. I'm Steven. - Steven!

2163
02:11:53,349 --> 02:11:55,577
Firstly, I'm very grateful...

2164
02:11:55,578 --> 02:11:57,649
to Universe League.

2165
02:11:57,949 --> 02:11:59,319
Thank you for giving me...

2166
02:12:00,019 --> 02:12:02,519
the opportunities and experiences.

2167
02:12:02,819 --> 02:12:05,888
Secondly, to my fans.

2168
02:12:05,889 --> 02:12:09,428
Thank you to my fans for rooting for me...

2169
02:12:09,429 --> 02:12:11,699
and loving me until the very end.

2170
02:12:13,798 --> 02:12:16,698
And I'd like to thank the agency...

2171
02:12:16,699 --> 02:12:19,337
for giving me the chance...

2172
02:12:19,338 --> 02:12:21,968
to be on this show.

2173
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:26,149
Directors. I love you.

2174
02:12:26,779 --> 02:12:29,819
Thank you very much...

2175
02:12:30,248 --> 02:12:32,018
for choosing me from the beginning...

2176
02:12:32,019 --> 02:12:34,689
and helping me perform in TEAM RHYTHM...

2177
02:12:34,918 --> 02:12:36,559
from start to finish...

2178
02:12:37,019 --> 02:12:39,628
and shine. I love you.

2179
02:12:41,328 --> 02:12:42,328
Right.

2180
02:12:42,899 --> 02:12:45,627
To the trainees...

2181
02:12:45,628 --> 02:12:48,868
I'm unable to debut with.

2182
02:12:49,168 --> 02:12:50,199
Really.

2183
02:12:50,798 --> 02:12:52,967
You are all cool,

2184
02:12:52,968 --> 02:12:55,069
good at what you're doing, and amazing.

2185
02:12:56,078 --> 02:12:58,309
Let's succeed...

2186
02:12:58,979 --> 02:13:02,208
and meet at the TV stations.

2187
02:13:07,618 --> 02:13:10,418
Let's listen to Zhang Shuaibo's speech next.

2188
02:13:10,519 --> 02:13:11,559
Thank you.

2189
02:13:11,689 --> 02:13:13,088
Zhang Shuaibo!

2190
02:13:13,189 --> 02:13:15,529
Hi, I'm Zhang Shuaibo.

2191
02:13:17,828 --> 02:13:19,728
Being able to meet everyone again...

2192
02:13:19,729 --> 02:13:21,828
through Universe League...

2193
02:13:22,128 --> 02:13:23,998
makes me so happy.

2194
02:13:26,138 --> 02:13:27,209
Thank you very much...

2195
02:13:27,769 --> 02:13:30,808
to the fans who voted for me.

2196
02:13:34,648 --> 02:13:37,148
Before starting again,

2197
02:13:38,648 --> 02:13:39,719
I...

2198
02:13:45,258 --> 02:13:47,388
- Don't cry, Zhang Shuaibo! - Zhang Shuaibo!

2199
02:13:48,359 --> 02:13:49,359
I...

2200
02:13:54,498 --> 02:13:56,668
- You did well! - Good job!

2201
02:13:57,299 --> 02:13:59,269
Before starting again, I...

2202
02:13:59,869 --> 02:14:00,969
wasn't sure if...

2203
02:14:02,209 --> 02:14:03,238
I could...

2204
02:14:08,879 --> 02:14:09,879
Thank you.

2205
02:14:11,619 --> 02:14:13,118
- All right. - You're the best, Zhang Shuaibo!

2206
02:14:13,119 --> 02:14:15,488
Let's hear it from Park Ju Won next.

2207
02:14:20,359 --> 02:14:23,057
Right now,

2208
02:14:23,058 --> 02:14:26,398
this very moment feels very surreal.

2209
02:14:26,998 --> 02:14:28,498
Thank you to my fans...

2210
02:14:28,898 --> 02:14:30,837
for loving me...

2211
02:14:30,838 --> 02:14:33,668
and adoring me despite how much I lack.

2212
02:14:34,539 --> 02:14:35,539
And...

2213
02:14:40,408 --> 02:14:42,818
As much as the love I received,

2214
02:14:43,519 --> 02:14:46,219
I will always smile next to you...

2215
02:14:46,519 --> 02:14:49,388
and work hard to become a singer...

2216
02:14:49,719 --> 02:14:53,258
who can make you smile. Thank you.

2217
02:14:54,029 --> 02:14:56,459
Also, thank you to the directors.

2218
02:14:56,699 --> 02:14:59,898
I have learned a lot. Thank you to my teacher.

2219
02:15:00,228 --> 02:15:01,299
Lastly,

2220
02:15:03,299 --> 02:15:04,338
let's keep in touch.

2221
02:15:06,709 --> 02:15:08,869
Okay. Let's listen to Daisuke's speech next.

2222
02:15:12,679 --> 02:15:15,508
Hi. I'm Daisuke.

2223
02:15:17,078 --> 02:15:18,078
Performing...

2224
02:15:18,549 --> 02:15:21,849
in TEAM RHYTHM...

2225
02:15:23,219 --> 02:15:25,219
from start to end...

2226
02:15:25,719 --> 02:15:27,689
made me...

2227
02:15:28,988 --> 02:15:31,498
really happy. Really.

2228
02:15:32,158 --> 02:15:34,298
I'd like to thank...

2229
02:15:34,299 --> 02:15:37,498
the directors. Thank you very much.

2230
02:15:38,469 --> 02:15:39,539
But...

2231
02:15:40,668 --> 02:15:42,168
I'm...

2232
02:15:44,379 --> 02:15:46,609
still too young.

2233
02:15:48,008 --> 02:15:50,119
With the others...

2234
02:15:50,318 --> 02:15:52,219
I will work hard...

2235
02:15:52,478 --> 02:15:54,449
with the other older members.

2236
02:15:54,748 --> 02:15:55,988
I am in your care.

2237
02:15:56,918 --> 02:15:57,988
Yes.

2238
02:15:58,359 --> 02:16:00,588
Next is Seo Jeong Woo's speech.

2239
02:16:03,258 --> 02:16:04,929
Hi. I'm Seo Jeong Woo.

2240
02:16:08,099 --> 02:16:10,897
First off, everything on Universe League...

2241
02:16:10,898 --> 02:16:14,308
was a first for me. It was unfamiliar and awkward.

2242
02:16:14,709 --> 02:16:16,439
Thank you to my fellow trainees,

2243
02:16:16,939 --> 02:16:19,679
who have helped me every time.

2244
02:16:20,279 --> 02:16:21,779
And thank you...

2245
02:16:22,779 --> 02:16:25,549
to the production crew, who always took great care of us.

2246
02:16:27,148 --> 02:16:29,789
My parents, always supporting me from afar...

2247
02:16:30,959 --> 02:16:32,758
and cheering me on in whatever I do.

2248
02:16:33,228 --> 02:16:34,758
Thank you very much.

2249
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:38,599
Thank you to my younger sibling.

2250
02:16:41,498 --> 02:16:44,337
And thank you to my fans for loving me...

2251
02:16:44,338 --> 02:16:46,438
despite how much I lack. I love you.

2252
02:16:46,439 --> 02:16:49,237
(Seo Jeong Woo)

2253
02:16:49,238 --> 02:16:51,138
All right. Chih En's speech is next.

2254
02:16:55,179 --> 02:16:58,478
Hi. I'm Chih En of Universe League.

2255
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:02,417
Firstly, I'd like to thank my fans and family...

2256
02:17:02,418 --> 02:17:04,718
for loving me and rooting for me...

2257
02:17:04,719 --> 02:17:06,629
until now.

2258
02:17:07,129 --> 02:17:09,758
Thanks to everyone, I'm able to stand here.

2259
02:17:10,228 --> 02:17:13,598
And thank you to my TEAM RHYTHM members...

2260
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:15,529
for taking care of me.

2261
02:17:16,099 --> 02:17:18,338
I'd like to express how much I love them.

2262
02:17:19,398 --> 02:17:22,108
Lastly, I have a player...

2263
02:17:22,109 --> 02:17:25,709
I want to thank dearly while participating in Universe League.

2264
02:17:28,008 --> 02:17:30,719
And it's Kwon Hee Jun.

2265
02:17:38,119 --> 02:17:39,158
Actually, I...

2266
02:17:52,068 --> 02:17:54,307
Whenever I have it hard or am worried,

2267
02:17:54,308 --> 02:17:57,539
I'm the type to endure it and not tell others.

2268
02:17:58,408 --> 02:18:00,609
But being with me during those times...

2269
02:18:00,978 --> 02:18:02,907
and thinking about my problems together...

2270
02:18:02,908 --> 02:18:05,119
cheered me up.

2271
02:18:13,529 --> 02:18:16,029
It would've been nice if we had debuted together.

2272
02:18:16,289 --> 02:18:18,328
It's a shame we can't.

2273
02:18:19,658 --> 02:18:20,668
From now on,

2274
02:18:23,039 --> 02:18:25,638
I will always do my best...

2275
02:18:26,238 --> 02:18:27,238
and put on...

2276
02:18:27,738 --> 02:18:29,168
the greatest performances.

2277
02:18:30,709 --> 02:18:34,448
Please love and root for me.

2278
02:18:34,449 --> 02:18:37,779
Great work to all the players and production crew.

2279
02:18:38,119 --> 02:18:39,418
I love you. Thank you.

2280
02:18:40,019 --> 02:18:42,048
(Cha Woong Ki, Congratulations on your debut.)

2281
02:18:42,049 --> 02:18:43,119
Good work.

2282
02:18:43,318 --> 02:18:45,019
Next is Cha Woong Ki.

2283
02:18:49,328 --> 02:18:52,359
This is the moment I've been dreaming of...

2284
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:53,969
for years.

2285
02:18:57,238 --> 02:18:58,269
I'll forget about...

2286
02:18:59,039 --> 02:19:01,168
all those times I've failed.

2287
02:19:01,939 --> 02:19:04,609
As a member of AHOF,

2288
02:19:05,379 --> 02:19:08,379
I will only move forward.

2289
02:19:08,609 --> 02:19:09,679
Our...

2290
02:19:10,619 --> 02:19:13,248
Our members of TEAM BEAT who wanted to...

2291
02:19:14,388 --> 02:19:17,289
but couldn't join us in the final performances.

2292
02:19:20,129 --> 02:19:23,058
You will forever live in my heart as members of TEAM BEAT.

2293
02:19:24,328 --> 02:19:29,068
Our team was in third place from start to finish.

2294
02:19:29,799 --> 02:19:30,799
No!

2295
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:32,638
Even if it was just once,

2296
02:19:33,568 --> 02:19:37,039
I hoped we could've gotten a better result.

2297
02:19:39,738 --> 02:19:43,619
To the members of TEAM BEAT, who have always been...

2298
02:19:44,418 --> 02:19:46,888
in first place in my heart.

2299
02:19:48,088 --> 02:19:53,158
Thank you for being by my side.

2300
02:19:53,629 --> 02:19:56,599
I want to tell them how much I relied on them...

2301
02:19:57,299 --> 02:19:58,699
and that they cheered me on.

2302
02:19:59,529 --> 02:20:01,827
And thank you to everyone who gives me energy...

2303
02:20:01,828 --> 02:20:03,638
and cheers for me. I love you.

2304
02:20:04,898 --> 02:20:06,468
(Cha Woong Ki)

2305
02:20:06,469 --> 02:20:10,209
And lastly, let's listen to Park Han.

2306
02:20:12,008 --> 02:20:13,109
Park Han!

2307
02:20:15,648 --> 02:20:16,747
Congratulations!

2308
02:20:16,748 --> 02:20:17,748
- Right. - Congratulations!

2309
02:20:21,888 --> 02:20:24,488
I'm in total bliss right now.

2310
02:20:26,558 --> 02:20:27,658
The seven years...

2311
02:20:28,588 --> 02:20:31,258
made my debut feel out of my reach.

2312
02:20:33,668 --> 02:20:36,029
Thinking those long years...

2313
02:20:36,898 --> 02:20:37,939
finally...

2314
02:20:40,068 --> 02:20:44,279
bore fruit makes me incredibly happy.

2315
02:20:44,539 --> 02:20:47,548
And Director Chang Sub,

2316
02:20:47,549 --> 02:20:49,849
who always embraced us with love.

Thank you very much.

02:20:57,719 --> 02:20:58,758
It's a shame...

2320
02:21:00,258 --> 02:21:01,828
we can't debut together.

2321
02:21:02,558 --> 02:21:04,529
But I will be rooting for everyone's future.

2322
02:21:05,758 --> 02:21:08,199
And I once mentioned...

2323
02:21:11,568 --> 02:21:15,039
that I wanted to perform on a stage,

2324
02:21:15,709 --> 02:21:17,879
and not dance and sing before a mirror.

2325
02:21:20,949 --> 02:21:24,578
I'm happy my first performance was in front of you.

2326
02:21:25,019 --> 02:21:26,887
- Don't say that! - Come on!

2327
02:21:26,888 --> 02:21:28,619
I will forever return the kindness. Thank you.

2328
02:21:30,658 --> 02:21:31,758
