1
00:00:03,563 --> 00:00:05,434
A world where the winner takes all.

2
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:09,274
But it is not sports.

3
00:00:10,874 --> 00:00:12,274
It is Universe League.

4
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:17,314
(Universe League)

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:18,714
RHYTHM.

6
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:20,554
GROOVE.

7
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:22,214
BEAT.

8
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:25,924
Three teams are competing for the one and only Prism Cup.

9
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:28,453
Who will be winning the Prism Cup,

10
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:30,963
winning the glory and the chance to debut?

11
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:36,563
Forty-two players enter the fierce battle for their debut.

12
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:45,343
I'll use every possible means to beat everyone.

13
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:47,044
(I will crush the performance.)

14
00:00:48,514 --> 00:00:51,743
(The players' fierce performances with their dreams on the line)

15
00:00:54,783 --> 00:00:57,584
(And a battle to scout players with the directors' pride at stake.)

16
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,454
You can use HYBE's practice rooms here.

17
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:06,094
I'll take you to HYBE's practice rooms.

18
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:08,334
Your weapon...

19
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:09,963
is your vocals.

20
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:13,034
Come to the team that will help you use your weapon wisely.

21
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:15,773
(The starting players are selected.)

22
00:01:15,773 --> 00:01:18,674
(21 players have not been picked.)

23
00:01:20,743 --> 00:01:23,013
You are given...

24
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:24,713
one more chance.

25
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:27,183
It is the Bench Test.

26
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:28,984
(Bench Test, the last chance to survive)

27
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:30,554
I was waiting for my turn.

28
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:33,153
The meaning of this time

29
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:34,653
(Disappointed)

30
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:35,653
(I'm losing it.)

31
00:01:35,653 --> 00:01:37,463
(I want to try.)

32
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,094
(You are eliminated.)

33
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:46,734
(What is the fate of the players who are not chosen?)

34
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,204
Boys' dream match, Universe League.

35
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:51,344
(Universe League)

36
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,944
(The draft has left some happy and others sad.)

37
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:59,084
A total of 21 players have become...

38
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:01,383
the starting player of the three teams.

39
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:04,883
On the bench...

40
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:07,183
are 21 players who have not been picked.

41
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:10,153
(What is the fate of the players on the verge of elimination?)

42
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:12,424
The teamless players on the bench...

43
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:14,463
cannot participate...

44
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,963
in Universe League if they are not scouted to a team.

45
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,304
You cannot participate...

46
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:20,773
(The players are eliminated if not picked.)

47
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:24,604
(Someone might leave this place.)

48
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:27,343
Today? Are they eliminated today?

49
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:30,313
I have been living for this dream.

50
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,843
I don't want to end it here.

51
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:35,283
I don't think I'm incompetent.

52
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:39,153
I know I will get another chance to stand onstage.

53
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,993
I'm starting to get nervous myself.

54
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:48,164
The last chance to be scouted into a team.

55
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:49,764
It's the Bench Test.

56
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:51,334
(Bench Test)

57
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:53,204
Bench Test? What is that?

58
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:56,674
- Bench Test? - What is a Bench Test?

59
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,773
(The last chance for the teamless players)

60
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:02,443
The Bench Test will be conducted 1-on-1 with the directors.

61
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:03,813
Go ahead.

62
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,484
Can you show us some dance or rap?

63
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:07,414
- Can you show us what you prepared? - Yes.

64
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,454
The player picked out by the directors...

65
00:03:10,454 --> 00:03:12,153
(The player picked out by the directors...)

66
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:14,394
must sing and dance.

67
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:16,523
If the player passes,

68
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:18,623
he will become the team's bench player.

69
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:20,223
(Scouted as a team bench player)

70
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:21,433
(Disappointed)

71
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,234
- Oh, no. - I will do anything.

72
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,664
Players not picked in this test...

73
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:28,334
are eliminated.

74
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:31,144
(The players gather for the Bench Test.)

75
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,204
Like this all at once?

76
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:35,773
Will they perform in front of them?

77
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:45,824
(The directors also move for the test.)

78
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,023
They're too close.

79
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:54,634
If I lose this last chance, it'll be the end.

80
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,563
I was waiting for my turn.

81
00:03:58,704 --> 00:04:00,873
I couldn't miss this chance.

82
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:03,304
Everyone here is desperate.

83
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:05,273
I should prove myself more.

84
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:10,943
(The Bench Test will change the fate of the 21 players.)

85
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:12,044
Directors.

86
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,054
Start the 1-on-1 test with the player you want 1st.

87
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,683
- Don't you want to test him? - Come.

88
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,453
Like this?

89
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:25,664
(Director Lee Chang Sub carefully looks at the players.)

90
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,034
Why don't we go over there too?

91
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,133
- Take good care of us. - Good luck!

92
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:34,034
(Who will TEAM BEAT test first?)

93
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,414
- We wanted to test you, Han Seo. - I see. Hi.

94
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:48,753
(Koo Han Seo gets a chance at the test.)

95
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,683
(Koo Han Seo was in "Siren,")

96
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:54,024
(the stage the directors highly praised.)

97
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:56,623
Compared to the other teams,

98
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,724
I think we have better average talent.

99
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,133
I was determined to win...

100
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,734
one of the bench seats.

101
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:07,164
- What you prepared... - Yes. Should I start right away?

102
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:09,203
- Can we have a look? - Yes, I'm ready.

103
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:14,813
(He starts right away without any hesitation.)

104
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,743
This is KWANGYA

105
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:20,513
(Drawing the players' attention)

106
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:21,914
I can feel the tension under my skin

107
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:23,154
I might cross the line

108
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,953
This is awesome wild, just like a zoo

109
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:27,993
An instinctive dance

110
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:32,024
Partying, feeling young, you know what to do

111
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:35,794
(He ends the test with confidence.)

112
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:39,364
- I like him. What do you think? - I do too.

113
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:41,674
- Thank you. - Thank you.

114
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:46,503
(Player Koo Han Seo is scouted as TEAM BEAT's bench player.)

115
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:51,943
- Nice! - Han Seo!

116
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,183
- Hi. - Nice.

117
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,623
- Who do we have? - Second,

118
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:03,094
let's test the redhead right away.

119
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,924
Let's test him before the other two teams take him.

120
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:13,104
- Hi, Kairi. - Hi.

121
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:17,373
You've been looking at our team since earlier.

122
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,474
Do you want to join our team?

123
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:22,114
Yes.

124
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,114
- Are you okay with it? - Yes.

125
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,914
- Nice. Okay. - I am in your care.

126
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:25,914
Thanks in advance.

127
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:27,044
(Player Kairi gets a chance to test.)

128
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,714
I hope he does well. Good luck, Kairi.

129
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:37,794
So that no one can see you

130
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:45,063
(With relaxed moves, Kairi performs with accurate Korean pronunciation.)

131
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:48,633
A black shadow awakes within me

132
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:51,743
I have been living for this dream.

133
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:54,344
I don't want to lose here.

134
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:58,443
I can't lose.

135
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:01,354
I performed with the thought of advancing.

136
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:03,753
I growl

137
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,253
If you don't step back, you might get hurt

138
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:10,893
What do you think?

139
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:15,433
I thought I wouldn't get nervous.

140
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:17,094
But it was the opposite.

141
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,164
This player is already...

142
00:07:22,073 --> 00:07:24,373
- Congratulations. - Gosh, thank you.

143
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:27,304
- No, don't do that. - Come on.

144
00:07:27,404 --> 00:07:28,943
- Thank you. - No problem.

145
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,183
- Thank you. Let's work hard. - Okay.

146
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:32,813
I'll do my best.

147
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,524
(Meanwhile, TEAM RHYTHM...)

148
00:07:43,524 --> 00:07:49,263
(is looking hard for someone.)

149
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,263
- Where is he? - Where is he?

150
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:54,974
(He locates him.)

151
00:07:57,203 --> 00:08:00,003
(Who is the player they are going to?)

152
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:09,683
- Hi. - Hi.

153
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:10,683
(At the corner of the stage)

154
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:13,024
Is this all right? He won't fall down, will he?

155
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:16,453
(Kwon Hee Jun)

156
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:20,364
(He performed "BOOMERANG" during the draft stage.)

157
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:22,964
Because you only used your strength, your moves...

158
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:26,703
weren't in sync with the beat.

159
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:30,034
Because I got excited onstage, I couldn't show them...

160
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:32,644
what I had.

161
00:08:32,943 --> 00:08:35,213
It was a big disappointment.

162
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:36,374
(Feeling regret from the performance)

163
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,613
- I'll start. - Go ahead.

164
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,713
(Can Kwon Hee Jun avoid getting eliminated?)

165
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,223
(His eyes have changed.)

166
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:51,424
Expanding right now, I'm about to explode, I love this feeling

167
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:54,994
Expanding right now, I'm about to explode, I love this feeling

168
00:08:55,164 --> 00:09:00,304
(Player Kwon Hee Jun performs with all his might.)

169
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:08,174
I wanted to show them what I was good at and best at.

170
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,313
It was my last chance. With that in mind,

171
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:13,884
I poured everything into it.

172
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:17,683
Thank you.

173
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,453
(To seize what could be the last chance,)

174
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:23,494
(he did his best in the performance.)

175
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:28,193
(Will TEAM RHYTHM scout him?)

176
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,333
Okay. I'm happy with him.

177
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,304
Let's work hard together.

178
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:35,973
- Congratulations. - I'll do my best. Thank you.

179
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,174
Congratulations.

180
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:39,404
(Player Kwon Hee Jun is scouted as TEAM RHYTHM's bench player.)

181
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:41,874
Now... Oh, my.

182
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:56,693
(The moment he got accepted, he burst into tears.)

183
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:00,764
I was...

184
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:03,333
just really happy.

185
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:08,404
(I was just really happy.)

186
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,603
I was happy.

187
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:13,374
(Kwon Hee Jun dreamed of joining TEAM RHYTHM from the start.)

188
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:14,644
I was filled with joy.

189
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,443
It made me happy.

190
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:20,784
(He finally gets to wear...)

191
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,683
(TEAM RHYTHM's uniform of his dreams.)

192
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:28,254
(TEAM GROOVE is carefully looking at the players.)

193
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:31,323
(Unable to choose easily)

194
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:37,693
(Unable to choose easily)

195
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:39,933
(Passing by)

196
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,414
Hi.

197
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,784
(Bae Jae Ho's test opportunity)

198
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:58,254
- Okay. - Don't feel nervous.

199
00:10:58,254 --> 00:10:59,284
Be comfortable.

200
00:10:59,723 --> 00:11:01,994
I will be showing my vocals.

201
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:06,494
I want to prove that my singing is worth listening to.

202
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,164
I will start singing.

203
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:10,363
- Be confident. - Right.

204
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,433
Your eyes, nose, lips

205
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:22,343
Your touch and your small fingernails

206
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:25,583
I can still feel you

207
00:11:26,113 --> 00:11:31,453
Like a fire put out

208
00:11:33,654 --> 00:11:35,424
(Walking on eggshells)

209
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:40,723
I'll leave you as a memory even though it hurts so much

210
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,433
Okay. Try singing the national anthem of Korea.

211
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,004
(The national anthem all of a sudden?)

212
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:49,703
Try singing the national anthem of Korea.

213
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:53,943
He suddenly made me sing the national anthem.

214
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:02,183
(He sings the national anthem calmly with nervousness.)

215
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:05,223
Someone is singing the national anthem.

216
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:06,223
Really?

217
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,353
- That was the national anthem? - Yes.

218
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:10,353
Why? Did he sing the wrong notes?

219
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:13,424
(Director Lee's national anthem test sparked everyone's curiosity.)

220
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,233
(The Bench Test site is filled with the national anthem.)

221
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,733
(TEAM GROOVE's special test method)

222
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,044
How long have you danced?

223
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:32,014
I've learned dancing for exactly one year.

224
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:33,384
- For one year? - Yes.

225
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,784
But I really have...

226
00:12:36,313 --> 00:12:38,723
the confidence to work hard as I lack compared to others.

227
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:40,884
I'm really desperate.

228
00:12:41,693 --> 00:12:43,554
I will do my best if you give me the chance.

229
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:48,193
(Will Director Lee Chang Sub give him the chance to perform?)

230
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,394
Okay.

231
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:50,994
Thank you.

232
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:54,733
(Bae Jae Ho gets scouted to TEAM GROOVE's bench.)

233
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:04,744
(TEAM GROOVE continues to look for the next player.)

234
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:15,353
Let's give it a try. Will you sing the national anthem?

235
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:16,394
Yes.

236
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:18,723
(Park Yeon Jun also gets asked to sing the national anthem.)

237
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:26,063
(Feeling very nervous)

238
00:13:27,304 --> 00:13:29,374
Until the East Sea dries

239
00:13:29,374 --> 00:13:34,813
And Mount Baekdu is worn away

240
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:39,813
The deity will protect us

241
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:42,914
Long live our country

242
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:44,983
Okay.

243
00:13:47,154 --> 00:13:48,994
- I'll be back. - Okay.

244
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:52,593
Think about how you can sing this with a sincere heart.

245
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:53,593
Understood.

246
00:13:57,164 --> 00:14:02,634
(Park Yeon Jun is put on hold after getting an assignment.)

247
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,573
- Yeon Jun. - You're here.

248
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:12,713
- Yeon Jun. Hello. - Hello.

249
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:15,014
- Can we see what you've prepared? - Yes.

250
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,284
Okay. Good luck.

251
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:21,394
Everyone together, oh, yes

252
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:32,463
(Unlike TEAM GROOVE, they start with dancing and singing.)

253
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:34,504
We will continue tomorrow as well, TWS

254
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:44,713
(Will Park Yeon Jun be picked by TEAM BEAT's directors?)

255
00:14:44,713 --> 00:14:45,914
Okay.

256
00:14:47,943 --> 00:14:50,583
Were you a bit disappointed? Should we see the others?

257
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:53,554
- Or... - I think we should do that.

258
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:54,723
Right.

259
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:56,353
We need to see a bit more.

260
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:00,164
(They are taking a while to decide what to do.)

261
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,223
Okay.

262
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,264
Okay. Then...

263
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:06,463
(Director!)

264
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:08,304
(I want to try.)

265
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:10,703
Director! I want to try.

266
00:15:13,744 --> 00:15:15,374
Can I? Yes.

267
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:18,914
(He Junjin raises his hand before they make their decision.)

268
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:20,514
I want to try.

269
00:15:21,813 --> 00:15:22,853
Can I?

270
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:24,823
I raised my hand because I felt desperate.

271
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,093
I thought that I wouldn't get a chance at all after this.

272
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:32,193
(He waited and wasn't even given a chance.)

273
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:33,963
(He courageously stepped up in the end.)

274
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:35,693
I'm sorry. Please wait just a little bit.

275
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,164
Right. I'm sorry.

276
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:41,433
If you pick me,

277
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:44,304
- I know how you're feeling. - I'll do anything.

278
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:46,674
Could you wait for us?

279
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:48,274
- Yes. I will. - Really?

280
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,943
We'll see one more person and come back.

281
00:15:49,943 --> 00:15:50,973
Okay.

282
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:53,384
- Thank you. - All right.

283
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:57,583
(Park Yeon Jun's chance of survival is put on hold again.)

284
00:15:57,983 --> 00:15:59,054
"I'm in trouble."

285
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:03,254
"What can I do in this situation?" I could only sigh.

286
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,394
(What can I do in this situation?)

287
00:16:07,193 --> 00:16:10,534
Could we see you sing briefly?

288
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:12,664
- Only sing? - Is it fine?

289
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:13,833
Okay.

290
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:22,244
(He sings with a desperate heart and courage.)

291
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:27,713
You're still shining

292
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:30,754
Thank you for that.

293
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:37,723
- I prefer the previous guy. - Right.

294
00:16:37,723 --> 00:16:39,024
We have to pass him then.

295
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:42,134
I'm sorry. We'll be seeing the other players.

296
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,134
Okay.

297
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:49,774
Thank you for waiting.

298
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:52,703
- Thank you. - Don't be.

299
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:55,014
- We thank you too. - Thank you so much.

300
00:16:56,014 --> 00:17:01,284
(Who will Director Lee Chang Sub be seeing next?)

301
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:03,883
Let's do this. Be confident.

302
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,623
Try singing the national anthem.

303
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:09,423
(The national anthem test begins again.)

304
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:11,694
Until the East Sea dries

305
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:16,563
And Mount Baekdu is worn away

306
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:17,934
(Again!)

307
00:17:17,934 --> 00:17:19,333
- Again. - Okay.

308
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,103
- Again. You're off-key. - Okay.

309
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:27,873
(He slowly sings the national anthem once again.)

310
00:17:30,873 --> 00:17:34,714
The deity will protect us

311
00:17:34,714 --> 00:17:38,153
Long live our country

312
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:41,494
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do. Try this.

313
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,794
(The scale test follows.)

314
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:45,794
- Try this. - Okay.

315
00:17:46,964 --> 00:17:51,903
(Following TEAM GROOVE's color, the test is vocal)

316
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:56,403
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do

317
00:17:57,133 --> 00:18:01,143
(The players feel nervous as they show their basics.)

318
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:05,913
I gritted my teeth.

319
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:08,984
I thought to myself, "I will die if I don't get it right."

320
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:11,014
Right.

321
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,923
I can do my best. Thank you!

322
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:15,123
(Kim Dae Yun gets scouted to TEAM GROOVE's bench.)

323
00:18:15,123 --> 00:18:16,224
Thank you!

324
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:20,024
(Kim Dae Yun gets scouted to TEAM GROOVE's bench.)

325
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:23,393
Director Lee Chang Sub, I want to join TEAM GROOVE.

326
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:28,673
(Kim Gi Joong makes a direct request to Director Lee Chang Sub.)

327
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:30,974
I want to be in the green team, no matter what.

328
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:33,004
I want to be on TEAM GROOVE, no matter what.

329
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,373
I want to get a good scolding from Director Lee Chang Sub.

330
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,613
Based on my singing.

331
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:40,244
Try going up the scale.

332
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,014
(The test for the basics cannot be missed.)

333
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:45,554
Again.

334
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:47,323
(He's precise.)

335
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,454
- Slowly. - Do, Re, Mi

336
00:18:49,454 --> 00:18:52,593
Fa, So, La, Ti, Do

337
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,524
Ti, Do

338
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:57,194
- Okay. - Thank you!

339
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:04,734
(He gets onto TEAM GROOVE's bench with his confident voice.)

340
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,544
(Meanwhile, TEAM RHYTHM...)

341
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:09,373
There's someone else I want to see.

342
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:10,774
Can we see this guy?

343
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:12,313
Let's go.

344
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:15,554
(The players are waiting anxiously.)

345
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:18,653
- Hello. - Hello.

346
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,984
Can we see any kind of dance from you?

347
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:23,123
- I will begin. - Okay.

348
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:24,153
(Nam Do Yoon gets an opportunity.)

349
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:26,264
When someone comes to see me,

350
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:28,694
I want to be able to show off all of my charms...

351
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,034
and make them like me.

352
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,434
(I am your Nam Do Yoon)

353
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,873
I am your Nam Do Yoon

354
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:44,173
In the repetitive day

355
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:47,244
In the repetitive day

356
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:50,284
This song will be the start

357
00:19:50,284 --> 00:19:52,554
I'll sing it for you

358
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,454
We have to cheer up, what else can we do?

359
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,554
We have to cheer up

360
00:19:57,554 --> 00:20:02,163
(Doing his best)

361
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:04,734
(I am Nam Do Yoon)

362
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:05,964
(We have to cheer up)

363
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:07,663
Thank you.

364
00:20:07,663 --> 00:20:09,004
(Nam Do Yoon's test was full of energy.)

365
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:11,073
I really didn't want to go back home.

366
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,873
Should we think about it more?

367
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,143
- We'll come back to you. - Thank you.

368
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:17,544
- Thank you. - Thank you.

369
00:20:17,544 --> 00:20:18,613
(TEAM RHYTHM puts Nam Do Yoon on hold.)

370
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,383
(He loses his chance even with his energy.)

371
00:20:21,813 --> 00:20:24,383
Let's think about it first.

372
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:25,754
(TEAM RHYTHM looks for a different player.)

373
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:27,684
All right. Let's move on.

374
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:31,254
Should we go up? Let's go up.

375
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:32,994
I think going up will be better.

376
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:37,934
(He heads to the stage along with TEAM RHYTHM's directors.)

377
00:20:38,163 --> 00:20:40,663
They all went up onstage.

378
00:20:40,663 --> 00:20:43,734
I thought that I wouldn't get any attention down there.

379
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:46,444
I got up onstage as I tried to do anything.

380
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:52,143
I wish we could have one bright member on our team.

381
00:20:52,143 --> 00:20:53,214
- Right. - Right.

382
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:54,484
Let's decide after one more test.

383
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:55,784
- Right. - Let's do another test.

384
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:58,583
Let's go.

385
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:02,494
(He feels anxious as he might lose his chance.)

386
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,794
- Can we see you one more time? - Yes.

387
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:08,694
Do you know how to dance to a groovy song?

388
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:12,764
- I know a bit of "Dynamite" by BTS. - Great. Please show us.

389
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,274
I wanted to show them more of who I am.

390
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:18,944
I thought to myself, "What can I do to appeal to them more?"

391
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:23,514
(Will he be able to take his second chance?)

392
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,684
(The silent dancing begins without any music.)

393
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:38,423
(Peeking)

394
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:44,294
(His dancing is full of energy without any sound.)

395
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:47,333
- Right. Thank you. - Thank you.

396
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:49,073
This is hard.

397
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:52,444
(Quite perplexed)

398
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:55,373
Okay.

399
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,784
(TEAM RHYTHM moves away one more time.)

400
00:21:59,383 --> 00:22:02,454
(He fails to get scouted after two opportunities.)

401
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:08,153
(The TEAM RHYTHM followers follow the directors again.)

402
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:11,194
I really didn't want to go home.

403
00:22:11,524 --> 00:22:14,363
I didn't want to go home yet. I wanted to stay.

404
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:16,363
I wanted to show them more of me.

405
00:22:16,363 --> 00:22:18,964
(At that moment when he couldn't hide his disappointment...)

406
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:21,234
- Can we see you? - Sure.

407
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,833
- Can we see you? - Sure.

408
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:26,204
(TEAM BEAT's directors came to Nam Do Yoon.)

409
00:22:26,204 --> 00:22:27,843
- Can we see what you have prepared? - Yes.

410
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:33,684
(Nam Do Yoon's cheer begins again.)

411
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,184
Never give it up

412
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:36,984
(Peeking)

413
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:38,353
We have to cheer up

414
00:22:38,853 --> 00:22:40,883
(I am Nam Do Yoon)

415
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:43,323
(We have to cheer up)

416
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:44,393
Thank you.

417
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:48,434
He's cute, but...

418
00:22:51,593 --> 00:22:54,663
(Will his cheer be successful this time?)

419
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,903
Thank you!

420
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:57,934
Thank you!

421
00:22:57,934 --> 00:22:59,774
- Please don't! - Thank you!

422
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:04,974
I was too late.

423
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:08,044
I was too late. What a bummer.

424
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:12,653
- Thank you. - Nam Do Yoon, please move to...

425
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:15,024
- TEAM BEAT's bench. - I'll do my best.

426
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,363
I will show you an amazing performance...

427
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,734
and make you regret not picking me.

428
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:26,764
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup and bench are selected.)

429
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:28,573
- Welcome. - Thank you.

430
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,873
(TEAM RHYTHM and TEAM GROOVE's directors are speeding things up...)

431
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:32,274
(to scout their members.)

432
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:33,873
Thank you.

433
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:35,744
Thank you!

434
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:38,643
(The bench members get scouted 1 by 1.)

435
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,244
Thank you.

436
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:44,883
(TEAM RHYTHM completes its lineup with Jin Ziming as the last member.)

437
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:50,294
(There's just one spot left for TEAM GROOVE.)

438
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:53,123
They all returned. He's the only one left.

439
00:23:53,694 --> 00:23:55,393
- Hiroto? - I'm Hiroto.

440
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,294
- Hiroto? - Yes.

441
00:23:57,294 --> 00:24:00,563
(Hiroto is the only one left for the Bench Test.)

442
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:11,643
(Just 1 person is left out of the 21 people who are in danger.)

443
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:16,954
(He calmly carries on with the song,)

444
00:24:17,883 --> 00:24:22,393
(but Director Lee Chang Sub doesn't say a single word.)

445
00:24:23,694 --> 00:24:25,994
That's good.

446
00:24:26,593 --> 00:24:29,234
Are you a rapper?

447
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:31,934
Are you a vocalist?

448
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,363
I haven't quite decided.

449
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,704
Try rapping.

450
00:24:37,004 --> 00:24:38,004
Rapping?

451
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:40,944
(He takes the second test with rapping.)

452
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:41,974
Okay.

453
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:48,784
(He desperately spits out his rap verse.)

454
00:24:50,014 --> 00:24:52,984
(He focuses while trying to ease his anxiety.)

455
00:24:58,454 --> 00:24:59,524
Thank you.

456
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:04,694
(Director Lee Chang Sub silently looks torn.)

457
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,403
(Will he become TEAM GROOVE's last bench player...)

458
00:25:07,403 --> 00:25:11,903
(or will he get eliminated at this moment?)

459
00:25:11,903 --> 00:25:14,804
(or will he get eliminated at this moment?)

460
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:19,514
I thought that I could become...

461
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,853
the only one to get eliminated.

462
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:25,184
I felt really anxious while having that thought.

463
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:29,524
(Hiroto becomes TEAM GROOVE's last bench member.)

464
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:30,554
Thank you.

465
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:35,294
(Hiroto becomes TEAM GROOVE's last bench member.)

466
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:39,434
Thank you.

467
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:44,434
(Tears burst out as his anxiety gets relieved.)

468
00:25:46,343 --> 00:25:53,284
(A warm welcome from the members who know exactly how he feels)

469
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:05,563
To be able to contribute to the win of our team,

470
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:09,994
I thought that I had to work even harder.

471
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:13,264
I will make sure to do that.

472
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:17,704
All right. These are the lineups...

473
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:19,204
of the three teams of Universe League.

(Li Zhinuo, Kwon Hee Jun, Eito, Jin Ziming, Ayumu, Xie Yuxin, Mac)

486
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:48,434
The performance is thought of when it comes to K-pop.

487
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:51,133
It's something that has everyone's attention globally.

488
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:54,274
We were in NCT and WayV.

489
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:57,544
We will share the experiences and tips we got...

490
00:26:57,544 --> 00:26:59,484
and make sure to have them have their debut.

491
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:03,653
I have only one thing in mind. It's us coming first.

492
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:06,684
I will destroy the stage with an intense performance.

493
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:08,724
I'm a fighter. I'm confident.

I hope the members of TEAM GROOVE...

506
00:27:36,284 --> 00:27:39,353
will be singers who are able to sing live.

507
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:42,694
I want to make them idol stars who sing well.

508
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:45,663
I will share with them all of the experience I had...

509

for 13 years...

510
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:48,833
and make TEAM GROOVE make its debut.

We will make sure to release...

528
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:31,934
songs that suit our players better than the other teams.

529
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:35,204
There are a lot of players who have what it takes to become an idol.

Represent.

539
00:29:07,143 --> 00:29:10,143
In this round, the representative songs...

540
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:12,544
of the directors and teams' colors will be performed.

541
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:14,514
Each team will have the starting players...

542
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:17,484
and bench players go against each other separately.

543
00:29:18,353 --> 00:29:20,853
The 1st battle of the 3 teams with their pride on the line.

544
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:22,994
Please show us the best performances.

545
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,353
(Which team will get the first win?)

546
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:28,294

closes on December 21 at 7am.

559

Please root for the players' race toward their debut.

560
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:11,873
Boys' dream match, Universe League.

561
00:30:13,004 --> 00:30:14,044
Are you ready?

562
00:30:19,613 --> 00:30:22,044
(The directors and 42 players have gathered again.)

563
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:23,784
(Special director, XIAOJUN)

564
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,383
Universe League's first round.

565
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:28,454
Represent. It's the performance with the representative songs...

566
00:30:28,454 --> 00:30:29,524
of the directors.

567
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:35,663
This place will soon be filled with fans.

568
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:36,934
(This place will soon be filled with the panelists.)

569
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,133
The evaluation of these fans...

570
00:30:39,434 --> 00:30:41,234
will decide the ranks of the three teams.

571
00:30:41,234 --> 00:30:42,434
(The ranks will be decided by the panelists.)

572
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,504
(Nervous)

573
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:48,504
That was all I thought about.

574
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:50,643
"Will there be anyone..."

575
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:52,984
"who has come to root for me?"

576
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,813
This is the first time I'm showing my skills to an audience.

577
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:59,353
I thought I should show off my charms as much as I can...

578
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:02,823
to win over the hearts of the fans.

579
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:06,794
Each member's points will be added to determine the team ranking.

580
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,034
And according to the team ranking,

581
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:12,704
the lower-scoring members in the 2nd and 3rd place teams...

582
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,534
will be given yellow cards.

583
00:31:14,534 --> 00:31:16,603
(The 2nd and 3rd place teams will be given yellow cards.)

584
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:22,044
(Yellow cards?)

585
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:27,214
If you receive two yellow cards, you will be eliminated right away.

586
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:29,554
(Those with two yellow cards will be eliminated right away.)

587
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:31,514
Oh, my gosh.

588
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,153
It felt like they jerked me awake.

589
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:36,454
Oh, the time has finally come.

590
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:38,823
This is really the beginning.

591
00:31:38,823 --> 00:31:42,063
That's when it really hit me.

592
00:31:42,264 --> 00:31:47,034
Here are the number of yellow cards for each rank.

593
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,504
The 2nd place team will get 3 yellow cards,

594
00:31:51,774 --> 00:31:54,173
and the 3rd place team will get 6 yellow cards.

595
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:56,744
(The 2nd place team gets 3, and the 3rd place team gets 6!)

596
00:31:57,313 --> 00:32:01,214
(Gasping)

597
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:02,784
The number of cards is different?

598
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:04,984
(There are more yellow cards than they thought.)

599
00:32:04,984 --> 00:32:06,383
I seriously got goosebumps.

600
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,923
Did he say six cards?

601
00:32:09,454 --> 00:32:10,893
I mean, six people...

602
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:13,593
make up almost half of a team.

603
00:32:13,694 --> 00:32:18,194
I didn't think they'd give out 9 cards in the 1st round.

604
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,734
They're basically saying everyone on the bench will get one.

605
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,573
Universe League is so cruel.

606
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:28,343
Things are not happening the way I predicted even once.

607
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:31,573
We have to win no matter what.

608
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:33,813
Getting second place isn't good enough.

609
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:35,613
We have to get first place.

610
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:38,754
(To avoid the yellow cards,)

611
00:32:38,984 --> 00:32:43,353
(you must get 1st place.)

612
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:45,964
I don't want to go home.

613
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,194
(I don't want to go home.)

614
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:48,563
- Hello. - Hello.

615
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:50,294
- Hello. - What's up?

616
00:32:50,294 --> 00:32:51,694
- Hello. - Hello.

617
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:54,434
- Hello. - Hello.

618
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:57,474
There are many people in the audience.

619
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:01,944
(They can see what's going on live through their monitors.)

620
00:33:01,944 --> 00:33:04,413
- There are so many people. - There are so many people.

621
00:33:04,974 --> 00:33:06,014
(The seats are filled with panelists who want to cheer for the players.)

622
00:33:06,014 --> 00:33:07,484
(Park Ju Won)

623
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:08,883
(Jeong Woo, Joo Hyoung, Let's go, Steven!)

624
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:10,284
(The seats are filled with panelists who want to cheer for the players.)

625
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:12,954
Hold on. I'm so nervous. I'm nervous already.

626
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:14,123
There are so many people.

627
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:19,294
I didn't know so many people would come to see us.

628
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:21,724
Seeing all of the people who came to see us,

629
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:24,464
I felt like I got a step closer to my dream.

630
00:33:25,163 --> 00:33:27,704
I hope people can see my sincerity through my performance.

631
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,534
I wanted to receive the audience members' energy...

632
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:33,704
and show them an even better performance.

633
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:40,444
(The lights to signal the start of the league match turn on.)

634
00:33:41,544 --> 00:33:42,653
- What is this? - What is this?

635
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:46,923
(The players watch the stage, half-nervous and half-excited.)

636
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:49,254
I'm suddenly getting nervous.

637
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,224
(Universe League Round 1)

638
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:58,093
- What is this? - Oh, my.

639
00:33:58,093 --> 00:33:59,234
(Hee Jun)

640
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:07,974
(Universe League's MC, Jay Park, comes on the stage.)

641
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:10,213
Welcome to the Universe League.

642
00:34:10,213 --> 00:34:12,113
Hello, I'm MC Jay Park. Nice to see you.

643
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:15,483
(Jay Park is so cool.)

644
00:34:16,983 --> 00:34:20,284
Finally, TEAM RHYTHM's, GROOVE's, and BEAT's players...

645
00:34:20,284 --> 00:34:21,584
will have their first match.

646
00:34:21,954 --> 00:34:23,653
And the outcome of this match...

647
00:34:23,954 --> 00:34:25,153
will be decided by all of you.

648
00:34:25,153 --> 00:34:27,693
(The fans in the audience will decide who wins.)

649
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,934
- Show off all of your charms. - Okay.

650
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:32,863
- You need to dominate the camera. - Okay.

651
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:35,874
Which team will win the first round?

652
00:34:36,003 --> 00:34:38,773
- BEAT. - Are you ready to have fun?

653
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:40,173
- Yes! - Yes!

654
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:41,543
Are you ready?

655
00:34:41,543 --> 00:34:43,974
- Yes! - Yes!

656
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:46,184
We're ready.

657
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:48,713
- We're going first, right? - Yes.

658
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:50,914
- Let's show them. - Don't be nervous.

659
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,983
- Okay. - Just have fun.

660
00:34:54,253 --> 00:34:55,684
- We can do it. - We can do it.

661
00:34:55,684 --> 00:34:58,093
- Let's go! - Should we do a cheer?

662
00:34:58,093 --> 00:34:59,193
- Nice. - TEAM RHYTHM's motto.

663
00:34:59,323 --> 00:35:00,363
Who are we?

664
00:35:00,363 --> 00:35:02,293
- RHYTHM! RHYTHM! RHYTHM! - RHYTHM! RHYTHM! RHYTHM!

665
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:03,363
(Who are we? RHYTHM! RHYTHM! RHYTHM!)

666
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:05,434
- Let's go! - Let's go!

667
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:07,903
- You can do it. - Let's go!

668
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:09,204
- Let's go! - Let's go!

669
00:35:09,204 --> 00:35:11,034
You can make your gestures a bit bigger.

670
00:35:11,034 --> 00:35:12,104
Okay.

671
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:14,244
- We'll be back. - Let's go.

672
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:15,244
- You can do it. - Let's go.

673
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:16,314
Let's go.

674
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,314
- Have fun, really. - Okay.

675
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:21,483
Now, shall we check out the first performance?

676
00:35:21,814 --> 00:35:23,883
Please come out, TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.

677
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:25,084
(Kyung Ho)

678
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:33,764
Please welcome them with a big round of applause.

679
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:35,963
(Joo Hyoung)

680
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:39,604
Steven.

681
00:35:40,363 --> 00:35:41,664
JL.

682
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:43,604
Zhang Shuaibo

683
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:45,773
Daisuke.

684
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,343
Park Ju Won.

685
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:50,974
Royce, and Sirin, everyone.

686
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:52,474
Two, three.

687
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:56,383
- Rhythm! Let's go. - Rhythm! Let's go.

688
00:35:56,383 --> 00:35:58,153
(Rhythm! Let's go.)

689
00:35:58,153 --> 00:35:59,284
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup starts with a cute greeting.)

690
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:01,983
Hello. We're TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.

691
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:04,494
(Nice to meet you.)

692
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:08,463
I was told TEAM RHYTHM had players from six different countries.

693
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:12,934
How do you talk when you're all together?

694
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:16,374
While practicing, my Korean skills...

695
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,974
and my ability to read the room improved a lot.

696
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,343
(He's so cute.)

697
00:36:20,343 --> 00:36:21,343
"Read the room."

698
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:24,414
I can hear and understand words.

699
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:28,713
Ju Won is my Korean teacher.

700
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:30,314
- Right? - Right.

701
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:34,054
I heard there were many teachers other than Ju Won on this team.

702
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:35,454
Who else is there?

703
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:37,423
First, Steven...

704
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:41,963
was like a homeroom teacher who took care of all of us.

705
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:45,534
And Zhang Shuaibo taught us gestures...

706
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:48,863
and sexiness.

707
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:51,374
- Zhang Shuaibo. - Yes.

708
00:36:51,374 --> 00:36:53,543
- Show us a sexy facial expression. - Okay.

709
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:55,273
- Show us. - Let's go.

710
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,383
(Look closely, students. This is what sexy is.)

711
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:03,314
(Extremely moved)

712
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:04,684
Look at this guy.

713
00:37:08,124 --> 00:37:09,923
Oh, gosh.

714
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:12,624
JL was our vocal teacher.

715
00:37:12,624 --> 00:37:14,463
(Lastly, JL is the vocal teacher.)

716
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:17,264
- This team is really good too. - Really?

717
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:19,963
- They're really good. - The Avengers?

718
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:22,204
Yes, they're The Avengers.

719
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:25,034
Who is the most memorable player?

720
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,573
TEAM RHYTHM's JL.

721
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:28,974
JL.

722
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:31,443
JL.

723
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:35,843
I saw the rehearsal for TEAM RHYTHM and BEAT's starting lineups.

724
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:37,054
Isn't he good at singing?

725
00:37:38,414 --> 00:37:39,483
JL.

726
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:42,584
JL especially caught my eye.

727
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:46,164
(JL was chosen by all 3 teams at the draft.)

728
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:49,463
Ever since the draft, Ju Won has been...

729
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:52,034
rising in the ranks.

730
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:54,903
Ju Won really caught my eye.

731
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:58,003
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup is full of strong players.)

732
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:00,773
Please tell us about your performance today.

733
00:38:01,043 --> 00:38:04,644
We have prepared "Give Me That" by WayV,

734
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:07,184
Directors TEN and YANGYANG's group.

735
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,314
Please look forward to it.

736
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:14,023
(WayV's most popular song with a strong beat,)

737
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:17,854
(bright energy, and funky charm)

738
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:23,494
When they told us they would arrange the song with a sexy feel,

739
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,334
I thought, "Oh, my!"

740
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,733
(Was that a pterodactyl just now?)

741
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:29,633
(That surprised me.)

742
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:31,534
"No!"

743
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:36,003
(Park Ju Won showed off his cute charms at the draft.)

744
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:40,084
But now that I think about it, I'm excited...

745
00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:43,383
because we'll be able to show people...

746
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:45,584
a newer, cooler side of us.

747
00:38:45,753 --> 00:38:47,483
It's okay. We have our sexy teacher here.

748
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:48,483
(Laughing)

749
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:50,494
"Love Shot." Sexy.

750
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,664
Not at all.

751
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,793
- Sexy master. - Not at all.

752
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:58,693
Not at all.

753
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:01,903
(An explosion of reactions)

754
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:04,334
(I'll take care of the sexiness.)

755
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:06,244
Did you have certain parts that you wanted?

756
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,244
(Trying to find...)

757
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:11,073
(the right timing to speak)

758
00:39:11,073 --> 00:39:13,914
I kind of want Part One.

759
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:17,454
- Part One is cool. - Totally.

760
00:39:17,454 --> 00:39:19,483
(Part 1, the part everyone wants,)

761
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:23,224
(is the highlight.)

762
00:39:25,023 --> 00:39:28,224
To be honest, I want the highlight.

763
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:31,164
- Of course, the highlight. - The highlight.

764
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:32,394
I wanted it.

765
00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:36,034
I think it will really suit my vocals.

766
00:39:36,034 --> 00:39:37,534
I really want to do it.

767
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:41,144
How should we distribute the parts?

768
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:42,443
The parts...

769
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,443
Directors TEN and YANGYANG will come in two days...

770
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:48,843
to personally assign you the parts.

771
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:50,354
What?

772
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,923
(The directors are coming?)

773
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,354
So you only get two days to practice.

774
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:58,593
- What? - What? Hold on!

775
00:39:58,593 --> 00:40:00,564
No!

776
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,923
No!

777
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:02,934
(Passing out)

778
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,093
What should we do?

779
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:06,963
I saw I had a chance.

780
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:09,133
"This is doable."

781
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:10,633
"It's possible if I work hard."

782
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:14,003
I think I should believe in myself.

783
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:16,514
I can do it. I'll work hard.

784
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,414
I'm confident I'll do well.

785
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:20,043
I'm confident.

786
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:21,343
It's my part.

787
00:40:22,584 --> 00:40:26,113
(An intense competition to take the highlight has begun.)

788
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:30,693
(Who will become the owner of the highlight?)

789
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:33,693
(And two days passed.)

790
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:37,193
(The part distribution day has come.)

791
00:40:38,064 --> 00:40:41,863
(Intensely practicing until the last moment)

792
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:44,804
- Hello. - Hello.

793
00:40:45,673 --> 00:40:47,503
(The WayV directors came to the practice room.)

794
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:50,713
- Hello. - Hello.

795
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:51,773
Long time no see.

796
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:54,284
- Hello. - Long time no see.

797
00:40:54,284 --> 00:40:56,483
- Hello. - Hello.

798
00:40:56,483 --> 00:40:57,613
Have you been well?

799
00:40:57,983 --> 00:40:59,014
- Yes! - Yes!

800
00:40:59,314 --> 00:41:01,354
How has it been preparing for the performance?

801
00:41:01,823 --> 00:41:03,923
- We worked hard. - I see.

802
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:05,854
Then we can expect a lot today, right?

803
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:07,894
- Yes! - Yes!

804
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:10,733
If so,

805
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:12,834
do you want to go first, Daisuke?

806
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:14,064
(Frozen)

807
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:16,334
- I don't think he's ready yet. - It's okay.

808
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:17,434
You can do it.

809
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,334
- Let's go, Daisuke. - Let's go.

810
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:20,374
Let's go.

811
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:22,073
Let's go.

812
00:41:22,573 --> 00:41:24,914
(They'll do the vocal evaluation first.)

813
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:26,284
Let's get close

814
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,244
Don't things feel a bit different?

815
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,314
(Nervous hands)

816
00:41:35,584 --> 00:41:38,354
(Hands shaking)

817
00:41:39,894 --> 00:41:41,423
(He messed up the lyrics because he was so nervous.)

818
00:41:41,423 --> 00:41:45,394
I don't need anyone else now

819
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:50,474
(Nervous)

820
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:53,943
I think you'll have to memorize the lyrics more.

821
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,843
You made so many mistakes.

822
00:41:57,073 --> 00:42:00,543
I can't focus. It's just flowing by.

823
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:01,843
Okay.

824
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:04,584
(He didn't get to show what he practiced.)

825
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:06,923
(The second evaluation, Zhang Shuaibo)

826
00:42:06,923 --> 00:42:08,153
(Losing balance)

827
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:09,284
(Biting his lips)

828
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:14,423
(Starting the highlight part that he wanted)

829
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:17,133
(Well...)

830
00:42:17,934 --> 00:42:19,463
(Losing balance)

831
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:27,573
(The directors hesitate to speak.)

832
00:42:27,573 --> 00:42:28,644
I think...

833
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:32,474
you'll have to practice the dance more.

834
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:33,943
You need to get more used to it.

835
00:42:33,943 --> 00:42:35,983
Since you can't control your body yet,

836
00:42:36,514 --> 00:42:38,584
none of the movements are clean.

837
00:42:39,383 --> 00:42:40,383
Okay.

838
00:42:41,523 --> 00:42:43,693
Because they were so nervous,

839
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:45,423
they couldn't feel the rhythm,

840
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:48,593
and they couldn't dance as well as they usually could.

841
00:42:49,093 --> 00:42:51,193
I felt bad for them as I watched.

842
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:53,104
- Let's go, Steven. - Steven, let's go.

843
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,133
(The next evaluation is Steven.)

844
00:42:55,003 --> 00:42:59,233
(He walks up repeating the lyrics until the last second.)

845
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:00,573
Let's go, Steven.

846
00:43:00,573 --> 00:43:02,874
Steven. Are you going to read the lyrics?

847
00:43:03,343 --> 00:43:04,713
I'm going to do my best not to.

848
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:09,244
I want to memorize the lyrics and be well-prepared.

849
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,314
Baby can you give me that

850
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:15,653
(Starting to sing confidently without looking at the lyrics)

851
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:17,954
About the cross the line bump bump

852
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:20,523
(Shaky)

853
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:21,894
(Glaring)

854
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,434
(He totally forgot the lyrics.)

855
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,534
- Do you want the lyrics? - Let's have you read the lyrics.

856
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:32,173
Oh, no.

857
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:34,043
My head went blank.

858
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:37,173
I was disappointed in myself.

859
00:43:40,113 --> 00:43:43,414
(They resumed the evaluation with Steven reading the lyrics.)

860
00:43:43,713 --> 00:43:45,383
Don't things feel a bit different?

861
00:43:47,354 --> 00:43:49,354
(He seemed to be singing confidently this time.)

862
00:43:49,454 --> 00:43:50,854
(Looking nervous)

863
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:52,293
Let me know

864
00:43:52,293 --> 00:43:55,064
(Going off pitch)

865
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:56,793
Love

866
00:43:59,463 --> 00:44:02,764
(He also made many mistakes during the dance evaluation.)

867
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:06,903
(Steven can barely dance.)

868
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:15,184
- You're in the starting lineup. - Yes.

869
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,354
Today, I'm a bit disappointed.

870
00:44:22,423 --> 00:44:23,494
Honestly,

871
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:26,793
sometimes we only have three days to practice.

872
00:44:26,793 --> 00:44:30,564
Sometimes we shoot music videos after just three days of practice.

873
00:44:31,064 --> 00:44:34,133
I think you'll have to memorize this as soon as possible.

874
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:36,573
Whether you practice for two days...

875
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:39,503
or for however long,

876
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:41,043
the audience doesn't know that.

877
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,514
They only see the result.

878
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,244
If you go onstage like this,

879
00:44:45,244 --> 00:44:47,744
you won't see good results.

880
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:50,613
If you know you have a hard time...

881
00:44:50,613 --> 00:44:52,454
memorizing the choreography,

882
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:54,684
you need to practice dancing...

883
00:44:55,084 --> 00:44:57,323
two or three times more than the other members.

884
00:44:57,693 --> 00:44:58,693
I understand.

885
00:44:59,253 --> 00:45:01,124
I was very disappointed in myself.

886
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:02,793
It's not...

887
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,064
that I didn't practice.

888
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,804
Did I practice in the wrong way?

889
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:10,834
I thought about that a lot.

890
00:45:12,403 --> 00:45:14,943
Next player, Ju Won.

891
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:17,843
- Okay. - Let's go.

892
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:19,213
(Park Ju Won got 2 picks at the draft.)

893
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:20,284
Hello.

894
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:25,554
(Starting the performance with a confident voice)

895
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:27,684
(Rapping powerfully)

896
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:30,323
I watch you so mesmerized like fireworks

897
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,323
(I'm thinking about you)

898
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:33,664
(What?)

899
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:36,733
(Unlike during the rap part, Ju Won looks unconfident.)

900
00:45:38,564 --> 00:45:40,863
(His gaze transforms.)

901
00:45:48,273 --> 00:45:51,374
(You can feel the power in Ju Won's dance.)

902
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:52,514
Oh, nice.

903
00:45:58,054 --> 00:45:59,713
(Very satisfied)

904
00:46:00,153 --> 00:46:01,184
Thank you.

905
00:46:02,124 --> 00:46:03,253
You did well in the dance.

906
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:08,363
You have to move very fast, and you have to control...

907
00:46:08,363 --> 00:46:11,494
your body well in this part. You calculated all of that.

908
00:46:11,494 --> 00:46:13,863
It was really fun to watch.

909
00:46:13,863 --> 00:46:16,064
When you practice with everyone,

910
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:18,403
- Teach them. - you should teach them.

911
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:20,903
Even during the draft,

912
00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:23,414
I really liked...

913
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,343
your dancing and facial expressions.

914
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:27,414
- I felt we made the right choice. - Right.

915
00:46:27,414 --> 00:46:28,883
Very good job.

916
00:46:28,883 --> 00:46:29,954
Thank you.

917
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,753
(Park Ju Won's dance satisfied the two directors.)

918
00:46:31,753 --> 00:46:33,653
Oh, but...

919
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,153
But...

920
00:46:36,124 --> 00:46:38,494
are you not practicing singing at all?

921
00:46:38,593 --> 00:46:39,653
I did.

922
00:46:40,693 --> 00:46:42,894
- I am practicing. - I see.

923
00:46:43,293 --> 00:46:45,264
- You're mainly a rapper, right? - Yes.

924
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:46,633
Yes.

925
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,434
It's good for you...

926
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:52,073
to say clearly, "I'm a rapper."

927
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:53,704
But you don't know what could happen.

928
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:55,843
- Right. - You could get a singing part.

929
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:57,914
But if you're lacking in vocal skills,

930
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:00,213
what will you do then? Just dance?

931
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:04,613
I was a bit flustered. He hit the nail on the head.

932
00:47:05,354 --> 00:47:08,184
The reason I didn't get the three picks at the draft...

933
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:10,253
was because of my vocal skills.

934
00:47:10,624 --> 00:47:13,363
Because of that, I wasn't confident,

935
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:16,193
and I ended up singing timidly.

936
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:18,633
When you practice,

937
00:47:19,093 --> 00:47:22,204
you can learn a lot from recording yourself.

938
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:25,034
We can't know how our voices sound.

939
00:47:25,503 --> 00:47:27,043
I want you to do that a lot.

940
00:47:27,374 --> 00:47:28,744
- Okay. - Okay.

941
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:31,144
- JL. - Oh, my.

942
00:47:31,144 --> 00:47:32,213
Okay. Let's go.

943
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:33,843
(Stop it, guys.)

944
00:47:34,514 --> 00:47:35,613
(Excited)

945
00:47:36,084 --> 00:47:37,084
Hello.

946
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:41,124
All three teams picked him.

947
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,554
- Right. The only three pick. - Thank you.

948
00:47:43,554 --> 00:47:45,323
- Right? - I'm excited.

949
00:47:45,793 --> 00:47:47,394
- Let's go. - Don't feel pressured.

950
00:47:47,394 --> 00:47:48,624
We're really excited.

951
00:47:49,293 --> 00:47:50,693
(Looking down from feeling the pressure)

952
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:52,293
Let's go, JL.

953
00:47:53,534 --> 00:47:54,963
Let's get close

954
00:47:54,963 --> 00:47:56,834
Don't things feel a bit different?

955
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,343
(Starting to smile as soon as JL starts singing)

956
00:48:00,343 --> 00:48:01,403
He's so good.

957
00:48:02,304 --> 00:48:05,113
(JL enjoys himself while singing with ease.)

958
00:48:07,914 --> 00:48:09,983
(Starting the highlight)

959
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,554
(Focused)

960
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:15,184
Give me your love, give me your love

961
00:48:17,023 --> 00:48:19,054
(How is 3 Pick JL's dancing?)

962
00:48:19,793 --> 00:48:21,394
(Clean angles)

963
00:48:25,764 --> 00:48:27,564
(Relaxed and confident)

964
00:48:29,164 --> 00:48:31,633
- Nice. - He did well.

965
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:34,343
- You really deserve three picks. - You did well.

966
00:48:35,043 --> 00:48:36,104
What I liked the most...

967
00:48:36,104 --> 00:48:38,673
is how you kept eye contact with us while you were dancing.

968
00:48:39,073 --> 00:48:41,883
- I really liked that. - Thank you.

969
00:48:43,184 --> 00:48:45,554
I really liked your singing,

970
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,423
but can you sing the chorus with your modal voice?

971
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:53,124
Because you're using falsetto right now, right?

972
00:48:53,253 --> 00:48:55,164
Can you give it a try?

973
00:48:56,193 --> 00:48:58,693
Give me your love, give me your love

974
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:01,133
Give me your love, give me your love

975
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,233
(Oh, my...)

976
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:08,144
(Singing the high notes easily with his modal voice)

977
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:09,943
- That's much better. - Baby can you give me that

978
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:13,443
Earlier, it was a bit careful.

979
00:49:13,443 --> 00:49:14,684
(Earlier, your high notes were a bit careful.)

980
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:16,644
- Right. - It was much better than earlier.

981
00:49:17,113 --> 00:49:18,184
Thank you!

982
00:49:18,184 --> 00:49:19,653
(With JL getting praised by the directors,)

983
00:49:19,653 --> 00:49:21,684
(the part distribution evaluation comes to an end.)

984
00:49:21,684 --> 00:49:24,454
We'll now announce who'll get which part.

985
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:25,693
(Time to announce the part distribution results)

986
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:27,394
(Nervous)

987
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:29,264
"Give Me That's" highlight...

988
00:49:29,724 --> 00:49:32,693
and main vocalist is JL.

989
00:49:32,994 --> 00:49:34,003
JL.

990
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:36,204
Thank you.

991
00:49:37,304 --> 00:49:38,304
I'll do my best.

992
00:49:40,503 --> 00:49:41,943
(My heart is pounding.)

993
00:49:41,943 --> 00:49:43,003
It felt like this.

994
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:46,173
I felt so much relief,

995
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:48,584
but at the same time, I'm really happy.

996
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:50,383
I was so happy.

997
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,653
I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed.

998
00:49:54,323 --> 00:49:56,653
What I originally wanted was the highlight.

999
00:49:57,153 --> 00:49:59,354
The fact that I gave up without really trying...

1000
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:01,394
because of my singing abilities...

1001
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:03,564
I was kind of...

1002
00:50:04,264 --> 00:50:06,463
disappointed in myself.

1003
00:50:07,564 --> 00:50:09,834
- You really need to practice a lot. - Okay.

1004
00:50:09,834 --> 00:50:12,534
Don't just look at yourself when practicing.

1005
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:15,244
Look at each other...

1006
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:17,244
and tell each other if something looks weird.

1007
00:50:17,244 --> 00:50:20,043
If you think, "I just need to do well,"

1008
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:23,314
all of the attention could go to one person who doesn't do well.

1009
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:25,784
So I think you should help each other...

1010
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:28,423
and do well together.

1011
00:50:28,753 --> 00:50:30,293
- Okay. - I'm cheering for you.

1012
00:50:31,494 --> 00:50:33,193
I was very upset.

1013
00:50:33,394 --> 00:50:35,363
I didn't get the highlight part that I wanted.

1014
00:50:35,793 --> 00:50:37,093
And I only showed...

1015
00:50:37,894 --> 00:50:39,963
the directors how much I was lacking.

1016
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:43,733
I thought I should work even harder.

1017
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:46,173
I got both positive...

1018
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,204
and negative feedback.

1019
00:50:48,304 --> 00:50:50,443
I think the negative part was actually very important.

1020
00:50:50,744 --> 00:50:53,613
I believe it's important to know what we did wrong.

1021
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:56,113
By fixing what we were criticized for,

1022
00:50:56,113 --> 00:50:59,814
the group will be able to get to the next step.

1023
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:02,153
(The day after distributing the parts)

1024
00:51:02,153 --> 00:51:03,153
It's getting better.

1025
00:51:04,153 --> 00:51:05,823
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup is listening to something.)

1026
00:51:05,823 --> 00:51:08,323
- Who's that? - I didn't do that.

1027
00:51:08,323 --> 00:51:10,463
- That's you. - Right.

1028
00:51:12,334 --> 00:51:15,434
(Their director told them to record their own voices...)

1029
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:17,503
(and to listen to themselves sing.)

1030
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:21,804
(They begin vocal practice and record their sessions.)

1031
00:51:21,804 --> 00:51:23,644
Doesn't it seem different?

1032
00:51:24,043 --> 00:51:26,073
It feels like crossing the line, bump bump

1033
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:30,554
(They carefully sing their sections while focusing on their voices.)

1034
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:35,023
(They carefully sing their sections while focusing on their voices.)

1035
00:51:35,454 --> 00:51:37,994
(They check the recording right away!)

1036
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,863
The chorus needs a lot of improvement.

1037
00:51:41,994 --> 00:51:44,463
We're totally off-beat when singing the chorus.

1038
00:51:45,193 --> 00:51:46,434
The chorus is like...

1039
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:47,764
(The chorus is the issue.)

1040
00:51:47,764 --> 00:51:49,934
Right. The chorus.

1041
00:51:49,934 --> 00:51:53,034
- The chorus! - Yes.

1042
00:51:53,773 --> 00:51:55,173
It's so hard.

1043
00:51:55,173 --> 00:51:58,374
Let's try to be more active.

1044
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:01,213
- Give me your love - Yes.

1045
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:03,284
- So we're going to fade out. - The fade out. Exactly.

1046
00:52:04,153 --> 00:52:06,753
JL played the role of our beacon...

1047
00:52:06,983 --> 00:52:08,784
and gave us a lot of feedback,

1048
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:10,753
as well as pointers.

1049
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:11,753
That's how we were able...

1050
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,954
- to improve. - Like...

1051
00:52:12,954 --> 00:52:14,023
JL.

1052
00:52:14,523 --> 00:52:16,564
- Can you help me with this? - What?

1053
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:21,733
(When stuck vocally, get a 1-on-1 session with JL.)

1054
00:52:21,733 --> 00:52:23,604
- I've been learning... - Give me that, give me that

1055
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:25,073
- a lot from him. - Give me that, give me that

1056
00:52:25,073 --> 00:52:28,573
- Not like that, but... - While practicing "Give Me That,"

1057
00:52:28,573 --> 00:52:31,213
- I could tell that I improved. - Give me that

1058
00:52:31,213 --> 00:52:32,974
- I will teach you. - My gosh.

1059
00:52:32,974 --> 00:52:34,113
I'll give you pointers.

1060
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:37,414
It felt good to be able...

1061
00:52:37,414 --> 00:52:40,084
to help the others with their singing,

1062
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:44,054
and I believe that experience helped us all improve.

1063
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,054
Roll back and to the other side.

1064
00:52:46,054 --> 00:52:47,064
(For the dance, Park Ju Won takes the reins.)

1065
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:49,423
Do that twice, and twice again with the arms.

1066
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:53,834
(During the evaluation, Park Ju Won heard good feedback.)

1067
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:57,073
Draw a shape like so, and...

1068
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,133
Boom.

1069
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,874
Push down with your left arm,

1070
00:52:59,874 --> 00:53:02,874
- and then your right. - The directors praised my dancing,

1071
00:53:02,874 --> 00:53:04,814
and that's something I know I can do well.

1072
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,874
That's how I got to lead our dance practice.

1073
00:53:06,874 --> 00:53:08,314
(Exclaiming)

1074
00:53:08,314 --> 00:53:10,113
Swirl, and send it.

1075
00:53:10,113 --> 00:53:11,784
From here, slide your back foot.

1076
00:53:12,014 --> 00:53:13,153
- Slide. - Slide.

1077
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:15,323
- Then, snap. - Snap.

1078
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:18,153
From here, rotate both your right hand and head.

1079
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,954
- Rotate. - From here,

1080
00:53:19,954 --> 00:53:22,394
- draw a big circle. - Circle.

1081
00:53:22,394 --> 00:53:23,463
With your arms,

1082
00:53:23,463 --> 00:53:24,564
make a small circle and then a big one.

1083
00:53:24,564 --> 00:53:26,963
The others were eager to follow my cues,

1084
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:29,503
which is why everything went smoothly.

1085
00:53:29,764 --> 00:53:31,773
What should I do with this hand?

1086
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:34,104
Give it 100 percent on this side...

1087
00:53:34,104 --> 00:53:36,804
- while keeping it at a 30 here. - Got it.

1088
00:53:36,804 --> 00:53:38,113
(He keeps his directions simple.)

1089
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,113
(Easy to understand)

1090
00:53:41,113 --> 00:53:43,814
Dancing wasn't my strong suit coming into this competition,

1091
00:53:43,814 --> 00:53:47,584
but with Ju Won's help, I was able to improve immensely.

1092
00:53:47,584 --> 00:53:48,653
I was so grateful,

1093
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:49,724
and it gave me confidence.

1094
00:53:50,323 --> 00:53:52,193
- Let's try this. - Sure.

1095
00:53:53,354 --> 00:53:55,693
- Sirin, are you tired? - A little.

1096
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:57,233
- Are you tired? - A little.

1097
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,264
You can do this.

1098
00:54:00,264 --> 00:54:03,264
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup became one team...)

1099
00:54:03,264 --> 00:54:09,974
(by helping each other improve where they lack.)

1100
00:54:09,974 --> 00:54:14,914
Everyone's doing their best for the team.

1101
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:18,483
I'm one to value result over process,

1102
00:54:18,483 --> 00:54:22,054
but the process was more meaningful to me this time around.

1103
00:54:22,923 --> 00:54:25,193
(They fall asleep after a rigorous practice session.)

1104
00:54:25,693 --> 00:54:29,023
Hi, we're TEAM RHYTHM.

1105
00:54:29,023 --> 00:54:30,064
(Whispering)

1106
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:31,894
We, TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup,

1107
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:34,363
put our hearts and souls into this performance.

1108
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,434
We'll present a performance that won't be disappointing.

1109
00:54:38,003 --> 00:54:39,073
Nice.

1110
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:40,503
Go, TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.

1111
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:44,713
(What performance will be presented by TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup?)

1112
00:54:44,713 --> 00:54:46,843
TEAM RHYTHM, are you ready?

1113
00:54:46,843 --> 00:54:48,843
- Yes! - Let's go.

1114
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:50,814
- Let's go, TEAM RHYTHM. - Let's go.

1115
00:54:50,814 --> 00:54:52,314
- Let's go, TEAM RHYTHM. - Good luck.

1116
00:54:52,554 --> 00:54:53,613
Good luck, guys.

1117
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:55,883
- Be confident. - Go for it!

1118
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:57,793
- Let's go. - TEAM RHYTHM is the best.

1119
00:54:57,793 --> 00:54:59,423
- Go, TEAM RHYTHM. - Let's go!

1120
00:54:59,423 --> 00:55:01,624
I want to present a performance...

1121
00:55:01,624 --> 00:55:05,764
that will make our fans proud.

1122
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:11,604
(Directors of the opposing teams are just as nervous.)

1123
00:55:11,804 --> 00:55:12,834
You've got this!

1124
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,343
Let's go!

1125
00:55:14,704 --> 00:55:16,043
You can do it!

1126
00:55:16,043 --> 00:55:17,514
The color of the light sticks changed.

1127
00:55:17,744 --> 00:55:18,814
- Nice. - No way.

1128
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:21,113
They must change color, depending on the performing team.

1129
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:23,584
- Nice. - My gosh.

1130
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,753
Ready? Go.

1131
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:33,323
- Go, Steven! - He's so handsome.

1132
00:55:33,323 --> 00:55:35,293
No way. How can one look like that?

1133
00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:37,264
The gaze!

1134
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:40,834
My gosh.

1135
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:42,604
("Give Me That" by Daisuke, JL, Park Ju Won,)

1136
00:55:42,604 --> 00:55:44,204
(Royce, Sirin, Steven, Zhang Shuaibo)

1137
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:04,023
Daisuke's adorable.

1138
00:56:09,624 --> 00:56:12,334
- I didn't expect that from him. - I'm in love with that gesture.

1139
00:56:24,113 --> 00:56:25,874
Check out his muscles.

1140
00:56:31,814 --> 00:56:32,814
They're good.

1141
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,494
His face is very...

1142
00:57:05,153 --> 00:57:07,454
- What's with the rose? - Where did that come from?

1143
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:39,753
Did you see that move?

1144
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:14,124
Ju Won's really good.

1145
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:26,164
Gosh.

1146
00:58:49,753 --> 00:58:52,823
- Gosh. - Check out JL's expressions.

1147
00:59:11,744 --> 00:59:12,814
(That's why they're the starting lineup!)

1148
00:59:12,814 --> 00:59:14,414
Nice. That was awesome.

1149
00:59:14,914 --> 00:59:17,144
(They tore up the stage.)

1150
00:59:17,144 --> 00:59:18,213
That was so cool.

1151
00:59:18,213 --> 00:59:20,613
Ju Won has something about him that is unexpectedly charming.

1152
00:59:20,613 --> 00:59:22,184
He's so cool when he raps.

1153
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,184
(He's normally cute but cool when he raps.)

1154
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,954
They're good.

1155
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:28,224
- They did a good job. - That was cool.

1156
00:59:28,963 --> 00:59:32,093
(The pressure is on.)

1157
00:59:33,293 --> 00:59:35,334
(The dominating performance has TEAM BEAT at a loss for words.)

1158
00:59:36,334 --> 00:59:39,633
I thought they'd do a good job,

1159
00:59:40,273 --> 00:59:42,543
but they were even better than I expected.

1160
00:59:43,903 --> 00:59:47,144
Guys, we can do it. They're beatable.

1161
00:59:47,644 --> 00:59:49,014
- We can do it. - Of course.

1162
00:59:49,414 --> 00:59:52,054
- That was awesome! - You did so well.

1163
00:59:52,054 --> 00:59:54,054
- Nice job. - Ju Won, you did great.

1164
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:56,784
All right. Wait, what's this?

1165
00:59:56,784 --> 00:59:59,894
(What's this?)

1166
00:59:59,894 --> 01:00:01,394
Who brought this out here?

1167
01:00:03,394 --> 01:00:05,264
I... Just a second.

1168
01:00:05,264 --> 01:00:06,363
Right.

1169
01:00:06,664 --> 01:00:08,834
It's okay. Catch your breath.

1170
01:00:09,834 --> 01:00:10,874
It's a rose.

1171
01:00:11,003 --> 01:00:12,273
- Is it a rose? - Yes.

1172
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:17,514
(He melted the hearts of fans by looking sexy with a rose.)

1173
01:00:17,713 --> 01:00:19,443
Is it mine? Are you giving it to me?

1174
01:00:20,343 --> 01:00:21,443
(I'll take it.)

1175
01:00:21,543 --> 01:00:22,613
It's yours.

1176
01:00:22,613 --> 01:00:23,644
(It's yours, Jay.)

1177
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:25,113
Thanks.

1178
01:00:25,113 --> 01:00:26,113
(He pockets it immediately.)

1179
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:28,753
(He goes back to being cute after the performance is over.)

1180
01:00:28,753 --> 01:00:32,153
All right. We'll now begin the voting.

1181
01:00:32,554 --> 01:00:34,963
You will be scored individually.

1182
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:36,463
(Round 1 Rules)

1183
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:38,494
The individual scores will be added,

1184
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:40,494
and the teams will be ranked depending on the total score.

1185
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,704
The individual with the highest score...

1186
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:43,934
will be crowned as the MVP.

1187
01:00:43,934 --> 01:00:46,374
(Round 1 Rules)

1188
01:00:46,374 --> 01:00:48,644
Please press the circle...

1189
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:51,113
if you enjoyed his performance.

1190
01:00:52,073 --> 01:00:56,814
(Who will be the MVP with the most votes from the fans?)

1191
01:00:57,084 --> 01:00:58,113
The moment has come.

1192
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:02,584
Wait. Why am I nervous?

1193
01:01:06,923 --> 01:01:07,963
Please vote!

1194
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,994
- This is good. Appeal to them. - He's cute.

1195
01:01:10,994 --> 01:01:12,064
(Daisuke)

1196
01:01:12,963 --> 01:01:15,064
Please vote for me.

1197
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:17,363
- Please vote for me. - He's cute.

1198
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:21,744
(I'll go for sexy.)

1199
01:01:22,343 --> 01:01:23,403
They're appealing.

1200
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:28,814
(Feeling dizzy)

1201
01:01:29,113 --> 01:01:30,144
They're relaxed.

1202
01:01:30,883 --> 01:01:31,954
Your turn.

1203
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,014
(They're busy appealing to fans.)

1204
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:36,823
(I love it.)

1205
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:38,894
(Zhang Shuaibo)

1206
01:01:39,253 --> 01:01:40,823
Five, four,

1207
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:42,224
three,

1208
01:01:42,224 --> 01:01:43,764
two, one.

1209
01:01:44,093 --> 01:01:46,934
Voting is now closed.

1210
01:01:48,863 --> 01:01:51,304
This isn't easy. I was thinking Ju Won,

1211
01:01:51,304 --> 01:01:54,244
JL, and Steven.

1212
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:57,304
- But everyone did well. - Choosing one person?

1213
01:01:57,304 --> 01:01:58,543
(It's difficult to choose one MVP.)

1214
01:01:59,073 --> 01:02:01,244
- How about you as a first-timer? - I'll choose JL and Steven.

1215
01:02:01,414 --> 01:02:03,144
- JL and Steven. I see. - But...

1216
01:02:03,144 --> 01:02:05,954
- But Steven wasn't... - Lower it...

1217
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:08,954
good at dancing like today.

1218
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:11,923
- His singing improved too. - Everyone improved a lot.

1219
01:02:11,923 --> 01:02:13,394
(Will Steven, who got attention with his charismatic performance, win?)

1220
01:02:13,394 --> 01:02:14,764
I have no idea who will win in this team.

1221
01:02:15,293 --> 01:02:16,693
I think it will be JL.

1222
01:02:17,764 --> 01:02:19,764
His gestures and dancing skills are amazing.

1223
01:02:20,334 --> 01:02:21,363
He's even good at singing.

1224
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:24,503
(Will JL, who showcased impressive expressions and vocal skills, win?)

1225
01:02:24,503 --> 01:02:27,173
He stood out during his solo part.

1226
01:02:27,474 --> 01:02:29,644
But as a whole, Ju Won stood out.

1227
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:34,543
(Will Ju Won, who showcased his charismatic rapping and charm, win?)

1228
01:02:35,144 --> 01:02:37,753
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup has strong MVP candidates.)

1229
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:39,354
I'll announce the MVP now.

1230
01:02:39,753 --> 01:02:40,923
The MVP of TEAM RHYTHM is...

1231
01:02:43,284 --> 01:02:46,854
I was just hoping for a lot of votes.

1232
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,793
I think the ranking of my team is important.

1233
01:02:51,363 --> 01:02:54,863
I was just hoping anybody would win a lot of votes.

1234
01:02:55,534 --> 01:02:56,704
The MVP of TEAM RHYTHM is...

1235
01:02:56,704 --> 01:02:59,773
(Who will be the MVP among the strong candidates?)

1236
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:02,343
Park Ju Won.

1237
01:03:02,343 --> 01:03:07,152
(Park Ju Won is the MVP of TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.)

1238
01:03:07,752 --> 01:03:09,252
(He captivated fans with his unexpected charm.)

1239
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,522
Thank you!

1240
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:12,522
(Stunned and speechless)

1241
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,863
Thank you!

1242
01:03:16,033 --> 01:03:17,033
My gosh.

1243
01:03:17,033 --> 01:03:18,593
(Bewildered)

1244
01:03:18,593 --> 01:03:20,703
(Park Ju Won)

1245
01:03:21,163 --> 01:03:22,303
Park Ju Won.

1246
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:24,772
(Good job.)

1247
01:03:24,772 --> 01:03:25,803
- Oh, my gosh. - Gosh!

1248
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:27,772
(Nice work.)

1249
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,143
- He did very well. - Yes.

1250
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:35,013
His choreography was neat, and it was strong.

1251
01:03:35,683 --> 01:03:36,752
Well,

1252
01:03:37,752 --> 01:03:38,783
I mean...

1253
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,382
Firstly, thank you so much.

1254
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:43,893
- Congratulations. - Well...

1255
01:03:44,152 --> 01:03:45,823
honestly,

1256
01:03:46,363 --> 01:03:49,692
I really wanted to be the MVP. But I thought I wouldn't win it.

1257
01:03:50,332 --> 01:03:51,462
But thank you...

1258
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:54,863
for making me the MVP.

1259
01:03:56,203 --> 01:03:59,102
- I'll try harder. - You did well!

1260
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:00,473
- You did well! - Good job!

1261
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:01,643
(Park Ju Won)

1262
01:04:02,203 --> 01:04:05,442
I didn't imagine I'd be the MVP.

1263
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,743
It feels like a dream.

1264
01:04:08,042 --> 01:04:11,752
I won the MVP, and I was satisfied with my performance like a dream.

1265
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:14,152
I tried pinching my body.

1266
01:04:14,652 --> 01:04:16,292
But it was painful.

1267
01:04:16,922 --> 01:04:18,422
So it means it's a dream.

1268
01:04:18,752 --> 01:04:22,263
No, I mean, it's not a dream.

1269
01:04:22,263 --> 01:04:23,663
(Being recognized by the fans feels like a dream)

1270
01:04:24,033 --> 01:04:26,433
- Well done. - Well done.

1271
01:04:26,433 --> 01:04:27,703
- MVP! - MVP!

1272
01:04:27,703 --> 01:04:29,803
- Well done. - Well done.

1273
01:04:29,803 --> 01:04:33,303
(The starting lineup is welcomed passionately.)

1274
01:04:33,343 --> 01:04:36,513
- Thank you. - MVP!

1275
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,413
- Well done. - Daisuke, good!

1276
01:04:40,582 --> 01:04:41,712
(All 14 players became 1 team under TEAM RHYTHM.)

1277
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,752
- You did well. Everyone did well. - TEAM RHYTHM.

1278
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:48,053
(All 14 players became 1 team under TEAM RHYTHM.)

1279
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,192
- Is it our turn now? - It is our turn. My goodness.

1280
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:55,123
Get ready.

1281
01:04:57,132 --> 01:05:01,033
(The starting players of TEAM BEAT are very nervous.)

1282
01:05:01,533 --> 01:05:03,172
- Why am I so nervous? - Me too.

1283
01:05:03,902 --> 01:05:05,303
I feel more nervous than performing.

1284
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:07,873
This is...

1285
01:05:07,873 --> 01:05:08,942
(The two directors are as anxious as the players.)

1286
01:05:09,102 --> 01:05:10,172
Now,

1287
01:05:10,513 --> 01:05:12,882
it's TEAM BEAT's turn.

1288
01:05:12,882 --> 01:05:14,143
(Chih En)

1289
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:16,553
(It's time to go onstage.)

1290
01:05:16,553 --> 01:05:18,982
- You can do it! - Let's go!

1291
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:19,982
Gather around.

1292
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:22,852
- Let’s do it without regrets. - Yes.

1293
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:25,422
- You're the coolest. Don't worry. - Have fun.

1294
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:27,692
Have fun. Let's do it upwards. One, two, three.

1295
01:05:27,692 --> 01:05:30,332
- TEAM BEAT, let's go! - Let's go!

1296
01:05:31,893 --> 01:05:34,803
(The starting players go onstage after receiving some energy.)

1297
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:37,373
They're the starting players of TEAM BEAT. Come on out.

1298
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:38,533
Please give them a round of applause.

1299
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:43,913
(They walk onto the stage with nervous hearts.)

1300
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:45,982
(They cheer enthusiastically.)

1301
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:47,382
Chih En.

1302
01:05:48,183 --> 01:05:50,712
(The starting players of TEAM BEAT are all wearing white.)

1303
01:05:51,082 --> 01:05:53,723
Keum Jin Ho, Jiang Fan,

1304
01:05:54,123 --> 01:05:55,152
Chih En.

1305
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:57,393
(He's cute.)

1306
01:05:57,393 --> 01:05:59,152
Why is Chih En so cute?

1307
01:05:59,263 --> 01:06:01,163
I think he's really nervous.

1308
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:02,692
Kim Dong Yun,

1309
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,792
An Yul, Park Ji Hun.

1310
01:06:06,303 --> 01:06:07,332
and Cha Woong Ki.

1311
01:06:08,562 --> 01:06:09,973
(Woong Ki)

1312
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:12,433
Cha Woong Ki.

1313
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:14,473
Do you know that this team is also really good?

1314
01:06:14,772 --> 01:06:16,442
Woong Ki is so good.

1315
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:20,843
- Let us say hello. Drop the beat! - Beat!

1316
01:06:21,113 --> 01:06:24,113
- Hello. We're the starting players. - We're TEAM BEAT.

1317
01:06:24,812 --> 01:06:27,982
(The starting players of TEAM BEAT can't harmonize from the start.)

1318
01:06:28,382 --> 01:06:29,453
What?

1319
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:31,953
(Reading the room)

1320
01:06:32,152 --> 01:06:34,062
- Hey! - Guys!

1321
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,132
I think we did better from the start.

1322
01:06:36,132 --> 01:06:37,692
(Let's go.)

1323
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,263
Did you purposely delay saying hello?

1324
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:42,902
- "Hello. TEAM BEAT." Like this? - I apologize.

1325
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,033
Can we try one more time?

1326
01:06:45,433 --> 01:06:48,442
Oh, okay. I'll give you one more chance.

1327
01:06:49,143 --> 01:06:51,442
Everyone, we'll say, "We're TEAM BEAT's starting lineup."

1328
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:52,473
- Yes. - Okay.

1329
01:06:52,473 --> 01:06:53,783
(We're ready.)

1330
01:06:53,783 --> 01:06:55,113
Let us say hello.

1331
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:58,312
- Drop the beat! - Beat!

1332
01:06:58,582 --> 01:06:59,723
- Hello. - Hello.

1333
01:06:59,723 --> 01:07:01,852
- We're TEAM BEAT's starting lineup. - We're TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.

1334
01:07:02,053 --> 01:07:04,752
(Nice to meet you.)

1335
01:07:05,652 --> 01:07:07,393
You could do well,

1336
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:10,033
but you were all just nervous.

1337
01:07:10,963 --> 01:07:12,392
Oh, no. They're so nervous.

1338
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:15,432
What kind of performance did you prepare for today?

1339
01:07:15,902 --> 01:07:19,102
We'll perform a song that Director EL CAPITXN composed.

1340
01:07:19,342 --> 01:07:21,003
It's a song by tripleS.

1341
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:24,413
It's called "Girls Never Die."

1342
01:07:25,413 --> 01:07:26,783
(Are they singing a girl group song?)

1343
01:07:27,213 --> 01:07:28,682
(Surprised)

1344
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,552
(It’s a representative song by Director EL CAPITXN...)

1345
01:07:31,552 --> 01:07:34,682
(with an addictive melody, realistic lyrics, and precise choreography.)

1346
01:07:36,423 --> 01:07:39,222
(They're performing a rearranged version, "Boys Never Die.")

1347
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:41,863
- "Girls Never Die?" - Yes, "Boys Never Die."

1348
01:07:41,863 --> 01:07:42,963
Oh, tripleS.

1349
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:45,833
I know this song. It's a good one.

1350
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:49,602
- The lyrics suit them well. - Yes.

1351
01:07:49,902 --> 01:07:51,932
Especially this part. "I'll go all the way. I won't give up."

1352
01:07:53,673 --> 01:07:55,243
Only the starting players of TEAM BEAT...

1353
01:07:55,602 --> 01:07:57,942
- selected a girl group song. - Yes.

1354
01:07:58,213 --> 01:07:59,482
What has changed from the original?

1355
01:07:59,982 --> 01:08:02,283
"Girls Never Die" by tripleS was...

1356
01:08:02,713 --> 01:08:05,152
(The choreography was sharp with a pure concept.)

1357
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:06,352
like this.

1358
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:08,583
But "Boys Never Die" is...

1359
01:08:08,982 --> 01:08:10,753
(Powerful)

1360
01:08:11,092 --> 01:08:12,892
(Perfect ending)

1361
01:08:13,363 --> 01:08:15,793
(Their reaction is overwhelming.)

1362
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:16,993
(Woong Ki, you're doing great!)

1363
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:19,163
Good! Woong Ki, you're great!

1364
01:08:19,163 --> 01:08:22,003
- What was that, Cha Woong Ki? - This is the vibe.

1365
01:08:22,972 --> 01:08:24,232
He showed us the ending fairy.

1366
01:08:24,232 --> 01:08:27,873
(How was practice for the starting players of TEAM BEAT?)

1367
01:08:29,203 --> 01:08:30,972
Oh, it changed to "Boys Never Die."

1368
01:08:30,972 --> 01:08:32,573
- I just realized. - Oh, you're right.

1369
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:34,342
- It changed to "Boys Never Die." - It's "Boys Never Die."

1370
01:08:34,342 --> 01:08:35,383
- I see. - That's nice.

1371
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:40,453
(First reveal of "Boys Never Die")

1372
01:08:41,482 --> 01:08:43,352
It's difficult.

1373
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:49,062
Why is it so sad? It's rearranged in a sad way.

1374
01:08:49,062 --> 01:08:51,692
The song, "Girls Never Die," was already sad.

1375
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:52,833
There's a bit of sorrow in it.

1376
01:08:53,533 --> 01:08:57,033
Usually, "Let's do it again" comes after "Shall I do it again?"

1377
01:08:57,373 --> 01:08:59,302
But after saying "Let's do it again,"

1378
01:08:59,472 --> 01:09:01,503
they failed, so they're hesitating to say, "Shall I do it again?"

1379
01:09:01,503 --> 01:09:02,543
That's right.

1380
01:09:02,743 --> 01:09:05,713
- This is the explanation, everyone! - Why are you so smart?

1381
01:09:07,213 --> 01:09:10,152
It's changed to "Boys Never Die" from "Girls Never Die."

1382
01:09:10,383 --> 01:09:13,883
"Girls Never Die" talks about a girl’s frustration...

1383
01:09:14,052 --> 01:09:16,793
and her resolve to try again.

1384
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:20,623
"Boys Never Die," when compared to my own story,

1385
01:09:20,963 --> 01:09:21,963
reflects...

1386
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:25,033
my determination...

1387
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:28,802
to try again after falling apart.

1388
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:33,173
(The lyrics are similar to their stories.)

1389
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,802
The most recent...

1390
01:09:36,312 --> 01:09:37,642
audition program...

1391
01:09:37,642 --> 01:09:40,482
was a great opportunity for me,

1392
01:09:40,482 --> 01:09:43,352
but unfortunately, I didn’t make it into the debuting team.

1393
01:09:45,052 --> 01:09:49,383
(He gave it all that he had but had to pack his bags in sorrow.)

1394
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:51,392
"I guess..."

1395
01:09:53,463 --> 01:09:55,592
"I had done enough."

1396
01:09:56,562 --> 01:09:59,663
(Should I quit?)

1397
01:09:59,663 --> 01:10:02,333
To be honest, I didn't want to enter another competition.

1398
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:04,232
I really didn't want to.

1399
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,142
However, not being on this show...

1400
01:10:08,142 --> 01:10:09,972
meant that I was giving up on my dreams.

1401
01:10:10,642 --> 01:10:14,842
(Should I start over?)

1402
01:10:20,652 --> 01:10:22,352
Hello, I'm...

1403
01:10:23,022 --> 01:10:24,123
I'm...

1404
01:10:24,123 --> 01:10:25,923
(Woong Ki entered another survival audition show...)

1405
01:10:25,923 --> 01:10:27,722
(to give it another chance at performing onstage.)

1406
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:32,293
Before I joined Universe League,

1407
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:35,232
I didn't have the strength to start over.

1408
01:10:35,363 --> 01:10:38,432
But right now, I'm at a stage where I'm eager to try again.

1409
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:40,873
(I'm at a stage where I'm eager to try again.)

1410
01:10:41,272 --> 01:10:44,012
(You're not worthy of this choreography.)

1411
01:10:44,713 --> 01:10:46,743
(Why are you trying to ruin the song I wrote?)

1412
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:51,283
(You don't seem to be ready.)

1413
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:54,852
(2 minutes?)

1414
01:10:55,123 --> 01:10:57,123
(You're killing me!)

1415
01:10:58,352 --> 01:11:00,323
(There's no reason for us to practice together.)

1416
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:10,432
(What happened during practice?)

1417
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:14,472
Five, six, seven, eight.

1418
01:11:14,472 --> 01:11:17,312
- One, two, and three, and four. - Step forward.

1419
01:11:17,312 --> 01:11:18,442
- Get into position. - Watch the formation.

1420
01:11:18,812 --> 01:11:20,583
It's okay. How much did you step forward?

1421
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,812
- How much did you step forward? - Sorry.

1422
01:11:22,812 --> 01:11:24,312
(Even Kim Dong Yun couldn't stay in formation.)

1423
01:11:25,883 --> 01:11:27,623
Run into position.

1424
01:11:28,482 --> 01:11:29,953
Step, and up.

1425
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,692
One, two, and...

1426
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:32,692
(Continuous mistakes by Park Ji Hun)

1427
01:11:32,692 --> 01:11:34,163
Ji Hun, walk in a straight line.

1428
01:11:34,163 --> 01:11:36,333
Don't move in or anything.

1429
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,562
Got it. Step, step, step.

1430
01:11:38,562 --> 01:11:40,802
- Like this. - Oh, right.

1431
01:11:40,802 --> 01:11:42,932
It's all right. Take it from the top.

1432
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:45,772
- One, two, three, four. - Don't miss the beat.

1433
01:11:45,772 --> 01:11:47,543
- Boom. Got it? - Yes.

1434
01:11:47,873 --> 01:11:49,272
Why are you two standing like that?

1435
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:50,312
(Choreographer Um Tae Woong)

1436
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,043
Don't you remember your positions?

1437
01:11:52,573 --> 01:11:54,812
- I don't. - You don't?

1438
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:57,383
How can you say you don't remember your positions?

1439
01:11:57,383 --> 01:12:00,883
No, not there. Ji Hun. Yes, you should step inward.

1440
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,993
(Park Ji Hun is lost and can't remember the steps.)

1441
01:12:02,993 --> 01:12:03,993
This is bad.

1442
01:12:04,722 --> 01:12:06,052
We need to move this along,

1443
01:12:06,052 --> 01:12:07,392
but I don't even know where to begin.

1444
01:12:07,392 --> 01:12:09,363
It worries me.

1445
01:12:11,363 --> 01:12:14,863
Ji Hun, you need to try harder and watch the videos more.

1446
01:12:15,762 --> 01:12:17,772
I've just started out...

1447
01:12:18,003 --> 01:12:20,573
learning how to sing and dance,

1448
01:12:20,842 --> 01:12:22,442
so I had fallen behind...

1449
01:12:22,442 --> 01:12:26,543
in terms of my positioning, the moves,

1450
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:30,312
and the overall timing of my steps.

1451
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:34,953
(During the draft)

1452
01:12:35,253 --> 01:12:36,923
(Park Ji Hun)

1453
01:12:38,152 --> 01:12:40,692
(For being handsome, although he lacked skills,)

1454
01:12:41,592 --> 01:12:45,892
(Park Ji Hun was chosen to be on TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.)

1455
01:12:45,892 --> 01:12:49,033
All 3 teams were able to welcome their 1st Picks.

1456
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:50,573
- Is he good-looking? - Those chosen...

1457
01:12:50,573 --> 01:12:52,533
- will sit with their teammates. - I'm suddenly on the fence.

1458
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:55,302
I didn't expect it at all.

1459
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:58,673
I didn't know if I had the right to be chosen.

1460
01:12:59,682 --> 01:13:03,583
I only thought about working harder from here.

1461
01:13:05,652 --> 01:13:07,652
(That night after dance training)

1462
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:11,552
(TEAM BEAT's starting players stay behind to practice.)

1463
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:18,133
(Park Ji Hun isn't focused.)

1464
01:13:20,932 --> 01:13:24,302
(He's only looking at himself in the mirror.)

1465
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:25,873
(Glancing)

1466
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:30,642
A lot of the time, Ji Hun doesn't look invested.

1467
01:13:31,113 --> 01:13:33,213
I don't know if it's because he's tired...

1468
01:13:33,213 --> 01:13:35,342
or because he doesn't have what it takes,

1469
01:13:35,342 --> 01:13:38,012
but in our eyes,

1470
01:13:38,253 --> 01:13:40,522
he doesn't seem passionate about this.

1471
01:13:47,993 --> 01:13:49,892
- Let's work on the dance break. - Sure.

1472
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:51,633
The dance break!

1473
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:54,963
(They practice the dance break, which requires teamwork.)

1474
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,363
And move back.

1475
01:13:57,432 --> 01:13:59,432
The formation was too wide just now.

1476
01:13:59,743 --> 01:14:02,142
- Right. Ji Hun. - Yes?

1477
01:14:03,942 --> 01:14:04,942
This place.

1478
01:14:05,113 --> 01:14:06,272
- Hold on. - Okay.

1479
01:14:06,272 --> 01:14:07,442
I told you about this yesterday.

1480
01:14:07,442 --> 01:14:08,883
(I gave you feedback on that part yesterday.)

1481
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:14,352
(Team leader Keum Jin Ho gave them daily feedback.)

1482
01:14:14,352 --> 01:14:15,522
- Here. Let's see it. - But I...

1483
01:14:15,522 --> 01:14:17,392
Doing this, I moved too much.

1484
01:14:17,392 --> 01:14:18,692
I slid too far back.

1485
01:14:18,692 --> 01:14:21,923
- That wasn't the problem. This was. - Yes, exactly.

1486
01:14:21,923 --> 01:14:25,033
(This move is the issue.)

1487
01:14:25,033 --> 01:14:26,503
- This is how it goes. - Right.

1488
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,133
Like this. Exactly.

1489
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:31,302
When your right arm comes up here, this arm should be out.

1490
01:14:32,602 --> 01:14:35,102
(They try working on the moves again.)

1491
01:14:37,213 --> 01:14:40,182
(The same mistake is made in the same part.)

1492
01:14:40,182 --> 01:14:43,613
- Nothing changed. - Exactly. That was the same.

1493
01:14:43,682 --> 01:14:47,652
The details...

1494
01:14:48,552 --> 01:14:52,152
that were pointed out by the others.

1495
01:14:52,152 --> 01:14:56,533
He clearly didn't practice them,

1496
01:14:56,533 --> 01:15:00,533
which kept leading to mistakes.

1497
01:15:04,102 --> 01:15:07,442
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup is gathered for vocal practice.)

1498
01:15:10,312 --> 01:15:13,113
(Park Ji Hun was off-beat.)

1499
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:15,713
You must count yourself in.

1500
01:15:15,713 --> 01:15:17,413
- Do you count the beat? - Yes.

1501
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,552
All you have to do is count four beats,

1502
01:15:19,552 --> 01:15:20,783
- but you... - However,

1503
01:15:20,783 --> 01:15:22,682
even after I count the beat,

1504
01:15:22,682 --> 01:15:25,123
my section begins off-beat.

1505
01:15:25,123 --> 01:15:27,793
It's not. It's right on the beat.

1506
01:15:27,793 --> 01:15:29,663
Meanwhile, you're going in off-beat.

1507
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:35,003
You sing after counting 5, 6, 7, and 8.

1508
01:15:35,003 --> 01:15:37,602
- It doesn't start like that. - Just listen.

1509
01:15:38,232 --> 01:15:40,873
(Jin Ho is lost for words at Ji Hun's brash attitude.)

1510
01:15:42,402 --> 01:15:45,913
(The others count the beat for him.)

1511
01:15:45,913 --> 01:15:49,852
Follow me, look how I've changed, let us become one

1512
01:15:50,052 --> 01:15:51,152
Turn it off.

1513
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:58,852
(Ji Hun listens to the song and checks the beat.)

1514
01:16:01,392 --> 01:16:04,963
(They wait for him to be done.)

1515
01:16:06,602 --> 01:16:07,732
I...

1516
01:16:09,463 --> 01:16:10,902
(Walking on eggshells)

1517
01:16:13,272 --> 01:16:15,142
You want to say this is off-beat, right?

1518
01:16:18,113 --> 01:16:19,613
Am I perceptive or what?

1519
01:16:24,352 --> 01:16:26,652
I figured it could be off-beat,

1520
01:16:26,652 --> 01:16:29,892
so I tried singing it that way, but it's definitely on the beat.

1521
01:16:32,923 --> 01:16:34,022
But that isn't what's important.

1522
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:36,222
- Exactly. As if that helps. - Right now...

1523
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:39,363
In this entire song, you were barely...

1524
01:16:39,363 --> 01:16:41,432
given ten seconds to master.

1525
01:16:41,902 --> 01:16:44,873
Actually,

1526
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:48,043
if I'm being honest,

1527
01:16:48,703 --> 01:16:52,713
to be off-beat when he had two weeks...

1528
01:16:53,783 --> 01:16:57,482
I'd like to have someone else sing that section instead.

1529
01:16:57,482 --> 01:16:58,713
(Someone else should sing it.)

1530
01:16:59,883 --> 01:17:02,953
(An Yul's suggestion leaves them deep in thought.)

1531
01:17:03,522 --> 01:17:06,453
Ji Hun's attitude wasn't improving,

1532
01:17:06,762 --> 01:17:09,323
which only exhausted us.

1533
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:11,133
Could you...

1534
01:17:12,062 --> 01:17:17,732
perhaps give me about two minutes?

1535
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:21,073
Why did we have to wait 2 weeks if you could master it in 2 minutes?

1536
01:17:23,573 --> 01:17:26,243
We gave you enough time to practice.

1537
01:17:26,243 --> 01:17:27,283
We gave you time...

1538
01:17:27,283 --> 01:17:29,113
to practice that section for hours each day.

1539
01:17:30,482 --> 01:17:32,213
Two minutes?

1540
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:34,083
You're killing me.

1541
01:17:34,753 --> 01:17:37,793
He hadn't practiced the things...

1542
01:17:37,892 --> 01:17:41,163
that I thought were essential,

1543
01:17:41,592 --> 01:17:43,592
which only made me more anxious.

1544
01:17:44,033 --> 01:17:45,432
The anxiety is eating away at me.

1545
01:17:49,602 --> 01:17:50,673
- What's up? - My gosh.

1546
01:17:50,673 --> 01:17:52,333
- Hello. - Hi.

1547
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:54,142
- What's up? - My gosh.

1548
01:17:54,442 --> 01:17:56,442
(Director YUGYEOM is here to check on their progress.)

1549
01:17:56,442 --> 01:17:58,972
- Hello. - Hi.

1550
01:17:58,972 --> 01:18:00,942
What's up? Hey, I'm in blue too.

1551
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,512
- Hello. - Hello.

1552
01:18:03,453 --> 01:18:04,453
Hi.

1553
01:18:04,453 --> 01:18:05,583
(Nervous)

1554
01:18:05,583 --> 01:18:07,482
- Have you been well? - Yes.

1555
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:08,652
(Choreographer Um Tae Woong)

1556
01:18:08,652 --> 01:18:10,592
Did you practice singing live while dancing?

1557
01:18:10,592 --> 01:18:11,923
- Yes. - Yes, we did.

1558
01:18:12,692 --> 01:18:14,562
I'll check your progress so far...

1559
01:18:14,562 --> 01:18:16,623
and give you whatever feedback there is.

1560
01:18:16,623 --> 01:18:18,463
- Sure. - Good luck.

1561
01:18:18,463 --> 01:18:19,963
- All right. - Let's go.

1562
01:18:21,133 --> 01:18:23,533
- Chih En, let's go. - Let's do this.

1563
01:18:24,402 --> 01:18:25,472
(Excited)

1564
01:18:28,173 --> 01:18:30,073
(The starting players show their director...)

1565
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:31,642
(the song they have practiced so far.)

1566
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:40,753
(Even from the start, they're not in sync.)

1567
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:52,133
(Park Ji Hun's mistake messes up the formation.)

1568
01:18:59,232 --> 01:19:01,203
(My gosh!)

1569
01:19:02,442 --> 01:19:05,713
(YUGYEOM can't seem to find the right words.)

1570
01:19:08,842 --> 01:19:12,413
I was so ashamed that I couldn't raise my head.

1571
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,852
You're not worthy of this choreography.

1572
01:19:18,092 --> 01:19:20,923
(YUGYEOM begins his feedback with harsh criticism.)

1573
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:23,892
You don't seem to be ready at all.

1574
01:19:25,863 --> 01:19:27,762
I had never heard anyone say that to me before,

1575
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:30,633
which was why I felt like I had been hit on the head.

1576
01:19:31,602 --> 01:19:34,972
There clearly seems to be a communication issue,

1577
01:19:34,972 --> 01:19:36,573
and you're not in sync.

1578
01:19:36,573 --> 01:19:38,142
Like I said before,

1579
01:19:38,142 --> 01:19:41,083
you have to give each other as much feedback as you can.

1580
01:19:41,842 --> 01:19:43,283
I didn't see any improvement.

1581
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:49,083
I don't know where to start, but I'll slowly tell you 1 by 1.

1582
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:50,993
Try the chorus choreography.

1583
01:19:52,592 --> 01:19:55,592
One, two, and three, and four, and five,

1584
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:57,932
six, seven, eight.

1585
01:20:00,902 --> 01:20:02,363
Wait. This move...

1586
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:06,333
should feel heavier.

1587
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:09,373
The dance moves need to be light at times and heavy at other times.

1588
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:12,913
But all the moves feel light, like only your arms and legs are dancing.

1589
01:20:13,613 --> 01:20:15,783
Dancing like this.

1590
01:20:15,982 --> 01:20:18,453
Ji Hun, can you dance alone?

1591
01:20:20,423 --> 01:20:23,423
(Park Ji Hun shows his solo part.)

1592
01:20:26,052 --> 01:20:27,123
Okay.

1593
01:20:31,863 --> 01:20:33,562
The beat in your part is very strong.

1594
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,863
But if your energy decreases,

1595
01:20:36,902 --> 01:20:39,272
that part will just collapse.

1596
01:20:39,272 --> 01:20:42,342
Even if you can't handle it,

1597
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,942
- you need to practice more. - I'll practice.

1598
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:48,512
But didn't you practice until now?

1599
01:20:49,243 --> 01:20:50,512
Try your best.

1600
01:20:53,453 --> 01:20:56,552
Personally, I think...

1601
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:58,092
it's simple.

1602
01:20:58,352 --> 01:21:02,022
It's simple. If you practice a lot, you will do well. If not, you won't.

1603
01:21:02,363 --> 01:21:04,562
I will be able to see and feel that.

1604
01:21:04,562 --> 01:21:05,833
(Director YUGYEOM tells the team that they're not practicing enough.)

1605
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:07,633
The audience will know too.

1606
01:21:08,203 --> 01:21:11,602
Like he said, it doesn't make sense that you're not improving.

1607
01:21:11,602 --> 01:21:14,342
(It doesn't make sense that you're not improving.)

1608
01:21:18,342 --> 01:21:20,043
(A few days after the interim check)

1609
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:21,342
- Ji Hun, come here. - Yes.

1610
01:21:22,512 --> 01:21:23,552
- I mean... - Yes.

1611
01:21:24,283 --> 01:21:25,352
Well...

1612
01:21:27,522 --> 01:21:30,323
Why is everyone talking about you?

1613
01:21:32,092 --> 01:21:33,762
I hate people who ruin my song.

1614
01:21:33,762 --> 01:21:36,022
(I hate people who ruin my song.)

1615
01:21:36,022 --> 01:21:37,892
This is a song I truly cherish.

1616
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,432
- I'm sorry. - I don't want your apology.

1617
01:21:42,932 --> 01:21:45,073
You should be sorry to your team.

1618
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,373
- Apologize to them. - Yes.

1619
01:21:47,942 --> 01:21:49,543
Even with just two days left, give it your all.

1620
01:21:49,543 --> 01:21:51,873
(Even with just two days left, give it your all.)

1621
01:21:57,852 --> 01:22:02,123
(Park Ji Hun and An Yul are practicing individually.)

1622
01:22:09,062 --> 01:22:12,293
(An Yul leaves the practice room for a moment.)

1623
01:22:12,293 --> 01:22:14,302
(Glancing)

1624
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:33,213
(Park Ji Hun changes the angle of the camera.)

1625
01:22:34,823 --> 01:22:38,152
At this rate, all seven of us are in danger.

1626
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:43,963
I have many stage experiences.

1627
01:22:44,232 --> 01:22:46,762
I shouldn't be worse than I was in the past.

1628
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:51,432
But I'm afraid I'll be like that.

1629
01:22:52,972 --> 01:22:55,772
- You can do it! - Let's go!

1630
01:22:55,772 --> 01:22:58,413
(TEAM BEAT prepared for the stage amid worry and anxiety.)

1631
01:23:00,682 --> 01:23:03,213
I hope they give it their all with no regrets.

1632
01:23:04,652 --> 01:23:05,652
We can't lose.

1633
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:10,692
(What kind of performance will TEAM BEAT's starting players show?)

1634
01:23:10,692 --> 01:23:13,123
- You can do it! - Let's go!

1635
01:23:13,123 --> 01:23:14,123
You can do it!

1636
01:23:14,892 --> 01:23:17,863
- I'm nervous. - Ready? Go.

1637
01:23:18,932 --> 01:23:19,932
It's cool.

1638
01:23:23,262 --> 01:23:25,533
("Boys Never Die" by Cha Woong Ki, Chih En, Jiang Fan,)

1639
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,173
(Keum Jin Ho, Kim Dong Yun, Park Ji Hun)

1640
01:23:35,213 --> 01:23:36,213
Good.

1641
01:23:48,923 --> 01:23:50,932
Cha Woong Ki is amazing.

1642
01:25:13,413 --> 01:25:14,413
There was no mistake.

1643
01:25:46,043 --> 01:25:47,913
Cha Woong Ki is so powerful.

1644
01:25:52,453 --> 01:25:54,623
There's too much power, so the choreography isn’t in sync.

1645
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:56,823
Completely.

1646
01:26:20,113 --> 01:26:21,182
They did well.

1647
01:26:21,182 --> 01:26:22,642
(Nam Do Yoon)

1648
01:26:22,642 --> 01:26:24,982
- They nailed it! - I want to watch it again.

1649
01:26:24,982 --> 01:26:27,283
I'll feel frustrated if we don't win.

1650
01:26:27,283 --> 01:26:28,323
They were so cool.

1651
01:26:28,953 --> 01:26:29,982
Thank you.

1652
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:35,963
(Do Yoon, read the room.)

1653
01:26:40,732 --> 01:26:41,932
TEAM RHYTHM, let's go. Straighten your backs.

1654
01:26:44,102 --> 01:26:45,402
(Straightening backs)

1655
01:26:45,932 --> 01:26:46,932
We won.

1656
01:26:48,472 --> 01:26:50,772
(Predicting a win)

1657
01:26:52,142 --> 01:26:54,012
I felt anxious,

1658
01:26:54,012 --> 01:26:56,043
and we struggled during practice,

1659
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:59,383
but before the stage, he kept saying that he'd do well...

1660
01:26:59,383 --> 01:27:00,722
because he'd practiced a lot.

1661
01:27:01,052 --> 01:27:04,293
I trusted him and performed, but...

1662
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:10,293
He made mistakes in pitch, timing,

1663
01:27:10,993 --> 01:27:13,692
and even gestures.

1664
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:16,663
I also danced...

1665
01:27:17,203 --> 01:27:19,073
two counts early in the chorus.

1666
01:27:21,173 --> 01:27:24,772
(Teamwork that didn't work out, even onstage.)

1667
01:27:26,012 --> 01:27:28,482
The lack of harmony in our team was the most disappointing.

1668
01:27:33,812 --> 01:27:35,682
(There are only regrets in TEAM BEAT's performance.)

1669
01:27:35,682 --> 01:27:38,092
Start voting now.

1670
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:39,192
(The on-site voting has started.)

1671
01:27:39,793 --> 01:27:42,022
Voting will be based on individual evaluation.

1672
01:27:42,562 --> 01:27:45,963
The team ranking will be determined by the scores of all players.

1673
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:49,562
The one with the highest score for each stage will be the MVP.

1674
01:27:50,363 --> 01:27:51,932
Two, one!

1675
01:27:52,173 --> 01:27:53,203
Yes.

1676
01:27:53,942 --> 01:27:56,402
Voting is now closed.

1677
01:27:56,402 --> 01:27:57,673
(Voting is now closed.)

1678
01:27:57,972 --> 01:28:01,213
Shall we see who won the MVP?

1679
01:28:01,682 --> 01:28:02,812
(Who will win?)

1680
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,222
I think he can win it. He's charming.

1681
01:28:09,722 --> 01:28:13,123
(Is it Chih En who grabs attention at first glance?)

1682
01:28:13,592 --> 01:28:15,863
- Who do you think will be the MVP? - The MVP?

1683
01:28:16,722 --> 01:28:18,232
I think it'll be Cha Woong Ki.

1684
01:28:18,232 --> 01:28:21,762
I think the same. Cha Woong Ki.

1685
01:28:23,003 --> 01:28:24,932
(Is it Woong Ki who finished the stage without faltering?)

1686
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:26,133
The MVP of TEAM BEAT is...

1687
01:28:26,133 --> 01:28:29,402
(Which player will boost the team with the highest number of votes?)

1688
01:28:30,086 --> 01:28:31,325
The MVP of TEAM BEAT is...

1689
01:28:32,525 --> 01:28:33,886
(Chih En)

1690
01:28:36,355 --> 01:28:37,596
It's Cha Woong Ki!

1691
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:38,825
(Cha Woong Ki is the MVP of TEAM BEAT.)

1692
01:28:38,825 --> 01:28:39,895
Thank you!

1693
01:28:40,735 --> 01:28:41,735
Thank you.

1694
01:28:42,766 --> 01:28:44,065
It's Cha Woong Ki!

1695
01:28:46,605 --> 01:28:48,105
Of course.

1696
01:28:50,876 --> 01:28:53,445
- I expected him to get it. - Yes.

1697
01:28:53,445 --> 01:28:55,516
Wait. I was right.

1698
01:28:55,516 --> 01:28:56,516
(It's Cha Woong Ki.)

1699
01:28:57,145 --> 01:28:58,145
Gosh.

1700
01:29:00,046 --> 01:29:02,916
Woong Ki, they must've felt how desperate you were.

1701
01:29:02,916 --> 01:29:04,126
Thank you so much.

1702
01:29:04,985 --> 01:29:07,325
- Well... - Why?

1703
01:29:07,726 --> 01:29:11,025
I'll continue to do my best and debut.

1704
01:29:11,266 --> 01:29:12,365
I'll do my best!

1705
01:29:14,596 --> 01:29:16,195
Well done.

1706
01:29:20,876 --> 01:29:22,735
- Well done. - Thank you.

1707
01:29:22,735 --> 01:29:24,376
Good job.

1708
01:29:24,376 --> 01:29:26,346
- Good job. - Well done.

1709
01:29:26,506 --> 01:29:27,575
Good job.

1710
01:29:28,575 --> 01:29:30,476
- You won. - Nice.

1711
01:29:30,476 --> 01:29:32,815
Well done.

1712
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:35,155
Good job.

1713
01:29:35,386 --> 01:29:37,556
- Does this... - I'll check the mic.

1714
01:29:37,556 --> 01:29:40,655
(They welcome the players brightly, but they can't hide the regret.)

1715
01:29:41,025 --> 01:29:43,455
Number one is teamwork and vibe.

1716
01:29:43,895 --> 01:29:45,995
Number two is the result.

1717
01:29:46,195 --> 01:29:49,796
And we failed to show both.

1718
01:29:50,195 --> 01:29:51,266
I regretted everything.

1719
01:29:53,006 --> 01:29:55,535
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup put on a regrettable performance.)

1720
01:29:55,936 --> 01:29:59,806
(The waiting room for TEAM GROOVE that's up next)

1721
01:29:59,806 --> 01:30:02,445
I'm not okay.

1722
01:30:02,445 --> 01:30:03,645
(Nervous)

1723
01:30:03,645 --> 01:30:05,386
Should I take a relaxing pill or something?

1724
01:30:06,445 --> 01:30:09,016
- You should. - It feels like my heart will burst.

1725
01:30:09,615 --> 01:30:12,186
- Park Han. - What? Why is it beating so fast?

1726
01:30:12,355 --> 01:30:13,985
- You can do it. - We got this!

1727
01:30:13,985 --> 01:30:14,995
You can do it.

1728
01:30:15,226 --> 01:30:18,596
That's the world you'll be in soon.

1729
01:30:23,195 --> 01:30:24,266
I'm so nervous.

1730
01:30:25,636 --> 01:30:26,705
What do I do?

1731
01:30:27,436 --> 01:30:30,336
Shall we watch the next performance?

1732
01:30:30,336 --> 01:30:33,275
- Yes! - Yes!

1733
01:30:33,676 --> 01:30:36,846
- Let's go. - Good luck.

1734
01:30:36,945 --> 01:30:38,046
Gather up.

1735
01:30:38,285 --> 01:30:39,645
- Good luck. - You got this.

1736
01:30:39,645 --> 01:30:41,155
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1737
01:30:41,355 --> 01:30:44,115
Just show what you've been doing. Do what you can do.

1738
01:30:44,626 --> 01:30:46,186
Do what you always do.

1739
01:30:46,285 --> 01:30:47,895
- Yes. - Don't worry about anything.

1740
01:30:47,895 --> 01:30:49,455
- Yes. - Yes.

1741
01:30:50,226 --> 01:30:52,525
- Downward. - Enjoy it.

1742
01:30:52,525 --> 01:30:54,535
- Let's enjoy it. - Yes, enjoy it. Okay?

1743
01:30:54,535 --> 01:30:56,895
- One, two, three. Let's go! - Let's go!

1744
01:30:56,895 --> 01:30:57,936
(Go, TEAM GROOVE.)

1745
01:30:57,936 --> 01:30:59,365
- You got this. - GROOVE.

1746
01:30:59,365 --> 01:31:01,806
- You got this. - Good luck.

1747
01:31:01,806 --> 01:31:03,605
- Good luck. - Do your best.

1748
01:31:04,035 --> 01:31:05,645
- Promise me. - I'll pull it off.

1749
01:31:06,006 --> 01:31:07,676
- You can do it. - I'll do my best.

1750
01:31:07,676 --> 01:31:09,476
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1751
01:31:10,046 --> 01:31:12,386
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1752
01:31:12,985 --> 01:31:15,355
TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup, please come on up.

1753
01:31:15,355 --> 01:31:16,655
(Kyung Ho)

1754
01:31:16,655 --> 01:31:18,126
(Jeong Woo)

1755
01:31:22,955 --> 01:31:25,796
(Nervous to meet the audience for the first time onstage)

1756
01:31:25,796 --> 01:31:26,796
Kyung Ho!

1757
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:32,235
James, Zen Zen,

1758
01:31:33,436 --> 01:31:34,476
Kenta.

1759
01:31:35,176 --> 01:31:36,275
(Kenta)

1760
01:31:36,275 --> 01:31:37,336
(Jeong Woo)

1761
01:31:37,336 --> 01:31:38,376
Seo Jeong Woo.

1762
01:31:38,846 --> 01:31:40,275
(Surprised)

1763
01:31:40,546 --> 01:31:41,615
Park Han.

1764
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:43,516
Jang Kyung Ho.

1765
01:31:44,615 --> 01:31:45,686
(Jang Kyung Ho)

1766
01:31:45,985 --> 01:31:47,485
Kim Joo Hyoung.

1767
01:31:48,216 --> 01:31:49,256
Joo Hyoung!

1768
01:31:49,256 --> 01:31:50,256
(Kim Joo Hyoung)

1769
01:31:51,056 --> 01:31:52,256
Let's go.

1770
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:54,796
GROOVE.

1771
01:31:54,895 --> 01:31:57,126
- Two, three. It's time to groove. - It's time to groove.

1772
01:31:57,126 --> 01:31:58,426
- It's time to groove. - It's time to groove.

1773
01:31:58,426 --> 01:32:01,565
Hello. We're TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.

1774
01:32:01,895 --> 01:32:03,735
(Nice to meet you.)

1775
01:32:03,735 --> 01:32:05,506
(Kim Joo Hyoung)

1776
01:32:06,006 --> 01:32:07,306
See how loud they are?

1777
01:32:08,205 --> 01:32:10,306
(Nervous to hear their fans' cheer)

1778
01:32:14,676 --> 01:32:17,546
They feel like...

1779
01:32:17,546 --> 01:32:18,886
You know...

1780
01:32:19,245 --> 01:32:21,615
The real singers.

1781
01:32:21,615 --> 01:32:23,556
- That's what they feel like. - Yes.

1782
01:32:23,655 --> 01:32:25,586
They don't look like idols.

1783
01:32:25,586 --> 01:32:26,955
Maybe because...

1784
01:32:26,955 --> 01:32:28,955
- they're in school uniforms? - The vibe...

1785
01:32:29,296 --> 01:32:32,596
All of their vocalists are good.

1786
01:32:33,596 --> 01:32:36,035
They're holding hand mics.

1787
01:32:36,266 --> 01:32:39,705
I'm expecting them to sing a ballad.

1788
01:32:39,905 --> 01:32:41,836
Because he's an amazing singer too.

1789
01:32:41,836 --> 01:32:42,936
- Yes. - So I'm guessing...

1790
01:32:43,235 --> 01:32:46,006
What did you prepare today?

1791
01:32:46,006 --> 01:32:48,645
It's our director BTOB's...

1792
01:32:49,346 --> 01:32:51,086
"Missing You."

1793
01:32:51,086 --> 01:32:52,945
("Missing You" by BTOB)

1794
01:32:53,285 --> 01:32:58,926
("Missing You" is a sentimental ballad.)

1795
01:32:59,525 --> 01:33:05,796
(The song's known for its delicate harmony and vocals.)

1796
01:33:05,796 --> 01:33:08,766
(Loving it)

1797
01:33:09,065 --> 01:33:12,035
TEAM GROOVE's outstanding vocalists are all here.

1798
01:33:12,166 --> 01:33:15,436
Who's the main vocalist here?

1799
01:33:15,436 --> 01:33:18,976
(Which player is the main vocalist?)

1800
01:33:19,275 --> 01:33:22,046
- Hello. - Hello.

1801
01:33:22,046 --> 01:33:25,615
I'll hear your voices first and assign the parts.

1802
01:33:25,615 --> 01:33:26,716
- Yes. - Yes.

1803
01:33:27,046 --> 01:33:30,186
I heard the starting lineup consisted of main vocalists.

1804
01:33:30,455 --> 01:33:32,556
- Yes. - I still have a lot to show...

1805
01:33:32,556 --> 01:33:34,025
in terms of my vocals.

1806
01:33:35,126 --> 01:33:41,235
(Park Han is stable no matter how intense the choreography is.)

1807
01:33:41,235 --> 01:33:42,735
I wanted the main vocalist position.

1808
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:47,565
(Jang Kyung Ho with nice and powerful vocals)

1809
01:33:47,565 --> 01:33:50,836
(Jang Kyung Ho with nice and powerful vocals)

1810
01:33:50,836 --> 01:33:55,275
(Zen Zen with refreshing vocals)

1811
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:59,716
(Kim Joo Hyoung, the all-rounder vocalist and rapper)

1812
01:34:00,186 --> 01:34:03,955
I'll look forward to the main vocalist of main vocalists.

1813
01:34:04,115 --> 01:34:05,325
- Joo Hyoung. - Yes.

1814
01:34:05,325 --> 01:34:06,355
(Kim Joo Hyoung tries the main vocalist part.)

1815
01:34:06,825 --> 01:34:07,855
(Clearing his voice)

1816
01:34:08,355 --> 01:34:09,855
(Eyes focused)

1817
01:34:09,855 --> 01:34:15,266
A day is gone after missing you

1818
01:34:15,535 --> 01:34:21,205
A year is gone after missing you

1819
01:34:21,205 --> 01:34:23,006
(He struggles with the high notes.)

1820
01:34:24,905 --> 01:34:27,775
After missing you

1821
01:34:28,775 --> 01:34:29,815
Okay.

1822
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:35,516
(Zen Zen tries the main vocalist part.)

1823
01:34:35,516 --> 01:34:41,226
A year is gone after missing you

1824
01:34:41,355 --> 01:34:43,256
Missing you

1825
01:34:43,256 --> 01:34:45,966
I was surprised. He was good at reaching the high note.

1826
01:34:45,966 --> 01:34:49,035
- Okay. Next is Kyung Ho. - Yes.

1827
01:34:49,035 --> 01:34:50,466
(Jang Kyung Ho goes next.)

1828
01:34:51,506 --> 01:34:56,976
A day is gone after missing you

1829
01:34:57,205 --> 01:35:02,976
A year is gone after missing you

1830
01:35:02,976 --> 01:35:05,086
(His voice cracked while singing a high note.)

1831
01:35:05,086 --> 01:35:10,716
That's how I live now

1832
01:35:10,815 --> 01:35:16,926
After missing you

1833
01:35:18,226 --> 01:35:19,266
Okay.

1834
01:35:23,966 --> 01:35:27,535
(Park Han tries the main vocalist part.)

1835
01:35:28,136 --> 01:35:30,405
(I see.)

1836
01:35:30,405 --> 01:35:34,976
(Sad voice and stable high notes)

1837
01:35:35,476 --> 01:35:40,886
That's how I live now

1838
01:35:40,886 --> 01:35:47,226
After missing you

1839
01:35:47,485 --> 01:35:48,796
- Okay. - Thank you.

1840
01:35:48,796 --> 01:35:50,825
(Pulling off the main vocalist part)

1841
01:35:50,825 --> 01:35:51,825
I...

1842
01:35:52,065 --> 01:35:53,096
(I...)

1843
01:35:53,096 --> 01:35:55,895
I was too nervous and failed to show what I could do.

1844
01:35:56,136 --> 01:35:58,336
Can I try it again?

1845
01:36:07,245 --> 01:36:12,145
(Jang Kyung Ho tries it again.)

1846
01:36:12,445 --> 01:36:18,056
A year is gone after missing you

1847
01:36:18,056 --> 01:36:20,556
(His voice cracks again.)

1848
01:36:20,556 --> 01:36:25,865
That's how I live now

1849
01:36:25,865 --> 01:36:31,966
After missing you

1850
01:36:34,365 --> 01:36:37,636
I was angry...

1851
01:36:37,636 --> 01:36:39,745
at myself.

1852
01:36:42,376 --> 01:36:45,315
Because so many of you are good,

1853
01:36:45,315 --> 01:36:47,516
we contemplated a lot.

1854
01:36:50,716 --> 01:36:53,455
I wanted to sing the chorus.

1855
01:36:53,686 --> 01:36:55,626
If I get to sing the main vocalist part,

1856
01:36:55,626 --> 01:36:58,065
I will be able to show my vocals.

1857
01:36:58,065 --> 01:37:00,426
(Who will get to sing the main vocalist part?)

1858
01:37:00,426 --> 01:37:02,636
- Han will sing the first chorus. - Yes.

1859
01:37:03,035 --> 01:37:05,336
And "That's how I" part goes...

1860
01:37:05,336 --> 01:37:06,936
- to Joo Hyoung. - Yes.

1861
01:37:07,136 --> 01:37:10,405
- The second chorus goes to Zen Zen. - Yes.

1862
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,645
The last chorus...

1863
01:37:12,645 --> 01:37:14,176
(The last chorus...)

1864
01:37:14,916 --> 01:37:15,945
Han should sing it.

1865
01:37:16,615 --> 01:37:17,676
- Yes. - Okay.

1866
01:37:18,645 --> 01:37:19,886
I was so happy.

1867
01:37:20,186 --> 01:37:22,056
I got all the parts I wanted.

1868
01:37:22,056 --> 01:37:24,626
I'll be able to show you my vocals.

1869
01:37:25,186 --> 01:37:27,226
The rap goes to Kyung Ho.

1870
01:37:27,825 --> 01:37:29,556
Until the end of this part.

1871
01:37:29,556 --> 01:37:30,695
(Jang Kyung Ho got the rap, not the vocalist part.)

1872
01:37:30,695 --> 01:37:31,695
Okay.

1873
01:37:32,426 --> 01:37:35,365
I've never performed as a rapper before.

1874
01:37:35,365 --> 01:37:37,296
I was so worried.

1875
01:37:37,466 --> 01:37:41,306
I told myself this after the draft.

1876
01:37:41,705 --> 01:37:44,775
(He performed in a team for the draft.)

1877
01:37:45,445 --> 01:37:46,445
(It's a bummer.)

1878
01:37:46,846 --> 01:37:51,445
(They were criticized for terrible teamwork.)

1879
01:37:51,445 --> 01:37:52,516
Here's the thing.

1880
01:37:52,516 --> 01:37:55,285
(I didn't feel your emotion at all.)

1881
01:37:56,186 --> 01:37:58,686
"I don't want my team..."

1882
01:37:58,686 --> 01:38:01,525
"to be criticized anymore."

1883
01:38:01,796 --> 01:38:04,325
When I'm done here,

1884
01:38:04,525 --> 01:38:07,226
there should be a line in front of me.

1885
01:38:08,065 --> 01:38:10,796
It's a shame that I missed the main vocalist part.

1886
01:38:10,966 --> 01:38:12,105
Let's go!

1887
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:15,836
But my strength is dancing.

1888
01:38:16,336 --> 01:38:18,976
I'll lead other people in dancing.

1889
01:38:19,105 --> 01:38:21,775
Hit, go back, and hit again.

1890
01:38:22,445 --> 01:38:23,876
Jeong Woo, you have to move more.

1891
01:38:25,245 --> 01:38:27,485
He teaches every detail...

1892
01:38:27,785 --> 01:38:29,615
and timing 1 by 1.

1893
01:38:29,886 --> 01:38:32,785
One and boom and go.

1894
01:38:32,785 --> 01:38:34,995
Again. Five, six, seven, eight.

1895
01:38:34,995 --> 01:38:37,155
(Practicing the choreography with Jang Kyung Ho in the lead)

1896
01:38:37,825 --> 01:38:42,336
(Practicing over and over to be the best team)

1897
01:38:42,936 --> 01:38:46,506
(And it's the day of interim check.)

1898
01:38:47,336 --> 01:38:48,376
Not yet

1899
01:38:48,376 --> 01:38:50,535
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

1900
01:38:50,535 --> 01:38:52,676
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

1901
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:54,376
- Hello. - Hello.

1902
01:38:54,376 --> 01:38:55,716
(Director Lee Chang Sub visited the practice room.)

1903
01:38:55,716 --> 01:38:56,745
So humid.

1904
01:38:58,245 --> 01:38:59,546
You must've practiced a lot.

1905
01:39:01,955 --> 01:39:04,926
I've been watching your practice.

1906
01:39:05,025 --> 01:39:08,096
- Yes. - I see the updates every day.

1907
01:39:08,325 --> 01:39:11,796
I want to see it after a while.

1908
01:39:11,796 --> 01:39:13,995
- Yes. - I want to see...

1909
01:39:13,995 --> 01:39:16,695
how much you've practiced...

1910
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:20,336
and what you need to work on.

1911
01:39:20,436 --> 01:39:22,636
Let's talk about it after watching it.

1912
01:39:22,636 --> 01:39:23,735
- Yes. - Okay?

1913
01:39:24,006 --> 01:39:25,905
- The starting lineup first. - Yes.

1914
01:39:25,905 --> 01:39:26,945
(Checking TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup first)

1915
01:39:26,945 --> 01:39:28,615
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1916
01:39:32,645 --> 01:39:35,686
(How will TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup do?)

1917
01:39:38,825 --> 01:39:42,195
(The intro begins with Park Han's voice.)

1918
01:39:42,195 --> 01:39:43,626
(Focused)

1919
01:39:48,766 --> 01:39:51,195
(Awkward)

1920
01:39:51,195 --> 01:39:54,565
I guess I'm still there

1921
01:39:55,836 --> 01:40:01,245
(Kenta, the foreigner, raps.)

1922
01:40:01,245 --> 01:40:05,945
I thought I saw the answer, but it became a prison that locked me up

1923
01:40:06,916 --> 01:40:09,285
Missing you

1924
01:40:09,756 --> 01:40:13,955
Missing you

1925
01:40:13,955 --> 01:40:15,325
(Their performance for the interim check ends.)

1926
01:40:16,126 --> 01:40:22,796
(What does Director Lee Chang Sub say?)

1927
01:40:22,796 --> 01:40:25,636
Honestly, I wasn't looking forward to it.

1928
01:40:27,065 --> 01:40:29,876
I didn't expect you to make it in such a short time.

1929
01:40:30,506 --> 01:40:31,676
It was beyond my expectations.

1930
01:40:31,676 --> 01:40:34,476
(It was beyond my expectations.)

1931
01:40:35,476 --> 01:40:36,876
You appeared to be united.

1932
01:40:37,176 --> 01:40:38,245
It seems the leader...

1933
01:40:39,716 --> 01:40:41,655
did a good job of leading you.

1934
01:40:42,355 --> 01:40:44,416
It was good. I mean it.

1935
01:40:44,516 --> 01:40:46,086
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1936
01:40:46,556 --> 01:40:48,596
(Feeling proud)

1937
01:40:49,226 --> 01:40:50,556
- Kenta. - Yes.

1938
01:40:51,256 --> 01:40:54,166
I wondered if you could do it when you didn't learn Korean.

1939
01:40:54,166 --> 01:40:55,565
I was worried a lot.

1940
01:40:56,065 --> 01:40:57,065
It was wonderful.

1941
01:41:00,065 --> 01:41:01,105
Thank you.

1942
01:41:02,905 --> 01:41:05,976
I was surprised...

1943
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:07,605
to receive a compliment.

1944
01:41:07,705 --> 01:41:10,245
It was a good idea...

1945
01:41:10,245 --> 01:41:12,216
to do my best.

1946
01:41:12,516 --> 01:41:15,115
"Missing You" focuses...

1947
01:41:15,115 --> 01:41:17,785
on vocals.

1948
01:41:17,886 --> 01:41:20,855
We have to fix the vocals more.

1949
01:41:21,355 --> 01:41:22,596
(Director Chang Sub's lesson)

1950
01:41:22,596 --> 01:41:23,756
Try it.

1951
01:41:24,195 --> 01:41:26,096
(Zen Zen has the high note part.)

1952
01:41:26,296 --> 01:41:27,296
Try this and do it.

1953
01:41:27,966 --> 01:41:28,966
- In this pose. - Like this?

1954
01:41:28,995 --> 01:41:31,395
(High note tip 1: posture)

1955
01:41:31,636 --> 01:41:34,506
- Say, "Na." - "Na."

1956
01:41:34,735 --> 01:41:35,905
Na

1957
01:41:35,905 --> 01:41:37,676
(Problem solved.)

1958
01:41:38,136 --> 01:41:41,245
His lessons are different.

1959
01:41:41,245 --> 01:41:43,376
When you go, "Missing you,"

1960
01:41:43,476 --> 01:41:46,516
imagine you're making a triangle.

1961
01:41:47,016 --> 01:41:49,586
- Missing you - Yes.

1962
01:41:49,716 --> 01:41:52,525
- Missing you - You got it.

1963
01:41:52,726 --> 01:41:55,126
- It sounds clear. Okay? - Yes.

1964
01:41:55,726 --> 01:41:57,096
He complimented us a lot,

1965
01:41:57,096 --> 01:41:59,666
and he told us what to change nicely.

1966
01:41:59,666 --> 01:42:02,065
It felt like a buy 1 get 10 free.

1967
01:42:02,436 --> 01:42:04,936
It was a very rich lesson.

1968
01:42:05,836 --> 01:42:07,336
Anyone with no handheld mic experience?

1969
01:42:08,535 --> 01:42:10,136
- Never? - No.

1970
01:42:10,735 --> 01:42:13,205
- Only at karaoke. - At karaoke. It's the same.

1971
01:42:13,575 --> 01:42:15,676
But I've never used it while dancing.

1972
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:18,445
Is it hard to dance with a handheld mic?

1973
01:42:18,445 --> 01:42:19,615
(A handheld mic all of a sudden?)

1974
01:42:20,016 --> 01:42:23,256
He told us to change it to a handheld mic.

1975
01:42:23,256 --> 01:42:26,325
We never thought about using a handheld mic.

1976
01:42:26,325 --> 01:42:29,096
I wondered if I could do it.

1977
01:42:29,096 --> 01:42:30,995
If you use this,

1978
01:42:31,096 --> 01:42:33,495
you'll be scared to sing high notes.

1979
01:42:34,226 --> 01:42:35,235
It's very scary.

1980
01:42:35,336 --> 01:42:37,535
You have to control the mic...

1981
01:42:38,436 --> 01:42:39,535
to control the volume.

1982
01:42:40,266 --> 01:42:43,105
They'll need a handheld mic. It's okay for now.

1983
01:42:43,105 --> 01:42:46,176
You have to be tight on the rhythm.

1984
01:42:46,275 --> 01:42:47,745
You're too loose right now.

1985
01:42:48,416 --> 01:42:51,145
(His passionate coaching never tires.)

1986
01:42:51,346 --> 01:42:53,815
- This is how I live - Stop.

1987
01:42:56,655 --> 01:42:57,716
(Surprised)

1988
01:42:58,086 --> 01:43:01,355
Sing, "I thought I couldn't live without you" again.

1989
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:04,325
- The dance too? - Yes, come forward from the back.

1990
01:43:05,126 --> 01:43:07,796
(Seo Jeong Woo sings his part again.)

1991
01:43:08,096 --> 01:43:10,466
- This is how I live - Stop.

1992
01:43:11,565 --> 01:43:13,735
(The practice stops at the same part again.)

1993
01:43:13,735 --> 01:43:15,876
How did you come forward?

1994
01:43:16,136 --> 01:43:17,775
- Like this. - Come forward.

1995
01:43:17,936 --> 01:43:19,245
Come forward again.

1996
01:43:19,245 --> 01:43:22,575
(Director Lee Chang Sub makes him repeat the same part.)

1997
01:43:23,046 --> 01:43:24,676
And I walk to the center.

1998
01:43:25,346 --> 01:43:27,645
- Dance as you come forward. - Okay.

1999
01:43:28,815 --> 01:43:33,086
(Only Seo Jeong Woo repeats his part.)

2000
01:43:33,325 --> 01:43:35,825
But it feels like something is missing

2001
01:43:35,825 --> 01:43:39,565
I guess I'm still there

2002
01:43:39,565 --> 01:43:40,596
Okay.

2003
01:43:42,596 --> 01:43:46,136
(On eggshells)

2004
01:43:49,535 --> 01:43:51,436
To be honest,

2005
01:43:52,275 --> 01:43:53,546
we need to hide you.

2006
01:43:54,876 --> 01:43:57,046
- We need to hide you. - Okay.

2007
01:43:57,046 --> 01:43:58,145
(Hiding awkward Jeong Woo to win)

2008
01:43:58,416 --> 01:44:00,815
My heart dropped.

2009
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:04,016
I was embarrassed.

2010
01:44:04,155 --> 01:44:07,586
Your choreography is sloppy, so we need to hide you.

2011
01:44:07,586 --> 01:44:11,056
We need to think about ways to hide our weakness.

2012
01:44:11,596 --> 01:44:13,726
Because I was stuck on my part,

2013
01:44:13,726 --> 01:44:17,136
other people couldn't practice.

2014
01:44:18,035 --> 01:44:21,205
I was being a pain in the neck.

2015
01:44:21,205 --> 01:44:23,506
This was my first time dancing...

2016
01:44:23,506 --> 01:44:25,405
for an audition.

2017
01:44:25,405 --> 01:44:27,405
My body couldn't keep up.

2018
01:44:31,176 --> 01:44:33,645
(After the interim check)

2019
01:44:33,886 --> 01:44:36,655
I have a question. When you spin...

2020
01:44:36,655 --> 01:44:38,426
Do you turn on your left foot or not?

2021
01:44:39,886 --> 01:44:42,325
- Yes, turn on your left foot. - Left foot.

2022
01:44:42,525 --> 01:44:45,825
Can you help me with the timing?

2023
01:44:45,926 --> 01:44:47,325
I'm confused.

2024
01:44:48,126 --> 01:44:49,336
My direction's different.

2025
01:44:49,995 --> 01:44:52,705
- Boom. - I see.

2026
01:44:52,936 --> 01:44:54,936
Because Jeong Woo doesn't have...

2027
01:44:54,936 --> 01:44:57,936
experience in dancing or singing,

2028
01:44:58,336 --> 01:45:00,245
it might discourage him,

2029
01:45:00,405 --> 01:45:04,046
but he doesn't yield to it. He tries even harder.

2030
01:45:07,186 --> 01:45:09,785
I thought I couldn't live without you

2031
01:45:09,785 --> 01:45:12,056
(He keeps practicing the part that was criticized.)

2032
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:17,325
(He keeps practicing the part that was criticized.)

2033
01:45:18,426 --> 01:45:21,836
This opportunity means a lot to me.

2034
01:45:22,865 --> 01:45:26,506
So I'm going to practice as much as the other trainees...

2035
01:45:27,365 --> 01:45:30,575
or even more.

2036
01:45:32,605 --> 01:45:34,506
I'll do my best...

2037
01:45:34,806 --> 01:45:36,145
- not to cause them harm. - Good luck.

2038
01:45:38,376 --> 01:45:40,716
- You can do it. - Good luck!

2039
01:45:41,756 --> 01:45:44,355
This is my first time singing and dancing in front of an audience.

2040
01:45:44,655 --> 01:45:46,985
"Missing You" became...

2041
01:45:47,325 --> 01:45:49,796
my dream stage.

2042
01:45:50,355 --> 01:45:53,796
I'll make a great result in an ideal team.

2043
01:45:54,626 --> 01:45:58,565
(Go, TEAM GROOVE.)

2044
01:45:59,166 --> 01:46:01,876
(Nervous since it's the first performance by his players)

2045
01:46:01,876 --> 01:46:03,035
I'm nervous.

2046
01:46:04,806 --> 01:46:05,846
You can do it.

2047
01:46:07,405 --> 01:46:08,575
- Let's go. - I'm excited.

2048
01:46:08,575 --> 01:46:09,916
(All the other teams look forward to it.)

2049
01:46:09,916 --> 01:46:11,445
- I can't wait. - Me neither.

2050
01:46:12,416 --> 01:46:13,546
I can't wait to see them.

2051
01:46:16,056 --> 01:46:18,556
- Joo Hyoung! - You can do it!

2052
01:46:18,655 --> 01:46:19,686
Ready?

2053
01:46:20,226 --> 01:46:21,226
Go.

2054
01:46:25,266 --> 01:46:27,626
("Missing You" by James, Jang Kyung Ho, Kenta,)

2055
01:46:27,626 --> 01:46:30,235
(Kim Joo Hyoung, Park Han, Seo Jeong Woo, Zen Zen)

2056
01:46:41,546 --> 01:46:42,575
Oh, his voice.

2057
01:47:12,205 --> 01:47:14,275
Kenta's Korean improved so much.

2058
01:47:49,145 --> 01:47:50,815
He looks sad.

2059
01:48:45,096 --> 01:48:49,176
(Jang Kyung Ho's getting faster.)

2060
01:49:05,056 --> 01:49:07,455
- They pulled it off so well. - Nice.

2061
01:49:07,455 --> 01:49:08,485
(Relieved)

2062
01:49:13,726 --> 01:49:14,895
My goodness.

2063
01:49:20,336 --> 01:49:21,336
Gosh.

2064
01:49:25,346 --> 01:49:26,376
Gosh.

2065
01:49:30,645 --> 01:49:31,676
Gosh.

2066
01:50:09,056 --> 01:50:10,416
You nailed it!

2067
01:50:10,416 --> 01:50:12,186
Seo Jeong Woo, you're handsome!

2068
01:50:12,186 --> 01:50:13,485
- They did so well. - Yes.

2069
01:50:13,485 --> 01:50:14,785
They deserve to be the starting lineup.

2070
01:50:16,355 --> 01:50:18,256
I couldn't breathe.

2071
01:50:19,626 --> 01:50:22,166
(He became one with the players and watched the performance.)

2072
01:50:22,596 --> 01:50:23,666
They all did a good job.

2073
01:50:23,666 --> 01:50:24,695
(All our players did a good job.)

2074
01:50:29,676 --> 01:50:31,775
(Amazing.)

2075
01:50:31,775 --> 01:50:33,876
What do you think? Did we do better?

2076
01:50:33,876 --> 01:50:35,205
We were way better.

2077
01:50:35,916 --> 01:50:38,016
(TEAM RHYTHM is the best.)

2078
01:50:38,016 --> 01:50:39,985
- To be honest... - Have confidence.

2079
01:50:40,686 --> 01:50:41,785
We were better.

2080
01:50:46,756 --> 01:50:48,995
After watching their performance,

2081
01:50:48,995 --> 01:50:50,626
I was worried about if we could place first.

2082
01:50:50,626 --> 01:50:51,695
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup)

2083
01:50:55,325 --> 01:50:57,796
Team "Boys Never Die..."

2084
01:50:58,266 --> 01:51:02,605
wasn't as impressive as the other teams.

2085
01:51:03,035 --> 01:51:06,376
I was worried a lot.

2086
01:51:06,846 --> 01:51:09,476
Yes, sir. Well done.

2087
01:51:09,476 --> 01:51:11,145
After missing you

2088
01:51:11,145 --> 01:51:12,216
I love it.

2089
01:51:12,516 --> 01:51:14,346
What did you think of TEAM GROOVE's performance?

2090
01:51:14,346 --> 01:51:15,386
Did you like it?

2091
01:51:15,386 --> 01:51:17,256
- They nailed it. - Yes.

2092
01:51:17,855 --> 01:51:19,455
- They nailed it. - Yes.

2093
01:51:19,455 --> 01:51:23,126
(They've never felt the heat onstage before.)

2094
01:51:23,126 --> 01:51:25,256
Let's start voting right away.

2095
01:51:25,256 --> 01:51:26,426
(On-site voting begins.)

2096
01:51:26,926 --> 01:51:28,966
(Acting cute toward the audience)

2097
01:51:29,695 --> 01:51:31,865
(Showing off their idol abilities)

2098
01:51:32,735 --> 01:51:36,735
(While they're seizing the fans' hearts by acting cute...)

2099
01:51:38,105 --> 01:51:39,405
They're doing their best.

2100
01:51:39,405 --> 01:51:41,745
(Park Han is struggling.)

2101
01:51:42,476 --> 01:51:44,416
(He also doesn't know what to do.)

2102
01:51:44,416 --> 01:51:45,416
(Seo Jeong Woo)

2103
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:47,216
- You're handsome. - Thank you.

2104
01:51:47,216 --> 01:51:51,086
Six, five, four, three...

2105
01:51:51,615 --> 01:51:55,525
- Four, three, two, one... - You're so handsome.

2106
01:51:55,525 --> 01:51:56,626
(Oh, right. I have to vote.)

2107
01:51:57,825 --> 01:51:58,966
He's got the looks.

2108
01:51:58,966 --> 01:52:01,096
(Doing his best to win votes until the end)

2109
01:52:01,895 --> 01:52:04,195
(The experienced one is laid-back.)

2110
01:52:04,666 --> 01:52:06,306
The voting has ended.

2111
01:52:06,836 --> 01:52:10,376
Let's find out who's going to be the MVP.

2112
01:52:11,105 --> 01:52:13,976
Who's going to be the MVP?

2113
01:52:14,405 --> 01:52:16,046
Right. Who's going to be the MVP?

2114
01:52:16,445 --> 01:52:18,416
Han? Park Han?

2115
01:52:18,716 --> 01:52:20,485
Han has a very nice voice.

2116
01:52:20,485 --> 01:52:21,815
I think it's Park Han.

2117
01:52:21,815 --> 01:52:23,455
(Park Han with overwhelming live singing?)

2118
01:52:23,686 --> 01:52:26,525
When I saw it on screen, Joo Hyoung pulled it off well.

2119
01:52:26,686 --> 01:52:28,086
Joo Hyoung looked professional.

2120
01:52:28,086 --> 01:52:31,426
(Kim Joo Hyoung with the best stage presence?)

2121
01:52:31,995 --> 01:52:33,796
It's hard. Who's going to be the MVP?

2122
01:52:34,325 --> 01:52:35,325
Maybe Jeong Woo?

2123
01:52:36,695 --> 01:52:38,666
(He seduced everyone with his sunny smile.)

2124
01:52:39,436 --> 01:52:43,176
(Then he impressed everyone with the ending.)

2125
01:52:43,176 --> 01:52:46,876
Who's going to be the MVP among them?

2126
01:52:46,876 --> 01:52:48,575
I'll announce it right away.

2127
01:52:50,216 --> 01:52:51,575
The MVP is...

2128
01:52:52,745 --> 01:52:54,785
(Curious)

2129
01:52:55,216 --> 01:52:56,417
Seo Jeong Woo.

2130
01:52:56,417 --> 01:52:58,657
(TEAM GROOVE's MVP is Seo Jeong Woo.)

2131
01:52:58,657 --> 01:53:00,487
Thank you.

2132
01:53:09,567 --> 01:53:12,096
I didn't prepare a speech.

2133
01:53:12,336 --> 01:53:15,966
Thank you. I'll continue to show improvements.

2134
01:53:15,966 --> 01:53:17,107
Thank you.

2135
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:20,107
(Let's debut.)

2136
01:53:22,207 --> 01:53:26,176
Because I lack a lot, my friends helped me so much.

2137
01:53:27,516 --> 01:53:30,317
(He practiced again and again to avoid causing the team harm.)

2138
01:53:30,317 --> 01:53:33,417
Thanks to the team, I was able to complete the performance,

2139
01:53:33,417 --> 01:53:35,327
and even became the MVP.

2140
01:53:35,327 --> 01:53:39,157
I'm so happy that I was helpful to the team.

2141
01:53:39,697 --> 01:53:42,426
I decided to work even harder...

2142
01:53:42,426 --> 01:53:44,897
for the next performance.

2143
01:53:46,836 --> 01:53:49,636
- Congratulations. - Welcome back.

2144
01:53:49,636 --> 01:53:51,107
Good job.

2145
01:53:51,277 --> 01:53:52,836
That was wonderful.

2146
01:53:53,277 --> 01:53:55,176
Jeong Woo, congratulations on becoming the MVP.

2147
01:53:55,476 --> 01:53:57,676
Congratulations.

2148
01:53:59,016 --> 01:54:00,046
Great.

2149
01:54:00,376 --> 01:54:03,617
I'll now reveal the first half's starting lineup match scores.

2150
01:54:03,617 --> 01:54:04,787
Oh, okay.

2151
01:54:04,787 --> 01:54:05,857
(The starting lineup match result is revealed right away.)

2152
01:54:05,857 --> 01:54:07,987
Wait a minute. Out of nowhere?

2153
01:54:09,357 --> 01:54:12,157
I'll reveal the starting lineup match result.

2154
01:54:12,357 --> 01:54:13,426
Gosh, hang on.

2155
01:54:15,796 --> 01:54:16,926
If we got a low score,

2156
01:54:16,926 --> 01:54:19,037
that'd be a lot of pressure on the bench.

2157
01:54:19,037 --> 01:54:20,766
- No. - No, don't say that.

2158
01:54:20,766 --> 01:54:22,207
- He's right. - That's not going to happen.

2159
01:54:24,336 --> 01:54:27,607
It was neck-and-neck.

2160
01:54:28,077 --> 01:54:29,147
I really don't know.

2161
01:54:29,147 --> 01:54:30,207
(I really don't know what the result will be.)

2162
01:54:30,207 --> 01:54:31,216
The starting lineup.

2163
01:54:31,976 --> 01:54:34,417
Don't be nervous. We did a good job.

2164
01:54:34,417 --> 01:54:35,846
Straighten your backs.

2165
01:54:36,546 --> 01:54:38,357
Relax.

2166
01:54:38,586 --> 01:54:40,756
I'll reveal the interim ranking.

2167
01:54:42,586 --> 01:54:43,926
What?

2168
01:54:44,626 --> 01:54:46,327
(TEAM RHYTHM's score is revealed first.)

2169
01:54:46,327 --> 01:54:47,827
(Starting lineup)

2170
01:54:47,827 --> 01:54:50,466
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup, 1,234)

2171
01:54:50,626 --> 01:54:52,067
(TEAM RHYTHM received 1,234 points.)

2172
01:54:52,067 --> 01:54:55,006
- Is that a lot? - One, two, three, four.

2173
01:54:57,136 --> 01:54:58,976
I can't tell if that's high because it's the first.

2174
01:54:58,976 --> 01:55:01,306
- Gosh, is that... - Seriously.

2175
01:55:01,306 --> 01:55:02,647
- Please. - One, two, three, four.

2176
01:55:02,806 --> 01:55:04,476
I'll reveal TEAM BEAT's score.

2177
01:55:04,476 --> 01:55:05,876
(TEAM BEAT's score is revealed next.)

2178
01:55:05,876 --> 01:55:07,247
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup, 1,234)

2179
01:55:07,247 --> 01:55:08,947
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup, 966)

2180
01:55:09,147 --> 01:55:11,957
(First half starting lineup match)

2181
01:55:12,157 --> 01:55:13,617
- It's okay. We got your back. - It's okay.

2182
01:55:13,957 --> 01:55:16,186
- Guys, it's okay. - It's okay.

2183
01:55:16,756 --> 01:55:19,527
It was a shame. The gap was too big.

2184
01:55:21,266 --> 01:55:22,926
(Regretful)

2185
01:55:23,626 --> 01:55:24,966
We can still catch up.

2186
01:55:25,537 --> 01:55:26,737
Here is TEAM GROOVE's score.

2187
01:55:27,397 --> 01:55:29,707
(Who will be the winner of the starting lineup match?)

2188
01:55:29,707 --> 01:55:30,976
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup)

2189
01:55:30,976 --> 01:55:33,336
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup, 1,172)

2190
01:55:33,836 --> 01:55:38,917
(First half starting lineup match)

2191
01:55:39,216 --> 01:55:41,846
(TEAM RHYTHM wins the starting lineup match.)

2192
01:55:41,846 --> 01:55:45,516
I was so happy. Once again, I realized...

2193
01:55:45,516 --> 01:55:47,626
TEAM RHYTHM was the best.

2194
01:55:48,426 --> 01:55:49,857
(Checking again)

2195
01:55:50,957 --> 01:55:52,056
Who are we?

2196
01:55:52,056 --> 01:55:54,497
- TEAM RHYTHM. - TEAM RHYTHM.

2197
01:55:58,096 --> 01:55:59,766
Good job. You were amazing.

2198
01:56:00,436 --> 01:56:01,907
- Good job. - Are you crying?

2199
01:56:01,907 --> 01:56:03,907
- It's okay. - You did a good job.

2200
01:56:03,907 --> 01:56:07,476
(Zhang Shuaibo sheds tears of joy.)

2201
01:56:11,346 --> 01:56:13,516
It feels great.

2202
01:56:13,777 --> 01:56:18,256
I consider the team...

2203
01:56:18,256 --> 01:56:20,056
important.

2204
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:24,497
So I wanted to win.

2205
01:56:24,497 --> 01:56:27,796
And when that happened,

2206
01:56:27,796 --> 01:56:29,997
I burst into tears.

2207
01:56:31,037 --> 01:56:33,737
I think we had the best teamwork.

2208
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:36,136
I knew we were going to win.

2209
01:56:36,136 --> 01:56:37,167
(Their tight teamwork led TEAM RHYTHM to victory.)

2210
01:56:37,336 --> 01:56:38,537
It's okay.

2211
01:56:38,537 --> 01:56:40,176
We still did a good job.

2212
01:56:40,176 --> 01:56:41,777
(Unfortunately, TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup placed 2nd.)

2213
01:56:41,777 --> 01:56:43,407
Good job. Well done.

2214
01:56:46,317 --> 01:56:50,117
If I hadn't made the mistake, would the result have been different?

2215
01:56:51,186 --> 01:56:52,357
(On eggshells)

2216
01:56:52,357 --> 01:56:56,056
It felt like I was pressuring the bench.

2217
01:56:56,787 --> 01:56:59,256
The bench has to pull it off for us to place first.

2218
01:57:01,197 --> 01:57:03,926
It's a bummer that we didn't get over 1,000 points.

2219
01:57:03,926 --> 01:57:05,296
(TEAM BEAT placed last.)

2220
01:57:05,697 --> 01:57:08,806
Were we really that bad?

2221
01:57:10,537 --> 01:57:13,636
It hurt my pride.

2222
01:57:14,506 --> 01:57:16,676
If this continues, it's six yellow cards.

2223
01:57:18,376 --> 01:57:19,846
This is bad.

2224
01:57:21,647 --> 01:57:23,586
Hey, don't cry yet.

2225
01:57:23,716 --> 01:57:25,716
- Don't cry yet. - Calm down.

2226
01:57:25,716 --> 01:57:27,186
- You have to sing later. - Yes.

2227
01:57:27,186 --> 01:57:28,926
Bench, calm down.

2228
01:57:28,926 --> 01:57:31,926
You got a good result because you did your best.

2229
01:57:32,357 --> 01:57:35,367
The bench has to do better.

2230
01:57:35,367 --> 01:57:36,397
We're in first place right now.

2231
01:57:37,527 --> 01:57:38,737
- But it could change. - Understood.

2232
01:57:39,037 --> 01:57:40,697
Guys. Let's defend it.

2233
01:57:41,506 --> 01:57:43,006
- Okay? We can do it. - We pop.

2234
01:57:43,266 --> 01:57:44,336
We can do it.

2235
01:57:45,376 --> 01:57:47,577
(The second half, Bench Match, continues.)

2236
01:57:47,577 --> 01:57:49,077
We will now start...

2237
01:57:49,077 --> 01:57:51,516
the second half, the Bench Match.

2238
01:57:52,176 --> 01:57:54,346
I thought we must kill it.

2239
01:57:54,346 --> 01:57:56,447
We need to make our team place first.

2240
01:57:59,056 --> 01:58:00,086
Good luck!

2241
01:58:00,086 --> 01:58:01,226
- Passion! - You trust us, right?

2242
01:58:01,787 --> 01:58:03,857
Are you ready?

2243
01:58:05,197 --> 01:58:07,226
(The bench players keep making mistakes.)

2244
01:58:07,527 --> 01:58:08,626
(He's too tense.)

2245
01:58:11,266 --> 01:58:12,867
(It's not a vibe you can bring out easily.)

2246
01:58:13,237 --> 01:58:15,636
They were slightly off-sync.

2247
01:58:15,636 --> 01:58:18,207
(The bench players' performances are disappointing?)

2248
01:58:18,936 --> 01:58:20,836
(A comeback win is the most thrilling in sports.)

2249
01:58:21,346 --> 01:58:23,947
(TEAM BEAT's bench hopes for a comeback win from 3rd place.)

2250
01:58:24,676 --> 01:58:25,676
(Kairi)

2251
01:58:26,016 --> 01:58:27,886
(Amazed)

2252
01:58:27,886 --> 01:58:29,317
(They're incredible.)

2253
01:58:29,886 --> 01:58:31,787
(A hunch that TEAM BEAT's bench will win?)

2254
01:58:32,216 --> 01:58:34,586
(Round 1's team ranking is finally revealed.)

2255
01:58:35,327 --> 01:58:36,686
(The time has come.)

2256
01:58:36,686 --> 01:58:38,197
- I'm so nervous. - What do I do?

2257
01:58:38,397 --> 01:58:39,426
Please.

2258
01:58:39,626 --> 01:58:41,827
Here's the final score. They turned the tables...

2259
01:58:41,827 --> 01:58:44,397
- and ranked first. - Let's go!

2260
01:58:45,336 --> 01:58:47,966
- Great work. - Good job.

2261
01:58:50,407 --> 01:58:52,376
I'm really sad.

2262
01:58:52,607 --> 01:58:55,707
(Universe League)
