1
00:00:03,523 --> 00:00:06,362
(Round 2 decides the fate of the players.)

2
00:00:06,363 --> 00:00:07,663
Intercept.

3
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:09,561
(To intercept)

4
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:11,363
(Or to defend)

5
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:13,902
(Intercept Round: Who will win the new song?)

6
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:15,172
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup versus TEAM BEAT's bench)

7
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:17,942
(The long-awaited first match of the Intercept Round)

8
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:21,512
(TEAM RHYTHM had a showdown with TEAM BEAT's bench.)

9
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:24,642
(Who is the owner of "IGNITION?")

10
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:26,283
TEAM RHYTHM. Congratulations.

11
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:28,752
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup defended their new song.)

12
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:30,183
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup versus TEAM GROOVE's bench)

13
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:32,253
(Moving on to the second Intercept match)

14
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:36,152
(TEAM GROOVE's bench challenged TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.)

15
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:40,792
(If I were him, I would've avoided our team.)

16
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:44,802
(Woong Ki has to fight against his former teammate, Kyung Ho.)

17
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:46,563
(It'll hurt my pride.)

18
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:48,573
(I'd rather die than lose.)

19
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:50,842
(It was cute.)

20
00:00:51,272 --> 00:00:53,573
(I wasn't sure what they did, but I took a look.)

21
00:00:57,073 --> 00:00:59,081
(TEAM BEAT starting lineup's desperate performance...)

22
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:00,143
(to defend the song)

23
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:05,352
(They want to defend the song more as EL CAPITXN wrote about them.)

24
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:11,122
("MAMMA MIA" by TEAM BEAT's starting lineup...)

25
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:13,322
(expressed youthful passion.)

26
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:19,432
(Rise again, go, chasing the higher light)

27
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:22,132
(We never stop)

28
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:25,102
(We never stop, bet on everything)

29
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:28,072
(Even if we don't know where the end is)

30
00:01:28,772 --> 00:01:31,843
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup bets everything to defend the new song.)

31
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:37,212
(Did their sincerity reach the audience?)

32
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:43,492
(I hope this is my last "again.")

33
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:48,092
(I am ready to open...)

34
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:50,033
(Pandora's box.)

35
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:54,102
(The two players' backstory is finally revealed today.)

36
00:01:56,733 --> 00:02:01,613
(What is the two players' real story that shocks everyone?)

37

50
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:45,923
(The 2nd Global Fan Voting rankings will soon be revealed.)

51
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:49,392
Boys' dream match, Universe League.

52
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:50,422
(Universe League)

53
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:51,423
Are you ready?

54
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:57,531
(TEAM GROOVE's bench is ready to intercept "MAMMA MIA.")

55
00:02:57,532 --> 00:02:59,431
There are too many with their abs showing.

56
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:01,332
Everyone is wearing cropped tops.

57
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,472
(Contending against the boyish charm...)

58
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:04,602
(is the adult charm.)

59
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:05,643
(Kyung Ho)

60
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:09,572
How sexy!

61
00:03:09,573 --> 00:03:11,483
(How sexy!)

62
00:03:12,312 --> 00:03:14,413
(Look at the wild reaction.)

63
00:03:14,812 --> 00:03:17,013
They're not singing a different song, are they?

64
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:19,453
Their concepts are polar opposites.

65
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:20,582
My goodness.

66
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,591
(TEAM GROOVE has adult vibes, unlike boyish TEAM BEAT.)

67
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:23,723
TEAM BEAT was soft, but TEAM GROOVE is wild.

68
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,262
"MAMMA MIA!"

69
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:27,532
They have a fierce concept.

70
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,502
Joo Hyoung. How was TEAM BEAT's performance?

71
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:34,103
Their performance was great.

72
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,371
But because they were after youthfulness,

73
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:38,502
they still need to grow up more.

74
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:40,402
(Grow up more?)

75
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:43,112
Me? Is he telling me to grow up more?

76
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:44,581
(Universe League's oldest player)

77
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:47,853
We will show you the complete "MAMMA MIA" with our sexiness.

78
00:03:48,212 --> 00:03:49,883
A sexy "MAMMA MIA?"

79
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:53,051
Did they understand the song correctly?

80
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:54,353
A sexy "MAMMA MIA?"

81
00:03:55,393 --> 00:03:57,822
- It's kind of... - I don't see it mixing well.

82
00:03:57,823 --> 00:03:59,492
It's hard to imagine.

83
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,262
- Kyung Ho. - Yes?

84
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:03,532
With what determination will you perform in this match?

85
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:08,371
Well, we're very desperate.

86
00:04:08,372 --> 00:04:09,431
We're desperate.

87
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,633
Kyung Ho is tense.

88
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:12,772
- To think he's nervous. - Right?

89
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:15,912
There's an old friend of mine. I do care about him.

90
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:20,483
(There's an old friend of mine. I do care about him.)

91
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:23,181
But a match is still a match.

92
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:25,882
Our team losing today is not a part of my plan.

93
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,892
Old friendships don't matter in matches.

94
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,423
He was no threat to me.

95
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:35,932
Look at Jang Kyung Ho's eyes. How scary.

96
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,163
What a weird atmosphere.

97
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:40,702
The way his eyes are looking is weird.

98
00:04:40,872 --> 00:04:42,032
His eyes are filled with determination.

99
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,142
You can tell he wants to intercept it badly.

100
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,102
Kyung Ho. I heard you designated TEAM BEAT.

101
00:04:47,103 --> 00:04:48,142
What was your reason?

102
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:55,552
I am ready to open Pandora's box.

103
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:01,552
When we were teammates,

104
00:05:02,892 --> 00:05:06,163
we were on good terms. Nothing bad happened.

105
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:10,392
That is if I'm not mistaken.

106
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:15,572
Woong Ki left the team first.

107
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:17,273
It was...

108
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,742
totally an internal matter within the company.

109
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:23,442
The reason wasn't disclosed.

110
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:26,141
It was a notice.

111
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:28,312
(Woong Ki suddenly left the team after 2 years.)

112
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,622
I only found out Woong Ki was taking part...

113
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:35,022
in Universe League when I came here.

114
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:36,423
When I came to the practice room.

115
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:38,923
After I found out,

116
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:42,162
we bumped into each other in the restroom.

117
00:05:42,163 --> 00:05:45,132
I was like, "What?"

118
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:46,963
But he just walked by.

119
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,833
We bumped into each other again...

120
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,001
when practicing the title song.

121
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:53,772
I thought we'd practice together.

122
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:56,172
I asked if he was using the same practice room,

123
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,742
which was my first ever complete sentence to him.

124
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:01,251
Woong Ki said, "No, I'm not."

125
00:06:01,252 --> 00:06:02,653
And he left just like that.

126
00:06:04,423 --> 00:06:07,222
I felt he was...

127
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:09,023
avoiding me back then.

128
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:13,322
From what I see, it's rather...

129
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:19,562
I think Woong Ki has also felt that...

130
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,432
we're on different paths now.

131
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:25,502
Either way,

132
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:28,342
I thought I should accept the reality.

133
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:30,343
We have to compete against each other right now.

134
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:33,343
- What? - What?

135
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:38,451
(Kyung Ho didn't avoid going up against Woong Ki.)

136
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:39,552
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:40,552 --> 00:06:43,391
I think we had a good friendship.

138
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:45,262
I'm not sure either.

139
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,863
Whether...

140
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:49,832
there's a reason I haven't realized yet...

141
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:53,102
or if Woong Ki is absorbed in Universe League...

142
00:06:53,103 --> 00:06:56,002
and is trying to win just one more match.

143
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,741
I wanted to fight against him.

144
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:01,812
(Kyung Ho wants to know the reason through a match.)

145
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:04,982
Okay, guys. It's here.

146
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:06,181
- Yes. - Yes.

147
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,852
- Finally. - We have the song and the lyrics.

148
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:09,682
- Earlier... - It's here.

149
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:12,653
Here it is. Let's listen to it.

150
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,622
(Impressed)

151
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:20,463
(Admiring nonstop)

152
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:24,332
Many songs Director EL CAPITXN released...

153
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,733
were amazing.

154
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:29,302
So I knew it was going to be great.

155
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,043
Here it goes.

156
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,273
(This is what I'm talking about.)

157
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,812
(Zen Zen is excited.)

158
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:40,811
This is like a pop song.

159
00:07:40,812 --> 00:07:44,251
I love how the beat...

160
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:47,252
- Like how it doesn't stop? - Yes, I love the beat.

161
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:50,252
I liked the song more than I expected.

162
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:53,762
I could totally be in my element.

163
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,592
I love it. The moment I heard it,

164
00:07:55,593 --> 00:07:56,691
it stuck in my mind.

165
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,001
Even among the three songs,

166
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:01,533
this one is the best.

167
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:06,141
(The song is a killer.)

168
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:07,543
For real?

169
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:11,641
What do you think?

170
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:12,742
Our decision...

171
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,212
wasn't wrong.

172
00:08:15,213 --> 00:08:17,352
It suits us well.

173
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:18,881
- Does it? - Yes.

174
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:21,153
I'm serious. It's really good.

175
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,023
What about you, Dae Yun?

176
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:24,863
You look like you have a lot on your mind.

177
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,862
- Right. - You're worried, aren't you?

178
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:29,061
You see, this song...

179
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:31,363
Despite singing the same song,

180
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:34,132
TEAM BEAT's starting lineup and we will have different vibes.

181
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:37,501
The colors they have and we have...

182
00:08:37,502 --> 00:08:39,203
are too different.

183
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:42,473
Don't mind that. It's not like we're weak.

184
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:45,683
We're TEAM GROOVE. Let's interpret it our way.

185
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:49,082
Won't we be able to show the audience...

186
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,583
a completely different image from Round One?

187
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,952
We made the best decision of choosing this song.

188
00:08:54,953 --> 00:08:56,322
I can already picture us...

189
00:08:56,323 --> 00:08:58,463
killing the performance.

190
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:01,031
I don't think about losing when going to war.

191
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:02,593
Why fight if you expect to lose?

192
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:07,603
I don't think anyone on TEAM BEAT...

193
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,573
is a better dancer than I am.

194
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,102
With dancing alone, I'm confident...

195
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:15,272
that I'll beat all the starting players. There are no worries there.

196
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:17,782
We even have the main rapper.

197
00:09:18,012 --> 00:09:19,012
Rap is fine too.

198
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,882
The song was made for TEAM BEAT.

199
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:23,712
I was in TEAM BEAT.

200
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:26,323
I'll think of it as a song made for me...

201
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:27,892
and intercept it.

202
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:30,652
Let's prepare well and beat them.

203
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:31,822
- Okay. - Okay.

204
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:32,823
(TEAM GROOVE's bench is determined.)

205
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:38,531
(As expected from TEAM GROOVE, they are practicing live singing.)

206
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:41,333
- We are - We are

207
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,073
- We are - We are

208
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:47,872
Let us be engraved on this path, show them who we are

209
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:51,742
(Breathing heavily)

210
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,552
(They're worn out after practicing the whole song once.)

211
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,553
Sit down.

212
00:09:57,252 --> 00:09:58,922
It's seriously tough.

213
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:00,752
Give me a second.

214
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,062
It's super-fast.

215
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:08,832
(How is TEAM BEAT pulling it off?)

216
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,162
I'm beat.

217
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:13,732
But you were in TEAM BEAT.

218
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,233
Do you know how they're doing?

219
00:10:15,603 --> 00:10:17,902
I know they're not as good as us.

220
00:10:18,002 --> 00:10:19,002
Is that so?

221
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:21,443
It's refreshing...

222
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:24,073
and has a bit of a young vibe.

223
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:26,781
(A young vibe?)

224
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:28,412
I'm sorry, guys.

225
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:30,982
Same here.

226
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:33,281
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

227
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:34,823
Our average ages are similar.

228
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:37,223
Should I say, the person's image?

229
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:42,162
When I heard Woong Ki analyzed the song's concept as boyish,

230
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:45,563
I predicted he would express...

231
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,532
his strongest points.

232
00:10:49,103 --> 00:10:51,973
It could become a tough match.

233
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,672
What Woong Ki is good at, he excels at it.

234
00:10:56,213 --> 00:10:58,042
Even if it's the same song,

235
00:10:58,713 --> 00:11:02,083
the performances are different.

236
00:11:02,882 --> 00:11:04,782
We should go for sexiness...

237
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:07,852
with more passion and power.

238
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:10,522
Let's beat them with such "MAMMA MIA."

239
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:11,693
Okay.

240
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,863
Loosen up here.

241
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:16,132
The next move is fast.

242
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:19,501
Give it a bit of punch...

243
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:20,933
before moving on.

244
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:22,973
Make the next move sexy.

245
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:26,001
I think such transitions would be nice.

246
00:11:26,002 --> 00:11:27,572
(Adding sexiness to change up the mood)

247
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:29,572
Don't overreact.

248
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,313
Slide sexily into the next move.

249
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,751
- Can you do it? - Nice, Junjin.

250
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:37,453
Okay. Good.

251
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:43,553
(Upgrading "MAMMA MIA" to have a mature vibe)

252
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:45,363
This is our weapon.

253
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,693
We prepared the performance so that...

254
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:51,732
the sexy parts were smoking...

255
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,902
and the energetic parts were super energetic.

256
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,833
It should move here.

257
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:58,371
In this position, switch your legs...

258
00:11:58,372 --> 00:11:59,901
- while going down. - That was why it was weird.

259
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:01,541
- Yes. The legs have to switch. - Like this...

260
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:03,671
The song is actually for TEAM BEAT.

261
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,281
- The song for Round Two. - Right away.

262
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:08,212
We practiced with the thought of...

263
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:09,782
needing TEAM GROOVE's distinct color.

264
00:12:10,113 --> 00:12:11,823
And figuring out how to pull that off...

265
00:12:12,053 --> 00:12:14,953
was our homework every day while preparing for this round.

266
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:20,563
(Showing off manliness)

267
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:22,933
Isn't that a tough workout?

268
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:26,162
It's like watching my younger cousins on a national holiday.

269
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,072
How can you do that?

270
00:12:28,073 --> 00:12:29,473
(Surprised)

271
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,001
(Surprising athleticism)

272
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,343
You'll get hurt. Be careful.

273
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:38,683
We're preparing with all our might.

274
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:42,953
With this, we'll destroy TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.

275
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,652
(The final check with Director Lee Chang Sub)

276
00:12:50,122 --> 00:12:52,323
Our time is coming

277
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:55,433
(Focused)

278
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,862
Even if the end is unknown

279
00:12:57,863 --> 00:13:00,862
- Tell them we are - We are

280
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,171
- We are - We are

281
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:06,573
- Together. Just a bit more. - We are

282
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:10,172
Let us be engraved on this path, show them who we are

283
00:13:12,713 --> 00:13:14,141
(A satisfied smile)

284
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:15,313
- Gosh. - I'm tired.

285
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,113
Great job.

286
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,282
A clean live singing will be critical...

287
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:23,152
in both verses 1 and 2.

288
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:24,823
- Okay. - Okay.

289
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:29,563
I believe this is a song we can intercept.

290
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:31,032
- Understood. - Good.

291
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:33,433
- Intercept it. - Okay.

292
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:35,172
You must, okay?

293
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:36,632
We will, no matter what.

294
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:39,842
There's my relationship with Woong Ki,

295
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:41,371
but I can't win this match...

296
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:43,113
with my efforts alone.

297
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:47,412
Together with my members, I'll intercept the song at any cost.

298
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:50,281
(Monitoring their practice video)

299
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:51,352
We're in perfect sync.

300
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:54,651
Yes, this much balance is a must.

301
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:55,792
Who are you guys?

302
00:13:56,492 --> 00:14:02,262
(The bench players are ready with TEAM GROOVE's unique color.)

303
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,803
(Nervous)

304
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:08,833
What will the sexy version of "MAMMA MIA" look like?

305
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,372
Let's watch TEAM GROOVE's bench's performance.

306
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:15,612
Are you ready?

307
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,342
(Everyone is ready.)

308
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,713
Let's watch them.

309
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:20,641
- Let's see. - Let's see how good they are.

310
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:23,453
Just enjoy it. We did an amazing job.

311
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:25,483
- Good luck, Jang Kyung Ho! - Good luck, Jang Kyung Ho!

312
00:14:26,353 --> 00:14:28,093
(Tense)

313
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,792
They can intercept it.

314
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:34,162
They can do it. Our team can do it.

315
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:36,693
I'm excited.

316
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:41,032
Our mission is to intercept.

317
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:43,632
If not our team, who can intercept the song?

318
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:48,073
We will surely intercept TEAM BEAT's song.

319
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:01,651
("MAMMA MIA (WHO WE ARE)" by He Junjin, James, Jang Kyung Ho,)

320
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:02,892
(Kim Dae Yun, Kim Joo Hyoung, Koo Han Seo, Zen Zen)

321
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,733
They're looking cool.

322
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,713
Yes.

323
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,382
Zen Zen!

324
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:30,782
Yes!

325
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:16,001
Is this the same song?

326
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:34,896
(Koo Han Seo)

327
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:46,266
Go, James!

328
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:09,456
(Sexy!)

329
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,266
(Koo Han Seo)

330
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,056
Let's go! Let's go, Kyung Ho!

331
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:23,634
(As expected from our team.)

332
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,404
That was legendary.

333
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,405
(Nice.)

334
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,604
Good job.

335
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:28,835
Gosh.

336
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,345
- I love you! - I love you!

337
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:36,716
It ended with no aftertaste.

338
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:42,055
- We won. - We'll win.

339
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:43,056
We won.

340
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,895
I couldn't feel my lungs.

341
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,835
I gave it my all. It was do or die.

342
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,864
Now, then.

343
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:04,135
TEAM BEAT's starting lineup, please come up onstage as well.

344
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:10,575
(It's time to decide the owner of "MAMMA MIA.")

345
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,654
(Who will become the owner of "MAMMA MIA?")

346
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,655
Why does it feel like I'm watching a soccer match?

347
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:23,055
(Will the new song be taken away...)

348
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,726
(or will it be kept?)

349
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:27,665
- All right, Woong Ki. - Yes?

350
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,335
What did you think of their performance?

351
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:30,936
What did you think of their performance?

352
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:34,536
They did...

353
00:19:35,135 --> 00:19:36,335
seem to work hard and do well,

354
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,776
but I think our team's teamwork stood out more.

355
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:44,215
Gosh.

356
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,844
(Nice one, Woong Ki!)

357
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:46,915
What did you think?

358
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,485
We did work hard,

359
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:51,016
but I do think we did a great job as well.

360
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:52,925
Well...

361
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:57,055
Woong Ki has improved quite a bit too.

362
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:59,065
(Woong Ki has improved quite a bit too.)

363
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,865
Our performance was better than theirs.

364
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:03,296
There's no way people thought we did a bad job.

365
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:06,165
We are going to get picked anyway.

366
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,835
I thought he was trying too hard.

367
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:10,775
Their performances...

368
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,546
- were very different. - Right.

369
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:15,315
The Intercept Round.

370
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,186
The winner and owner of the new songs...

371
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:21,814
will be decided...

372
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:24,855
by the on-site voting of the fans that are here.

373
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:27,425
Please vote for the team that you think did better.

374
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:32,125
(Which team's voice will the new song be released in?)

375
00:20:32,925 --> 00:20:33,966
We can't lose this.

376
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:36,436
The voting will begin now.

377
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,936
(There are only 20 seconds to vote.)

378
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,404
(Who will the fans vote...)

379
00:20:43,405 --> 00:20:46,545
(as the owner of the new song?)

380
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,306
If you liked TEAM BEAT's starting lineup's performance,

381
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:50,446
press Number One.

382
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:54,246
(A cute appeal to keep their new song)

383
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:56,915
Please pick us!

384
00:20:57,615 --> 00:21:00,125
(He's so cute.)

385
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,496
(Shooting hearts)

386
00:21:03,825 --> 00:21:05,525
Please pick TEAM BEAT!

387
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:07,796
(Please pick TEAM BEAT!)

388
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:09,835
Gosh, he's so pretty.

389
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:12,635
- Why is he so cute? - Right.

390
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:14,865
I want to raise him.

391
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:17,875
I should take him after we're done.

392
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:24,216
(TEAM GROOVE's bench can't lose.)

393
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:27,546
I think we're Number Two. Please pick us!

394
00:21:29,556 --> 00:21:30,556
Gosh.

395
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,925
Kyung Ho acting cute? This is a precious scene.

396
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,796
You all have to press the button. Please vote.

397
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,195
- Please vote for us! - Number Two!

398
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:42,936
- Please press Number One! - Please vote for us!

399
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,766
- Please! - Five,

400
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:46,806
four, three,

401
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:48,776
two, one.

402
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:53,375
The voting is over.

403
00:21:55,675 --> 00:21:58,374
- We won't lose this one. - Right?

404
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,015
Losing can't happen to us.

405
00:22:01,016 --> 00:22:02,914
Gosh, I feel so nervous. I feel more nervous about this...

406
00:22:02,915 --> 00:22:04,016
- than our performance. - Seriously.

407
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:07,226
Our team's performance did seem to be spotless.

408
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:09,825
I didn't see any mistakes.

409
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,766
We just need to accept the result.

410
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,195
I'm not sure.

411
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:15,466
(I'm not sure who will win.)

412
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:18,835
We will now reveal the result.

413
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,735
The owner of the new song, "MAMMA MIA," is...

414
00:22:22,736 --> 00:22:26,046
(Who will become the owner of the new song, "MAMMA MIA?")

415
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,006
We have to win...

416
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:31,314
not to make our teammates get any yellow cards.

417
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:32,815
(We have to win not to make our teammates get any yellow cards.)

418
00:22:33,115 --> 00:22:34,914
Our team must've won no matter what.

419
00:22:34,915 --> 00:22:36,056
(TEAM BEAT has received 7 yellow cards.)

420
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,215
(If they lose again,)

421
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,786
(there might be members eliminated with 2 yellow cards.)

422
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,496
Our team can't afford to get more yellow cards.

423
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:45,425
I don't want to lose.

424
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:50,565
I really want to take away their new song.

425
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:53,006
I really hope for us to win.

426
00:22:56,536 --> 00:23:01,405
(Extremely nervous)

427
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:02,715
I can't watch this!

428
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,875
(I can't watch this!)

429
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,344
The owner of the new song, "MAMMA MIA," is...

430
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:07,486
(Will the new song be kept or intercepted?)

431
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:09,844
(Who will become the winner of this match?)

432
00:23:10,485 --> 00:23:12,784
TEAM GROOVE! Congratulations!

433
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:14,124
(TEAM GROOVE's bench wins.)

434
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:18,724
(TEAM GROOVE's bench manages to intercept TEAM BEAT's new song.)

435
00:23:18,725 --> 00:23:21,794
(We got their song!)

436
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:23,834
(Congratulations!)

437
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:28,933
("MAMMA MIA (WHO WE ARE)" by TEAM GROOVE's bench...)

438
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,674
(will be released on December 21 at 6pm.)

439
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:34,644
(That's amazing.)

440
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,884
(It really got intercepted!)

441
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:41,684
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup wasn't able to keep the song.)

442
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:52,065
(Another unbelievable loss)

443
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,295
Is this even possible?

444
00:23:53,296 --> 00:23:55,894
(Is this even possible?)

445
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:03,644
This is flustering.

446
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:10,344
(Another loss hits them right after their previous loss.)

447
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,854
- Great job! - Great job!

448
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:16,555
- Great job! - Great job!

449
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,302
Gosh, he looks really sad.

450
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:30,202
(Worried)

451
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:31,543
Don't cry!

452
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,453
(Kyung Ho spots Woong Ki crying.)

453
00:24:41,912 --> 00:24:45,182
(He hesitates to go to him as he's on the opposing team.)

454
00:24:53,162 --> 00:24:57,902
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup heads to Woong Ki.)

455
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:00,902
It's okay. You did really well.

456
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:10,313
(Kyung Ho plucks up his courage and heads toward him.)

457
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:15,283
Woong Ki.

458
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,023
You did really well.

459
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:33,872
(As he knows how much Woong Ki wanted to do well,)

460
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:39,513
(Kyung Ho quietly comforts him.)

461
00:25:39,813 --> 00:25:42,743
- Don't cry! - Don't cry!

462
00:25:42,983 --> 00:25:44,283
- Don't cry! - Don't cry!

463
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,151
(Only the sound of Woong Ki crying can be heard...)

464
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:54,152
(in TEAM BEAT's waiting room.)

465
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:11,602
(Director EL CAPITXN leaves as he finds it tough to watch.)

466
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:19,852
It's a world of competition,

467
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:22,182
- It's scary. - but I do feel...

468
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:24,582
quite bad.

469
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:31,592
I'm sorry.

470
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,592
- It's okay! - You did well, Woong Ki!

471
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:44,203
I thought that I would feel...

472
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:47,313
a burst of joy after winning.

473
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:49,313
I really worked hard to prepare for this performance.

474
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:50,983
But...

475
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,382
I felt really numb.

476
00:26:55,852 --> 00:26:58,993
I think I have something I wish to tell Woong Ki.

477
00:26:59,553 --> 00:27:02,322
When I was on the same team as Woong Ki,

478
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:03,793
I imagined us getting good results...

479
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:08,233
and lifting up the trophy together.

480
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:12,132
But we're now on different teams...

481
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:14,102
and walking our own paths.

482
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:16,003
I know how serious...

483
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:18,672
Woong Ki is about this and how hard he works.

484
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:23,842
I want to tell him that he did a great job.

485
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:26,982
Working with him...

486
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:28,953
feels like yesterday.

487
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:30,622
After hearing his words,

488
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,953
I cried as I felt really sorry.

489
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:40,963
(These two can now truly root for each other's new path.)

490
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:51,503
- You did really well. - Gosh, Woong Ki!

491
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:53,743
This is heartbreaking.

492
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:58,283
Someone is really going to go home today.

493
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:02,722
Gosh.

494
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,422
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup returns to the waiting room.)

495
00:28:05,693 --> 00:28:06,722
It's okay.

496
00:28:06,723 --> 00:28:08,522
- I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry.

497
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:10,062
I should be the one to feel sorry.

498
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,661
(The players feel hurt after their losses.)

499
00:28:11,662 --> 00:28:13,233
It's okay.

500
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:15,262
These things can happen.

501
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:16,703
(Director YUGYEOM gives them a warm hug.)

502
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:19,371
You guys did well.

503
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:21,003
Anyone would've thought you guys were the winners.

504
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:24,042
I'm serious.

505
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:25,401
(Their tears won't stop flowing even with his warm words.)

506
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,043
I'm serious.

507
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:30,111
You guys have done nothing wrong. You all did well.

508
00:28:30,112 --> 00:28:31,582
You guys were the winners.

509
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:33,053
I'm serious.

510
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:35,212
- Thank you. - I'm serious.

511
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,252
(We hope these are pains...)

512
00:28:36,253 --> 00:28:37,322
(that will make them stronger tomorrow.)

513
00:28:38,023 --> 00:28:41,522
(TEAM RHYTHM's waiting room feels tense.)

514
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:43,693
(Feeling nervous)

515
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:46,331
Even during the previous round,

516
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:48,931
- our starting lineup won. - Right.

517
00:28:48,932 --> 00:28:51,802
But our bench was a bit disappointing.

518
00:28:51,803 --> 00:28:55,503
(But our bench was a bit disappointing.)

519
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:58,672
(The bench's performance in Round 1)

520
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:03,341
(Incorrect dance moves...)

521
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:04,342
(and singing out of tune)

522
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:05,682
This...

523
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:10,053
(TEAM RHYTHM's directors showed their disappointment.)

524
00:29:10,553 --> 00:29:12,723
You have to do well today.

525
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:14,352
(Determined nod)

526
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:15,693
Can you do well?

527
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:18,723
- We can do well! - We can do well!

528
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:20,563
(Let's intercept as well!)

529
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:23,262
"Prison" should become TEAM RHYTHM's song as well.

530
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:25,302
- Let's get two songs! - Okay!

531
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:26,732
Do you think you can take away their song?

532
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:28,372
- Yes! - Intercept!

533
00:29:28,572 --> 00:29:30,773
- Take their song! - Take their song!

534
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:33,141
- Just do what you used to do. - Right.

535
00:29:33,142 --> 00:29:34,442
- This is your song. - Right.

536
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:36,641
Don't think about getting it taken away.

537
00:29:36,642 --> 00:29:38,611
That was how we prepared for this, right?

538
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:40,552
- Got it. - Hands down. In 1, 2, 3.

539
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:41,983
- Let's go! - Let's go!

540
00:29:42,723 --> 00:29:46,592
Shall we meet the stars of Intercept Round's final match?

541
00:29:47,122 --> 00:29:48,122
(Excited)

542
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:50,621
The ones that will try to protect their new song...

543
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,063
with a sturdy defense. The team with the strongest vocalists,

544
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,132
TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup. Please come up onstage.

545
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:03,202
Director Lee Chang Sub...

546
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:04,702
wrote this song just for us.

547
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,012
It will be hard for any team...

548
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,313
to take away our song.

549
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:15,581
(Gangdong)

550
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:17,122
(Kenta)

551
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:19,453
(Check out their outfits.)

552
00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:21,422
Seo Jeong Woo.

553
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:23,963
Kwon Hee Jun.

554
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:26,332
Kim Gi Joong.

555
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,503
Yeo Gangdong. Bae Jae Ho.

556
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:30,932
Kenta.

557
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:33,132
Park Han.

558
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:36,601
(Park Han, Gi Joong)

559
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:38,671
(Amazed)

560
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,473
- Hee Jun. - Hee Jun.

561
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:42,013
They look insane.

562
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,611
Is it because they have fair skin? It really suits them.

563
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:47,881
- They look so good. - Right.

564
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:50,151
This is the opposing team...

565
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:52,121
that will try to take away TEAM GROOVE's new song.

566
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:54,121
The team with intense performances,

567
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:56,622
TEAM RHYTHM's bench. Please come up onstage.

568
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,262
Our team's intense performance...

569
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,703
is unrivaled.

570
00:31:06,273 --> 00:31:08,232
We can beat TEAM GROOVE.

571
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,203
(We can beat TEAM GROOVE.)

572
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,813
These two teams have such a strong presence.

573
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:21,013
(Eito, Seo Jeong Woo)

574
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:22,652
Eito.

575
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,922
Ayumu.

576
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:27,793
Mac. Li Zhinuo.

577
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:31,493
Xie Yuxin. Jin Ziming.

578
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:33,332
Sirin.

579
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:35,901
(They are all amazed.)

580
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:37,563
They look like vampires!

581
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,533
(Last match of the Intercept Round)

582
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,303
Gosh, why do I feel so nervous?

583
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:46,313
(The directors feel nervous as well as it's the last match of Round 2.)

584
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:49,072
Which song are you two teams fighting for?

585
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:52,312
The song that we have prepared for is called "Prison."

586
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:55,181
As we are the team with the strongest vocalists,

587
00:31:55,182 --> 00:31:57,552
our director has made this song based on that.

588
00:31:57,553 --> 00:32:00,821
I think it will be a song that will be hard...

589
00:32:00,822 --> 00:32:02,193
to intercept from us.

590
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,492
(Smirking)

591
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,861
(TEAM GROOVE shows a lot of confidence.)

592
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:11,132
Our team displays a strong performance.

593
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,631
With a stronger performance,

594
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,102
we will take away your new song.

595
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:17,542
Of course.

596
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:19,513
(Will that be possible?)

597
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,273
- Let's go! - Let's go!

598
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:25,141
- RHYTHM! - RHYTHM!

599
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:26,283
Let's go!

600
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:27,912
Let's get them.

601
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:33,052
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench watches from the seats.)

602
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:34,193
Gi Joong.

603
00:32:34,693 --> 00:32:37,891
How was it when you first listened to the song?

604
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:39,962
As soon as I listened to it,

605
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:42,391
my eyes popped out as it was so good.

606
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:44,763
And as the song was really difficult,

607
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,032
we struggled quite a lot during practice,

608
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,773
even as the strongest vocalists.

609
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:51,702
This is supposed to be a secret,

610
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,542
but Director Lee Chang Sub...

611
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:56,043
said this song was hard even for him.

612
00:32:56,382 --> 00:32:57,982
(How hard is it?)

613
00:32:57,983 --> 00:32:59,581
(Clearing his throat)

614
00:32:59,582 --> 00:33:02,483
But TEAM GROOVE has Park Han.

615
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,752
The singing is important for this song,

616
00:33:04,753 --> 00:33:05,822
but Han is there.

617
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:07,722
(How were the practice sessions for the tough song, "Prison?")

618
00:33:08,093 --> 00:33:09,721
(Practice room of TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup)

619
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:13,161
Do you know what was said when they provoked us?

620
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:15,162
I don't remember what was said because I never was affected by it.

621
00:33:17,633 --> 00:33:20,233
All I remember is Li Zhinuo walking up to me.

622
00:33:21,273 --> 00:33:24,602
(After the opposing teams were decided)

623
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:28,313
(It's a very difficult song.)

624
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,942
The only team that can handle this song...

625
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,052
(TEAM GROOVE provoked them with their vocal skills.)

626
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:46,693
(TEAM RHYTHM fought back with the yellow card performance.)

627
00:33:47,032 --> 00:33:49,293
- Nice one - Go, Li Zhinuo!

628
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:51,832
(Look at this punk!)

629
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:54,503
To be honest,

630
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:56,702
I don't feel afraid of them.

631
00:33:57,642 --> 00:34:00,511
We have great members,

632
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:02,543
and influential members...

633
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:04,213
joined our team.

634
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:07,411
Our team has three MVPs.

635
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,322
It was great because they all felt reliable.

636
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:11,951
Shall we listen to the song?

637
00:34:11,952 --> 00:34:13,621
- Yes. - Yes.

638
00:34:13,622 --> 00:34:14,653
Go.

639
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:18,991
(A melody that brings back memories)

640
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:22,802
I thought the song got better with each listen.

641
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:26,732
Each day, in those memories

642
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:30,042
I loved the chorus the most.

643
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:33,372
I also thought it would suit my voice.

644
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:37,782
(They all are into the song.)

645
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:41,511
(And I cannot escape)

646
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,581
(On this pitch-black night)

647
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,051
The song is amazing.

648
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:47,022
- Gosh. - It...

649
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:49,593
It sounds like a song...

650
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:51,661
made just for TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.

651
00:34:51,662 --> 00:34:53,562
- Right. - It's insane.

652
00:34:53,563 --> 00:34:54,633
Gosh.

653
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:57,831
Don't you think we are the only ones...

654
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:59,972
- who can pull off this song? - Right.

655
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:02,602
Is there a member on that team who can pull off the chorus?

656
00:35:03,073 --> 00:35:05,543
You were on that team, Hee Jun.

657
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:13,153
Xie Yuxin is the rapper.

658
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:15,011
But he could hit really high notes.

659
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,052
That was why he was the main vocalist.

660
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:18,682
Is he better than Han?

661
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,152
No way.

662
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:22,823
Okay.

663
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,292
To be honest, I think Han...

664
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:26,491
is the best singer on this show.

665
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,962
The main vocalist of main vocalists.

666
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:30,031
Don't feel shy!

667
00:35:30,032 --> 00:35:31,232
I acted confident...

668
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:32,972
because I was relying on Han.

669
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:34,871
(The reliable vocalist, Han)

670
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:36,241
Me too.

671
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:38,042
I think things are going out of hand.

672
00:35:38,043 --> 00:35:40,043
- Gosh. - It'd be great if you could stop.

673
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:42,572
He's just really talented.

674
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,112
I think he's the most talented...

675
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:46,412
out of all 42 players.

676
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:50,952
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup is practicing their singing.)

677
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:55,391
(Showing how it's done)

678
00:35:55,392 --> 00:35:57,523
Expressing rage and resentment.

679
00:35:58,262 --> 00:36:00,593
It was really hard to sing that way.

680
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:02,292
You have to sound huskier.

681
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,601
We

682
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:06,831
We can't afford to fail and give up

683
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,132
How do you sound huskier?

684
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,202
Just try to sound huskier.

685
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,572
Hey!

686
00:36:10,573 --> 00:36:12,443
- Like this? - Like this?

687
00:36:14,012 --> 00:36:16,542
(Trying to sound like Han as much as possible)

688
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:17,912
That was close.

689
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:19,442
So I can breathe

690
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:20,482
Can you do that part for me?

691
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:21,652
So I can breathe

692
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:24,722
(Why not?)

693
00:36:25,323 --> 00:36:27,323
Five, six, seven...

694
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,622
(Han harmonizes with him.)

695
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,262
One more time.

696
00:36:32,662 --> 00:36:35,891
So I can breathe and be free

697
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:37,502
- Make it ring. - Ring?

698
00:36:37,503 --> 00:36:38,733
Right.

699
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:40,332
Five, six, seven...

700
00:36:40,602 --> 00:36:43,742
So I can breathe and be free

701
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,502
- Free - Right.

702
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,713
One last time, please.

703
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,642
I'm sorry.

704
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:52,642
(He helps out with his practicing endlessly.)

705
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:55,152
(Hee Jun is in charge of the rap part of "Prison.")

706
00:36:55,153 --> 00:36:56,253
(Confused)

707
00:36:56,753 --> 00:36:59,323
(He's fine with the rap part as well.)

708
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:01,592
Every day, every night, does this make sense?

709
00:37:01,593 --> 00:37:02,753
There's an accent on the last word.

710
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:04,762
(Detailed)

711
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:07,063
Every day, every night, does this make sense?

712
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:11,332
He took great care of our team members.

713
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,031
It has to be detailed.

714
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:16,342
(Han became a vocal trainer for the members during practice.)

715
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:20,043
If TEAM GROOVE takes first place,

716
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:22,871
I believe Han should get...

717
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:24,213
a lot of credit for the win.

718
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,813
(The vocal training ends.)

719
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:33,593
(Han is practicing on his own.)

720
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:37,621
(Doing his best)

721
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,762
(Doing his best again)

722
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:45,133
(Repeating it until he is satisfied)

723
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:47,633
There are a lot of high notes,

724
00:37:48,073 --> 00:37:50,871
and it requires a lot of breath.

725
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:53,971
I thought it was a tough song...

726
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,813
to sing while dancing.

727
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:58,511
(Practicing hard so he can sing stably...)

728
00:37:58,512 --> 00:38:00,181
(even while dancing.)

729
00:38:00,182 --> 00:38:01,182
So...

730
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,681
I'm just practicing...

731
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,552
until I can do it.

732
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:13,792
(He's facing the obstacle straight on...)

733
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:20,032
(instead of avoiding it.)

734
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:23,843
Are you doing well?

735
00:38:23,903 --> 00:38:25,172
- Yes. - We're working hard.

736
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:26,241
(Director Lee Chang Sub is here for the interim check.)

737
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:27,712
- Just the singing. - Okay.

738
00:38:27,713 --> 00:38:29,642
Yes, let's just sing first.

739
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,912
- Han. - Yes?

740
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:33,952
When you start, it needs to sound...

741
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:36,523
- a bit more like you're taking off. - Okay.

742
00:38:36,622 --> 00:38:37,622
So...

743
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:42,753
It feels like I am trapped in the cycle that is you

744
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:45,062
There is no end, prison

745
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:46,121
Like this.

746
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:48,462
- There is no end, prison - There we go.

747
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:50,732
- Okay. - That could make you breathless.

748
00:38:50,733 --> 00:38:53,101
- Okay. - But if you practice, it'll work.

749
00:38:53,102 --> 00:38:54,133
Okay.

750
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:57,971
- And you can't take off. - Okay.

751
00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:59,471
- You're in the air already. - Okay.

752
00:38:59,472 --> 00:39:00,472
- Okay? - Okay.

753
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:01,672
- You're following him, right? - Yes.

754
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,043
You have to continue his energy.

755
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,312
There is no end, prison

756
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:08,113
- Like this. You need to connect it. - Okay.

757
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,653
Think of it as a relay.

758
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,621
- It's a relay. - Okay.

759
00:39:11,622 --> 00:39:12,752
- Okay? - Okay.

760
00:39:12,753 --> 00:39:16,462
I am trapped in the times, stuck in the cracks

761
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:19,693
And I cannot escape

762
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:21,432
- Like this. - Okay.

763
00:39:22,032 --> 00:39:25,102
(Meanwhile)

764
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:29,032
Try it. Lower.

765
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:33,411
- I got goosebumps. - I am trapped in the times

766
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,072
(He can't take his eyes off him.)

767
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,781
(Reacting every time he sings)

768
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:39,812
Try it again.

769
00:39:39,813 --> 00:39:41,252
Five, six, seven, eight.

770
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:45,081
- I am trapped in the times - That's our director.

771
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,082
Good.

772
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:47,622
Don't overthink it.

773
00:39:48,093 --> 00:39:49,093
Put your hand here...

774
00:39:49,593 --> 00:39:52,122
and imagine that your voice doesn't go...

775
00:39:53,332 --> 00:39:54,931
any farther than that.

776
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:55,932
- Okay. - Okay?

777
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:59,772
That way... Where is the end

778
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,403
- You have to keep it inside. Okay? - Okay.

779
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,443
Director Lee Chang Sub...

780
00:40:05,043 --> 00:40:06,872
keeps us positive.

781
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:11,483
He gives us the carrot and the stick at the same time.

782
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:14,951
"I'll keep you positive, but I'll also help you improve."

783
00:40:14,952 --> 00:40:15,952
He's kind of like that.

784
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:18,922
(Afterward, Director Lee Chang Sub...)

785
00:40:18,923 --> 00:40:25,222
(checks on the choreography, focusing on the main part.)

786
00:40:27,193 --> 00:40:29,593
(Glaring)

787
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:36,601
(The choreography is tough, despite it being a high part.)

788
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:39,813
There is no end, prison

789
00:40:39,912 --> 00:40:40,972
Okay. You can stop there.

790
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:44,081
For the "There is no exit, prison" part,

791
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:46,781
- don't dance. - Okay.

792
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:48,213
- Okay. - Just hit the important points.

793
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:50,851
- Okay. - And I cannot escape

794
00:40:50,852 --> 00:40:52,122
Don't dance during that part.

795
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:55,952
- Bang! - There is no end, prison

796
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:59,093
Because we're a team centered around vocals,

797
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,563
he was directing us in a way...

798
00:41:04,032 --> 00:41:05,063
that highlighted our vocals.

799
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:06,232
(Director Chang Sub's strategy:)

800
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:08,172
(Focus on the vocals without ruining the choreography.)

801
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:09,733
He made our vocals the focus.

802
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:12,573
"If your vocals are affected, let's remove some of the dancing."

803
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:16,713
It feels a lot more comfortable to watch now.

804
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:20,512
(And Director Lee Chang Sub's secret weapon)

805
00:41:20,713 --> 00:41:23,221
Show me your abs.

806
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:24,452
(Suddenly showing off their abs?)

807
00:41:24,923 --> 00:41:27,153
Should we show off your abs here?

808
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:30,122
(They were waiting to change up their looks.)

809
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:32,492
(This is the time to do so.)

810
00:41:34,532 --> 00:41:37,503
(Very satisfied)

811
00:41:38,202 --> 00:41:39,733
Don't gain weight, okay?

812
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,332
Okay.

813
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:43,343
Okay. Good.

814
00:41:43,673 --> 00:41:46,201
I thought Kenta would be able to capture the audience's eyes...

815
00:41:46,202 --> 00:41:48,971
with his looks in the introduction, which is a very important part.

816
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:50,383
So I'm not worried at all.

817
00:41:53,142 --> 00:41:54,181
Yes, sir.

818
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:57,552
Let's watch the performance by TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup,

819
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:58,752
the owners of the new song.

820
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:02,923
TEAM GROOVE. Are you ready?

821
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,832
(Kwon Hee Jun)

822
00:42:07,363 --> 00:42:10,062
Thinking about how well Han will do...

823
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:11,431
- already makes me... - Han.

824
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:13,502
Thinking about hearing Han's singing makes me excited.

825
00:42:13,503 --> 00:42:15,003
Right?

826
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,813
We'll prove that only our team can perform this song.

827
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:28,512
We will take "Prison" no matter what.

828
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:31,622
I love you, Hee Jun.

829
00:42:35,632 --> 00:42:37,871
Ready? Go.

830
00:42:42,832 --> 00:42:46,672
("Prison" by Bae Jae Ho, Kenta, Kim Gi Joong,)

831
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:49,702
(Kwon Hee Jun, Park Han, Seo Jeong Woo, Yeo Gangdong)

832
00:43:06,622 --> 00:43:07,622
(Kenta)

833
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:23,302
That outfit is cheating.

834
00:44:11,323 --> 00:44:12,383
Oh, a body roll.

835
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:28,972
(Jeong Woo)

836
00:44:43,952 --> 00:44:44,952
Okay, let's go!

837
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:24,062
This team has strong vocals.

838
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:25,722
Their vocals are so...

839
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:52,352
They're too good.

840
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:05,532
How seductive.

841
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:41,202
Oh, my.

842
00:47:01,823 --> 00:47:04,261
(Oh, my, GROOVE!)

843
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:05,722
Han really is great!

844
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:06,932
That was good.

845
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:09,262
How could anyone beat this?

846
00:47:09,832 --> 00:47:11,063
No matter what anyone says, they did well.

847
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:12,733
They're so good.

848
00:47:14,472 --> 00:47:16,272
Nice.

849
00:47:16,273 --> 00:47:17,472
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup gave a high-quality performance.)

850
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:20,412
Their dancing was a bit lacking.

851
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:23,141
(TEAM RHYTHM is strong in terms of dancing.)

852
00:47:23,142 --> 00:47:25,343
I have a good feeling for our team.

853
00:47:26,883 --> 00:47:29,182
- Show them, RHYTHM. - Show them, RHYTHM.

854
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,660
(Now, all TEAM RHYTHM's bench has to do is to strike back.)

855
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:35,051
(Nervous)

856
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:38,092
We'll win.

857
00:47:38,093 --> 00:47:39,262
We'll definitely get first place.

858
00:47:40,432 --> 00:47:43,132
That was TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.

859
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:44,232
Good job!

860
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:47,831
- You can join your team now. - Good job!

861
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:49,503
Good work.

862
00:47:52,543 --> 00:47:54,141
Good job, Hee Jun!

863
00:47:54,142 --> 00:47:55,172
(You dominated today. I'm so proud of you.)

864
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:57,282
Good job, boys!

865
00:47:58,313 --> 00:48:00,712
(It was a satisfactory performance, including the audience reaction.)

866
00:48:00,713 --> 00:48:02,383
The most memorable people were Han...

867
00:48:03,883 --> 00:48:05,722
Han, Gi Joong, Kenta, and Hee Jun?

868
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:07,823
That's all of them.

869
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:13,392
I thought we'd win because the performance went well.

870
00:48:13,863 --> 00:48:17,432
I believe we did everything we could.

871
00:48:17,932 --> 00:48:20,832
We will invite TEAM RHYTHM's bench onto the stage...

872
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:24,003
to take on TEAM GROOVE.

873
00:48:26,242 --> 00:48:28,073
(Let's go, RHYTHM.)

874
00:48:29,642 --> 00:48:30,713
Why am I so nervous?

875
00:48:32,512 --> 00:48:34,882
This team is very global.

876
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:36,352
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench has players from several countries.)

877
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:38,383
Oh, right. They don't have a Korean member.

878
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,552
There's not a single Korean member.

879
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:43,452
Li Zhinuo.

880
00:48:44,593 --> 00:48:46,293
(Extremely nervous)

881
00:48:46,563 --> 00:48:48,161
(He's so cute.)

882
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:49,162
Li Zhinuo.

883
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:52,563
What did you honestly think when you heard the song?

884
00:48:53,162 --> 00:48:54,503
(Curious)

885
00:48:54,972 --> 00:48:57,543
Honestly, the song is too high.

886
00:48:59,742 --> 00:49:01,512
It's too hard.

887
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,741
(Everyone laughs at how nervous he is.)

888
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:05,782
He's so cute.

889
00:49:06,912 --> 00:49:08,012
Okay. Nice.

890
00:49:08,983 --> 00:49:11,423
What did you think of TEAM GROOVE's performance?

891
00:49:15,823 --> 00:49:16,923
I thought we could take them on.

892
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:20,832
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench players confidently provoke the opponents.)

893
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:23,432
(Not affected at all)

894
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:25,503
Good job.

895
00:49:25,903 --> 00:49:26,903
That's what I'm talking about.

896
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:29,673
Vocals are very important in this song.

897
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:34,642
Since TEAM RHYTHM's bench has many players...

898
00:49:34,742 --> 00:49:37,012
whose main strength is dancing,

899
00:49:37,313 --> 00:49:39,113
I thought it would be hard for them.

900
00:49:41,613 --> 00:49:42,852
Our vocalists are good too.

901
00:49:43,552 --> 00:49:46,082
He gives our team stability.

902
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,153
He's good at singing and dancing.

903
00:49:49,622 --> 00:49:50,622
He's so good.

904
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:54,491
Who is TEAM RHYTHM's main vocalist?

905
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,593
(Who is TEAM RHYTHM's main vocalist?)

906
00:49:57,133 --> 00:49:58,201
Me.

907
00:49:58,202 --> 00:49:59,233
(Sirin is the main vocalist of TEAM RHYTHM's bench.)

908
00:49:59,432 --> 00:50:01,402
(Who?)

909
00:50:01,403 --> 00:50:03,371
(Let's go, Sirin.)

910
00:50:03,372 --> 00:50:05,202
- Be confident. That's right. - Main vocalist.

911
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:07,273
Sirin will carry the team.

912
00:50:08,343 --> 00:50:09,443
Sirin is good at singing.

913
00:50:10,813 --> 00:50:11,813
He's good at singing.

914
00:50:14,483 --> 00:50:16,983
(How was practice for TEAM RHYTHM's confident bench players?)

915
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:20,022
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench's practice room)

916
00:50:20,023 --> 00:50:22,391
We're going to compete...

917
00:50:22,392 --> 00:50:25,162
against TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.

918
00:50:25,963 --> 00:50:26,991
How do you feel?

919
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:29,092
Park Han, who was in Group "Siren..."

920
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:30,802
- is on this team, right? - Right.

921
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:32,762
- Park Han. - Yes, Han.

922
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:39,741
(From TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup, they're most worried about Han.)

923
00:50:39,742 --> 00:50:43,073
(From TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup, they're most worried about Han.)

924
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:46,281
Since Han is good at singing...

925
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:48,012
and at dancing,

926
00:50:48,452 --> 00:50:52,121
I think he's the most...

927
00:50:52,122 --> 00:50:54,222
threatening player.

928
00:50:55,293 --> 00:50:56,991
TEAM GROOVE has many vocalists,

929
00:50:56,992 --> 00:50:58,292
but our team...

930
00:50:58,293 --> 00:51:00,662
- has many dancers and rappers. - You're right.

931
00:51:01,832 --> 00:51:03,831
When I look...

932
00:51:03,832 --> 00:51:06,133
at our team,

933
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:08,431
I see...

934
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,701
many talented players,

935
00:51:10,702 --> 00:51:12,972
so I think it'll be easy.

936
00:51:14,273 --> 00:51:15,912
(Thumbs-up)

937
00:51:16,912 --> 00:51:19,483
Oh, my. This is going to be really fun...

938
00:51:19,682 --> 00:51:21,382
because I obviously have a yellow card,

939
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:22,681
and I also really want...

940
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:25,823
to get that revenge. You know what I mean?

941
00:51:26,122 --> 00:51:28,153
(Mac is very eager.)

942
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:30,392
(And another player with a yellow card...)

943
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,262
(burning with passion)

944
00:51:33,563 --> 00:51:35,762
You gave me a yellow card, right?

945
00:51:37,063 --> 00:51:38,832
(I'm going to stop eating and only practice.)

946
00:51:39,932 --> 00:51:41,003
Okay.

947
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:42,073
Me too.

948
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:43,201
No sleep.

949
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:44,273
(Sleeping is also prohibited!)

950
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,602
(What is that?)

951
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,673
Okay?

952
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:47,813
Practice.

953
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,012
(There's something else?)

954
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,343
No bathroom.

955
00:51:52,313 --> 00:51:53,713
"No bathroom?"

956
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:57,011
(Li Zhinuo is only interested in intercepting the song.)

957
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:58,422
Either I'll get eliminated,

958
00:51:58,423 --> 00:51:59,722
or other members will get yellow cards.

959
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:03,193
I'm planning to give our opponents yellow cards.

960
00:52:03,492 --> 00:52:05,391
I want TEAM RHYTHM's bench...

961
00:52:05,392 --> 00:52:08,593
to get first place this time.

962
00:52:09,063 --> 00:52:11,133
I'll work super,

963
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:13,032
super hard.

964
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,772
(The other team members burn up with passion too.)

965
00:52:15,773 --> 00:52:16,773
I'll work hard.

966
00:52:17,742 --> 00:52:19,871
- Let's go. - Let's go.

967
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:21,073
(Checking the song right away)

968
00:52:21,843 --> 00:52:25,142
(They're listening to the song later than TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.)

969
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:30,823
(The introduction of the song starts with a low rap.)

970
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:37,162
(There are many explosive high notes the further you get into the song.)

971
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:39,822
(He tries singing along,)

972
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:43,162
(but it's too hard.)

973
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:47,702
(He can't even dare to try the high notes.)

974
00:52:48,503 --> 00:52:53,602
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench fell silent at the difficult song.)

975
00:52:54,073 --> 00:52:56,313
Oh, it's hard.

976
00:52:56,412 --> 00:52:58,613
It's overwhelming.

977
00:52:59,282 --> 00:53:01,613
It was so hard because it was so high.

978
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,621
(The mood becomes serious...)

979
00:53:05,622 --> 00:53:07,891
(because it's difficult to sing even a line of the high parts.)

980
00:53:07,892 --> 00:53:08,952
Oh, my gosh.

981
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:11,622
It's easy.

982
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:14,661
(It's easy?)

983
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:15,662
But it's so high.

984
00:53:15,663 --> 00:53:17,733
(But it's so high.)

985
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:21,173
(Sirin tries singing the high part.)

986
00:53:21,432 --> 00:53:23,801
There is no end, prison

987
00:53:23,802 --> 00:53:24,942
The chorus is yours.

988
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:26,101
Prison

989
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:27,742
The chorus is yours.

990
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:31,082
Okay, you'll take the vocal part.

991
00:53:31,983 --> 00:53:34,552
I think Sirin could be our main vocalist.

992
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:36,252
You have a nice voice.

993
00:53:36,253 --> 00:53:37,852
(With that one impactful verse, he earned his team's trust.)

994
00:53:39,323 --> 00:53:42,923
Hello. I'm Sirin, and I'm from Thailand.

995
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:50,531
(He passed his audition with his emotional singing...)

996
00:53:50,532 --> 00:53:54,532
(that makes it hard to believe that he's 16 years old.)

997
00:53:55,532 --> 00:54:02,843
(He showed off his powerful dancing and singing during the draft.)

998
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:07,113
(Sirin)

999
00:54:07,613 --> 00:54:09,511
(He joined TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup...)

1000
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:11,483
(as the directors' First Pick.)

1001
00:54:13,852 --> 00:54:19,122
(Sirin handled his part as the sub-vocalist in Round 1.)

1002
00:54:21,363 --> 00:54:23,233
- Sirin. - Sirin.

1003
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:26,432
You're our team's main vocalist king.

1004
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:30,903
I also think Sirin's dancing...

1005
00:54:31,003 --> 00:54:34,512
is better than Park Han's.

1006
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,813
Oh, my.

1007
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:40,582
He said beating Park Han would be easy.

1008
00:54:40,813 --> 00:54:43,113
(The reliable youngest)

1009
00:54:43,582 --> 00:54:45,923
- Nice. - Sirin.

1010
00:54:46,552 --> 00:54:48,523
- Oh, yes. Thank you. - Really?

1011
00:54:48,793 --> 00:54:50,492
- "Really?" - Really?

1012
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:54,032
- Help me. Sirin. Help me. - Really?

1013
00:54:54,432 --> 00:54:56,762
- Really? - Help me.

1014
00:54:56,963 --> 00:54:58,003
You're the only one.

1015
00:54:58,832 --> 00:55:01,431
Maybe, I'll have to go home.

1016
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,201
(Lots of responsibility)

1017
00:55:03,202 --> 00:55:04,273
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1018
00:55:04,472 --> 00:55:06,871
You know, I'm so nervous...

1019
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:08,773
because I dropped...

1020
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:10,912
from the starting lineup to the bench,

1021
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:13,613
but I can help out with my vocals...

1022
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:16,713
and help this team get first place.

1023
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:22,222
(Sirin is the main vocalist for TEAM RHYTHM's bench.)

1024
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:27,221
(Practicing hard for his team's victory)

1025
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:30,802
(Practicing hard for his team's victory)

1026
00:55:32,302 --> 00:55:33,962
There is no end

1027
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,372
(Explosive high notes)

1028
00:55:36,573 --> 00:55:38,573
(Oh, my.)

1029
00:55:39,802 --> 00:55:43,872
(His high notes sound clearer with repeated practice.)

1030
00:55:44,782 --> 00:55:45,983
Oh, my.

1031
00:55:47,082 --> 00:55:49,781
Not only can Sirin sing the best...

1032
00:55:49,782 --> 00:55:51,782
and hit the right notes,

1033
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:55,093
he can also sing in a pleasant way.

1034
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:57,193
I believe...

1035
00:55:57,423 --> 00:55:59,923
he will lift our team up...

1036
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,492
with his vocals.

1037
00:56:02,832 --> 00:56:04,332
(A few days later...)

1038
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,532
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench is practicing the choreography to the music.)

1039
00:56:09,403 --> 00:56:12,472
(Maximum power)

1040
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:16,173
(The floor choreography follows.)

1041
00:56:20,682 --> 00:56:22,681
(Unlike TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup,)

1042
00:56:22,682 --> 00:56:24,082
(they added difficult moves.)

1043
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:27,923
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench performs...)

1044
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:34,633
(this obviously difficult move very smoothly.)

1045
00:56:35,432 --> 00:56:37,602
(And the next move)

1046
00:56:39,532 --> 00:56:45,943
(A part with extremely synchronized moves)

1047
00:56:48,073 --> 00:56:51,782
(Clean angles)

1048
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:57,012
(More clean angles)

1049
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,323
Since dancing is our team's strength,

1050
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,122
we practiced a lot to be synchronized.

1051
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,962
There aren't many players...

1052
00:57:06,963 --> 00:57:09,463
who can dance this well there,

1053
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:11,562
so I thought our team...

1054
00:57:11,563 --> 00:57:13,363
had a chance of winning.

1055
00:57:14,332 --> 00:57:16,102
(To intercept the new song,)

1056
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:21,472
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench will compete with both their vocals and dancing.)

1057
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:25,983
(After a tough dance practice session)

1058
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,281
(Looking tired)

1059
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:31,323
- How was it? - Oh, my. How is your group doing?

1060
00:57:31,653 --> 00:57:32,852
(Ta-da.)

1061
00:57:33,323 --> 00:57:34,491
(What is that?)

1062
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,252
Let's eat tteokbokki!

1063
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:37,522
(Snack time for the players who have been practicing hard)

1064
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:39,423
- Let's eat tteokbokki. - What is this?

1065
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,492
The packaging is so pretty. So pink.

1066
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:43,662
Pink.

1067
00:57:45,363 --> 00:57:46,531
(We didn't know what they'd like.)

1068
00:57:46,532 --> 00:57:47,601
This looks delicious.

1069
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:48,802
(So we prepared two types of tteokbokki.)

1070
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,133
Sundae!

1071
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,842
(And you can't miss tteokbokki's best friends.)

1072
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,242
- There's sundae. - Oh, my gosh.

1073
00:57:53,573 --> 00:57:55,141
Guys, let's eat then.

1074
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:57,172
- Okay. - Okay.

1075
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,281
Let's go!

1076
00:57:58,282 --> 00:58:01,011
- We'll enjoy it. - Enjoy, everyone.

1077
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:02,012
I'll enjoy it.

1078
00:58:02,013 --> 00:58:03,652
- Zhang Shuaibo, what do you want? - He stood up.

1079
00:58:03,653 --> 00:58:05,522
- This? - Let's go.

1080
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,181
- Enjoy. - Enjoy, guys.

1081
00:58:07,182 --> 00:58:09,423
- Thanks. - I'll enjoy this.

1082
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:10,652
I'll enjoy it.

1083
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,022
(Sirin goes for the spicy and sweet tteokbokki.)

1084
00:58:12,023 --> 00:58:14,592
- It's so good. - I'll enjoy it.

1085
00:58:14,593 --> 00:58:15,633
(Exclaiming)

1086
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:18,832
- It's so good. - Is it good?

1087
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:20,132
Yes, it's good.

1088
00:58:20,133 --> 00:58:22,902
(They must've been hungry, seeing how they're silently eating.)

1089
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:23,931
This too.

1090
00:58:23,932 --> 00:58:25,241
- You know, - Yes?

1091
00:58:25,242 --> 00:58:26,542
these must be flour-based rice cakes.

1092
00:58:26,543 --> 00:58:28,042
That's the kind I personally love,

1093
00:58:28,043 --> 00:58:29,741
which makes this even more delicious.

1094
00:58:29,742 --> 00:58:31,582
(Who can resist flour-based rice cakes?)

1095
00:58:31,983 --> 00:58:33,011
It's delicious.

1096
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:34,552
(Flour-based rice cakes are the best.)

1097
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,712
- Do you eat sundae? - I do.

1098
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:37,721
Dip it in the sauce.

1099
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,852
- Really? - Yes.

1100
00:58:39,122 --> 00:58:40,221
It's really good.

1101
00:58:40,222 --> 00:58:42,023
(The combo recommended by the brother from Australia.)

1102
00:58:42,593 --> 00:58:44,622
(Taking a bite each)

1103
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:46,621
Isn't it so much better?

1104
00:58:46,622 --> 00:58:48,831
(It's amazing.)

1105
00:58:48,832 --> 00:58:51,662
Daisuke, dip the sundae in the tteokbokki sauce.

1106
00:58:51,802 --> 00:58:54,331
- What's this? - That's sundae.

1107
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:55,502
- Sundae? - Yes.

1108
00:58:55,503 --> 00:58:56,503
I haven't tried this before.

1109
00:58:56,504 --> 00:58:57,801
- Is it your first time? - Yes.

1110
00:58:57,802 --> 00:58:59,502
This is Daisuke's first time having sundae.

1111
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:00,641
- Really? - Yes.

1112
00:59:00,642 --> 00:59:02,712
(The 3 older members watch Daisuke have his 1st sundae.)

1113
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:03,773
Is it good?

1114
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:05,843
- Is it good? - It's good.

1115
00:59:06,912 --> 00:59:08,082
So cute.

1116
00:59:08,782 --> 00:59:10,153
Everything's so good.

1117
00:59:10,983 --> 00:59:12,581
Do you want this? No?

1118
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:14,182
(Eating)

1119
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:16,522
You're killing me.

1120
00:59:16,523 --> 00:59:17,593
(Chih En cracks up at Zhang Shuaibo's playfulness.)

1121
00:59:18,093 --> 00:59:20,221
- Wasn't that funny? - It wasn't.

1122
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:21,233
Why not?

1123
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:24,092
Guys, let's make a toast.

1124
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,102
TEAM RHYTHM.

1125
00:59:25,432 --> 00:59:27,831
- For 1st place! - For 1st place!

1126
00:59:27,832 --> 00:59:31,702
(Thanks to the delicious snacks, they are fully recharged.)

1127
00:59:32,443 --> 00:59:35,242
(After enjoying a short break,)

1128
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:39,983
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench goes back to practicing.)

1129
00:59:40,682 --> 00:59:42,113
(Just then)

1130
00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:45,252
(Someone visits TEAM RHYTHM's bench.)

1131
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:46,281
Okay.

1132
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,522
"The memories..."

1133
00:59:47,523 --> 00:59:48,952
- What? - Hold on.

1134
00:59:49,193 --> 00:59:51,423
- Hello! - Hi!

1135
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:53,121
- Hi. - No way.

1136
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:54,261
Are things going well?

1137
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:55,362
- Yes. - Absolutely.

1138
00:59:55,363 --> 00:59:56,793
- Hello. - Really? Hey.

1139
00:59:57,162 --> 00:59:58,331
- Oh, my gosh. - No way.

1140
00:59:58,332 --> 00:59:59,762
(Puzzled)

1141
01:00:00,102 --> 01:00:01,732
The song's tough, isn't it?

1142
01:00:01,733 --> 01:00:03,132
- It is. - Yes.

1143
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:04,133
(It's difficult to master.)

1144
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,741
Show me what you've got.

1145
01:00:05,742 --> 01:00:07,613
- Sure. - Let's take a look.

1146
01:00:08,343 --> 01:00:12,011
(They present "Prison...")

1147
01:00:12,012 --> 01:00:15,912
(to the director of the opposing team.)

1148
01:00:16,852 --> 01:00:20,581
Each day, in those memories

1149
01:00:20,582 --> 01:00:23,951
We can't afford to fail and give up

1150
01:00:23,952 --> 01:00:25,161
(Smirking)

1151
01:00:25,162 --> 01:00:27,562
And I cannot escape

1152
01:00:27,563 --> 01:00:29,992
On this pitch-black night

1153
01:00:34,032 --> 01:00:36,733
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1154
01:00:37,532 --> 01:00:39,672
Sirin, you're a talented vocalist.

1155
01:00:39,673 --> 01:00:41,112
(Sirin, you're a talented vocalist.)

1156
01:00:41,113 --> 01:00:42,173
Thank you.

1157
01:00:46,012 --> 01:00:47,212
Director Lee Chang Sub.

1158
01:00:47,213 --> 01:00:49,351
Even though he was from the other team,

1159
01:00:49,352 --> 01:00:51,652
he commented regarding my vocal skills...

1160
01:00:51,653 --> 01:00:53,653
and said it was excellent.

1161
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:57,023
It was a great moment for me, and I was really happy.

1162
01:00:57,352 --> 01:00:59,422
You guys know how to put on a performance,

1163
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,531
so I should tell my team to practice harder...

1164
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,991
not to lose their song.

1165
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,863
(Proud)

1166
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:06,832
You delivered with your performance.

1167
01:01:07,162 --> 01:01:09,073
- Thank you. - Thanks.

1168
01:01:09,872 --> 01:01:11,801
I think that if...

1169
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:14,871
we were to use our biggest asset, which are...

1170
01:01:14,872 --> 01:01:17,741
in terms of performance, good dancing skills,

1171
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:19,482
and also good vocal skills,

1172
01:01:19,483 --> 01:01:22,883
I think that we can possibly beat TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.

1173
01:01:23,282 --> 01:01:25,582
We won't beat TEAM GROOVE per se.

1174
01:01:26,653 --> 01:01:27,952
We'll kill TEAM GROOVE.

1175
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:29,593
(Relaxed and confident)

1176
01:01:29,992 --> 01:01:32,621
(What kind of performance will TEAM RHYTHM's bench present?)

1177
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:37,293
TEAM RHYTHM. Are you ready?

1178
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,701
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1179
01:01:39,702 --> 01:01:41,702
- Please. - Let's do this!

1180
01:01:42,872 --> 01:01:44,472
You'd better steal their song.

1181
01:01:45,503 --> 01:01:46,872
- You've got this. - Sirin, come on!

1182
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:48,543
I believe in you.

1183
01:01:49,012 --> 01:01:50,412
- Let's go. - Hey, come on.

1184
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:51,782
Sirin, you've got this.

1185
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:00,451
We are a talented group...

1186
01:02:00,452 --> 01:02:04,462
that can deliver in terms of dancing and vocal skills.

1187
01:02:04,463 --> 01:02:07,093
TEAM RHYTHM doesn't lose.

1188
01:02:12,133 --> 01:02:13,202
Ready?

1189
01:02:13,762 --> 01:02:14,773
Go.

1190
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:20,272
("Prison" by Ayumu, Eito,)

1191
01:02:20,273 --> 01:02:22,512
(Jin Ziming, Li Zhinuo, Mac, Sirin, Xie Yuxin)

1192
01:02:28,613 --> 01:02:31,522
(What was that?)

1193
01:02:31,523 --> 01:02:32,823
(Embarrassed)

1194
01:02:51,302 --> 01:02:52,372
Check out their dance.

1195
01:02:58,282 --> 01:03:00,081
(What?)

1196
01:03:00,082 --> 01:03:01,253
They're so on point.

1197
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:04,012
No way!

1198
01:03:06,052 --> 01:03:07,122
My gosh.

1199
01:03:11,052 --> 01:03:12,093
Goodness.

1200
01:03:17,392 --> 01:03:18,432
Sirin!

1201
01:03:33,682 --> 01:03:35,552
Their live singing is better than expected.

1202
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,593
Why are they this good?

1203
01:03:55,972 --> 01:03:57,432
Oh, my gosh!

1204
01:04:01,242 --> 01:04:02,313
(No way.)

1205
01:04:25,503 --> 01:04:27,332
(That's it!)

1206
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:40,682
They're so good.

1207
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,682
- No way. - Nice.

1208
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,503
I love their choreography.

1209
01:05:10,543 --> 01:05:11,781
It goes perfectly with the song's vibe.

1210
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:12,911
I honestly can't tell who'll win.

1211
01:05:12,912 --> 01:05:15,352
- They keep leaving you in awe. - I know.

1212
01:05:34,233 --> 01:05:35,472
(Speechless)

1213
01:05:36,073 --> 01:05:38,503
(Go, TEAM RHYTHM!)

1214
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:02,162
All right!

1215
01:06:02,363 --> 01:06:03,863
- Go! - Okay!

1216
01:06:10,932 --> 01:06:12,872
I have to admit that it's cool.

1217
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,121
Okay. They did great.

1218
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,262
(Good job.)

1219
01:06:33,492 --> 01:06:34,862
(Their performance was on fire!)

1220
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:37,792
I don't care if they win or lose.

1221
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:38,832
They were just good.

1222
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:41,232
I could tell they practiced a lot.

1223
01:06:41,233 --> 01:06:42,773
- They practiced a lot. - Exactly.

1224
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:45,002
Vocal-oriented versus dance-oriented.

1225
01:06:45,003 --> 01:06:46,043
(TEAM GROOVE's vocals versus TEAM RHYTHM's dance)

1226
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:47,802
The two performances feel different.

1227
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:53,682
We might lose the song.

1228
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,153
I think they'll steal it away.

1229
01:07:01,122 --> 01:07:04,122
(It becomes tense for TEAM GROOVE.)

1230
01:07:05,122 --> 01:07:07,063
Clearly, they came prepared.

1231
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:10,163
They were better than expected.

1232
01:07:10,733 --> 01:07:13,102
Their dancing was stylish and impressive.

1233
01:07:16,802 --> 01:07:19,902
(It's now time to see who'll own "Prison.")

1234
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:21,971
The voting will begin.

1235
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:23,012
(On-site voting begins.)

1236
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,641
(Since it's the last match,)

1237
01:07:25,642 --> 01:07:27,842
(the audience makes a careful decision.)

1238
01:07:28,113 --> 01:07:29,851
Do you think our team will win?

1239
01:07:29,852 --> 01:07:31,452
- Of course. - Absolutely.

1240
01:07:31,453 --> 01:07:34,422
I'm proud of what our team accomplished today.

1241
01:07:37,823 --> 01:07:40,591
I could tell that the bench members came out packing a punch today.

1242
01:07:40,592 --> 01:07:42,192
- Look at that. - There you go.

1243
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:43,492
(Launching an attack with his abs)

1244
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:44,862
Goodness.

1245
01:07:44,863 --> 01:07:46,203
(Gangdong)

1246
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:47,833
(My gosh)

1247
01:07:48,102 --> 01:07:50,302
(An encore of his abs)

1248
01:07:50,502 --> 01:07:51,601
(Nicely done, Kenta!)

1249
01:07:51,602 --> 01:07:52,641
Kenta, nice!

1250
01:07:52,642 --> 01:07:54,472
(My belly, close your eyes.)

1251
01:07:55,142 --> 01:07:57,272
(Showing off his abs is the same as cheating.)

1252
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:58,342
He's showing too much skin.

1253
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:01,182
Please vote for us. Thank you.

1254
01:08:01,552 --> 01:08:03,182
(Adorable)

1255
01:08:04,653 --> 01:08:06,023
He worked a lot on his Korean.

1256
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:07,421
- Press one. - Guys!

1257
01:08:07,422 --> 01:08:08,721
- Press 1. - It's Number 1.

1258
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:09,722
- Press 1. - We're Number 1.

1259
01:08:09,723 --> 01:08:11,221
- RHYTHM. - RHYTHM.

1260
01:08:11,222 --> 01:08:13,692
- RHYTHM. - RHYTHM!

1261
01:08:13,693 --> 01:08:16,163
(The players appeal until the end.)

1262
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:17,493
Three,

1263
01:08:18,163 --> 01:08:19,163
- two, - RHYTHM.

1264
01:08:20,002 --> 01:08:21,002
one.

1265
01:08:21,003 --> 01:08:24,033
The voting has been closed.

1266
01:08:24,132 --> 01:08:26,042
I won't be surprised no matter who wins.

1267
01:08:27,102 --> 01:08:29,813
This boils down to personal preference.

1268
01:08:31,542 --> 01:08:33,082
(They gave off different vibes,)

1269
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,813
(which makes it harder to predict the outcome.)

1270
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:38,552
Let us reveal the result of the match.

1271
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:41,622
(Will they secure it?)

1272
01:08:41,623 --> 01:08:43,922
(Will they steal it?)

1273
01:08:44,323 --> 01:08:46,392
I doubt they'll be able to steal our song from us.

1274
01:08:47,892 --> 01:08:49,863
We can beat TEAM GROOVE.

1275
01:08:51,602 --> 01:08:54,033
I can feel years being shaved off my lifespan.

1276
01:08:56,273 --> 01:08:59,341
(TEAM GROOVE must secure their song...)

1277
01:08:59,342 --> 01:09:02,211
(while TEAM RHYTHM must intercept it.)

1278
01:09:02,212 --> 01:09:03,943
Please.

1279
01:09:04,913 --> 01:09:07,042
The two teams went head to head.

1280
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:11,112
Who will get to release the new song, "Prison?"

1281
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:14,065
(Who will get to release the new song, "Prison?")

1282
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:17,580
It's TEAM GROOVE. Congratulations.

1283
01:09:18,477 --> 01:09:21,687
(TEAM GROOVE wins the battle for "Prison.")

1284
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:24,816
Let's go!

1285
01:09:24,817 --> 01:09:27,317
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup managed to secure "Prison.")

1286
01:09:27,857 --> 01:09:29,625
(Both the starting lineup and bench of TEAM GROOVE...)

1287
01:09:29,626 --> 01:09:30,626
(won new songs.)

1288
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:34,727
- TEAM GROOVE! - All right!

1289
01:09:36,796 --> 01:09:39,197
(What a relief.)

1290
01:09:39,496 --> 01:09:41,536
This is crazy!

1291
01:09:43,966 --> 01:09:46,335
It's all right. We did great.

1292
01:09:46,336 --> 01:09:48,676
(TEAM RHYTHM's bench members console one another.)

1293
01:09:49,307 --> 01:09:50,706
Thank you.

1294
01:09:52,117 --> 01:09:53,746
I really feel sorry.

1295
01:09:55,347 --> 01:09:57,816
I want to apologize to the starting lineup...

1296
01:09:57,817 --> 01:10:01,117
for not being good enough.

1297
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,156
- It's all right. - Exactly.

1298
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:06,157
They did great.

1299
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,425
- That's for sure. - I have no regrets.

1300
01:10:07,426 --> 01:10:08,426
Absolutely.

1301
01:10:08,427 --> 01:10:10,126
- The result isn't everything. - Right.

1302
01:10:10,996 --> 01:10:12,836
You worked hard, preparing for the second round.

1303
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:17,267
"Prison" is now yours.

1304
01:10:15,352 --> 01:10:17,291
The two teams went head to head.

1305
01:10:17,292 --> 01:10:18,506
(Round 2, Intercept)

1306
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,675
("Prison" by TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup...)

1307
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:21,453
Who will get to release the new song "Prison?"

1308
01:10:19,676 --> 01:10:20,875
(will be released on December 21 at 6pm.)

1309
01:10:20,876 --> 01:10:22,477
- Congratulations. - Congratulations!

1310
01:10:21,453 --> 01:10:22,722
(Who will get to release the new song, "Prison?")

1311
01:10:22,477 --> 01:10:23,477
Good job.

1312
01:10:24,676 --> 01:10:27,347
This is the first official song we'll be releasing under our name,

1313
01:10:28,647 --> 01:10:30,386
and it feels weird.

1314
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:32,857
I'm touched in a way,

1315
01:10:33,756 --> 01:10:35,825
and I'm also grateful.

1316
01:10:35,826 --> 01:10:37,857
There are a lot of mixed feelings involved.

1317
01:10:38,897 --> 01:10:41,995
I'm truly glad that I didn't miss out...

1318
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:43,326
on this opportunity.

1319
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:47,635
(Round 2, the Intercept Round, is over)

1320
01:10:47,636 --> 01:10:49,067
Round Two, the Intercept Round.

1321
01:10:49,267 --> 01:10:52,705
The on-site voting decided the teams to win the song.

1322
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:54,777
(The on-site voting decided the teams to win the song.)

1323
01:10:55,006 --> 01:10:58,246
I can't look at our directors in their faces anymore.

1324
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:03,246
However, the final ranking of the teams will be determined...

1325
01:11:03,647 --> 01:11:06,455
by the on-site voting and the online voting.

1326
01:11:06,456 --> 01:11:07,986
(On-site and online votes will be added to determine the ranking.)

1327
01:11:07,987 --> 01:11:11,857
The ratio of the votes will be half on-site voting...

1328
01:11:12,397 --> 01:11:13,397
Half and half?

1329
01:11:14,097 --> 01:11:16,597
- and half online voting. - No way.

1330
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:18,766
Then it's up for grabs.

1331
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,166
- You never know. - It can go either way.

1332
01:11:20,267 --> 01:11:23,836
First, we will reveal the total on-site voting score...

1333
01:11:24,267 --> 01:11:26,906
for each team's starting lineup and bench.

1334
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:29,147
(The scores for the starting lineup and bench will be revealed.)

1335
01:11:32,477 --> 01:11:34,776
- What's that? - Are you kidding me?

1336
01:11:34,777 --> 01:11:36,216
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1337
01:11:36,416 --> 01:11:37,447
So that's how the scores will be revealed.

1338
01:11:37,647 --> 01:11:40,487
The first song, "IGNITION,"

1339
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:43,256
went to TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.

1340
01:11:44,727 --> 01:11:49,625
(With their fierce performance and perfect teamwork)

1341
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:55,606
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup managed to secure "IGNITION.")

1342
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:58,136
By how many points did they win?

1343
01:11:58,237 --> 01:12:00,205
Here are the scores.

1344
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:02,146
(The scores for the "IGNITION" match)

1345
01:12:02,147 --> 01:12:04,876
(Nervous)

1346
01:12:08,546 --> 01:12:09,686
("IGNITION" match)

1347
01:12:09,687 --> 01:12:10,816
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup: 243, TEAM BEAT's bench: 154)

1348
01:12:10,817 --> 01:12:11,986
- TEAM RHYTHM. - Nice.

1349
01:12:11,987 --> 01:12:14,186
You received 243 votes.

1350
01:12:14,187 --> 01:12:17,086
TEAM BEAT, you received 154 votes.

1351
01:12:17,386 --> 01:12:19,596
- Still, that was... - It was better than expected.

1352
01:12:19,597 --> 01:12:21,226
- Good. - It's not that bad.

1353
01:12:21,227 --> 01:12:22,966
It's 243 to 154.

1354
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:25,097
There isn't much of a gap.

1355
01:12:25,296 --> 01:12:26,296
What a relief.

1356
01:12:27,067 --> 01:12:29,367
Next was the "MAMMA MIA" match.

1357
01:12:29,966 --> 01:12:32,205
TEAM GROOVE's bench ended up winning the song.

1358
01:12:32,206 --> 01:12:33,737
(TEAM GROOVE's bench stole the song from TEAM BEAT's starting lineup.)

1359
01:12:35,376 --> 01:12:39,016
(TEAM GROOVE's bench received an enthusiastic response...)

1360
01:12:39,017 --> 01:12:41,476
(for their sexy performance.)

1361
01:12:41,477 --> 01:12:44,016
By how many points did they beat the opponent?

1362
01:12:44,017 --> 01:12:46,256
We'll reveal the scores.

1363
01:12:53,796 --> 01:12:55,766
TEAM GROOVE received 221 votes...

1364
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:58,396
while TEAM BEAT received 174 votes.

1365
01:12:58,397 --> 01:12:59,397
What a bummer.

1366
01:12:59,397 --> 01:13:00,397
("MAMMA MIA" match)

1367
01:13:00,398 --> 01:13:01,466
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup: 174, TEAM GROOVE's bench: 221)

1368
01:13:02,136 --> 01:13:06,276
(TEAM BEAT's starting lineup lost the song...)

1369
01:13:06,277 --> 01:13:08,505
(by a difference of only 47 votes.)

1370
01:13:08,506 --> 01:13:10,746
It hurt to hear the result.

1371
01:13:11,307 --> 01:13:13,277
Lastly, the song "Prison..."

1372
01:13:13,376 --> 01:13:15,286
went to TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup.

1373
01:13:16,317 --> 01:13:19,385
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup...)

1374
01:13:19,386 --> 01:13:23,955
(secured the song with their powerful vocal skills.)

1375
01:13:23,956 --> 01:13:25,756
Here are the scores.

1376
01:13:27,326 --> 01:13:28,896
(What were the final scores for the "Prison" match?)

1377
01:13:28,897 --> 01:13:29,995
- Come on. - Let it be a huge gap.

1378
01:13:29,996 --> 01:13:32,096
- Please. - Let it be a huge gap.

1379
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:34,496
(What were the final scores for the "Prison" match?)

1380
01:13:36,237 --> 01:13:39,976
- My gosh. - Goodness.

1381
01:13:39,977 --> 01:13:41,807
TEAM RHYTHM received 101 votes...

1382
01:13:42,246 --> 01:13:44,976
while TEAM GROOVE received 295 votes.

1383
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:45,977
(TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup: 295, TEAM RHYTHM's bench: 101)

1384
01:13:45,978 --> 01:13:48,846
It's fine.

1385
01:13:48,847 --> 01:13:50,986
- It's fine. - Don't feel bad.

1386
01:13:50,987 --> 01:13:52,285
- You did great. - It's fine.

1387
01:13:52,286 --> 01:13:54,486
- You all did great. - You still did a good job.

1388
01:13:54,487 --> 01:13:56,755
The team ranking for Round Two after the on-site voting.

1389
01:13:56,756 --> 01:13:58,756
TEAM GROOVE is in first place.

1390
01:13:59,057 --> 01:14:00,727
TEAM RHYTHM is in second place.

1391
01:14:01,057 --> 01:14:02,925
And TEAM BEAT is in third place.

1392
01:14:02,926 --> 01:14:03,926
(TEAM BEAT is in 3rd place after the on-site voting.)

1393
01:14:03,927 --> 01:14:05,836
There's a huge difference in the scores.

1394
01:14:05,937 --> 01:14:07,767
TEAM GROOVE killed it.

1395
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:09,165
Are you kidding me?

1396
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,907
(Total on-site voting score, RHYTHM: 344, GROOVE: 516, BEAT: 328)

1397
01:14:11,136 --> 01:14:13,336
The online voting could make a huge difference.

1398
01:14:13,706 --> 01:14:15,277
Who knows what the votes are like?

1399
01:14:15,876 --> 01:14:16,876
Oh, no.

1400
01:14:18,006 --> 01:14:20,045
Thousands of people would've voted online.

1401
01:14:20,046 --> 01:14:22,187
Thousands? Try five figures.

1402
01:14:22,517 --> 01:14:23,545
You're right.

1403
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:25,356
To be honest,

1404
01:14:25,357 --> 01:14:28,487
there are a lot of popular members on TEAM RHYTHM.

1405
01:14:29,027 --> 01:14:31,995
It felt as though TEAM RHYTHM would turn the tables.

1406
01:14:31,996 --> 01:14:33,596
I believed that TEAM RHYTHM...

1407
01:14:33,597 --> 01:14:35,626
would come out on top thanks to the online voting.

1408
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:37,767
Let's check out the votes.

1409
01:14:38,296 --> 01:14:40,295
We'll now add the online voting scores,

1410
01:14:40,296 --> 01:14:42,165
and reveal the final ranking.

1411
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:44,035
- Please. - Come on.

1412
01:14:44,036 --> 01:14:45,906
(The online voting scores are from the 1st Global Fan Voting.)

1413
01:14:45,907 --> 01:14:47,205
Please, the online voting.

1414
01:14:47,206 --> 01:14:48,407
This is where we turn the tables.

1415
01:14:48,576 --> 01:14:52,147
The online votes received by individual members...

1416
01:14:52,347 --> 01:14:56,745
were converted to match the value of the on-site votes.

1417
01:14:56,746 --> 01:14:58,415
(Online votes were converted to match the value of on-site votes.)

1418
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,616
First, please reveal TEAM BEAT's score.

1419
01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:06,196
(Revealing TEAM BEAT's final score)

1420
01:15:06,197 --> 01:15:08,496
There's only a 16-vote gap...

1421
01:15:09,097 --> 01:15:12,097
between us and TEAM RHYTHM.

1422
01:15:14,496 --> 01:15:15,506
I'm so nervous.

1423
01:15:20,277 --> 01:15:22,606
Your online voting score is 315.

1424
01:15:22,607 --> 01:15:24,375
I can't tell if that's high or not.

1425
01:15:24,376 --> 01:15:28,386
- Is that a lot? - In total, you received 643 votes.

1426
01:15:29,447 --> 01:15:32,816
Next, please reveal TEAM RHYTHM's score.

1427
01:15:32,817 --> 01:15:35,557
(Revealing TEAM RHYTHM's final score)

1428
01:15:35,756 --> 01:15:37,227
Please let it be 600.

1429
01:15:37,386 --> 01:15:38,995
What if we didn't get a high score?

1430
01:15:38,996 --> 01:15:39,996
Please.

1431
01:15:39,997 --> 01:15:42,097

(TEAM RHYTHM lost to TEAM GROOVE again.)

1471
01:17:09,933 --> 01:17:12,602
Although there was some disappointment...

1472
01:17:12,603 --> 01:17:15,873
about finishing 2nd, the 1st thing that came to mind...

1473
01:17:15,874 --> 01:17:19,403
was that our team was getting yellow cards.

1474
01:17:19,903 --> 01:17:21,844
Why are you crying?

1475
01:17:22,844 --> 01:17:25,384
- It's okay. - No, it isn't.

Don't worry.

01:17:34,653 --> 01:17:35,693
It's okay.

(TEAM BEAT ranked 3rd.)

1481
01:17:40,523 --> 01:17:43,994
We're in last place again.

1482
01:17:44,634 --> 01:17:47,103
Why do we always face challenges like this?

1483
01:17:47,464 --> 01:17:49,403
It was unsettling.

1484
01:17:53,273 --> 01:17:54,804
I will announce the player...

1485
01:17:55,143 --> 01:17:57,414

The yellow cards will be...

1492
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:15,233
given to the lower-ranking bench players on the team.

1493
01:18:15,964 --> 01:18:18,902
Let's check the individual ranking...

1494
01:18:18,903 --> 01:18:21,873
to see who will receive the yellow card.

1495

1499
01:18:30,514 --> 01:18:31,783
(Checking the individual ranking of the winning team, TEAM GROOVE)

1500
01:18:36,914 --> 01:18:39,283
They're amazing. They have no yellow cards.

1501
01:18:40,323 --> 01:18:43,494
The 1st to 7th place will be the starting players,

1502
01:18:43,893 --> 01:18:46,223
and the 8th to 14th place will be the bench players.

1503
01:18:46,964 --> 01:18:49,933
They're all talented.

1504
01:18:53,134 --> 01:18:55,204
The winner of TEAM GROOVE is...

1505
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:57,473
Is it Jeong Woo?

1506
01:18:58,103 --> 01:18:59,603
- Maybe? - Yes, Jeong Woo.

1507
01:19:01,773 --> 01:19:02,844
I think it'll be Hee Jun.

1508
01:19:06,344 --> 01:19:07,344
I had high hopes.

1509
01:19:07,544 --> 01:19:10,414
I always have hopes of a positive outcome.

1510
01:19:10,514 --> 01:19:13,584
Of course, I thought it would be nice to be the winner.

1511
01:19:14,254 --> 01:19:15,994
Who will take first place?

1512
01:19:16,994 --> 01:19:18,323
There are too many candidates.

1513

1514
01:19:21,393 --> 01:19:23,163

(Nice.)

1518
01:19:36,714 --> 01:19:38,174
It's 19,000 points?

1519
01:19:38,613 --> 01:19:41,044
(Starting lineup: Kenta, 19,423 points)

1520
01:19:41,514 --> 01:19:44,682
(That's a big number.)

1521
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:46,323
It can reach 20,000?

1522
01:19:49,693 --> 01:19:50,754
To be honest,

1523
01:19:51,994 --> 01:19:54,764
in TEAM GROOVE's starting lineup,

1524
01:19:55,094 --> 01:19:57,233
I'm the only Japanese.

1525
01:19:58,704 --> 01:19:59,704
But...

1526
01:20:01,433 --> 01:20:04,674
I had to be the center, and I was worried.

1527
01:20:05,804 --> 01:20:07,643
I was anxious every night...

1528
01:20:12,384 --> 01:20:13,414
and sometimes...

1529
01:20:15,113 --> 01:20:16,113
couldn't sleep.

1530
01:20:17,054 --> 01:20:20,383
But today, I took a new step forward,

1531
01:20:20,384 --> 01:20:22,054
and through this experience,

1532
01:20:22,994 --> 01:20:26,164
I will continue to grow.

1533
01:20:30,363 --> 01:20:33,362
I'll announce the second place.

1534
01:20:33,363 --> 01:20:35,402

01:20:38,473 --> 01:20:39,704

please move to your seats.

1565
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:56,914
This is unpredictable.

1566
01:21:57,254 --> 01:21:59,084
It all changed.

01:22:31,653 --> 01:22:33,424
Gosh. The yellow card is coming.

1580
01:22:34,723 --> 01:22:37,853
Their global fan votes are high.

1581
01:22:38,494 --> 01:22:41,363
I'm looking forward to their numbers.

1582

previously on TEAM RHYTHM.

1584
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,334
If they receive one more,

1585
01:22:51,704 --> 01:22:53,844
they won't be able to participate...

1586
01:22:54,443 --> 01:22:56,112
in Universe League.

(They can't participate in Universe League.)

1588
01:22:59,783 --> 01:23:00,844
It's cruel.

1598
01:23:23,533 --> 01:23:25,134
This team has a lot of strong players.

1599
01:23:27,073 --> 01:23:28,073

- What? - It's 38,000 points?

1604
01:23:38,754 --> 01:23:41,353

- It's twice as much as Kenta's. - I know, right?

1610
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:56,973
One thing I will promise is that...

01:25:54,454 --> 01:25:59,094
If I receive one more yellow card, I need to go home.

1658
01:25:59,294 --> 01:26:02,264
I thought I was in big trouble.

1659
01:26:02,533 --> 01:26:05,733

1677
01:26:54,813 --> 01:26:57,514
it wasn't going to be me, and...

can go to your seats.

1777
01:31:31,594 --> 01:31:32,664
My gosh.

1778
01:31:37,294 --> 01:31:38,994
Only one player here...

1779
01:31:39,603 --> 01:31:41,562
won't receive a yellow card.

1780
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:42,602
(Only one player can avoid getting a yellow card.)

1781
01:31:42,603 --> 01:31:45,433
I'll announce it now.

1782
01:31:48,073 --> 01:31:49,813
The eighth place...

1783
01:31:50,773 --> 01:31:51,773
who avoided the yellow card is...

1784
01:31:51,774 --> 01:31:57,054
(Who will win the 8th place, avoiding the yellow card?)

1785
01:31:59,853 --> 01:32:01,624
- An Yul. - Oh, gosh.

1786
01:32:01,823 --> 01:32:04,723
An Yul, you may go to your seat.

1787
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:12,232
All the remaining six players...

1788
01:32:12,233 --> 01:32:14,933
are receiving yellow cards.

1789
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:17,304
My goodness.

1790
01:32:19,704 --> 01:32:22,772
Five players except Li Zhiwei...

1791
01:32:22,773 --> 01:32:24,713
received their second yellow card.

1792
01:32:24,714 --> 01:32:27,014
So their elimination is confirmed.

1793
01:32:29,653 --> 01:32:31,584
Royce is in the ninth place.

1794
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:34,083
Jiang Fan is in the tenth place.

1795
01:32:34,084 --> 01:32:36,424
Li Zhiwei is in the 11th place.

1796
01:32:36,523 --> 01:32:38,624
Park Ji Hun is in the 12th place.

1797
01:32:38,794 --> 01:32:40,863
Kang Jun Hyuk is in the 13th place.

1798
01:32:41,023 --> 01:32:43,563
Park Yeon Jun is in the 14th place.

1799
01:32:47,804 --> 01:32:51,674
It's unfortunate, but you have to leave Universe League.

1800
01:32:51,804 --> 01:32:52,873
Thanks for your effort.

1801
01:32:52,874 --> 01:32:54,102
(It's unfortunate, but it's time to leave Universe League.)

1802
01:32:54,103 --> 01:32:56,072
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1803
01:32:56,073 --> 01:32:57,713
- Thanks for your effort. - You all went through a lot!

1804
01:32:57,714 --> 01:32:58,772
- Thank you. - Thanks for your effort!

1805
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:00,544
(Giving a round of applause to the players who have worked hard.)

1806
01:33:04,214 --> 01:33:05,982
(A heartfelt farewell with the team they've grown close to)

1807
01:33:05,983 --> 01:33:07,282
Don't go.

1808
01:33:07,283 --> 01:33:13,523
(A heartfelt farewell with the team they've grown close to)

1809
01:33:13,924 --> 01:33:14,964
Thank you.

1810
01:33:15,964 --> 01:33:18,263
Still, once this show airs,

1811
01:33:18,264 --> 01:33:20,402
as long as people know that...

1812
01:33:20,403 --> 01:33:23,703
there was someone like me...

1813
01:33:23,704 --> 01:33:27,643
who brought passion to the stage, I'll be satisfied.

1814
01:33:27,874 --> 01:33:30,473
I met my fans who supported me...

1815
01:33:31,113 --> 01:33:33,014
and loved me.

1816
01:33:33,344 --> 01:33:34,813
I've never had...

1817
01:33:35,244 --> 01:33:37,652
a better experience than this.

1818
01:33:37,653 --> 01:33:41,483
I'm just thankful to my fans.

1819
01:33:41,624 --> 01:33:45,223
I'll try harder moving forward.

1820
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:47,192
I'll do my best...

1821
01:33:47,193 --> 01:33:50,433
and show a lot of improvements.

1822
01:33:50,764 --> 01:33:52,663
I hope I'll be...

1823
01:33:52,664 --> 01:33:55,062
remembered a lot on this show,

1824
01:33:55,063 --> 01:33:58,334
whether it's onstage or in front of the camera.

1825
01:33:58,473 --> 01:34:00,572
As we said earlier,

1826
01:34:00,573 --> 01:34:03,072
we promised to be positive and smile...

1827
01:34:03,073 --> 01:34:04,573
until the end.

1828
01:34:04,874 --> 01:34:08,413
So I also want to leave...

1829
01:34:08,414 --> 01:34:12,683
with a smile.

1830
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:15,023
From now,

1831
01:34:15,754 --> 01:34:18,123
we'll start the trade.

1832
01:34:18,124 --> 01:34:22,023
(Trade tickets can make the 1st and 2nd place teams stronger.)

1833
01:34:22,264 --> 01:34:23,733
According to the results of Round Two,

1834
01:34:23,964 --> 01:34:25,933
TEAM GROOVE won two trade tickets,

1835
01:34:26,563 --> 01:34:28,763
and TEAM RHYTHM, who won the second place,

1836
01:34:28,764 --> 01:34:30,504
won one trade ticket.

1837
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:32,874
(Sighing)

1838
01:34:33,273 --> 01:34:35,443
I kept saying the same thing.

1839
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:37,714
We have to win in every round...

1840
01:34:37,844 --> 01:34:39,983
and strengthen our team.

1841
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,743
And it came true.

1842
01:34:41,744 --> 01:34:45,113
So we can comfortably strengthen our team.

1843
01:34:47,653 --> 01:34:49,454
This is so unfair.

1844
01:34:49,624 --> 01:34:51,893
We keep losing players.

1845
01:34:52,393 --> 01:34:54,722
(What will happen to TEAM BEAT after the trade?)

1846
01:34:54,723 --> 01:34:58,764
TEAM GROOVE will start trading first.

1847
01:34:58,933 --> 01:35:01,664
Director Lee Chang Sub, please come out to the stage.

1848
01:35:02,264 --> 01:35:04,273
- Captain, take care. - Take care.

1849
01:35:06,344 --> 01:35:07,942
(TEAM GROOVE has 2 trade tickets.)

1850
01:35:07,943 --> 01:35:10,142
(It can be used on both TEAM RHYTHM and TEAM BEAT.)

1851
01:35:10,143 --> 01:35:11,473
Why does this feel so ominous?

1852
01:35:12,214 --> 01:35:13,244
So this is how you feel.

1853
01:35:14,414 --> 01:35:16,953
(Getting released is inevitable with the trade.)

1854
01:35:16,954 --> 01:35:19,254
I was anxious for some reason.

1855
01:35:22,023 --> 01:35:23,094
(Trade)

1856
01:35:24,624 --> 01:35:26,393
Director Lee Chang Sub,

1857
01:35:26,964 --> 01:35:29,464
please announce the players you want to release.

1858
01:35:31,193 --> 01:35:33,264
They call it "release?"

1859
01:35:34,664 --> 01:35:37,233
The one to be released from my team is...

1860
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:42,504
All 14 people are very good.

1861
01:35:42,973 --> 01:35:46,443
I didn't want to leave TEAM GROOVE.

1862
01:35:47,813 --> 01:35:50,253
(Who's the first player to be released?)

1863
01:35:50,254 --> 01:35:51,414
Zen Zen.

1864
01:35:51,754 --> 01:35:58,223
(TEAM GROOVE releases Zen Zen in 13th place.)

1865
01:36:00,893 --> 01:36:03,193
(Fortunately, Zen Zen's cheerful.)

1866
01:36:03,533 --> 01:36:04,964
He seems to like it.

1867
01:36:05,433 --> 01:36:07,334
He's too cheerful.

1868
01:36:07,704 --> 01:36:10,072
Good job, Zen Zen.

1869
01:36:10,073 --> 01:36:11,273
He's bright.

1870
01:36:11,603 --> 01:36:13,004
It was a shame,

1871
01:36:13,244 --> 01:36:14,902
but since he's a good dancer,

1872
01:36:14,903 --> 01:36:16,943
he might do better on another team.

1873
01:36:17,273 --> 01:36:18,472
(The older members are sad.)

1874
01:36:18,473 --> 01:36:20,584
I'll do my best on another team.

1875
01:36:21,584 --> 01:36:25,853
Now, I'd appreciate it if you told me...

1876
01:36:26,084 --> 01:36:27,782
who you want to scout.

1877
01:36:27,783 --> 01:36:31,023
(Who's he scouting in Zen Zen's place?)

1878
01:36:34,063 --> 01:36:35,263
(During Round 1's trade,)

1879
01:36:35,264 --> 01:36:39,164
(he scouted Koo Han Seo.)

1880
01:36:39,533 --> 01:36:41,503
(He reinforced the team...)

1881
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:43,603
(with Han Seo's strong impression and rap.)

1882
01:36:44,973 --> 01:36:50,073
(Then he scouted Kwon Hee Jun.)

1883
01:36:50,443 --> 01:36:53,783
(He reinforced the team with Hee Jun's diverse looks.)

1884
01:36:54,384 --> 01:36:56,783
(TEAM GROOVE benefited from trading.)

1885
01:36:57,554 --> 01:37:00,453
(What's his trade standard this time?)

1886
01:37:00,454 --> 01:37:02,554
The player I want to scout is...

1887
01:37:04,153 --> 01:37:07,193
If he scouted anyone on my team,

1888
01:37:07,594 --> 01:37:10,964
it'd cause a big problem. I was anxious.

1889
01:37:12,294 --> 01:37:15,704
I was worried a lot.

1890
01:37:19,134 --> 01:37:22,473
From TEAM RHYTHM...

1891
01:37:30,483 --> 01:37:32,383
In terms of strategy,

1892
01:37:32,384 --> 01:37:33,953
we need popular players.

1893
01:37:33,954 --> 01:37:35,253
(2nd place in TEAM RHYTHM)

1894
01:37:35,254 --> 01:37:36,693
(3rd place in TEAM RHYTHM)

1895
01:37:37,254 --> 01:37:39,793
(Who will Director Lee Chang Sub choose?)

1896
01:37:39,794 --> 01:37:41,222
Sirin.

1897
01:37:41,223 --> 01:37:44,363
(TEAM GROOVE first scouts Sirin.)

1898
01:37:44,693 --> 01:37:46,032
Sirin.

1899
01:37:46,033 --> 01:37:47,362
(Sirin in 12th place is nominated.)

1900
01:37:47,363 --> 01:37:48,533
Sirin?

1901
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:53,573
I get it.

1902
01:37:54,143 --> 01:37:56,943
Sirin's vocals can be really improved.

1903
01:37:58,214 --> 01:38:00,344
When he performed "Prison,"

1904
01:38:00,613 --> 01:38:02,414
his vocals stood out the most.

1905
01:38:02,613 --> 01:38:07,754
He has the image my team doesn't have.

1906
01:38:08,183 --> 01:38:11,594
It'll be a good strategy to scout him.

1907
01:38:12,323 --> 01:38:15,822
Please move to your new teams.

1908
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:17,093
(Trading Sirin and Zen Zen)

1909
01:38:17,094 --> 01:38:18,263
Still, he's the master.

1910
01:38:18,264 --> 01:38:20,062
- Well done. - I don't want to go.

1911
01:38:20,063 --> 01:38:21,432
Good luck on TEAM RHYTHM.

1912
01:38:21,433 --> 01:38:22,433
Good luck.

1913
01:38:22,434 --> 01:38:23,804
Wish you the best. Thanks.

1914
01:38:23,903 --> 01:38:25,602
Thank you.

1915
01:38:25,603 --> 01:38:26,603
Good luck.

1916
01:38:26,603 --> 01:38:27,603
(Good luck on the new team.)

1917
01:38:28,804 --> 01:38:33,214
(TEAM GROOVE scouts Sirin.)

1918
01:38:33,783 --> 01:38:36,084
Now, you only have one trade ticket left.

1919
01:38:36,483 --> 01:38:39,553
Announce the player to be released.

1920
01:38:39,554 --> 01:38:44,023
(Who's the second player to be released in TEAM GROOVE?)

1921
01:38:44,454 --> 01:38:47,363
The second player to be released is...

1922
01:38:48,494 --> 01:38:50,892
I never expected it to be me.

1923
01:38:50,893 --> 01:38:53,063
He scouted me,

1924
01:38:53,403 --> 01:38:55,533
but he might release me.

1925
01:38:57,403 --> 01:38:58,533
James.

1926
01:38:58,874 --> 01:39:03,272
(TEAM GROOVE releases James in 9th place.)

1927
01:39:03,273 --> 01:39:09,683
(TEAM GROOVE releases James in 9th place.)

1928
01:39:10,113 --> 01:39:13,153
Also, announce the player to scout.

1929
01:39:13,254 --> 01:39:16,222
Yes. The player to be scouted is...

1930
01:39:16,223 --> 01:39:17,892
(Who's the second player to be scouted?)

1931
01:39:17,893 --> 01:39:20,124
I have a feeling it's J.

1932
01:39:20,964 --> 01:39:22,192
I felt it. It's J.

1933
01:39:22,193 --> 01:39:23,334
(I'd rather not see it.)

1934
01:39:24,094 --> 01:39:25,133
It's J.

1935
01:39:25,134 --> 01:39:26,134
(Is it Ju Won as Director TEN suspects?)

1936
01:39:26,135 --> 01:39:28,263
(Or JL?)

1937
01:39:28,264 --> 01:39:29,432
It is...

1938
01:39:29,433 --> 01:39:33,073
(Or trading from TEAM BEAT in danger?)

1939
01:39:33,973 --> 01:39:35,544
Once again from TEAM RHYTHM.

1940
01:39:36,744 --> 01:39:38,273
Once again from TEAM RHYTHM.

1941
01:39:38,674 --> 01:39:39,674
Oh, my gosh.

1942
01:39:40,714 --> 01:39:41,744
I know who it is.

1943
01:39:42,983 --> 01:39:44,254
Chang Sub, go easy on us.

1944
01:39:44,954 --> 01:39:46,983
(Sorry.)

1945
01:39:47,483 --> 01:39:48,853
It's J.

1946
01:39:49,323 --> 01:39:50,323
J.

1947
01:39:50,324 --> 01:39:51,593
(This man is especially anxious.)

1948
01:39:51,594 --> 01:39:54,693
I was very anxious.

1949
01:39:56,393 --> 01:39:57,464
What if you leave?

1950
01:39:58,634 --> 01:39:59,863
What if it's you?

1951
01:40:00,134 --> 01:40:02,464
(TEAM RHYTHM's directors expected to trade Park Ju Won.)

1952
01:40:02,964 --> 01:40:04,173
I'm never...

1953
01:40:04,174 --> 01:40:05,973
(I'm never wrong.)

1954
01:40:06,903 --> 01:40:12,472
(Who is scouted from TEAM RHYTHM?)

1955
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:14,084
Park Ju Won.

1956
01:40:14,283 --> 01:40:18,183
(TEAM GROOVE scouts Park Ju Won next.)

1957
01:40:19,823 --> 01:40:20,923
(TEAM RHYTHM's starting player, Park Ju Won, is nominated.)

1958
01:40:20,924 --> 01:40:22,023
No.

1959
01:40:23,023 --> 01:40:24,554
He's all we have.

1960
01:40:25,823 --> 01:40:27,522
- I told you. - Yes.

1961
01:40:27,523 --> 01:40:28,523
It's a shame.

1962
01:40:28,893 --> 01:40:31,294
My goodness. He's taking Park Ju Won?

1963
01:40:33,764 --> 01:40:35,004
We scouted a strong player.

1964
01:40:37,804 --> 01:40:40,972
I'm really worried because...

1965
01:40:40,973 --> 01:40:44,073
Ju Won is one of our front-runners in the starting lineup.

1966
01:40:45,613 --> 01:40:49,083
My conclusion was that we'd need someone...

1967
01:40:49,084 --> 01:40:50,683
passionate and bright.

1968
01:40:51,054 --> 01:40:54,023
It matched Park Ju Won the most.

1969
01:40:54,523 --> 01:40:57,352
So I decided to scout him.

1970
01:40:57,353 --> 01:40:58,693
(Director Lee Chang Sub creates the strongest team as he planned.)

1971
01:40:59,054 --> 01:41:02,222
James and Park Ju Won...

1972
01:41:02,223 --> 01:41:03,532
are traded.

1973
01:41:03,533 --> 01:41:06,362
(TEAM RHYTHM lost their core member.)

1974
01:41:06,363 --> 01:41:08,003
(Staring)

1975
01:41:08,004 --> 01:41:10,272
We have to pick a Korean.

1976
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:11,303
Yes.

1977
01:41:11,304 --> 01:41:12,304
(After trading Park Ju Won,)

1978
01:41:12,305 --> 01:41:13,902
(TEAM RHYTHM only has foreign members left.)

1979
01:41:13,903 --> 01:41:16,813
(The new member, James, is also from abroad.)

1980
01:41:17,174 --> 01:41:19,843
Even the last Korean member...

1981
01:41:19,844 --> 01:41:21,044
(Who will TEAM RHYTHM choose?)

1982
01:41:21,714 --> 01:41:23,213
Come here.

1983
01:41:23,214 --> 01:41:25,482
It's okay. You'll do well.

1984
01:41:25,483 --> 01:41:27,152
(Ju Won has to leave his team and members.)

1985
01:41:27,153 --> 01:41:28,183
Don't cry.

1986
01:41:28,653 --> 01:41:29,682
You'll do well.

1987
01:41:29,683 --> 01:41:30,693
Why are you crying?

1988
01:41:31,254 --> 01:41:33,924
I was the first member...

1989
01:41:34,693 --> 01:41:37,294
TEAM RHYTHM chose.

1990
01:41:38,733 --> 01:41:41,033
(Park Ju Won)

1991
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,703
(He can never forget the moment...)

1992
01:41:43,704 --> 01:41:45,903
(he joined TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup.)

1993
01:41:46,004 --> 01:41:49,344
(The directors greeted him.)

1994
01:41:50,374 --> 01:41:52,673
(He became TEAM RHYTHM's first starting player...)

1995
01:41:52,674 --> 01:41:54,143
(he'd been dreaming of...)

1996
01:41:54,683 --> 01:41:58,413
(and learned from Directors TEN and YANGYANG.)

1997
01:41:58,414 --> 01:42:02,153
(and learned from Directors TEN and YANGYANG.)

1998
01:42:03,254 --> 01:42:05,754
- Thank you. - Good work.

1999
01:42:06,023 --> 01:42:07,023
Thank you.

2000
01:42:07,124 --> 01:42:09,424
- Good luck. - You have to beat us there.

2001
01:42:10,634 --> 01:42:11,692
- Good luck. - Hi.

2002
01:42:11,693 --> 01:42:13,063
- Hi. - Hi.

2003
01:42:13,933 --> 01:42:15,062
Nice to meet you.

2004
01:42:15,063 --> 01:42:17,703
- Hey. - Nice to meet you.

2005
01:42:17,704 --> 01:42:18,903
We're a team now.

2006
01:42:19,204 --> 01:42:20,244
I know.

2007
01:42:20,344 --> 01:42:21,772
I've always wanted to be on the same team.

2008
01:42:21,773 --> 01:42:22,773
Welcome...

2009
01:42:23,714 --> 01:42:24,714
to TEAM GROOVE.

2010
01:42:25,943 --> 01:42:28,744
We'll next begin second place's trade.

2011
01:42:29,113 --> 01:42:31,583
TEAM RHYTHM's director, please come forward.

2012
01:42:31,584 --> 01:42:35,153
(TEAM RHYTHM has 1 trade ticket.)

2013
01:42:35,823 --> 01:42:40,063
(They can only trade with TEAM BEAT.)

2014
01:42:45,433 --> 01:42:48,432
I'd appreciate it if you announced...

2015
01:42:48,433 --> 01:42:49,973
the player to be released first.

2016
01:42:52,603 --> 01:42:55,243
First of all, I love...

2017
01:42:55,244 --> 01:42:57,514
everyone on TEAM RHYTHM.

2018
01:42:58,914 --> 01:43:02,543
Think about shining...

2019
01:43:02,544 --> 01:43:05,852
in another team.

2020
01:43:05,853 --> 01:43:06,853
(He hopes everyone to shine in any team.)

2021
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:09,483
The player to be released is...

2022
01:43:09,884 --> 01:43:13,223
(Who will be released from TEAM RHYTHM?)

2023
01:43:13,494 --> 01:43:16,464
I really wanted to avoid this moment.

2024
01:43:17,193 --> 01:43:19,164
Hearing my name?

2025
01:43:19,464 --> 01:43:21,033
I'd hate that even in my imagination.

2026
01:43:22,603 --> 01:43:26,642
(Who will TEAM RHYTHM's director choose?)

2027
01:43:26,643 --> 01:43:28,472
Jin Ziming.

2028
01:43:28,473 --> 01:43:33,213
(Releasing Jin Ziming in 14th place)

2029
01:43:33,214 --> 01:43:34,214
Jin Ziming.

2030
01:43:36,954 --> 01:43:37,983
Jin Ziming?

2031
01:43:39,054 --> 01:43:42,083
Announce the player...

2032
01:43:42,084 --> 01:43:43,554
to be scouted from TEAM BEAT.

2033
01:43:43,823 --> 01:43:44,852
TEAM BEAT.

2034
01:43:44,853 --> 01:43:47,263
(Who is he trading with Jin Ziming?)

2035
01:43:47,264 --> 01:43:49,594
I was expecting them to scout Woong Ki.

2036
01:43:50,363 --> 01:43:52,633
If they were to take anyone,

2037
01:43:52,634 --> 01:43:54,063
it'd be someone really valuable.

2038
01:43:54,363 --> 01:43:57,473
So I was expecting Cha Woong Ki.

2039
01:43:59,304 --> 01:44:01,803
(Who is TEAM RHYTHM scouting?)

2040
01:44:01,804 --> 01:44:02,903
From TEAM BEAT,

2041
01:44:04,014 --> 01:44:06,072
Kim Dong Yun.

2042
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,613
(TEAM RHYTHM chooses Kim Dong Yun.)

2043
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:17,152
(Trading with Kim Dong Yun in 2nd place)

2044
01:44:17,153 --> 01:44:18,553
Then...

2045
01:44:18,554 --> 01:44:20,494
But you just came here.

2046
01:44:21,594 --> 01:44:24,164
When Director TEN and I watched...

2047
01:44:24,363 --> 01:44:27,134
TEAM BEAT's performance,

2048
01:44:27,464 --> 01:44:30,073
Dong Yun stood out the most.

2049
01:44:30,704 --> 01:44:32,874
So we thought about...

2050
01:44:33,603 --> 01:44:36,844
scouting him to our team.

2051
01:44:37,273 --> 01:44:39,612
Welcome to TEAM RHYTHM.

2052
01:44:39,613 --> 01:44:40,744
(Welcome to TEAM RHYTHM.)

2053
01:44:42,044 --> 01:44:45,214
Do your best. Okay?

2054
01:44:45,313 --> 01:44:47,083
Do your best.

2055
01:44:47,084 --> 01:44:48,822
Okay? Anywhere you go,

2056
01:44:48,823 --> 01:44:50,054
- do your best. - Yes.

2057
01:44:50,523 --> 01:44:51,623
- Thank you. - Good luck.

2058
01:44:51,624 --> 01:44:52,793
(TEAM BEAT's directors root for Dong Yun.)

2059
01:44:52,794 --> 01:44:54,793
- Good luck. - Thank you.

2060
01:44:54,794 --> 01:44:56,023
- Good luck. - Thank you.

2061
01:45:00,103 --> 01:45:01,563
I thought if I joined TEAM RHYTHM's starting lineup,

2062
01:45:02,264 --> 01:45:04,874
I'd improve in no time.

2063
01:45:05,273 --> 01:45:07,473
Now that I'm here,

2064
01:45:08,143 --> 01:45:10,374
I might as well do my best.

2065
01:45:11,414 --> 01:45:13,943
(Park Ju Won)

2066
01:45:14,283 --> 01:45:16,783
(Sirin)

2067
01:45:17,483 --> 01:45:19,714
(Kim Dong Yun)

2068
01:45:20,424 --> 01:45:22,822
(James, Zen Zen)

2069
01:45:22,823 --> 01:45:24,723
(TEAM BEAT starting lineup)

2070
01:45:25,353 --> 01:45:27,764
(Jin Ziming)

2071
01:45:28,624 --> 01:45:31,294
Now, I will reveal Round Three's theme.

2072
01:45:31,393 --> 01:45:33,663
What's it going to be?

2073
01:45:33,664 --> 01:45:35,733
(It's here.)

2074
01:45:37,973 --> 01:45:40,504
Out of Universe League's five stages, PRISM,

2075
01:45:40,874 --> 01:45:42,874
it's S, Seven.

2076
01:45:44,714 --> 01:45:45,773
Seven?

2077
01:45:46,884 --> 01:45:47,884
Seven?

2078
01:45:48,584 --> 01:45:51,884
In this round, the player's position doesn't matter.

2079
01:45:52,853 --> 01:45:54,553
- It doesn't matter? - Sorry?

2080
01:45:54,554 --> 01:45:55,624
It doesn't matter?

2081
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:58,893
Only the elite seven players...

2082
01:45:58,994 --> 01:46:01,164
can perform onstage.

2083
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:04,764
(Only 7 players can go onstage?)

2084
01:46:05,164 --> 01:46:06,763
The three teams...

2085
01:46:06,764 --> 01:46:08,932
will form two units each...

2086
01:46:08,933 --> 01:46:10,973
and have league matches.

2087
01:46:11,473 --> 01:46:12,933
If a player isn't chosen...

2088
01:46:13,744 --> 01:46:15,403
as the seven by the directors,

2089
01:46:15,773 --> 01:46:18,313
he might not be able to perform onstage.

2090
01:46:20,214 --> 01:46:21,282
(There's no chance if not chosen.)

2091
01:46:21,283 --> 01:46:22,344
What now?

2092
01:46:23,454 --> 01:46:24,754
Then what will the rest do?

2093
01:46:25,983 --> 01:46:27,054
Are they going home?

2094
01:46:28,783 --> 01:46:31,294
Are we eliminated if we can't perform?

2095
01:46:32,153 --> 01:46:33,994
If a player fails to perform,

2096
01:46:34,664 --> 01:46:37,563
he will get zero points for the on-site voting.

2097
01:46:38,994 --> 01:46:40,732
- How can they do this to us? - What?

2098
01:46:40,733 --> 01:46:41,804
(The rule has become crueler.)

2099
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:44,174
That's so mean.

2100
01:46:44,433 --> 01:46:46,634
In this round, as the player performs onstage,

2101
01:46:46,943 --> 01:46:50,143
he can receive individual on-site points.

2102
01:46:52,473 --> 01:46:54,113
Perform in two stages,

2103
01:46:54,714 --> 01:46:58,014
and both points will be added to the individual's score.

2104
01:46:58,983 --> 01:47:01,954
The competition within the team will finally begin.

2105
01:47:02,054 --> 01:47:03,693
My wish is for the director...

2106
01:47:04,153 --> 01:47:07,124
to use me in at least one song.

2107
01:47:07,664 --> 01:47:09,723
If I don't suit the performance,

2108
01:47:09,823 --> 01:47:12,264
I might not be able to get onstage.

2109
01:47:12,363 --> 01:47:14,204
I got worried.

2110
01:47:15,563 --> 01:47:16,833
(Smiling)

2111
01:47:16,834 --> 01:47:18,834
I'm not scared of anyone.

2112
01:47:19,903 --> 01:47:23,103
I will perform on both stages...

2113
01:47:23,273 --> 01:47:26,273
and earn all points.

2114
01:47:26,744 --> 01:47:29,783
Directors. To win Round Three,

2115
01:47:30,143 --> 01:47:32,352
form the strongest lineup.

2116
01:47:32,353 --> 01:47:33,584
(The directors must form the strongest unit to win.)

2117
01:47:34,223 --> 01:47:37,293
Which players will be able to perform onstage?

2118
01:47:37,294 --> 01:47:40,223
(Who will become the 7 elite players?)

2119
01:47:42,594 --> 01:47:44,634
(To choose the 7 elite players)

2120
01:47:45,363 --> 01:47:49,204
(A cruel decision)

2121
01:47:49,504 --> 01:47:52,033
(The competitiveness has made the directors more cool-headed.)

2122
01:47:52,473 --> 01:47:54,573
(We can't have regrets anymore.)

2123
01:47:55,143 --> 01:47:57,714
(Did you loosen up after winning the two trivial performances?)

2124
01:47:57,943 --> 01:48:00,173
(You should be ashamed.)

2125
01:48:00,174 --> 01:48:01,414
If you want to be greedy...

2126
01:48:01,943 --> 01:48:04,884
(Prove yourself if you want to perform onstage.)

2127
01:48:05,754 --> 01:48:08,624
(The survival match is closing in on the players.)

2128
01:48:09,124 --> 01:48:10,994
(This is too tough.)

2129
01:48:11,594 --> 01:48:14,223
(Tears roll down the players' faces as they try to survive.)

2130
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:18,533
(Who will be the 7 elite players to perform onstage?)

2131
01:48:20,464 --> 01:48:23,603
As I'm someone with no emotions...

2132
01:48:31,073 --> 01:48:32,173
