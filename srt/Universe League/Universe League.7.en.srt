1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,433
(Universe League opens.)

2
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:06,102
Solely to debut...

3
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:08,773
(Universe League had two league matches.)

4
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:11,511
(Round 1: Represent)

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,342
(Represent, Match Theme: Director's Hit Song)

6
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:16,983
(The three teams competed with the directors' hit songs.)

7
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,211
(The match was fierce, )

8
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:21,723
(with the directors' and players' pride on the line.)

9
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:24,852
(Announcing the final ranking of Round 1)

10
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:27,961
(RHYTHM, Final score: 2,257, GROOVE, Final score: 2,353)

11
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:29,793
(BEAT, Final score: 1,945)

12
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:32,232
(TEAM GROOVE is in 1st place after Round 1.)

13
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:35,002
(Round 2: Intercept)

14
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:36,363
Intercept.

15
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,901
(To defend or to intercept)

16
00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:40,902
(A showdown between the starting lineup and bench)

17
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:42,743
(Announcing the final ranking of Round 2)

18
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:47,243
(TEAM GROOVE is in 1st place again after Round 2.)

19
00:00:47,473 --> 00:00:48,511
Congratulations.

20
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:50,012
(TEAM GROOVE won both matches.)

21
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:51,511
(We're in 1st place.)

22
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:52,881
(It made me so happy.)

23
00:00:52,882 --> 00:00:54,152
(I was in total bliss.)

24
00:00:54,412 --> 00:00:57,423
(With 2 yellow cards, 5 players got eliminated from TEAM BEAT.)

25
00:00:57,783 --> 00:00:59,622
They are eliminated.

26
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:04,662
(Bidding farewell to the players they've put in the work with)

27
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:07,162
(Why is it always TEAM BEAT facing hardship?)

28
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,802
(Losing 1st place again right before their eyes)

29
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:14,542
(Gosh. Again?)

30
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:16,802
(TEAM RHYTHM can't beat TEAM GROOVE.)

31
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,712
(I was furious.)

32
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,212
(The final league match, Round 3)

33
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,783
(There's nowhere to back out now.)

34
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:27,153
(Every player wants their team to win.)

35
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:30,552
(Which team will wrap up Round 3 with a victory?)

36
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:33,153
(We will get 1st place no matter what.)

(Closes Saturday, January 11, 2025, at 11:59pm)

54
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:26,213
Boys' dream match, Universe League.

55
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:27,942
Are you ready?

56
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:35,921
The performances for Round Two are over.

57
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,722
I will now reveal the theme of Round Three.

58
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,023
(Revealing the theme of Round 3)

59
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:45,433
Out of the five stages of Universe League's PRISM,

60
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:47,833
it's "S." Seven.

61
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:50,463
Seven?

62
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:52,572
Seven?

63
00:02:53,303 --> 00:02:54,502
In this round, it doesn't matter...

64
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:56,702
if you're in the starting lineup or on the bench.

65
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:58,512
What? It doesn't matter?

66
00:02:58,873 --> 00:03:00,113
- Sorry? - "It doesn't matter?"

67
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,682
Only the seven elite players...

68
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,912
can perform onstage.

69
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,213
What?

70
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:11,592
Each team is to form two units...

71
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:14,023
and carry out the league match.

72
00:03:14,292 --> 00:03:18,631
If a player is not chosen as 1 of the 7 by the director,

73
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,403
he may not be able to perform onstage.

74
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:24,101
(The player can't perform in Round 3.)

75
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:25,172
For real?

76
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:27,802
What will the rest do?

77
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:28,803
(The players not chosen)

78
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:29,843
Are they going home?

79
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:34,243
Is the player eliminated if they can't perform?

80
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,942
The player who doesn't perform...

81
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:40,583
will get zero points for the on-site voting.

82
00:03:41,852 --> 00:03:43,652
- What then? - What?

83
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:44,813
(The rule is now more cruel.)

84
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,093
That's so mean.

85
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,821
In this round, the player can get...

86
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,993
as many individual on-site points as they perform.

87
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,162
Perform two stages,

88
00:03:57,463 --> 00:04:01,003
and both points will be added to the individual score.

89
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,572
Goodness.

90
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:06,641
Directors. Form the best lineup...

91
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:09,011
in order to win Round Three.

92
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,111
(The directors must form the best unit to win.)

93
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,982
I dearly hope the director...

94
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:15,421
puts me in at least one song.

95
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,851
All I could think was, "Please pick me."

96
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:20,522
I may not be able to perform.

97
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:22,593
It got me worried a bit.

98
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,392
I will perform both stages...

99
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:29,533
and gain all the points.

100
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:34,232
(It's dead silent in the locker room after the rule is revealed.)

101
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:38,172
(The players look extremely nervous.)

102
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:42,442
- Hi. - Hi.

103
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:45,552
- Hi. - Hi.

104
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,882
- Hi. - Hi.

105
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:50,482
(The directors are nervous as well.)

106
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:54,351
As you already know,

107
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:57,092
the starting lineup and bench mean nothing now.

108
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:58,393
- Right. - Yes.

109
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:01,402
- It's now an individual match. - An individual match.

110
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:02,462
(The players must compete within the team.)

111
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:05,072
Although you are in TEAM RHYTHM,

112
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:08,472
it's time to think about yourself now.

113
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:09,802
- Yes. - Yes.

114
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:15,443
(Meanwhile, TEAM BEAT's locker room had eliminated players.)

115
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:17,583
As much...

116
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,852
- as we've cried... - Yes?

117
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:22,822
We should think about those players,

118
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,851
not give up, and prepare with all we've got.

119
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:27,453
- Yes. - Yes.

120
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:31,763
Great work. You all did a wonderful job.

121
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:34,932
It was amazing.

122
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:39,973
Until now, we've sailed smoothly.

123
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,072
But from Round Three,

124
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,541
I must choose players...

125
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,842
- who suit the song. - Right.

126
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:48,981
(Tense)

127
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,242
- Yes. - Yes.

128
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:53,852
I've already made the decision.

129
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,882
(The Elite 7 is finally announced.)

130
00:05:57,883 --> 00:06:01,463
Of course, some players aren't in either song.

131
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:07,062
Some players are in both songs.

132
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:11,061
And some players are in just one song.

133
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:12,133
- Okay. - Okay.

134
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,742
I'm aware that each and every one of you is important.

135
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,411
But as we're a team,

136
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,442
(The team's victory is more crucial.)

137
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:21,481
the team...

138
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22,981
(An unavoidable decision for the team's victory)

139
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,912
- must succeed. Okay? - Yes.

140
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,752
(They must win by forming the Elite 7.)

141
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:32,491
To prepare for Round 3, we've prepared 2 songs.

142
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:36,192
After listening to the songs, we'll announce...

143
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,692
which players will perform which song.

144
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,161
- Okay. - Okay.

145
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:42,501
The first song is "Roller Coaster."

146
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,132
- "Roller Coaster?" - "Roller Coaster."

147
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,203
(Roller coaster)

148
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:47,872
- Totally. - Yes.

149
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:49,973
Okay, let's listen to it.

150
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:52,342
("Roller Coaster:" A synth-pop song...)

151
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:53,611
(with a catchy chorus, comparing the mix...)

152
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:55,652
(of excitement and nervousness to a roller coaster)

153
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,251
(A bright and cute vibe TEAM RHYTHM hasn't shown before)

154
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,481
I love it.

155
00:07:02,482 --> 00:07:03,552
Me too.

156
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:05,622
(Daisuke loves it.)

157
00:07:11,393 --> 00:07:12,991
(It's right up Zhang Shuaibo's alley.)

158
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:13,992
It's nice.

159
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:19,171
(Even the ending is cute.)

160
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,671
- It's great. - It's great.

161
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:21,703
I love it.

162
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,972
"Roller Coaster" is a really different one,

163
00:07:25,973 --> 00:07:27,772
so I'm really excited.

164
00:07:27,773 --> 00:07:30,883
I'm really looking forward to doing it.

165
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:35,223
Who wants to perform this song?

166
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,322
- What? - Everyone wants to do it.

167
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,323
Everyone?

168
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,051
(The players are charmed by the cute concept.)

169
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:43,523
All right. We'll play the next song right away.

170
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:44,622
Okay.

171
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:47,162
The title of the next song is "Don't Hit The Brakes."

172
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:49,501
- I see. - "Don't Hit The Brakes."

173
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,703
Shall we listen to it?

174
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,073
(The 2nd new song starts with a strong intro.)

175
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,772
("Don't Hit The Brakes:" A song with a thrilling beat...)

176
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:57,801
(and heavy bass sounds, )

177
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:59,812
(highlighted by energetic chanting in the chorus)

178
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,742
Gosh, that's cool.

179
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,282
- I like this song more. - Same here.

180
00:08:05,283 --> 00:08:08,482
(The players are overpowered by the vibe different from the 1st song.)

181
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:12,193
(Totally captivated)

182
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:18,593
I could instantly imagine my voice in the rap part.

183
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,702
Dancing to this song would be cool,

184
00:08:21,703 --> 00:08:23,332
so I wanted to do it.

185
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,902
Who wants to perform this song?

186
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:25,903
- Me! - Me!

187
00:08:25,903 --> 00:08:26,903
Everyone again?

188
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:28,301
It's everyone again. Okay.

189
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:30,802
But be honest.

190
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,842
The two songs are very different, right?

191
00:08:32,843 --> 00:08:33,943
- Yes. - Like the vibe.

192
00:08:34,372 --> 00:08:36,542
We've selected...

193
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:40,282
the players for "Roller Coaster" first.

194
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,922
(Which 7 players will perform in UNIT 1?)

195
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:48,121
- I will now announce the names. - Great.

196
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,492
Can I? Okay.

197
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:52,491
If the concept or style doesn't suit me,

198
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,933
I might not be able to perform.

199
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,663
I felt anxious.

200
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,203
The first player.

201
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:00,803
JL.

202
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,501
Thank you.

203
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,572
(RHYTHM UNIT 1: JL)

204
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:08,881
- Daisuke. - What? Thank you.

205
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,511
(RHYTHM UNIT 1: JL, Daisuke)

206
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:14,751
- Next is Ayumu. - Thank you.

207
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:17,651
(RHYTHM UNIT 1: JL, Daisuke, Ayumu)

208
00:09:17,652 --> 00:09:20,052
- Xie Yuxin. - Thank you.

209
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:24,261
(RHYTHM UNIT 1: JL, Daisuke, Ayumu, Xie Yuxin)

210
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:25,262
Kim Dong Yun.

211
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:28,333
Thank you. I'll do my best.

212
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,232
Next is Mac.

213
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,631
Thank you.

214
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:38,372
(Only 1 spot is left in UNIT 1's Elite 7.)

215
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:42,112
I was nervous, thinking I might not get chosen.

216
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,742
My heart was starting to pound.

217
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,622
- Next is Chih En. - Thank you.

218
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,352
Thank you.

219
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:53,521
Chih En is good.

220
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:56,063
(Steven and Zhang Shuaibo weren't called.)

221
00:09:57,593 --> 00:09:58,963
I wasn't happy.

222
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:03,261
(Becoming more anxious in fear they might not perform)

223
00:10:03,262 --> 00:10:07,731
We've chosen the seven players.

224
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:11,202
- We'll call out the names. - The names.

225
00:10:11,203 --> 00:10:12,512
Can I? Okay.

226
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,242
I was praying my name would be called.

227
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:17,082
The first player.

228
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,611
(Who is the 1st player of UNIT 2?)

229
00:10:19,612 --> 00:10:20,713
The first player.

230
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,152
JL.

231
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,222
Thank you.

232
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:26,293
(RHYTHM UNIT 2: JL)

233
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:29,193
(JL is performing in both units.)

234
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,163
- Ayumu. - Okay.

235
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,963
(Ayumu is also in both Elite 7s.)

236
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:40,802
Next is Zen Zen.

237
00:10:40,803 --> 00:10:43,043
(RHYTHM UNIT 2: JL, Ayumu, Zen Zen)

238
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:44,401
Zen Zen.

239
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:48,642
(The starting lineup's names are still not being called.)

240
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:50,913
- Eito. - Yes, thank you.

241
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,381
Nice.

242
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:55,452
(RHYTHM UNIT 2: JL, Ayumu, Zen Zen, Eito)

243
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:56,453
Li Zhinuo.

244
00:10:56,454 --> 00:11:00,392
(RHYTHM UNIT 2: JL, Ayumu, Zen Zen, Eito, Li Zhinuo)

245
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,032
Steven.

246
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:07,663
Thank you.

247
00:11:07,664 --> 00:11:10,163
(RHYTHM UNIT 2: JL, Ayumu, Zen Zen, Eito, Li Zhinuo, Steven)

248
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:12,573
And the last player is...

249
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:16,241
(Who is the last player to perform?)

250
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,673
And the last player is Kim Dong Yun.

251
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:21,073
Thank you. I'll do my best.

252
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,012
Dong Yun is good too.

253
00:11:24,112 --> 00:11:27,812
(Zhang Shuaibo is the only starting lineup not in the Elite 7.)

254
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:31,252
It was an unexpected result.

255
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:34,093
I thought I would definitely get chosen.

256
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:38,022
Three players have not been called, right?

257
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,361
- Can you raise your hand? - Yes.

258
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:42,802
(The three players unable to perform)

259
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:43,901
(Hiroto, James, and Zhang Shuaibo)

260
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:46,272
We have reasons for our decision.

261
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:51,573
As for Zhang Shuaibo,

262
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,942
you've done many powerful...

263
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:55,213
and sexy performances.

264
00:11:56,343 --> 00:11:58,912
(Zhang Shuaibo showed off his sexiness and charms...)

265
00:11:58,913 --> 00:12:01,252
(in the previous performances.)

266
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,652
From what we saw, these two songs...

267
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:10,521
didn't really suit you.

268
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,292
With the image you have,

269
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:17,832
we think a sexy and sticky song suits you most.

270
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,601
The two songs we have are far from that.

271
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:22,002
(A decision made as the two songs' concepts don't suit him.)

272
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,203
At that moment, my mind went blank.

273
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:28,242
Even when the director told me the reason,

274
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,512
it was...

275
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,982
a result I didn't expect.

276
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:39,792
The reasons are the same for the other players as well.

277
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:43,293
But the players are not fixed yet.

278
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:46,693
While practicing for two weeks,

279
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:48,391
(The Elite 7 can change.)

280
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,332
the player list can change.

281
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,432
If you want to perform in both songs,

282
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,001
- practice both of them. - Okay.

283
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,973
This isn't the final list.

284
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:59,813
You must overcome your limit.

285
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,572
- Okay. - You get it, right?

286
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,583
So...

287
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:06,482
So what I think is that I can do both.

288
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:10,582
The chance was given to me. I will do my best,

289
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:15,093
make it mine, and show a different side of me.

290
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,562
I will devote my effort and time...

291
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:23,663
and go for both songs.

292
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:29,302
Now then, I'll play the first song.

293
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:31,001
(Revealing the new song of TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 1)

294
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:32,712
- I'm excited. - Give me a second.

295
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:35,842
It's a song I prepared to put...

296
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:38,652
the vibe of GROOVE into reverse.

297
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:47,151
(TEAM GROOVE has expressed a tough, masculine beauty through "Prison.")

298
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:49,891
It's a song I prepared to put the vibe of GROOVE into reverse.

299
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:50,991
(TEAM GROOVE's new song excites the players.)

300
00:13:50,992 --> 00:13:53,892
The title is "Only U."

301
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:55,531
- Gosh. - "Only U?"

302
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:56,703
- I'm you. - I'm you.

303
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,231
- "Only U." - "Only U."

304
00:13:58,232 --> 00:13:59,232
"Only you."

305
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,031
I'll play it.

306
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:04,102
(What's the unexpected charm of "Only U?")

307
00:14:05,813 --> 00:14:07,173
(Amazed)

308
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,511
("Only U:" A song with lyrics capturing the pure feeling...)

309
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:11,952
(of wanting to confess falling in love at first sight, )

310
00:14:11,953 --> 00:14:13,281
(featuring vocal synths and refreshing beats...)

311
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:14,482
(that stand out in the chorus)

312
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:18,121
This is it. I love it.

313
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:19,923
(The new song has a mellow charm.)

314
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,823
The moment I heard the song, I thought,

315
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:24,991
"I want to do this song."

316
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,063
"I can pull it off really well."

317
00:14:27,463 --> 00:14:29,602
"This song suits me. It's my song."

318
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,472
It screams Park Han.

319
00:14:35,473 --> 00:14:36,703
The song is really nice.

320
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,073
As I performed songs that felt quite heavy,

321
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:42,843
I wanted a song I could sing while smiling.

322
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:47,912
(Everyone is charmed by the bright and sweet vibe of "Only U.")

323
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,652
This song is crazy.

324
00:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,351
Gosh. It'll make a hit.

325
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:53,872
(Everyone is charmed by the bright and sweet vibe of "Only U.")

326
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:56,592
I want to do this song.

327
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:59,492
- Same here. - I love this song.

328
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,703
(Only you)

329
00:15:04,032 --> 00:15:05,032
(Even the ending was perfect.)

330
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:06,433
- It's okay. - Goodness.

331
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,532
The song is for you.

332
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,443
Isn't the last part for Kenta?

333
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:11,242
"Only you."

334
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:13,112
That's how the song goes.

335
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:17,412
The second song is "Butterfly."

336
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:19,212
- "Butterfly." - Nice.

337
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:20,213
It's another hit.

338
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:21,851
I'll play it right away.

339
00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:22,852
- Okay. - Okay.

340
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:26,752
- What? - Gosh.

341
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:27,792
("Butterfly:" A song featuring...)

342
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,991
(a refreshing and upbeat acoustic guitar sound, )

343
00:15:28,992 --> 00:15:30,491
(a well-structured development, and delicate melodic vocals)

344
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:32,193
- The chord is amazing. - I want to do it.

345
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,002
It's a song that can nail the refreshing vibe.

346
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:43,203
I could pull the song off.

347
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,573
"Butterfly" is a perfect match for me.

348
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,683
- Okay. - Please.

349
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:53,813
In all respects, this is simply to win as a team.

350
00:15:54,012 --> 00:15:56,521
The players I've chosen...

351
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,252
are those I think are the strongest strategically.

352
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:01,722
That's how I formed the units.

353
00:16:01,723 --> 00:16:02,723
- Okay. - Okay.

354
00:16:02,724 --> 00:16:06,562
All right. The first song, "Only U."

355
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:08,933
(Revealing the Elite 7 for "Only U")

356
00:16:09,232 --> 00:16:13,271
As I believe "Only U" suits me well,

357
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,632
I want to perform that song.

358
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:17,872
I wanted him to call out my name.

359
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:21,043
I had my hopes up.

- but also for your teammates. - Yes.

I couldn't afford to lose this opportunity.

426

00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,591
- We have the smallest team. - Right.

428
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,362
We talked about it, and...

429
00:18:56,363 --> 00:18:57,561
(How will the directors divide the 9 players into units?)

430
00:18:57,562 --> 00:18:58,603
Well,

431
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:01,873
the songs will be performed by the starting lineup.

432
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:04,241
(The directors will only have the starting lineup perform.)

433
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:07,242
The seven of them will take on...

434
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:09,012
- the songs first. - Okay.

435
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:11,982
There are only nine of us left on the team,

436
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,883
so how could they split us into 2 groups of 7?

437
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,462
It could be done. We had to make it work.

438
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,723
For the team and myself,

439
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:23,923
it only seemed right for me to perform both songs.

440
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:25,633
That being said,

441
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,433
we have brought you new songs.

442
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:31,231
They were written by EL CAPITXN,

443
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:34,103
- and they're both incredible. - My gosh.

444
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,703
What's the title of the first song?

445
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:39,012
The first song...

446
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,242
- is "My, My, My." - What?

447
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:42,643
My, my, my

448
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,282
That's the song.

449
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,353
I spiced it up with some Latin flavor.

450
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:52,123
It's a mixture of Latin music, hip-hop, and dance.

451
00:19:52,322 --> 00:19:54,092
- My gosh. - Let's listen to it.

452
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,722
("My, My, My:" This song about being infatuated...)

453
00:19:57,723 --> 00:19:59,231
(with someone sexy and mesmerizing...)

454
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,991
(compares a risky yet thrilling love to one's journey through a maze...)

455
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,103
(as the song expresses one's relentless chase.)

456
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:09,502
(Falling in love with Latin music)

457
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:11,942
I was waiting for a song...

458
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,743
that would allow me to perform in such a way.

459
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:17,581
Whether it's Jiang Fan, JL, or Kyung Ho,

460
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:20,413
I knew I could do just as well as them...

461
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,453
this time around.

462
00:20:24,982 --> 00:20:26,153
Nice.

463
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:31,662
You can already picture yourselves...

464
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,893

00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:38,332
(Let me in on it.)

466
00:20:38,532 --> 00:20:39,532
Something like that.

468
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:48,372
(EL CAPITXN's songs never disappoint.)

469
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,442
- That's incredible. - No way.

470
00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:53,382
The overall concept of this song...

471
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:54,482
has to be sexy.

472
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:58,953
You need to be a captivating man.

473
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:01,021
- Right. - Can I unbutton my jersey?

474
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,463
- Well... - Rip our pants more.

475
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,732
- Later. During practice. - Got it.

476
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:07,693
Let's listen to the next song.

477
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:09,301
(Excited and curious)

478
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,862
The next song is called "On and On."

479
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,832
I'm already loving the vibe it's giving off. LV!

480
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,042
- "LV?" - What's LV?

481
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:19,742
The song requires powerful vocals,

482
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:22,042
solid dancing,

483
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:23,682
and rap.

484
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,281
It's really on and on, right?

485

("On and On" requires a harmony of skills.)

486
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:28,953
- On and on. - There's finally a rap section.

487
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:31,252
- Finally. - There's a rap.

488

(The smile of a parent)

496
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,302
The song was designed to put on a performance,

497
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:55,213
and that's something I know I can do.

498
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:59,153
"On and On" was totally up my alley.

502
00:22:10,393 --> 00:22:11,561
That was incredible.

504
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,432
- Yes! - Yes!

505
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:17,513
- I'm loving that vibe. - It's focused on the dance.

506
00:22:17,832 --> 00:22:20,301
For this song, you'll have to dance...

507
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:22,102
- like there's no tomorrow. - Right.

508
00:22:22,103 --> 00:22:23,203
- Do you get it? - Yes.

509
00:22:25,203 --> 00:22:26,242
My life depends on this.

510
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,482
I'll be working on this like it's the last thing I do.

511
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:33,113
It wasn't about wanting to win anymore.

512
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:34,653
I was going to win.

I was given the opportunity,

516
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,732
so I was going to do my best to make this my own.

517
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:50,579
I only thought about how I couldn't afford to lose this opportunity.

518
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,732
Chang Sub gave me this section for a reason.

519
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:56,143
I'll do my best not to disappoint them.

00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:11,223
That's what I wanted to prove.

I want to show Director Lee Chang Sub...

524
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,152
that he was wrong.

525
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:16,623
Director Lee, you were wrong.

526

00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:48,123
(Nervous)

537
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:54,762
- Hello. - Hi.

538
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:57,331
- Hi, guys. - Hi.

539
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:58,463
It's been a while.

540
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:03,842
All right. First, I'm calling the seven that are performing...

541
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:07,242
- "Only U." - Okay.

542
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,071
- The seven of you, step forward. - Got it.

543
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,341
(Ju Won, Jeong Woo, Han, Hee Jun, Kenta, Junjin, Gangdong)

544
00:24:10,342 --> 00:24:11,342
Get ready.

545
00:24:11,643 --> 00:24:14,683
(Checking the performance of "Only U")

546
00:24:15,082 --> 00:24:18,152
(They get ready while tensions run high onstage.)

547
00:24:18,153 --> 00:24:20,393
- I'm nervous to the core. - This is nerve-racking.

548
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:23,562
Only you

549
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:28,392
(The intro begins with Park Han's refreshing vocals.)

550
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:29,502
Only you

551
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:33,272
You're the one I wanted

552
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:36,272
Share the vibe, you feel it too, then it's all right

553
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:40,372
(Park Ju Won's shaky voice)

554
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:43,042
What should I do? I'm clueless

555
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:47,052
Only you

556
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,281
The one I dreamed of

557
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:53,123
(He lacks confidence on the high notes.)

558
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,423
(Well...)

559
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:58,423
For me, it's only you

560
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:00,133
Only you

561
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:05,262
Okay.

562
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:17,242
(Silence falls in the auditorium after their performance.)

563
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,883
Sing "Only you" for me.

564
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:27,492
Only you

565
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:29,332
Place a finger here as you sing.

566
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,423
Only you

567
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:35,762
Jeong Woo, I see the notes are too high for you.

568
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,732
Yes, they're a bit too high.

569
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,502
I could tell I was in danger.

570
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,972
(He checks on Park Ju Won next.)

571
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,011
Sing that for me.

572
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:52,011
As our eyes meet

573
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:56,153
(Park Ju Won is off-key.)

574
00:25:56,482 --> 00:25:58,153
As our eyes

575
00:25:58,552 --> 00:25:59,953
As our eyes

576
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:02,193
You can't hit that note.

577
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:07,832
My vocals were my weak point,

578
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,663
so I worked hard...

579
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:13,933
to make it my strength.

580
00:26:14,403 --> 00:26:16,071
However, I wasn't able...

581
00:26:16,072 --> 00:26:18,373
to show him the work I had put in.

582
00:26:19,072 --> 00:26:21,041
- Why don't you get up onstage? - Sure.

583
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:23,242
(Those aiming for a spot come up onstage to be tested.)

584
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:26,782
(Anxious and nervous)

585
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:28,482
Okay.

586
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:30,733
- Han Seo, step forward. - Okay.

587
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,292
(Koo Han Seo is the first to take on the challenge.)

588
00:26:35,492 --> 00:26:37,392
(Nervous)

589
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:38,463
Let's go.

590
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:44,001
(Koo Han Seo confidently performs the rap section.)

591
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,301
I'm sorry for being shy

592
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:48,772
- Okay. - Thank you.

593
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,372
- Gi Joong - Here.

594
00:26:54,373 --> 00:26:57,012
(Next up is Kim Gi Joong.)

595
00:26:58,143 --> 00:26:59,382
I wanted to be acknowledged.

596
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:02,953
Rather than being acknowledged, I wanted to prove myself.

597
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,893
Only you

598
00:27:10,393 --> 00:27:13,732
The one I dreamed of

599
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:18,261
(Focused)

600
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:22,002
As our eyes meet for 0.5 seconds

601
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:27,873
(They worry about losing their spot to someone else.)

602
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:30,742
- Okay. - Thank you.

603
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,922
- Joo Hyoung. - Here.

604
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,752
(Next up is Kim Joo Hyoung.)

605
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:42,863
(Nervous)

606
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:51,163
Only you, the one I dreamed of

607
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:53,772
Every, every, everything

608
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:57,642
Every, every, everything is you

609
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:58,672
Relax a little.

610
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:00,213
Only you

611
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,782
(Being nervous, he was too tense while singing.)

612
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,652
Always, it's you

613
00:28:06,653 --> 00:28:09,482
Always, it's you

614
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:12,423
- Okay. - Thank you.

615
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:18,722
I wasn't satisfied...

616
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:22,633
because I thought I hadn't done well.

617
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:25,532
Do you practice...

618
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,231
breathing for singing?

619
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,473
- Yes. - Yes.

620
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:31,802
It doesn't sound that way.

621
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:37,582
If you want to be greedy,

622
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:39,752
prove yourself.

623
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:43,781
What were you trying to prove with your performance just now?

624
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:47,752
(What were you trying to prove with your performance just now?)

625
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:50,592
Are you slacking off...

626
00:28:51,393 --> 00:28:53,363
- because you already won twice? - No.

627
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:54,761
- No. - No.

628
00:28:54,762 --> 00:28:57,433
Have the two small victories gone to your head already?

629
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:01,732
(He criticizes them harshly for their lack of practice.)

630
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:04,002
We won't be able to win.

631
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:06,362
Not with you performing like that.

632
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:10,041
I worked hard,

633
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,042
but none of that showed,

634
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:14,551
which means I should've worked harder.

635
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:18,383
It hit me that I could be thrown out of this unit.

636
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:21,092
I was angry with myself.

637
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,522
How should I put it? I guess I was disappointed.

638
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:29,732
I worked hard so that I could prove to Director Lee...

639
00:29:30,032 --> 00:29:32,232
that he made a mistake not choosing me.

640
00:29:34,203 --> 00:29:36,402
Team "Only U," take the stage.

641
00:29:36,403 --> 00:29:38,241
(After much consideration, )

642
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,713
(Director Lee Chang Sub calls Team "Only U" to the stage.)

643
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,522
Only one member on Team "Only U" will be swapped out.

644
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:53,953
Just one.

645
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:56,992
(Who will be swapped out of Team "Only U?")

646
00:29:57,737 --> 00:29:58,807
Jeong Woo.

647
00:29:58,808 --> 00:30:01,578
(Seo Jeong Woo will not get to perform "Only U.")

648
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:04,548
What you lacked...

649
00:30:05,818 --> 00:30:07,447
couldn't stay hidden in this song,

650
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:09,717
even after you got to sing different sections.

651
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:12,427
- Right. - That's why I'm swapping you out.

652
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:16,727
- Jeong Woo, step down. - Okay.

653
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:20,497
(Seo Jeong Woo leaves the stage as he'll not be drafted.)

654
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:27,006
(Now that Jeong Woo was cut from the unit, )

655
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:31,338
(the others have a chance to fill his slot.)

656
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:33,407
(Han Seo, )

657
00:30:33,408 --> 00:30:34,447
(get up there.)

658
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:37,048
- Han Seo, get up there. - Me?

659
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:44,858
(Team "Only U" swaps Seo Jeong Woo for Koo Han Seo.)

660
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:46,986
Han Seo will perform "Only U" instead.

661
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:49,397
This is the team that'll perform "Only U."

662
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:50,996
- That's final. - Okay.

663
00:30:50,997 --> 00:30:52,797
You might be given different sections though.

664
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:56,067
Work like your life depends on it.

665
00:30:56,068 --> 00:30:57,637
- Got it. - Absolutely.

666
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:59,467
- I'll work hard. - Okay.

667
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,638
(Their fates change at the final draft for TEAM GROOVE.)

668
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:07,206
Have you been well?

669
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:08,447
- Yes. - Yes.

670
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:10,378
I hope...

671
00:31:10,717 --> 00:31:12,986
that you can show us the hard work you put in.

672
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:14,087
- Okay. - Okay.

673
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:15,786
Okay. First, let's see...

674
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:17,187
"My, My, My."

675
00:31:17,818 --> 00:31:19,358
- Okay. - Go, team!

676
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,397
(The song begins with Woong Ki...)

677
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:27,898
(who holds the center position of the group.)

678
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:30,966
All day, your scent lingers

679
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:34,308
(Hyo Tae's pitch and breathing are unstable.)

680
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:37,477
You got me so hot like summer

681
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:42,817
(His unexpected gaze)

682
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,677
(I like that.)

683
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,418
I actually prefer this.

684
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,328
- Thank you. - It was way better.

685
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:56,996
Jin Ziming and Li Zhiwei.

686
00:31:56,997 --> 00:31:58,527
- Yes? - Let's see you perform.

687
00:32:00,068 --> 00:32:02,496
My goal today...

688
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:05,267
is to be chosen as 1 of the Elite 7.

689
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:08,368
I knew I could do it.

690
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:11,808
Members of TEAM BEAT, watch out.

691
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:13,648
I will get this song.

692
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:20,087
(Li Zhiwei is up first.)

693
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:22,717
You can't fool me

694
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:26,357
(Nervous)

695
00:32:26,358 --> 00:32:30,398
Pull it, keep it up, keep it up, louder

696
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:33,568
Risk everything for me

697
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:37,466
(Li Zhiwei practiced the song by giving it his all.)

698
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:38,568
Thank you.

699
00:32:38,898 --> 00:32:40,408
- Good job. - Thanks.

700
00:32:41,037 --> 00:32:44,706
(Next up is Jin Ziming.)

701
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:47,378
My, my, my

702
00:32:47,677 --> 00:32:51,617
I got dumb, chasing frantically and endlessly

703
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:54,118
Pull it, keep it up, keep it up, louder

704
00:32:55,747 --> 00:33:01,128
(Doing his best)

705
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:03,798
(Focused)

706
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,068
Catch and hide it

707
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:11,096
(Jin Ziming did his best to let them see his work.)

708
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:12,168
Thank you.

709
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:15,437
Good job.

710
00:33:16,437 --> 00:33:18,637
EL CAPITXN and I...

711
00:33:19,178 --> 00:33:22,246
will talk it over and decide on the Elite Seven.

712
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:23,247
Good job, guys.

713
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:25,177
- Thank you. - Thank you.

714
00:33:25,178 --> 00:33:29,187
(Will the 2 be able to join the Elite 7?)

715
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:33,358
(The two directors are contemplating.)

716
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,996
(They must decide wisely...)

717
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,726
(since the team's fate depends on their choice.)

718
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,028
Right. Well...

719
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:44,168
To be honest, in terms of their singing tones,

720
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:47,108
the two are not too bad.

721
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:50,337
- However, they're a group, - Right.

722
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:53,447
Which means the members must dance in unison.

723
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,218
Shall we go with these seven, then?

724
00:33:56,517 --> 00:34:00,187
(Who will be the Elite 7 performing "My, My, My?")

725
00:34:01,448 --> 00:34:04,656
EL CAPITXN and I talked it over.

726
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:05,657
(The directors are done discussing.)

727
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:07,186
- Okay. - But...

728
00:34:07,187 --> 00:34:08,258
(Nervous)

729
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:09,858
To be honest,

730
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,367
- Li Zhiwei and Jin Ziming... - Yes?

731
00:34:15,198 --> 00:34:18,568
Your singing was stabler than Hyo Tae's singing.

732
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:21,667
That's what we had to consider.

733
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:24,738
However, your performance as a team...

734
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:27,548
is just as important.

735
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:31,148
That includes being harmonious.

736
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:35,217
Since Do Yoon and Hyo Tae...

737
00:34:35,218 --> 00:34:37,588
fit the team better,

738
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:42,157
we agreed to stick with the starting lineup.

739
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,157
- Sure. - Got it.

740
00:34:44,727 --> 00:34:45,727
Thank you.

741
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:48,366
(There will be no changes to Team "My, My, My.")

742
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,668
- Hyo Tae. - Yes?

743
00:34:52,338 --> 00:34:55,068
- You're singing the final chorus. - Yes.

744
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,738
You can't afford to present...

745
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:01,178
- a shaky performance. - Okay.

746
00:35:01,878 --> 00:35:03,318
Can you sing that for us again?

747
00:35:04,178 --> 00:35:08,087
All day, your scent lingers

748
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:09,147
(He sings in a shaky voice.)

749
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,016
It sounds unstable.

750
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:13,428
- Right. - The falsetto section is also weak.

751
00:35:13,858 --> 00:35:16,227
It sounds shaky as you transition into your chest voice,

752
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:19,197
which is why we're all...

753
00:35:19,198 --> 00:35:21,496
We can only enjoy the song when there isn't any tension,

754
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:23,937
but we couldn't because of it.

755
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:28,706
Hyo Tae and Woong Ki.

756
00:35:28,707 --> 00:35:31,476
You both have a limit you have set for yourselves.

757
00:35:31,477 --> 00:35:32,807
You have drawn a line.

758
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,047
It's important for you to go beyond that.

759
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:37,777
(They must break the limit they have set for themselves.)

760
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,247
If I'm being honest,

761
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:42,648
I'm not all that satisfied.

762
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:45,157
Because of our situation...

763
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:49,186
Because we don't have better options,

764
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:51,297
the seven of you are the starting lineup.

765
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:53,197
There's something...

766
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:55,927
you must clearly be aware of.

767
00:35:55,928 --> 00:35:57,596
Don't think you're part of the starting lineup...

768
00:35:57,597 --> 00:35:58,867
because you're that good.

769
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:00,668
- Right. - Do you understand?

770
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:05,436
That's the mindset you should have during practice sessions.

771
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:06,747
- Okay. - Got it.

772
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:09,976
What I just saw was too basic.

773
00:36:09,977 --> 00:36:12,077
Anyone could perform at that level.

774
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:14,817
I believe you must analyze your traits...

775
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:17,357
and show people how unique you are.

776
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,186
(It's time to show their own charms onstage!)

777
00:36:20,187 --> 00:36:21,557
We can't have any regrets.

778
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,226
We can't have any more regrets.

779
00:36:24,227 --> 00:36:25,326
- Right. - Right.

780
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:26,327
Right?

781
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:31,698
You each have to be equipped with your own weapon...

782
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:34,837
to show what you have.

783
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:36,677
(How will TEAM BEAT solve this issue?)

784
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:37,807
- Okay. - Okay.

785
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,177
- So... - Let's start with "Roller Coaster."

786
00:36:43,178 --> 00:36:44,178
- Okay. - Okay.

787
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:45,246
- Let's go! - Let's go!

788
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:46,488
- Let's go! - Let's go!

789
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:47,588
Okay.

790
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:49,593
(The interim check for the starting lineup of "Roller Coaster")

791
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:52,217
(The 1st draft for "Roller Coaster:")

792
00:36:52,218 --> 00:36:54,928
(Chih En, Mac, Daisuke, Kim Dong Yun, Xie Yuxin, JL, Ayumu)

793
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,596
(UNIT 1's final members can change with this performance.)

794
00:36:58,597 --> 00:36:59,597
Are you all ready?

795
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:00,597
- Yes. - Yes.

796
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:01,597
Okay.

797
00:37:02,298 --> 00:37:06,237
(Looking intently)

798
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:07,838
In the pulse that's getting bigger

799
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:10,137
There's a loop that can't be stopped

800
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,738
(Looking bright)

801
00:37:13,778 --> 00:37:15,746
(Daisuke's smile disarms the directors.)

802
00:37:15,747 --> 00:37:17,777
You drive me up, 2, 1

803
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,217
You got my all

804
00:37:19,218 --> 00:37:22,787
A good feeling brushes past me

805
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,656
Make me fall

806
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:28,527
(His voice cracks while singing with unstable notes.)

807
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:31,226
Make me fall

808
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:33,367
Oh, you better change up

809
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,697
You are my roller coaster

810
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:37,766
You are unpredictable

811
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:38,797
Go up

812
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,837
I love it

813
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:40,906
And go down

814
00:37:40,907 --> 00:37:42,167
I don't know why

815
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:44,177
You are my roller coaster

816
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,137
Baby, you take me higher

817
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:49,076
(They evaluate them carefully to find the final 7 members.)

818
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:50,976
Make me tap it up

819
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,577
You wake my heart up

820
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,487
It was... Well...

821
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:59,287
(Hesitating)

822
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:01,187
(Worried)

823
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:03,428
I think...

824
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:09,838
there is a need for change with the members.

825
00:38:17,637 --> 00:38:19,608
I saw a greater possibility of me performing.

826
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:23,246
Right. I said this before as well.

827
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:27,718
The seven members still haven't been fixed.

828
00:38:28,387 --> 00:38:30,617
After seeing today's performance...

829
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:33,858
We placed second twice.

830
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,927
We have to get first place once,

831
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:41,698
but I don't think we can with this sort of performance.

832
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:46,766
So... Hold on. We'll discuss it...

833
00:38:46,767 --> 00:38:48,036
and get back to you.

834
00:38:48,037 --> 00:38:49,338
- Okay. - Okay.

835
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,948
(TEAM RHYTHM's directors get into a serious discussion.)

836
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:54,807
(Curious)

837
00:38:56,548 --> 00:39:00,787
I wasn't able to fully show them what I prepared.

838
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:04,156
I was a bit worried.

839
00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:06,033
(I was worried about getting removed from the lineup.)

840
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,227
Well...

841
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:11,297
We decided on the player that will get replaced.

842
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:13,226
(Thinking)

843
00:39:13,227 --> 00:39:16,028
I did feel really nervous.

844
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,096
I will call out the name.

845
00:39:18,097 --> 00:39:19,838
(Which player will get replaced?)

846
00:39:20,907 --> 00:39:21,907
Kim Dong Yun.

847
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:23,107
(First candidate for getting replaced: Kim Dong Yun)

848
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:24,108
Okay.

849
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,647
- Ayumu. - Yes.

850
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:31,547
(Ayumu gets called as well.)

851
00:39:31,548 --> 00:39:32,817
- Mac. - Yes.

852
00:39:32,818 --> 00:39:35,247
(Mac gets called as well.)

853
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:38,517
(The final draft is filled with nervousness.)

854
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:41,627
(Last candidate for getting replaced)

855
00:39:41,628 --> 00:39:42,858
- Xie Yuxin. - Yes.

856
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,258
Yes.

857
00:39:45,227 --> 00:39:48,068
The other three...

858
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,136
(JL, )

859
00:39:51,137 --> 00:39:54,206
(Daisuke, Chih En)

860
00:39:54,207 --> 00:39:57,137
have passed for now.

861
00:39:58,207 --> 00:40:01,807
But you still need to practice a lot more.

862
00:40:01,907 --> 00:40:05,178
- Right. Thank you. - I think you will do well...

863
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,088
if you work on the singing.

864
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:11,088
You three can come down.

865
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:12,787
Okay.

866
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:17,257
If there is anyone who wants to challenge these four,

867
00:40:17,258 --> 00:40:19,057
you can go up.

868
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:21,866
Stand behind the member you want to replace.

869
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:23,267
- Okay. - Okay.

870
00:40:24,437 --> 00:40:25,437
All right.

871
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:26,707
(Rushing out)

872
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:30,937
- Gosh. - Oh, my gosh.

873
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:36,848
(The reserves stand behind the member they want to replace.)

874
00:40:37,818 --> 00:40:42,048
Dong Yun's dancing was a bit disappointing.

875
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:46,286
I saw his performance, and he seemed to lack the skills.

876
00:40:46,287 --> 00:40:47,528
(I wanted to challenge Mac.)

877
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:52,897
It'll be better to compare the members to the challengers.

878
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:56,097
We'll see who is the better fit...

879
00:40:56,298 --> 00:40:58,096
and decide on the member once again.

880
00:40:58,097 --> 00:40:59,596
- Okay. - Then...

881
00:40:59,597 --> 00:41:02,108
we'll start with Kim Dong Yun.

882
00:41:02,608 --> 00:41:05,837
- Yes. - We'll start with that line.

883
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,847
Okay.

884
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:12,517
I thought that I had to show more of my charms...

885
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:15,187
than the ones who stood behind me.

886
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:17,687
I worked really hard,

887
00:41:18,117 --> 00:41:20,157
so I was confident.

888
00:41:21,227 --> 00:41:23,096
(Will the starting lineup position be kept...)

889
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:24,698
(or taken away?)

890
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:28,127
(The performance of the three begins.)

891
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:29,837
Countdown, ready

892
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,397
You're certainly different

893
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:35,668
I've never felt this excited

894
00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:37,706
Going to be so nice

895
00:41:37,707 --> 00:41:39,407
In the pulse that's getting bigger

896
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:41,476
There's a loop that can't be stopped

897
00:41:41,477 --> 00:41:44,177
The thrill is on you

898
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:45,878
(Working hard with his facial expressions)

899
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:48,047
Make me tap it up

900
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:49,818
You wake my heart up

901
00:41:51,187 --> 00:41:52,957
You wake my heart up

902
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:56,657
(Zhang Shuaibo showed his own gestures and facial expressions.)

903
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:59,928
(Torn)

904
00:42:01,628 --> 00:42:05,867
First of all, I liked Zhang Shuaibo's idea.

905
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:09,037
Your gestures and facial expressions...

906
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:11,907
went well with this song.

907
00:42:15,907 --> 00:42:17,076
We'll need more time.

908
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,077
Yes. We'll need more time to think about it.

909
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:21,247
Let's go with the second line.

910
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:25,017
- Let's go with the second line. - Mac's line.

911
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:29,457
(Steven and Zen Zen want to take Mac's position.)

912
00:42:29,997 --> 00:42:33,028
I wondered if this song would suit me.

913
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:36,398
But I thought it was a chance to show a new side of me,

914
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:37,968
so I felt confident.

915
00:42:41,968 --> 00:42:43,368
(Equipping himself with brightness)

916
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:46,036
Countdown, ready

917
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:48,647
You're certainly different

918
00:42:48,648 --> 00:42:51,977
I've never felt this excited

919
00:42:52,378 --> 00:42:54,087
Going to be so nice

920
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:56,016
Make me tap it up

921
00:42:56,017 --> 00:42:57,588
You wake my heart up

922
00:42:58,057 --> 00:42:59,456
(The first time Steven has revealed his bright ending pose)

923
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:01,186
The ending pose as well. Okay.

924
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:02,227
Thank you!

925
00:43:03,327 --> 00:43:06,668
We'll see everyone perform and decide later.

926
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:09,627
- Thank you. - Thank you.

927
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,174
(The second performance also ends without a decision.)

928
00:43:11,198 --> 00:43:14,306
(The last performance begins.)

929
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:15,667
You better change up

930
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:17,338
You wake my heart up

931
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:21,608
This one is hard to decide on.

932
00:43:22,907 --> 00:43:24,548
Well...

933
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:28,387
It has to be someone that gets more attention.

934
00:43:28,747 --> 00:43:31,017
The one who gets the camera points.

935
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:33,927
I think that will be more important.

936
00:43:33,928 --> 00:43:38,627
We came up with the new seven members of "Roller Coaster."

937
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:40,798
We will announce it right away.

938
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:42,398
- Okay. - Okay.

939
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:46,198
- Kim Dong Yun. I'm sorry. - Yes.

940
00:43:46,568 --> 00:43:49,168
- Please come down. - Thank you.

941
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:51,136
(Kim Dong Yun is removed.)

942
00:43:51,137 --> 00:43:54,746
And in his place...

943
00:43:54,747 --> 00:43:57,846
(The member that will replace Kim Dong Yun)

944
00:43:57,847 --> 00:44:02,448
Zhang Shuaibo, please go up.

945
00:44:02,847 --> 00:44:04,218
Thank you.

946
00:44:09,057 --> 00:44:10,697
(Scurrying)

947
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:11,698
Right.

948
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:12,727
And...

949
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:16,668
thank you, Mac. I'm sorry.

950
00:44:18,437 --> 00:44:20,036
(Mac comes down from the stage.)

951
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:21,468
And...

952
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,838
Steven, please go up.

953
00:44:24,238 --> 00:44:25,238
Thank you.

954
00:44:26,137 --> 00:44:28,107
(Striding)

955
00:44:28,108 --> 00:44:33,016
Just these two members will be replaced.

956
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:38,358
This will be the final seven for "Roller Coaster."

957
00:44:38,457 --> 00:44:39,457
Good luck!

958
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,886
- Thank you. - We will work hard.

959
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,628
- Thank you. - Steven and Zhang Shuaibo,

960
00:44:44,157 --> 00:44:45,898
you two have to work even harder.

961
00:44:45,997 --> 00:44:47,398
- Okay. - Okay.

962
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:50,697
I worked really hard to practice.

963
00:44:50,698 --> 00:44:53,237
I want to be able to do both songs.

964
00:44:53,238 --> 00:44:54,413
(I want to be able to do both songs.)

965
00:44:54,437 --> 00:44:56,537
(2 weeks later)

966
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:03,448
(The players look nervous for the final league match.)

967
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:08,748
(MC Jay Park appears to announce the start of Round 3.)

968
00:45:09,187 --> 00:45:10,318
Hello, everyone.

969
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:11,686
- Hello. - Hello.

970
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:12,687
Hello.

971
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:15,127
After Round Two,

972
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:18,156
the first elimination had occurred in Universe League.

973
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:19,996
(Eliminations from receiving 2 yellow cards)

974
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:23,898
Five players from TEAM BEAT were eliminated.

975
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:28,537
Currently, TEAM RHYTHM has four yellow cards.

976
00:45:29,907 --> 00:45:31,277
TEAM GROOVE has one yellow card.

977
00:45:31,278 --> 00:45:33,107
(TEAM GROOVE has 1 yellow card.)

978
00:45:33,108 --> 00:45:35,377
TEAM BEAT has three yellow cards.

979
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:37,378
(TEAM GROOVE has 3 yellow cards.)

980
00:45:37,577 --> 00:45:39,417
For Round Three,

981
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:42,448
yellow cards and trade tickets will be given out once again.

982
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:46,218
If you receive two yellow cards during a league match,

983
00:45:46,988 --> 00:45:48,656
you will be eliminated right away.

984
00:45:48,657 --> 00:45:51,697
(You will be eliminated right away with 2 yellow cards.)

985
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:53,197
The last league match, Round Three.

986
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:54,226
Seven.

987
00:45:54,227 --> 00:45:56,398
(The theme of the last league match)

988
00:45:56,528 --> 00:45:59,567
A battle of pride between the seven elite players...

989
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:01,108
of each team.

990
00:46:02,168 --> 00:46:05,238
From the starting lineup or bench,

991
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:08,677
the directors have come up with 2 units of 7.

992
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:09,846
(The directors have come up with 2 units of 7.)

993
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:11,418
The team ranking of this round...

994
00:46:11,948 --> 00:46:15,516
will be decided by the scores of the on-site and online votes...

995
00:46:15,517 --> 00:46:18,016
of the players that perform.

996
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:19,663
(On-site and online votes will be added to decide the winning team.)

997
00:46:19,687 --> 00:46:22,258
When a player performs twice,

998
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:24,097
that player's on-site score...

999
00:46:24,597 --> 00:46:26,657
and online score will be added...

1000
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:28,197
to the team's score twice.

1001
00:46:28,198 --> 00:46:29,558
(Their votes will be added twice.)

1002
00:46:29,698 --> 00:46:31,937
Hey, who was in first place for the previous round?

1003
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:34,167
Woong Ki was in 1st place, and JL was in 2nd place, right?

1004
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:35,537
(The total ranking)

1005
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:36,937
Everyone,

1006
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:40,108
the competition isn't over.

1007
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:43,977
With the scores of Rounds 1, 2, and 3 added,

1008
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:47,187
the final team ranking of the league match will be decided.

1009
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:51,017
With the results of Round Three, the final team ranking...

1010
00:46:51,418 --> 00:46:52,758
can be changed.

1011
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:57,357
I will now reveal the lineups of each team.

1012
00:46:57,358 --> 00:46:58,918
(Which Seven will represent each team?)

1013
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:01,867
Here's the lineup of TEAM BEAT.

1014
00:47:02,128 --> 00:47:03,366
This team was the hardest to predict.

1015
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,127
I think a lot of members will perform twice.

1016
00:47:05,637 --> 00:47:08,037
(Unlike the other teams, there are only 9 of them in total.)

1017
00:47:08,668 --> 00:47:10,377
TEAM BEAT's UNIT ONE.

1018
00:47:10,378 --> 00:47:11,706
(The 1st player of TEAM BEAT's UNIT 1)

1019
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:12,837
(Cha Woong Ki)

1020
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:13,847
Cha Woong Ki.

1021
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:16,648
(As expected)

1022
00:47:17,678 --> 00:47:18,718
Keum Jin Ho.

1023
00:47:20,948 --> 00:47:21,988
Kairi.

1024
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:23,718
They are all the expected members.

1025
00:47:25,017 --> 00:47:27,428
Yuito. Kim Hyo Tae.

1026
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,088
Nam Do Yoon.

1027
00:47:29,528 --> 00:47:30,997
And lastly, An Yul.

1028
00:47:31,827 --> 00:47:33,157
(Surprised)

1029
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:34,638
It's the whole starting lineup.

1030
00:47:36,068 --> 00:47:38,468
As we're at the edge of the cliff,

1031
00:47:38,668 --> 00:47:41,136
we thought that we had to come up with a lineup...

1032
00:47:41,137 --> 00:47:42,867
that could win no matter what.

1033
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,207
That was how these seven were chosen.

1034
00:47:46,807 --> 00:47:49,278
(The 7 of TEAM BEAT's UNIT 1)

1035
00:47:50,218 --> 00:47:52,247
I could really feel...

1036
00:47:52,517 --> 00:47:54,346
that the director of TEAM BEAT...

1037
00:47:54,347 --> 00:47:56,488
really wanted to win.

1038
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,858
With our teamwork, we will make sure to do well.

1039
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:03,757
This is the lineup of TEAM GROOVE.

1040
00:48:03,758 --> 00:48:04,758
(The 7 of TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 1)

1041
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:06,826
TEAM GROOVE's UNIT ONE.

1042
00:48:06,827 --> 00:48:08,067
(The 7 of TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 1)

1043
00:48:08,968 --> 00:48:10,448
I'm the most curious about this team.

1044
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:17,837
Kenta.

1045
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:19,738
(The 1st member of TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 1, Kenta)

1046
00:48:21,448 --> 00:48:22,508
Park Ju Won.

1047
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:23,948
Park Ju Won!

1048
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:27,317
(Kwon Hee Jun)

1049
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:28,548
Kwon Hee Jun.

1050
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:33,627
- Park Han. - Park Han.

1051
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:35,909
(Feeling anxious with the appearance of talented players)

1052
00:48:35,957 --> 00:48:36,957
He Junjin.

1053
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:39,557
Koo Han Seo.

1054
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:42,428
And lastly,

1055
00:48:43,097 --> 00:48:44,367
Yeo Gangdong.

1056
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:48,068
(Seo Jeong Woo was replaced by Koo Han Seo.)

1057
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:52,407
- What? - That was unexpected.

1058
00:48:54,048 --> 00:48:57,076
(Seo Jeong Woo and Jang Kyung Ho from the starting lineup...)

1059
00:48:57,077 --> 00:48:59,847
(have been taken out from UNIT 1.)

1060
00:49:00,117 --> 00:49:01,186
That is a strong team.

1061
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:03,347
(TEAM GROOVE is a strong team.)

1062
00:49:04,157 --> 00:49:07,758
The members have been placed to secure all wins.

1063
00:49:08,628 --> 00:49:11,698
Our team has a lot of different colors,

1064
00:49:12,227 --> 00:49:14,698
so I made a bold move with the lineup.

1065
00:49:15,267 --> 00:49:16,267
(TEAM GROOVE has set up members with different charms, )

1066
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:17,267
(with 4 from the starting lineup and 3 from the bench.)

1067
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:21,367
TEAM GROOVE has a strong bench as well,

1068
00:49:21,738 --> 00:49:22,937
so I felt a bit intimidated.

1069
00:49:23,468 --> 00:49:24,877
Great. I will look forward to their performance.

1070
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,807
(Will TEAM GROOVE's plan work out?)

1071
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,577
Lastly, this is the lineup of TEAM RHYTHM.

1072
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,218
(Looking intently)

1073
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:34,787
What was the standard...

1074
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:37,157
behind selecting your Seven?

1075
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:41,287
(Curious)

1076
00:49:41,727 --> 00:49:43,287
TEAM RHYTHM ended up in second place...

1077
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:45,857
for Round 1 and Round 2.

1078
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,028
We're confident about taking the win this time.

1079
00:49:50,097 --> 00:49:52,997
TEAM RHYTHM's UNIT ONE.

1080
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,838
- JL. - As expected.

1081
00:49:57,637 --> 00:49:58,707
JL has to start.

1082
00:50:01,008 --> 00:50:02,048
Zhang Shuaibo.

1083
00:50:05,718 --> 00:50:06,718
Steven.

1084
00:50:07,418 --> 00:50:08,498
They won't be easy to face.

1085
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:11,318
Chih En.

1086
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:15,147
- We're in trouble. - That's a strong competitor.

1087
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:19,258
Daisuke.

1088
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:21,238
Isn't that the whole starting lineup?

1089
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,497
Are they set up just like us?

1090
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:25,398
That can't happen.

1091
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:28,007
(The other members of TEAM RHYTHM's UNIT 1)

1092
00:50:28,008 --> 00:50:29,668
Ayumu. And lastly,

1093
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,977
Xie Yuxin.

1094
00:50:32,537 --> 00:50:34,254
There are five players from the starting lineup.

1095
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:35,977
All of them are really popular.

1096
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:38,076
They are all determined.

1097
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,948
They are determined to win no matter what.

1098
00:50:40,178 --> 00:50:41,887
- They are the Avengers. - Right.

1099
00:50:42,687 --> 00:50:43,717
Let's take first place.

1100
00:50:43,718 --> 00:50:44,718
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1101
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,657
TEAM RHYTHM was my biggest concern.

1102
00:50:48,227 --> 00:50:51,556
I knew how talented the players of TEAM RHYTHM were,

1103
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:53,867
and that was why I felt more concerned about them.

1104
00:50:54,698 --> 00:50:57,866
Which team will finish with a smile at the end of the league?

1105
00:50:57,867 --> 00:50:59,387
(Which team will be the final winner?)

1106
00:50:59,668 --> 00:51:02,338
I will make sure to take first place no matter what today.

1107
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:05,306
I think we've prepared ourselves well,

1108
00:51:05,307 --> 00:51:07,027
so I think we will be able to perform well.

1109
00:51:07,378 --> 00:51:08,907
As it's the last league match,

1110
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:11,948
we want to show everyone a big comeback.

1111
00:51:13,517 --> 00:51:16,148
This is the last match.

1112
00:51:16,347 --> 00:51:18,257
It's the last match before the live show,

1113
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:19,718
so I can't be all smiles.

1114
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:22,657
- My heart feels heavy now. - Right.

1115
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:23,758
Go and prove yourselves.

1116
00:51:23,758 --> 00:51:24,758
- Right. - Right.

1117
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:26,257
It'll be a waste to lose everything you've practiced for.

1118
00:51:26,258 --> 00:51:27,327
Right.

1119
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:29,898
"This is who I am."

1120
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,068
- Have this mindset. - Okay.

1121
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:33,907
- Got it? - Yes!

1122
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:35,968
Here.

1123
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:40,237
If you can't focus on your singing while dancing here,

1124
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:43,917
I think it'll be better to go with your gestures...

1125
00:51:43,918 --> 00:51:45,218
without dancing.

1126
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:47,016
- Okay. - Make sure...

1127
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:49,847
to show your chemistry with one another.

1128
00:51:50,247 --> 00:51:53,257
I hope that you will perform with a lot more sincerity.

1129
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:54,826
- Okay. - Make sure to encourage each other.

1130
00:51:54,827 --> 00:51:55,886
- Okay. - Okay.

1131
00:51:55,887 --> 00:51:57,226
We have to win this time.

1132
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:58,298
- Okay! - Okay!

1133
00:51:59,057 --> 00:52:01,327
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1134
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:03,738
This is what I think.

1135
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:06,167
You have done well...

1136
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,338
to receive our feedback.

1137
00:52:09,037 --> 00:52:11,107
You just need to do well onstage today.

1138
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:12,108
- Good luck. - Okay.

1139
00:52:16,448 --> 00:52:18,647
(After the audience entered, )

1140
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:21,718
(Round 3 officially began.)

1141
00:52:25,387 --> 00:52:27,127
Hello.

1142
00:52:27,128 --> 00:52:28,226
(Steven, Chih En)

1143
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:29,686
(A warm...)

1144
00:52:29,687 --> 00:52:31,528
(welcome)

1145
00:52:32,097 --> 00:52:33,226
Welcome to Universe League.

1146
00:52:33,227 --> 00:52:34,587
I'm MC Jay Park. Nice to meet you.

1147
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:37,398
(It's great to see you.)

1148
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:39,668
With the Elite Seven,

1149
00:52:39,898 --> 00:52:42,738
the final league match will begin right now.

1150
00:52:43,108 --> 00:52:46,738
Are you ready?

1151
00:52:49,077 --> 00:52:51,277
Let's all gather around.

1152
00:52:51,278 --> 00:52:53,617
(It's TEAM GROOVE's time to get onstage.)

1153
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:57,187
I felt certain in Rounds 1 and 2.

1154
00:52:58,017 --> 00:53:00,088
But I'm not sure about this round.

1155
00:53:01,457 --> 00:53:03,997
All I can do is trust all of you.

1156
00:53:04,398 --> 00:53:05,428
Right.

1157
00:53:05,798 --> 00:53:06,798
All right.

1158
00:53:07,528 --> 00:53:08,528
Let's do this.

1159
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,667
- Just don't leave any regrets. - Okay.

1160
00:53:10,668 --> 00:53:12,837
Good luck with Round Three.

1161
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:14,507
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1162
00:53:14,508 --> 00:53:16,507
(Let's go, TEAM GROOVE!)

1163
00:53:16,508 --> 00:53:18,577
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1164
00:53:18,937 --> 00:53:20,007
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1165
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:21,524
(TEAM GROOVE's members cheer each other up as one.)

1166
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:23,608
- Good luck, Han. - Let's go!

1167
00:53:23,948 --> 00:53:27,218
Shall we start with the first unit's performance?

1168
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:31,117
TEAM GROOVE's UNIT ONE, please come out!

1169
00:53:38,057 --> 00:53:40,028
As I have come to TEAM GROOVE,

1170
00:53:40,428 --> 00:53:41,827
I want to be of help.

1171
00:53:42,028 --> 00:53:44,838
I will make TEAM GROOVE a team that stays in first place.

1172
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,807
TEAM GROOVE has never lost...

1173
00:53:48,108 --> 00:53:50,738
and has stayed at the top.

1174
00:53:51,037 --> 00:53:54,008
I want to keep it that way.

1175
00:53:56,077 --> 00:53:58,547
Hello.

1176
00:53:58,548 --> 00:53:59,577
Hello.

1177
00:53:59,977 --> 00:54:02,347
(Is my favorite player here?)

1178
00:54:03,218 --> 00:54:04,218
- Hello. - Hello.

1179
00:54:05,218 --> 00:54:07,057
(Hi.)

1180
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:09,287
(She spots her favorite.)

1181
00:54:10,088 --> 00:54:12,727
(Park Han!)

1182
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:14,826
(TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 1 is dressed with suits as white as snow.)

1183
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:15,827
Hello.

1184
00:54:15,828 --> 00:54:17,266
(TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 1 is dressed with suits as white as snow.)

1185
00:54:17,267 --> 00:54:18,267
All right.

1186
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:21,008
Please start by greeting the audience.

1187
00:54:22,137 --> 00:54:23,738
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

1188
00:54:23,878 --> 00:54:25,507
(Clip-clop)

1189
00:54:25,508 --> 00:54:27,007
(Horse Kenta makes a late start.)

1190
00:54:27,008 --> 00:54:28,806
(Neighing)

1191
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,378
The Charming Princes are coming this winter.

1192
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:36,048
(The return of the Charming Princes)

1193
00:54:36,418 --> 00:54:38,456
They look like the princes of winter.

1194
00:54:38,457 --> 00:54:40,157
The snow princes.

1195
00:54:40,887 --> 00:54:42,726
Hello, I am the First Love from Japan.

1196
00:54:42,727 --> 00:54:43,757
I'm Kenta.

1197
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:45,596
(The First Love from Japan, Kenta)

1198
00:54:45,597 --> 00:54:47,628
Kenta!

1199
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,737
Hello, I am the baby tiger that has appeared in Universe League.

1200
00:54:50,738 --> 00:54:51,738
I'm Park Ju Won.

1201
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:53,297
(All-rounder Park Ju Won, Kenta)

1202
00:54:53,298 --> 00:54:55,967
I'm here once again to turn on your green lights.

1203
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:57,278
I'm Yeo Gangdong.

1204
00:54:58,037 --> 00:54:59,706
TEAM GROOVE's second vocalist.

1205
00:54:59,707 --> 00:55:01,508
I'm He Junjin, the super puppy.

1206
00:55:02,548 --> 00:55:04,617
I'm Universe League's main rapper, Koo Han Seo.

1207
00:55:05,718 --> 00:55:06,877
(Koo Han Seo)

1208
00:55:06,878 --> 00:55:09,398
Hello, I'm the all-rounder Park Han who can do everything well.

1209
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:11,186
(Park Han)

1210
00:55:11,187 --> 00:55:13,186
Hello, I am Kwon Hee Jun...

1211
00:55:13,187 --> 00:55:15,528
who wants to be your hand warmer this winter.

1212
00:55:15,887 --> 00:55:17,798
(That's hot!)

1213
00:55:18,557 --> 00:55:20,968
The princes are here! They look great!

1214
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,567
They cannot get a bad reaction with those looks.

1215
00:55:23,568 --> 00:55:26,036
TEAM GROOVE has its distinct color.

1216
00:55:26,037 --> 00:55:27,168
Right.

1217
00:55:27,508 --> 00:55:30,637
TEAM GROOVE has placed first twice so far.

1218
00:55:31,178 --> 00:55:32,814
Do you think you will take first place...

1219
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:33,838
once again?

1220
00:55:34,847 --> 00:55:36,747
Yes. A fight is all about confidence.

1221
00:55:36,977 --> 00:55:39,347
We will keep this confidence and take the win again.

1222
00:55:39,648 --> 00:55:41,988
(That's impressive!)

1223
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:45,056
But wasn't he on TEAM BEAT during their first win?

1224
00:55:45,057 --> 00:55:46,088
- Right. - Right.

1225
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:49,057
(You must've forgotten already, )

1226
00:55:49,758 --> 00:55:53,858
(but you started with TEAM BEAT.)

1227
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:55,866
- He didn't win all the time. - He won once and lost once.

1228
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:58,037
(You weren't on TEAM GROOVE from the start.)

1229
00:55:58,668 --> 00:55:59,698
All right. Hee Jun.

1230
00:56:00,298 --> 00:56:02,538
What kind of performance have you prepared for us today?

1231
00:56:03,137 --> 00:56:04,977
The song we have prepared...

1232
00:56:05,437 --> 00:56:07,778
is called "Only U." This song...

1233
00:56:08,077 --> 00:56:10,747
is based on a confession of love.

1234
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:12,247
The members of TEAM GROOVE's...

1235
00:56:12,818 --> 00:56:14,786
UNIT ONE are ready...

1236
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:16,867
to make an amazing confession of love to all of you.

1237
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:19,457
Please give us lots of attention and love.

1238
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,628
- Okay. Great. - We will!

1239
00:56:22,928 --> 00:56:25,556
Ju Won. This is your first performance...

1240
00:56:25,557 --> 00:56:28,068
after being traded from RHYTHM to GROOVE.

1241
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:29,527
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

1242
00:56:29,528 --> 00:56:30,838
(Full of sadness)

1243
00:56:31,437 --> 00:56:33,237
- Oh, no. - Oh, Ju Won.

1244
00:56:33,238 --> 00:56:34,437
(Our Ju Won...)

1245
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:35,807
How did it feel...

1246
00:56:36,437 --> 00:56:37,507
to be on a new team?

1247
00:56:37,508 --> 00:56:38,607
Were you able to adjust well?

1248
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:41,806
Well... Because GROOVE is a team with strong vocalists,

1249
00:56:41,807 --> 00:56:43,608
it was really hard at first.

1250
00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:46,616
But now that I think about it, I'm really proud...

1251
00:56:46,617 --> 00:56:49,217
because it became a chance for me to level up.

1252
00:56:49,218 --> 00:56:50,447
Very nice.

1253
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,686
We should bring him back.

1254
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:53,557
(We should bring him back!)

1255
00:56:53,988 --> 00:56:55,187
He leveled up.

1256
00:56:56,727 --> 00:57:01,168
(What magic did Director Chang Sub show?)

1257
00:57:01,568 --> 00:57:03,668
This must be the final team, right?

1258
00:57:04,437 --> 00:57:06,398
I've joined, everyone. Hello.

1259
00:57:06,637 --> 00:57:08,706
- Hello. - Hello.

1260
00:57:08,707 --> 00:57:11,477
- Hello. - Hello.

1261
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:16,378
Looking at the fixed members, I'm getting a good feeling.

1262
00:57:16,648 --> 00:57:18,547
Everyone fits "Only U" well.

1263
00:57:18,548 --> 00:57:19,624
(The players fit the image of the song well.)

1264
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:20,717
Let's do our best.

1265
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:21,747
- Sounds good. - Yes.

1266
00:57:22,287 --> 00:57:23,686
I have a good idea.

1267
00:57:23,687 --> 00:57:25,556
We're TEAM GROOVE, right?

1268
00:57:25,557 --> 00:57:27,286
How about we use handheld mics?

1269
00:57:27,287 --> 00:57:28,686
- That's nice. - Handheld mics?

1270
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:30,157
That's TEAM GROOVE's specialty.

1271
00:57:31,028 --> 00:57:36,027
(Handheld mics let them show off their vocal abilities.)

1272
00:57:36,028 --> 00:57:37,967
Does anyone have zero experience with handheld mics?

1273
00:57:37,968 --> 00:57:39,697
- I've never used one before. - Me.

1274
00:57:39,698 --> 00:57:41,137
Only at karaoke...

1275
00:57:41,307 --> 00:57:43,937
- That's an experience too. - Oh, okay.

1276
00:57:44,238 --> 00:57:48,108
So I'm very worried.

1277
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:50,817
It's hard. It is.

1278
00:57:50,818 --> 00:57:53,076
- We'll have to practice a lot. - But you...

1279
00:57:53,077 --> 00:57:56,887
I think TEAM RHYTHM practiced the performance aspect more.

1280
00:57:57,017 --> 00:58:00,258
I felt that TEAM GROOVE practiced...

1281
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:03,187
the vocal aspect more.

1282
00:58:03,588 --> 00:58:05,956
(Starting practice with their handheld mics)

1283
00:58:05,957 --> 00:58:08,277
- Let's start with the sitting part. - Yes, let's do that.

1284
00:58:08,928 --> 00:58:10,798
Only you

1285
00:58:11,537 --> 00:58:17,907
(The experienced players are fine with the handheld mic.)

1286
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:20,237
One, two, three

1287
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:21,846
I was going to appear

1288
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:26,247
(Making mistakes he usually doesn't make)

1289
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:32,718
(Empty-handed, Empty-handed, Mic, Empty-handed, Empty-handed)

1290
00:58:33,017 --> 00:58:34,386
- Gosh. - There are three things...

1291
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:35,757
to think about. Dancing, singing, and the mic.

1292
00:58:35,758 --> 00:58:37,257
We'll need to change all of the gestures.

1293
00:58:37,258 --> 00:58:39,997
So hard. In-ears were much more comfortable.

1294
00:58:40,457 --> 00:58:42,767
How do I know which hand to hold the mic with?

1295
00:58:43,298 --> 00:58:46,767
So the default is to hold the mic with your left hand.

1296
00:58:47,238 --> 00:58:49,278
Only hold it with your right hand when you need to.

1297
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:51,508
Oh, I didn't learn the basics correctly.

1298
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:53,807
What should I do? The left hand is so uncomfortable.

1299
00:58:54,148 --> 00:58:56,278
I need to care about singing.

1300
00:58:56,747 --> 00:58:58,647
I need to care about dancing.

1301
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:01,588
I need to care about which hand to hold the mic with.

1302
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,718
My head felt so...

1303
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:06,718
confused and dizzy.

1304
00:59:06,957 --> 00:59:10,226
With handheld mics, we need to change all of the gestures, right?

1305
00:59:10,227 --> 00:59:12,197
Isn't that easier? I'm more comfortable with one hand.

1306
00:59:12,198 --> 00:59:13,258
Oh, really?

1307
00:59:13,457 --> 00:59:15,698
I'm more comfortable holding the mic with my right hand.

1308
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:18,367
- Your right hand? - Yes.

1309
00:59:19,298 --> 00:59:20,867
It'll be good to change that.

1310
00:59:21,437 --> 00:59:22,467
Like this...

1311
00:59:22,468 --> 00:59:23,706
("Only U" has many moves using the right hand.)

1312
00:59:23,707 --> 00:59:26,778
We have many moves using the right side.

1313
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:28,608
They're mostly on the right.

1314
00:59:28,977 --> 00:59:32,116
So you have to hold the mic with your left hand.

1315
00:59:32,117 --> 00:59:33,178
So...

1316
00:59:33,977 --> 00:59:35,318
Make it a habit!

1317
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:39,387
(Practicing is the only way to make it a habit.)

1318
00:59:39,718 --> 00:59:43,028
(The mic doesn't know where to go.)

1319
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:46,128
(Oh, right!)

1320
00:59:49,568 --> 00:59:50,596
(Right hand?)

1321
00:59:50,597 --> 00:59:52,897
(Keep it in my left hand!)

1322
00:59:52,898 --> 00:59:55,537
(After repeated practice, )

1323
00:59:56,407 --> 01:00:01,577
(he slowly got used to the handheld mic.)

1324
01:00:08,347 --> 01:00:09,417
Ju Won. That part.

1325
01:00:09,418 --> 01:00:11,786
"Only you." That part needs to pop out.

1326
01:00:11,787 --> 01:00:13,957
- Only you - It's too weak.

1327
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:15,787
- Yes. - Okay.

1328
01:00:16,057 --> 01:00:19,457
You need to show a completely different side...

1329
01:00:19,628 --> 01:00:22,568
that you didn't show when you were on TEAM RHYTHM.

1330
01:00:23,068 --> 01:00:26,037
(Unexpected feedback about his vocal expression)

1331
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:30,238
It was my first performance on a new team.

1332
01:00:31,778 --> 01:00:33,637
To be honest, this performance...

1333
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,107
was the performance I was most worried about...

1334
01:00:37,108 --> 01:00:40,847
out of all of my performances on Universe League.

1335
01:00:41,787 --> 01:00:45,387
My body can't keep up with the practice schedule.

1336
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:48,428
My voice is so hoarse.

1337
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:51,358
Just breathing hurts.

1338
01:00:52,057 --> 01:00:53,297
(His voice isn't in good condition for singing.)

1339
01:00:53,298 --> 01:00:56,068
- Because I have to do it a lot. - Right.

1340
01:00:56,398 --> 01:00:59,838
I was coaching the guys on their singing all day yesterday.

1341
01:01:01,668 --> 01:01:05,777
(Han volunteered as the vocal coach for the members once again.)

1342
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:08,847
Every, every, everything is you

1343
01:01:09,608 --> 01:01:12,448
(He had to use his voice more than the other members.)

1344
01:01:14,418 --> 01:01:20,787
(As the main vocalist of the team, Han has many high parts.)

1345
01:01:21,988 --> 01:01:27,227
(Singing hard)

1346
01:01:27,557 --> 01:01:28,698
Only you

1347
01:01:28,928 --> 01:01:31,467
I wasn't at my limit, but I felt it was getting worse.

1348
01:01:31,468 --> 01:01:33,536
I didn't know that I had a limit either.

1349
01:01:33,537 --> 01:01:35,906
I guess I had never used my voice that much before.

1350
01:01:35,907 --> 01:01:38,707
So as each day went on,

1351
01:01:39,307 --> 01:01:42,577
my throat was starting to suffer.

1352
01:01:45,448 --> 01:01:49,617
(Director Chang Sub came by to do a final check.)

1353
01:01:50,488 --> 01:01:54,687
(They show off the performance they practiced.)

1354
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,968
(Satisfied)

1355
01:02:03,727 --> 01:02:09,137
(Next up is Han, the main vocalist's part)

1356
01:02:10,137 --> 01:02:13,008
(Director Chang Sub face becomes serious.)

1357
01:02:14,137 --> 01:02:19,877
(And the last check came to a close.)

1358
01:02:19,878 --> 01:02:21,847
Okay.

1359
01:02:23,347 --> 01:02:25,187
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1360
01:02:26,287 --> 01:02:28,857
The choreography became much neater...

1361
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:30,657
than when I saw it on video.

1362
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:32,758
- Thank you. - Your moves are stronger now.

1363
01:02:32,928 --> 01:02:34,367
It was very nice to see.

1364
01:02:35,898 --> 01:02:37,468
- Han. - Yes.

1365
01:02:39,867 --> 01:02:41,338
Protect your voice.

1366
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,337
- Okay? - Yes.

1367
01:02:43,338 --> 01:02:46,036
- You need to protect your voice. - Okay.

1368
01:02:46,037 --> 01:02:47,237
(Chang Sub noticed the condition of Han's throat right away.)

1369
01:02:47,238 --> 01:02:50,247
- Especially when you have a cold. - Yes.

1370
01:02:50,407 --> 01:02:51,976
When you have a cold,

1371
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:54,746
singing too much will delay recovery.

1372
01:02:54,747 --> 01:02:56,516
- Okay. - Okay?

1373
01:02:56,517 --> 01:02:59,017
You need to protect your voice more.

1374
01:02:59,488 --> 01:03:00,758
Take care of it.

1375
01:03:01,428 --> 01:03:04,157
I believe I have lots of responsibility.

1376
01:03:04,557 --> 01:03:06,597
My team depends on this.

1377
01:03:07,727 --> 01:03:11,497
I can't let my team lose.

1378
01:03:11,898 --> 01:03:16,238
I'm going to do whatever I can...

1379
01:03:17,008 --> 01:03:19,338
and just go through it.

1380
01:03:21,577 --> 01:03:24,306
Okay. Let's watch TEAM GROOVE's performance.

1381
01:03:24,307 --> 01:03:27,076
TEAM GROOVE, are you ready?

1382
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:28,887
- Yes! - Let's go.

1383
01:03:29,148 --> 01:03:31,657
- Park Han! - You can do it!

1384
01:03:31,858 --> 01:03:33,317
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1385
01:03:33,318 --> 01:03:34,527
- Let's see. - Our rivals.

1386
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:36,656
- "Only U." - We were saying to each other,

1387
01:03:36,657 --> 01:03:38,227
"Let's just beat TEAM GROOVE."

1388
01:03:38,557 --> 01:03:39,596
We're not interested...

1389
01:03:39,597 --> 01:03:41,427
- in beating TEAM RHYTHM at all. - Right.

1390
01:03:41,428 --> 01:03:42,468
Just TEAM GROOVE.

1391
01:03:43,968 --> 01:03:46,996
(We'll be watching, TEAM GROOVE.)

1392
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:49,108
I'm excited to see Ju Won.

1393
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:52,077
- Hey. - Oh, my.

1394
01:03:55,307 --> 01:03:57,148
I plan to just go through it.

1395
01:03:57,577 --> 01:03:59,918
I'll do my best to keep our number one spot again.

1396
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:03,887
- Let's go, Ju Won! - It's starting.

1397
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:06,358
- Let's go, Han Seo! - Ready?

1398
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:08,727
- Go. - Oh, my.

1399
01:04:08,988 --> 01:04:10,286
(Let's debut, Gangdong.)

1400
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:11,898
Oh, my. Look at Kenta's face.

1401
01:04:11,922 --> 01:04:12,984
("Only U," by He Junjin, Kenta, Koo Han Seo, )

1402
01:04:12,985 --> 01:04:15,025
(Kwon Hee Jun, Park Han, Park Ju Won, Yeo Gangdong)

1403
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:26,596
He's so good.

1404
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,465
So cute.

1405
01:04:31,466 --> 01:04:32,966
Oh, Junjin.

1406
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,306
Hey.

1407
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:15,045
Han is really good at this part.

1408
01:05:15,176 --> 01:05:17,176
Han is really good.

1409
01:05:46,145 --> 01:05:48,906
He's like your first love from Japan who comes running from the snow.

1410
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,526
Oh, Ju Won.

1411
01:06:04,255 --> 01:06:05,295
(Kenta)

1412
01:07:12,926 --> 01:07:13,926
(Kenta)

1413
01:07:25,505 --> 01:07:27,005
Oh, look at that.

1414
01:07:51,495 --> 01:07:52,535
Nice.

1415
01:08:09,986 --> 01:08:11,386
Good job!

1416
01:08:15,695 --> 01:08:18,155
(A subtle smile of satisfaction)

1417
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:19,526
Oh, so cute.

1418
01:08:20,795 --> 01:08:23,266
(We knew you'd do well again today.)

1419
01:08:23,466 --> 01:08:26,405
(Proud)

1420
01:08:26,835 --> 01:08:27,835
That was clean.

1421
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:34,146
I think Han was the identity of "Only U."

1422
01:08:34,745 --> 01:08:37,245
His voice suited "Only U" really well.

1423
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:41,545
I thought, "TEAM GROOVE sure is great."

1424
01:08:42,115 --> 01:08:45,015
I was worried that TEAM GROOVE would get...

1425
01:08:45,016 --> 01:08:46,155
first place again.

1426
01:08:46,785 --> 01:08:49,356
Ju Won still has that TEAM RHYTHM feel.

1427
01:08:50,396 --> 01:08:51,396
Very much.

1428
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:53,995
- Good job. - Han Seo.

1429
01:08:55,766 --> 01:08:59,205
Okay. Shall we begin the vote?

1430
01:08:59,505 --> 01:09:01,236
If you liked this player's performance,

1431
01:09:01,436 --> 01:09:03,236
please press O.

1432
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:07,606
If you weren't satisfied, please press the X button.

1433
01:09:09,516 --> 01:09:11,716
- Please vote for me. - Okay!

1434
01:09:12,245 --> 01:09:13,645
(A cheek heart)

1435
01:09:13,646 --> 01:09:14,944
(Kenta)

1436
01:09:14,945 --> 01:09:16,556
You're so handsome, Kenta!

1437
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,785
Please vote for me.

1438
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:20,755
I love you, Ju Won!

1439
01:09:21,486 --> 01:09:22,794
I love you too.

1440
01:09:22,795 --> 01:09:23,925
(Exchanging confessions of love)

1441
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:27,825
- Han! - Han, I love you!

1442
01:09:28,896 --> 01:09:33,334
(Responding with a sweet song like the main vocalist he is)

1443
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,135
(Park Han, you are my light. Your voice is a cultural heritage.)

1444
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:37,105
Thank you. I love you.

1445
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,106
Han.

1446
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,905
- Yes! - Hurry up and vote!

1447
01:09:41,405 --> 01:09:42,444
- Okay. - Come on.

1448
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:43,445
(The votes shoot up as much as their affection)

1449
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,914
Three, two, one.

1450
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:48,886
The vote is now over.

1451
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:51,455
That was TEAM GROOVE, everyone.

1452
01:09:51,755 --> 01:09:54,754
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1453
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:56,395
(Park Han, Vote for Gangdong and Junjin.)

1454
01:09:59,865 --> 01:10:01,194
(Next up is TEAM BEAT.)

1455
01:10:01,195 --> 01:10:02,535
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1456
01:10:04,795 --> 01:10:05,806
Crush it.

1457
01:10:06,306 --> 01:10:08,106
I can do well, right?

1458
01:10:08,606 --> 01:10:09,976
Come here. Let's do a cheer.

1459
01:10:10,705 --> 01:10:11,705
Come on.

1460
01:10:12,806 --> 01:10:14,374
Let's have no injuries...

1461
01:10:14,375 --> 01:10:15,775
- and no regrets today. - Okay.

1462
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:16,975
- Show them. - Okay.

1463
01:10:16,976 --> 01:10:18,015
In 1, 2, 3.

1464
01:10:18,016 --> 01:10:20,015
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1465
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:21,245
(Let's go, TEAM BEAT!)

1466
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:23,715
- Let's go, TEAM BEAT! - Let's go.

1467
01:10:23,716 --> 01:10:25,016
Save my life.

1468
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:26,825
- Save my life. - Okay.

1469
01:10:27,325 --> 01:10:28,885
- Save my life. - Okay.

1470
01:10:28,886 --> 01:10:30,355
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1471
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:31,895
- Don't worry. - Let's go.

1472
01:10:31,896 --> 01:10:33,095
- Let's go. - Don't worry.

1473
01:10:33,096 --> 01:10:34,165
Let's go.

1474
01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:37,635
Okay. Now, we'll invite TEAM BEAT onto the stage.

1475
01:10:37,636 --> 01:10:38,966
Please come up, TEAM BEAT.

1476
01:10:39,405 --> 01:10:40,805
(Curious)

1477
01:10:40,806 --> 01:10:42,266
(Excited)

1478
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,676
We have nowhere to back down now.

1479
01:10:50,476 --> 01:10:55,085
I want to show everyone that we're an even stronger seven now.

1480
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,654
Let's go!

1481
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:03,096
(TEAM BEAT's first unit made up of starting players!)

1482
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:06,065
(Seo Jeong Woo, Cha Woong Ki)

1483
01:11:06,066 --> 01:11:08,026
(Cha Woong Ki)

1484
01:11:08,566 --> 01:11:11,736
(TEAM BEAT came onstage wearing suits.)

1485
01:11:14,306 --> 01:11:15,436
They look so cool.

1486
01:11:15,535 --> 01:11:17,574
- Bodyguard style. - Cha Woong Ki.

1487
01:11:17,575 --> 01:11:18,575
Good.

1488
01:11:18,576 --> 01:11:20,346
Woong Ki looks much better with black hair.

1489
01:11:20,445 --> 01:11:23,045
You're right. I was wondering what had changed. He dyed his hair.

1490
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,286
I've never seen him with black hair.

1491
01:11:25,445 --> 01:11:26,816
Black hair suits him so well.

1492
01:11:27,686 --> 01:11:29,114
Black hair suits him so well.

1493
01:11:29,115 --> 01:11:31,215
TEAM BEAT. Please introduce yourselves first.

1494
01:11:31,216 --> 01:11:32,284
Two, three.

1495
01:11:32,285 --> 01:11:33,785
- Vibing. - Vibing.

1496
01:11:34,486 --> 01:11:37,994
(TEAM BEAT's never-before-seen sexy side)

1497
01:11:37,995 --> 01:11:40,466
- Hello! We're TEAM BEAT! - We're TEAM BEAT!

1498
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:43,235
(I love it.)

1499
01:11:43,236 --> 01:11:44,794
(Surprised)

1500
01:11:44,795 --> 01:11:47,835
Hello. I'm Nam Do Yoon, the sexy sloth.

1501
01:11:48,335 --> 01:11:49,936
"The sexy sloth."

1502
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:54,375
Hello. I'm Yuito, the sexy rabbit.

1503
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:56,945
I'm An Yul, the sexy squirrel.

1504
01:11:57,115 --> 01:11:58,216
You're so handsome!

1505
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,386
I'm Keum Jin Ho, the sexy shark.

1506
01:12:00,886 --> 01:12:02,284
(From land to sea, we have all of their animal look-alikes.)

1507
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:04,415
I'm Kim Hyo Tae, the sexy frog.

1508
01:12:04,615 --> 01:12:07,356
Hello! I'm Cha Woong Ki, the sexy puppy.

1509
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:09,695
(Cha Woong Ki)

1510
01:12:11,755 --> 01:12:14,966
Hello. I'm Kairi, the sexy white tiger.

1511
01:12:16,636 --> 01:12:19,305
Kairi kind of became more manly.

1512
01:12:19,306 --> 01:12:20,306
Yes.

1513
01:12:21,106 --> 01:12:22,776
All right. Kairi.

1514
01:12:23,236 --> 01:12:27,405
What song will TEAM BEAT perform to get the win?

1515
01:12:27,606 --> 01:12:30,715
It's a song produced by Director EL CAPITXN...

1516
01:12:30,716 --> 01:12:32,316
called, "My, My, My."

1517
01:12:32,785 --> 01:12:34,645
It's a song...

1518
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:38,816
about risking everything you have for the person you love.

1519
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:42,084
Until now, we have shown you our boyish side.

1520
01:12:42,085 --> 01:12:44,426
Today, from our outfits to the choreography,

1521
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,596
we plan to show you our fatally sexy side.

1522
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:47,896
Okay.

1523
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:48,896
(From outfits to choreography, their concept is fatally sexy.)

1524
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:51,065
- You're all showing a bit of skin. - Yes.

1525
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,135
- Yes, a bit. - I like it.

1526
01:12:52,136 --> 01:12:53,136
(They're even showing some skin for the concept!)

1527
01:12:53,137 --> 01:12:54,306
Look at their outfits today.

1528
01:12:54,835 --> 01:12:56,606
Oh, that's strong.

1529
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:58,574
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

1530
01:12:58,575 --> 01:12:59,874
Their outfits are so strong.

1531
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,305
Their outfits are really cool. I was so surprised.

1532
01:13:02,306 --> 01:13:03,475
(Ready with suits that accent their fatal sexiness!)

1533
01:13:03,476 --> 01:13:05,745
- And Woong Ki. - Yes.

1534
01:13:06,686 --> 01:13:10,215
I heard TEAM BEAT faced trouble while preparing for this stage.

1535
01:13:10,216 --> 01:13:11,256
What trouble did you face?

1536
01:13:11,856 --> 01:13:13,056
Yes, well...

1537
01:13:14,226 --> 01:13:16,895
Our team always faced...

1538
01:13:16,896 --> 01:13:18,955
adversity and hardship.

1539
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:20,596
This time...

1540
01:13:21,766 --> 01:13:25,835
(What trouble did TEAM BEAT face?)

1541
01:13:26,505 --> 01:13:28,605
(TEAM BEAT's practice room)

1542
01:13:28,606 --> 01:13:29,966
- Let's try it again. - Thank you.

1543
01:13:30,236 --> 01:13:31,275
Let's try it again.

1544
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:34,276
(After selecting the final members, TEAM BEAT is practicing.)

1545
01:13:36,915 --> 01:13:40,044
(But there are only 6 people in the practice room?)

1546
01:13:40,045 --> 01:13:42,486
- My, my, my - My, my, my

1547
01:13:44,455 --> 01:13:45,754
(Woong Ki arrived later!)

1548
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,185
- Woong Ki! - Hello.

1549
01:13:47,186 --> 01:13:48,856
- Woong Ki. - Hello.

1550
01:13:50,995 --> 01:13:54,695
(He comes in looking worn out...)

1551
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:57,566
What's wrong?

1552
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:58,735
(Woong Ki is always so energetic. He seems different from usual.)

1553
01:13:58,736 --> 01:13:59,736
Are you unwell?

1554
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:01,606
You seem a bit sick today.

1555
01:14:01,766 --> 01:14:03,436
- What? - What is that?

1556
01:14:04,436 --> 01:14:06,744
(Woong Ki has bandages on?)

1557
01:14:06,745 --> 01:14:08,976
- What is this? - I didn't hurt a bone or anything.

1558
01:14:10,316 --> 01:14:11,316
(Serious)

1559
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:12,316
I just...

1560
01:14:13,646 --> 01:14:15,646
I went to the emergency room early in the morning.

1561
01:14:16,716 --> 01:14:17,915
- Why? - What happened?

1562
01:14:18,016 --> 01:14:19,016
What's wrong?

1563
01:14:19,017 --> 01:14:20,755
So yesterday,

1564
01:14:21,856 --> 01:14:24,026
we were recording until late at night, right?

1565
01:14:24,396 --> 01:14:27,096
My throat was so tired,

1566
01:14:27,466 --> 01:14:29,835
- so I was boiling some water... - No way.

1567
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,436
And I spilled it on myself.

1568
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,805
- Hey! - I spilled it on myself.

1569
01:14:34,806 --> 01:14:36,035
- I'm so... - Oh, no.

1570
01:14:36,535 --> 01:14:38,334
- That's scary. - So yesterday...

1571
01:14:38,335 --> 01:14:39,375
Are you okay?

1572
01:14:40,205 --> 01:14:44,415
I boiled water in a pot, and then I spilled it on my leg.

1573
01:14:45,115 --> 01:14:48,816
The pot actually touched my leg.

1574
01:14:51,585 --> 01:14:55,655
(Woong Ki went to the emergency room and got treated right away.)

1575
01:14:56,596 --> 01:14:57,596
(He got burns on his thigh and the back of his hand.)

1576
01:14:57,597 --> 01:15:00,195
- That must hurt so much. - So from here to there...

1577
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:02,525
- The thigh? - Oh, no.

1578
01:15:02,526 --> 01:15:06,565
(Flustered by the serious injury)

1579
01:15:06,566 --> 01:15:07,636
What now?

1580
01:15:10,575 --> 01:15:12,745
We had to leave at 9am...

1581
01:15:13,276 --> 01:15:16,346
for the choreography lesson.

1582
01:15:16,716 --> 01:15:19,785
But I couldn't find Woong Ki.

1583
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:22,085
I thought...

1584
01:15:22,186 --> 01:15:24,115
he simply didn't feel well.

1585
01:15:24,516 --> 01:15:26,625
But he looked more serious...

1586
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,596
than expected.

1587
01:15:30,195 --> 01:15:31,596
I was worried a lot.

1588
01:15:32,426 --> 01:15:35,865
I shouldn't dance for about two weeks.

1589
01:15:36,295 --> 01:15:38,164
But the competition is...

1590
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:39,805
- Right. - in two weeks.

1591
01:15:39,806 --> 01:15:41,364
(They only have 2 weeks left until Round 3.)

1592
01:15:41,365 --> 01:15:44,535
No liquid, including my own sweat, should touch it for two weeks.

1593
01:15:45,436 --> 01:15:47,606
Dancing is also not allowed.

1594
01:15:49,106 --> 01:15:50,216
The more it gets infected,

1595
01:15:50,816 --> 01:15:53,485
the more time it'll take to recover.

1596
01:15:53,486 --> 01:15:56,486
I was told to treat it well in the early stages.

1597
01:15:58,455 --> 01:16:00,155
The doctor said two weeks.

1598
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:03,454
So focus on your treatment to reduce that period.

1599
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:06,294
- Two days instead of two weeks? - Yes, let's reduce it.

1600
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:08,295
- Don't feel pressured. - Right.

1601
01:16:08,466 --> 01:16:09,866
It's not like I can't dance at all.

1602
01:16:10,295 --> 01:16:11,766
No, don't dance at all.

1603
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:14,306
I want you to focus on your recovery.

1604
01:16:15,966 --> 01:16:17,235
- I will. - Go home.

1605
01:16:17,236 --> 01:16:18,374
(Killing the mood)

1606
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:21,044
- Go home and lie down. - No, I'm here already.

1607
01:16:21,045 --> 01:16:22,074
(Still, since I'm here, I might as well practice.)

1608
01:16:22,075 --> 01:16:24,015
I heard a few changes were made...

1609
01:16:24,016 --> 01:16:25,476
during my absence.

1610
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:28,044
There are quite a few.

1611
01:16:28,045 --> 01:16:29,114
(Quite a few changes)

1612
01:16:29,115 --> 01:16:31,235
- But you should be fine. - There are also new moves.

1613
01:16:31,915 --> 01:16:32,986
Just that part...

1614
01:16:34,085 --> 01:16:36,596
I want to...

1615
01:16:36,955 --> 01:16:40,096
dance with them so badly.

1616
01:16:41,195 --> 01:16:42,955
But it hurts so much even when I'm standing.

1617
01:16:43,096 --> 01:16:44,135
(Woong Ki can barely stay standing.)

1618
01:16:44,136 --> 01:16:45,165
So...

1619
01:16:46,165 --> 01:16:48,664
since I can't practice dancing due to my injury,

1620
01:16:48,665 --> 01:16:50,636
I decided to focus on practicing my vocals...

1621
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:53,646
to show an improvement.

1622
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,475
It looks like TEAM BEAT is...

1623
01:16:56,476 --> 01:16:58,276
in a tough spot,

1624
01:16:58,646 --> 01:16:59,816
but...

1625
01:17:00,346 --> 01:17:01,846
it's Woong Ki.

1626
01:17:02,316 --> 01:17:04,414
Because it's Woong Ki,

1627
01:17:04,415 --> 01:17:06,726
I believe he will pull it off.

1628
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:08,785
Because it's Woong Ki,

1629
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:12,125
I believe he'll pull off...

1630
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:16,335
the choreography and the details.

1631
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,505
(Because they believe Woong Ki will return, )

1632
01:17:22,136 --> 01:17:25,676
(they focus on practicing with Woong Ki in mind.)

1633
01:17:26,276 --> 01:17:28,944
(A few days later)

1634
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:31,646
There should be memorable points.

1635
01:17:32,375 --> 01:17:35,346
I want to show that we're TEAM BEAT and that we're good.

1636
01:17:35,816 --> 01:17:36,855
Any ideas?

1637
01:17:36,856 --> 01:17:37,856
(They're thinking about an impressive performance.)

1638
01:17:37,857 --> 01:17:40,285
- Anything? - Maybe...

1639
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:41,825
a memorable pose?

1640
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,056
We should come up with one.

1641
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:46,994
What if we all dye our hair blue?

1642
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:47,995
That's a good idea.

1643
01:17:48,396 --> 01:17:50,834
Or we could use a flag.

1644
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:52,466
- That's a good idea. - I like that.

1645
01:17:52,766 --> 01:17:54,905
We kept thinking about...

1646
01:17:55,136 --> 01:17:56,806
something...

1647
01:17:57,205 --> 01:17:59,136
that only we could do.

1648
01:17:59,606 --> 01:18:01,744
Using a prop will...

1649
01:18:01,745 --> 01:18:03,445
already impress people.

1650
01:18:04,045 --> 01:18:06,415
I think the audience will like it.

1651
01:18:06,886 --> 01:18:07,985
(This performance)

1652
01:18:07,986 --> 01:18:09,085
To be honest,

1653
01:18:09,955 --> 01:18:11,886
it's our weapon.

1654
01:18:12,816 --> 01:18:14,385
- That's a good idea. - I like it.

1655
01:18:14,386 --> 01:18:16,955
We can make that possible.

1656
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:18,625
I like it.

1657
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:24,936
(Round 3)

1658
01:18:25,566 --> 01:18:27,365
(Sighing deeply)

1659
01:18:27,835 --> 01:18:28,835
Can we do it?

1660
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:30,405
(Can we perform?)

1661
01:18:31,075 --> 01:18:35,375
(Woong Ki still hasn't returned to the practice room.)

1662
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:38,045
- Oh, what? - Hi.

1663
01:18:38,976 --> 01:18:40,114
(Peeking)

1664
01:18:40,115 --> 01:18:42,146
- Oh, what? - Hi.

1665
01:18:42,955 --> 01:18:45,815
(Woong Ki visits the practice studio after a while.)

1666
01:18:45,816 --> 01:18:47,285
- Finally. - No way.

1667
01:18:48,856 --> 01:18:49,896
Hello.

1668
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:51,794
Good to see you again.

1669
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:53,625
Wait. Stop jumping.

1670
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,396
- Stop jumping. - Well done.

1671
01:18:57,495 --> 01:18:59,035
You look okay now.

1672
01:18:59,766 --> 01:19:01,936
Fortunately, I recovered quickly.

1673
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:04,116
I was able to get rid of the bandage.

1674
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,705
I can move freely now.

1675
01:19:06,806 --> 01:19:08,276
Does that mean you can dance now?

1676
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:10,115
I can't...

1677
01:19:11,115 --> 01:19:12,476
dance powerfully...

1678
01:19:12,676 --> 01:19:16,146
like before yet,

1679
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,414
but I can still join the group practice.

1680
01:19:19,415 --> 01:19:20,426
I'm glad to hear that.

1681
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:23,495
- That's a relief. - That's good. I'm glad.

1682
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,255
We have to perform in three days,

1683
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,925
but I can still perform.

1684
01:19:28,926 --> 01:19:31,235
(The doctor said he could go onstage.)

1685
01:19:31,236 --> 01:19:32,236
That's what I was told.

1686
01:19:32,665 --> 01:19:33,936
All seven of us are here.

1687
01:19:35,436 --> 01:19:36,436
- Let's practice. - Sure.

1688
01:19:36,976 --> 01:19:38,505
I love the group practice.

1689
01:19:38,705 --> 01:19:40,346
It's been a while.

1690
01:19:40,806 --> 01:19:42,646
Everyone's here to practice after a while.

1691
01:19:43,516 --> 01:19:45,845
Here, it's 7 and 8.

1692
01:19:45,846 --> 01:19:46,885
(Jin Ho teaches him the new moves.)

1693
01:19:46,886 --> 01:19:48,986
- Two, three, four. - Two, three, four.

1694
01:19:49,445 --> 01:19:52,455
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight.

1695
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,486
(Only 6 people practiced after Woong Ki was injured.)

1696
01:19:56,426 --> 01:19:59,356
(Practicing together as whole after Woong Ki joined)

1697
01:19:59,926 --> 01:20:02,566
(Thanks to the teammates who waited for him, )

1698
01:20:03,035 --> 01:20:05,294
(Woong Ki does his best.)

1699
01:20:05,295 --> 01:20:08,106
I don't have much time left.

1700
01:20:08,665 --> 01:20:09,745
But everyone on the team...

1701
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:12,276
is helping me.

1702
01:20:12,776 --> 01:20:16,005
I will pull it off,

1703
01:20:17,016 --> 01:20:18,176
so the audience won't notice.

1704
01:20:19,346 --> 01:20:22,146
Let's watch TEAM BEAT's performance. TEAM BEAT,

1705
01:20:22,245 --> 01:20:25,716
- are you ready? - Yes!

1706
01:20:25,816 --> 01:20:26,886
We're ready.

1707
01:20:27,356 --> 01:20:28,986
No more last place.

1708
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,495
I need help.

1709
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:34,026
I hope they pull it off.

1710
01:20:35,125 --> 01:20:36,405
I can't wait to watch TEAM BEAT.

1711
01:20:42,806 --> 01:20:45,236
We'll show our new side.

1712
01:20:45,436 --> 01:20:47,375
It'll be our chance...

1713
01:20:47,846 --> 01:20:49,276
to place first.

1714
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:51,745
"My, My, My" goes...

1715
01:20:52,075 --> 01:20:54,745
"Bet everything."

1716
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:57,815
All that time I spent working and practicing...

1717
01:20:57,816 --> 01:21:01,026
I'll head to the stage with a determination...

1718
01:21:01,226 --> 01:21:03,556
to bet my everything.

1719
01:21:04,556 --> 01:21:06,895
- Good luck! - Good luck!

1720
01:21:06,896 --> 01:21:08,995
- Good luck! - You can do it!

1721
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:12,266
Ready?

1722
01:21:12,795 --> 01:21:13,865
Go.

1723
01:21:18,835 --> 01:21:20,345
("My, My, My" by An Yul, Cha Woong Ki, Kairi, )

1724
01:21:20,346 --> 01:21:22,186
(Keum Jin Ho, Kim Hyo Tae, Nam Do Yoon, Yuito)

1725
01:21:32,915 --> 01:21:33,955
(Do Yoon)

1726
01:21:36,386 --> 01:21:38,154
(The secret weapon is the blindfold performance.)

1727
01:21:38,155 --> 01:21:40,395
(Shocked)

1728
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:41,466
Is that real?

1729
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:50,236
Oh, Kairi is crazy.

1730
01:22:07,325 --> 01:22:08,325
(Good job!)

1731
01:22:31,216 --> 01:22:32,316
(Do Yoon)

1732
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:38,226
(Shocked for the 2nd time)

1733
01:22:41,755 --> 01:22:42,955
I love it.

1734
01:22:58,436 --> 01:22:59,436
This is it!

1735
01:23:11,585 --> 01:23:12,615
Oh, so laid-back.

1736
01:23:42,016 --> 01:23:43,115
I love this song.

1737
01:23:55,726 --> 01:23:57,165
(Your face is your talent.)

1738
01:23:58,695 --> 01:24:00,035
Oh, my gosh. I like it.

1739
01:24:09,676 --> 01:24:10,676
(Go, Cha Woong Ki.)

1740
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:17,486
Oh, my gosh. Cha Woong Ki.

1741
01:24:17,655 --> 01:24:18,785
I really like this part.

1742
01:24:37,976 --> 01:24:42,245
(Everyone is cheering after the performance ends.)

1743
01:24:46,115 --> 01:24:48,146
(Good job, TEAM BEAT!)

1744
01:24:48,846 --> 01:24:50,246
That was better than the rehearsal.

1745
01:24:51,556 --> 01:24:52,556
I liked it.

1746
01:24:53,526 --> 01:24:59,596
(TEAM RHYTHM UNIT 1's players don't know what to say.)

1747
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:03,665
That was intense.

1748
01:25:04,335 --> 01:25:07,035
TEAM BEAT really clenched their teeth.

1749
01:25:07,705 --> 01:25:08,806
That was so cool.

1750
01:25:11,835 --> 01:25:13,744
Let's begin the voting.

1751
01:25:13,745 --> 01:25:16,404
The players' individual votes will be combined...

1752
01:25:16,405 --> 01:25:18,115
and reflected in the team score.

1753
01:25:19,176 --> 01:25:21,615
Hello. I'm TEAM BEAT's leader Keum Jin Ho.

1754
01:25:22,415 --> 01:25:23,855
I am sure you are all aware...

1755
01:25:23,856 --> 01:25:26,415
of the situation my team's currently in.

1756
01:25:26,825 --> 01:25:28,856
Please vote for us.

1757
01:25:30,396 --> 01:25:31,956
Is that how he appeals to the audience?

1758
01:25:32,325 --> 01:25:33,825
Please help us.

1759
01:25:35,195 --> 01:25:36,295
Please.

1760
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:38,565
Please vote for us.

1761
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:39,566
(TEAM BEAT players are appealing to pity.)

1762
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:42,035
- Vote! - Vote for us. Please.

1763
01:25:42,636 --> 01:25:44,034
(Let's vote.)

1764
01:25:44,035 --> 01:25:45,835
(Woong Ki's face is unbelievable.)

1765
01:25:46,776 --> 01:25:48,976
(Appealing with the fatal and sexy "My, My, My" dance)

1766
01:25:49,676 --> 01:25:51,915
(Screaming)

1767
01:25:52,615 --> 01:25:53,685
No more.

1768
01:25:53,686 --> 01:25:54,686
(Satisfied 423 percent)

1769
01:25:54,686 --> 01:25:55,686
He's good.

1770
01:25:56,186 --> 01:25:58,356
- He's cute. I'd vote for him. - Me too.

1771
01:25:59,186 --> 01:26:01,185
- Vote for us. - Five, four,

1772
01:26:01,186 --> 01:26:04,255
- I want you bad - three, two, one.

1773
01:26:04,396 --> 01:26:08,995
The voting is over.

1774
01:26:09,495 --> 01:26:10,566
That was good.

1775
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:12,494
Nice.

1776
01:26:12,495 --> 01:26:14,035
Kenta, you were better.

1777
01:26:14,466 --> 01:26:16,466
- What? - Your abs were better.

1778
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:18,875
Thank you.

1779
01:26:20,005 --> 01:26:22,105
Go naked for the finals.

1780
01:26:22,106 --> 01:26:23,815
(Joking)

1781
01:26:23,816 --> 01:26:25,715
(TEAM GROOVE's strategy to win)

1782
01:26:25,716 --> 01:26:27,084
- Completely. - One more time?

1783
01:26:27,085 --> 01:26:28,186
Take off your pants too.

1784
01:26:29,915 --> 01:26:31,154
- We're back. - We're back.

1785
01:26:31,155 --> 01:26:32,885
- We're back. - I don't remember how I did it.

1786
01:26:32,886 --> 01:26:34,601
- Good job. - It was better than the rehearsal.

1787
01:26:34,625 --> 01:26:35,725
- I was nervous. - Why do you get nervous...

1788
01:26:35,726 --> 01:26:36,824
when you're good?

1789
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:38,494
You didn't look nervous onstage.

1790
01:26:38,495 --> 01:26:40,364
- Thank you. - Good job.

1791
01:26:40,365 --> 01:26:42,765
It was the loudest cheer we had so far.

1792
01:26:42,766 --> 01:26:45,034
- Yes. It was so loud. - They were cheering so loud.

1793
01:26:45,035 --> 01:26:47,364
- Right? - It was the loudest.

1794
01:26:47,365 --> 01:26:48,365
I know.

1795
01:26:48,466 --> 01:26:50,275
The sky will determine the result.

1796
01:26:50,276 --> 01:26:51,435
- Yes. - Good job.

1797
01:26:51,436 --> 01:26:53,235
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1798
01:26:53,236 --> 01:26:54,622
(Will TEAM BEAT be able to avoid placing last?)

1799
01:26:54,646 --> 01:26:57,115
- Let's go. - You can do it.

1800
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:58,415
Let's go!

1801
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:00,745
- You can do it. - We got this!

1802
01:27:01,285 --> 01:27:02,845
- We can do it. - We got this.

1803
01:27:02,846 --> 01:27:04,955
- Good luck. - You must place first.

1804
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:07,055
Good luck. No pressure.

1805
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:08,385
- Thank you. - Place first.

1806
01:27:08,386 --> 01:27:09,754
- You must place first. - Yes.

1807
01:27:09,755 --> 01:27:11,255
We'll come back first place.

1808
01:27:11,795 --> 01:27:13,895
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1809
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:15,494
- Good luck. - Good luck.

1810
01:27:15,495 --> 01:27:17,066
- Let's place first. - Wish me luck.

1811
01:27:17,436 --> 01:27:18,736
Waiting for victory.

1812
01:27:19,865 --> 01:27:21,236
TEAM RHYTHM, please come out.

1813
01:27:23,106 --> 01:27:24,436
(Who is in...)

1814
01:27:24,736 --> 01:27:26,075
(TEAM RHYTHM's unit?)

1815
01:27:27,806 --> 01:27:31,414
We placed 2nd in Rounds 1 and 2.

1816
01:27:31,415 --> 01:27:34,944
So we put in extra effort this time.

1817
01:27:34,945 --> 01:27:38,055
First place will be ours.

1818
01:27:38,056 --> 01:27:40,825
I'm here to smash the stage.

1819
01:27:45,556 --> 01:27:46,966
(Spotting her favorite)

1820
01:27:47,825 --> 01:27:50,495
(Zhang Shuaibo)

1821
01:27:55,106 --> 01:27:58,306
Chih En!

1822
01:27:58,705 --> 01:28:00,944
Oh, Chih En is crazy.

1823
01:28:00,945 --> 01:28:02,176
Let's say hello.

1824
01:28:02,476 --> 01:28:03,515
Two, three.

1825
01:28:03,516 --> 01:28:05,374
- Who are we? - RHYTHM.

1826
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,385
(Cute)

1827
01:28:07,386 --> 01:28:09,284
Hello. We're TEAM RHYTHM.

1828
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:10,856
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1829
01:28:11,716 --> 01:28:13,315
(TEAM RHYTHM's cute greeting)

1830
01:28:13,316 --> 01:28:15,655
Can you introduce yourselves 1 by 1?

1831
01:28:15,755 --> 01:28:16,925
I'm Steven.

1832
01:28:16,926 --> 01:28:18,025
(Steven)

1833
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,225
(Steven)

1834
01:28:19,226 --> 01:28:20,995
I'm Zhang Shuaibo.

1835
01:28:23,026 --> 01:28:24,335
I'm Chih En.

1836
01:28:24,736 --> 01:28:26,235
(Chih En)

1837
01:28:26,236 --> 01:28:28,066
Hello. I'm Xie Yuxin.

1838
01:28:28,606 --> 01:28:29,865
I'm Ayumu.

1839
01:28:30,535 --> 01:28:31,976
I'm JL.

1840
01:28:32,636 --> 01:28:33,904
I'm Daisuke.

1841
01:28:33,905 --> 01:28:35,074
Daisuke!

1842
01:28:35,075 --> 01:28:36,606
(So cute!)

1843
01:28:38,445 --> 01:28:40,176
It's the strong team.

1844
01:28:40,386 --> 01:28:44,556
(TEAM RHYTHM always missed 1st place by a whisker.)

1845
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:46,855
They're all elite members.

1846
01:28:46,856 --> 01:28:49,026
I can't wait to see their performance.

1847
01:28:49,455 --> 01:28:50,825
What's their concept?

1848
01:28:51,795 --> 01:28:54,225
Maybe a festival?

1849
01:28:54,226 --> 01:28:55,771
(Their outfits are different from their regular outfits.)

1850
01:28:55,795 --> 01:28:57,896
They're always wearing red.

1851
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:01,504
Today, we're going to sing "Roller Coaster."

1852
01:29:01,505 --> 01:29:04,675
It depicts the dizzy emotional change from love...

1853
01:29:04,676 --> 01:29:06,636
through a roller coaster.

1854
01:29:06,905 --> 01:29:08,305
(Excited)

1855
01:29:08,306 --> 01:29:09,846
Chih En.

1856
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:13,985
I heard it was something your team never tried before.

1857
01:29:13,986 --> 01:29:16,114
What kind of genre is this?

1858
01:29:16,115 --> 01:29:17,614
If we put on performances...

1859
01:29:17,615 --> 01:29:20,386
with intense dances so far,

1860
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:23,154
this time, it's fresh...

1861
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:26,155
and bright.

1862
01:29:26,325 --> 01:29:28,124
(Like me.)

1863
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:30,026
(Screaming)

1864
01:29:30,226 --> 01:29:32,095
You'll get to watch our new...

1865
01:29:32,096 --> 01:29:34,566
- cha... What? - What?

1866
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:36,766
- What? - Our new charms.

1867
01:29:37,306 --> 01:29:39,704
All right. I'll look forward to something fresh.

1868
01:29:39,705 --> 01:29:40,744
(Shy)

1869
01:29:40,745 --> 01:29:44,345
As soon as TEAM RHYTHM heard the song,

1870
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:48,084
they said it was a perfect song for Daisuke.

1871
01:29:48,085 --> 01:29:50,455
What's the reason, Daisuke?

1872
01:29:50,716 --> 01:29:55,255
Because I'm confident in cute songs and expressions.

1873
01:29:56,825 --> 01:29:58,856
So I thought it was made for me.

1874
01:29:59,056 --> 01:30:01,865
Then can you show us...

1875
01:30:02,026 --> 01:30:04,194
- your cute expressions? - Okay.

1876
01:30:04,195 --> 01:30:05,795
- Just an example. - Sure.

1877
01:30:05,896 --> 01:30:07,065
(Looking forward to it)

1878
01:30:07,066 --> 01:30:09,364
- All right. Are you ready? - Yes.

1879
01:30:09,365 --> 01:30:10,736
One, two, three.

1880
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:12,904
(Fresh and cute)

1881
01:30:12,905 --> 01:30:13,944
Two, three.

1882
01:30:13,945 --> 01:30:15,545
(Daisuke cute act)

1883
01:30:16,205 --> 01:30:18,015
(It's making women...)

1884
01:30:18,016 --> 01:30:19,976
(pass out.)

1885
01:30:21,486 --> 01:30:24,085
- He's cute. - He knows what women like.

1886
01:30:25,516 --> 01:30:26,555
(He's melting other players too.)

1887
01:30:26,556 --> 01:30:27,955
- So cute. - You're cute.

1888
01:30:28,825 --> 01:30:30,954
Good. Nice.

1889
01:30:30,955 --> 01:30:34,494
JL. I heard you had a different resolution...

1890
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:36,895
for this song. What was your resolution?

1891
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:40,635
TEAM RHYTHM always placed second.

1892
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:44,175
We failed to protect our members.

1893
01:30:44,176 --> 01:30:46,175
So we're going to place first this time.

1894
01:30:46,176 --> 01:30:50,775
We practiced so much...

1895
01:30:50,776 --> 01:30:52,976
to protect our team.

1896
01:30:53,346 --> 01:30:56,386
Second place is not an option for RHYTHM anymore.

1897
01:30:57,356 --> 01:30:59,316
No more second place.

1898
01:30:59,556 --> 01:31:01,284
You'll place first to protect the team.

1899
01:31:01,285 --> 01:31:02,325
Sounds good.

1900
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:04,896
"No more 2nd place?" We want to place 2nd at least.

1901
01:31:05,096 --> 01:31:06,925
Yes. We want to place second at least.

1902
01:31:06,926 --> 01:31:08,266
- Let's switch. - Let's switch.

1903
01:31:12,535 --> 01:31:14,364
(After placing 2nd for the 2nd time)

1904
01:31:14,365 --> 01:31:16,306
(Biting his lips)

1905
01:31:17,606 --> 01:31:19,905
"Here we go again." To be honest...

1906
01:31:20,905 --> 01:31:22,175
And I predicted it.

1907
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:23,475
Like it's Park Ju Won.

1908
01:31:23,476 --> 01:31:24,476
(That Park Ju Won's name would be said.)

1909
01:31:24,477 --> 01:31:26,216
(Dispirited)

1910
01:31:26,516 --> 01:31:29,886
(During the Round 2 trade)

1911
01:31:30,556 --> 01:31:32,185
(It's Park Ju Won.)

1912
01:31:32,186 --> 01:31:33,685
(Park Ju Won was traded to TEAM GROOVE.)

1913
01:31:33,686 --> 01:31:36,125
(Park Ju Won)

1914
01:31:36,686 --> 01:31:37,855
It's Park Ju Won.

1915
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,995
(Everyone is shocked.)

1916
01:31:40,566 --> 01:31:44,436
(Park Ju Won was one of the key players.)

1917
01:31:45,495 --> 01:31:50,535
(JL was devastated...)

1918
01:31:51,106 --> 01:31:54,146
(to trade Ju Won unexpectedly.)

1919
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:56,004
It's really hard.

1920
01:31:56,005 --> 01:31:59,315
I really wanted to avoid this moment. Always.

1921
01:31:59,316 --> 01:32:00,375
So,

1922
01:32:00,986 --> 01:32:02,914
on the next mission, we'll make sure that...

1923
01:32:02,915 --> 01:32:06,585
we're the team to do this to other teams.

1924
01:32:07,386 --> 01:32:08,655
We must place first.

1925
01:32:10,755 --> 01:32:11,895
Again?

1926
01:32:11,896 --> 01:32:13,525
(Another determined player, Steven)

1927
01:32:13,526 --> 01:32:14,896
Other people...

1928
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:18,395
might hate me,

1929
01:32:18,396 --> 01:32:20,535
but I'm going to make them...

1930
01:32:21,365 --> 01:32:23,205
practice hard without a break.

1931
01:32:25,405 --> 01:32:27,245
Zhang Shuaibo.

1932
01:32:27,945 --> 01:32:29,705
- Look this way. - Okay.

1933
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:33,476
I pointed out every mistake, 1 by 1.

1934
01:32:33,646 --> 01:32:36,185
I felt bad.

1935
01:32:36,186 --> 01:32:39,655
Still, I'm thankful for their cooperation.

1936
01:32:40,386 --> 01:32:43,794
I decided to place first no matter what.

1937
01:32:43,795 --> 01:32:45,395
(I decided to place 1st no matter what.)

1938
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:47,995
Never felt before

1939
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:49,664
(No more 2nd place for TEAM RHYTHM)

1940
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:51,595
Okay!

1941
01:32:51,596 --> 01:32:52,865
Like it more

1942
01:32:53,195 --> 01:32:56,466
If we are to be second again,

1943
01:32:56,566 --> 01:32:58,435
it'll be so frustrating.

1944
01:32:58,436 --> 01:33:00,405
And I can't let that happen.

1945
01:33:01,476 --> 01:33:02,544
Down.

1946
01:33:02,545 --> 01:33:05,516
(JL gives a private dance lesson.)

1947
01:33:06,445 --> 01:33:07,445
Chih En.

1948
01:33:09,045 --> 01:33:10,655
When I do this,

1949
01:33:10,816 --> 01:33:12,356
I think you need to hold here.

1950
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:15,754
(Do you want to try together?)

1951
01:33:15,755 --> 01:33:18,695
- Nice tension - Here?

1952
01:33:19,926 --> 01:33:22,095
No, like this.

1953
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,425
(JL points out even the smallest detail.)

1954
01:33:23,426 --> 01:33:24,936
- Go. - Oh, okay.

1955
01:33:26,066 --> 01:33:27,704
Okay.

1956
01:33:27,705 --> 01:33:29,504
(The move improved thanks to JL.)

1957
01:33:29,505 --> 01:33:31,176
- Okay. - Okay.

1958
01:33:31,705 --> 01:33:32,806
Oh, yes.

1959
01:33:33,736 --> 01:33:36,404
Steven, we discovered something.

1960
01:33:36,405 --> 01:33:38,125
(When he got an idea he was super excited.)

1961
01:33:38,276 --> 01:33:39,276
All right.

1962
01:33:39,277 --> 01:33:40,544
This part will be...

1963
01:33:40,545 --> 01:33:42,715
better with isolation.

1964
01:33:42,716 --> 01:33:44,816
(JL aims for 1st place with passion.)

1965
01:33:45,016 --> 01:33:48,886
Since this is the last round of the league match,

1966
01:33:48,986 --> 01:33:51,725
everyone wants to place first.

1967
01:33:51,726 --> 01:33:54,865
Everyone changed a lot.

1968
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:56,395
With a thump.

1969
01:33:56,396 --> 01:33:57,835
(After the passionate practice)

1970
01:33:58,795 --> 01:34:01,305
Daisuke.

1971
01:34:01,306 --> 01:34:03,066
- Yes. - You are good with expressing.

1972
01:34:03,636 --> 01:34:07,035
So we need something new.

1973
01:34:07,276 --> 01:34:09,045
(When selecting the final 7)

1974
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:13,575
(Fresh looks)

1975
01:34:14,216 --> 01:34:16,516
(So cute)

1976
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:22,755
(Daisuke put on a cute face for the song...)

1977
01:34:23,155 --> 01:34:25,255
(and made the directors happy.)

1978
01:34:25,926 --> 01:34:27,426
I noticed it today.

1979
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:30,195
There's something new about Daisuke.

1980
01:34:30,426 --> 01:34:31,995
You improved so much.

1981
01:34:32,335 --> 01:34:33,365
(Thumbs-up)

1982
01:34:33,736 --> 01:34:35,065
It was very cute.

1983
01:34:35,066 --> 01:34:37,534
Other people would agree...

1984
01:34:37,535 --> 01:34:40,205
that it's cute. I liked it.

1985
01:34:40,476 --> 01:34:41,776
Thank you.

1986
01:34:41,976 --> 01:34:44,215
"Roller Coaster" is basically Daisuke's song.

1987
01:34:44,216 --> 01:34:46,915
It's like this song was made for Daisuke.

1988
01:34:47,115 --> 01:34:48,614
And Zhang Shuaibo.

1989
01:34:48,615 --> 01:34:49,646
(And Zhang Shuaibo!)

1990
01:34:49,745 --> 01:34:53,216
To be honest, I was shocked.

1991
01:34:53,686 --> 01:34:56,825
Zhang Shuaibo improved so much.

1992
01:34:57,226 --> 01:34:58,526
(To make it in the final 7)

1993
01:34:59,255 --> 01:35:03,695
(Zhang Shuaibo made so much effort.)

1994
01:35:04,936 --> 01:35:07,612
(As a master of expressions, he puts on a refreshing look perfectly.)

1995
01:35:07,636 --> 01:35:13,435
His gestures and expressions matched this song perfectly.

1996
01:35:13,436 --> 01:35:16,374
He grabs attention onstage.

1997
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:20,045
He seems to have his own sense of ease when performing onstage.

1998
01:35:20,445 --> 01:35:24,085
(Expression masters captured the hearts of both directors.)

1999
01:35:24,356 --> 01:35:25,556
Daisuke, show your expression.

2000
01:35:26,356 --> 01:35:27,856
Well...

2001
01:35:28,926 --> 01:35:30,325
I pose cutely.

2002
01:35:31,295 --> 01:35:36,026
I think posing cutely is the way to go.

2003
01:35:37,335 --> 01:35:39,495
(Promoting himself)

2004
01:35:40,136 --> 01:35:43,765
(We need to see Zhang Shuaibo's expressions too.)

2005
01:35:43,766 --> 01:35:44,775
Oh, something like that.

2006
01:35:44,776 --> 01:35:46,935
(That's nice.)

2007
01:35:46,936 --> 01:35:49,244
I wink too.

2008
01:35:49,245 --> 01:35:50,915
Then the fans will react like this.

2009
01:35:51,716 --> 01:35:53,574
(Exactly!)

2010
01:35:53,575 --> 01:35:56,186
- You're so good. - Seriously? Thank you.

2011
01:35:56,516 --> 01:35:59,016
(In the meantime)

2012
01:35:59,316 --> 01:36:01,856
(He glances at Zhang Shuaibo.)

2013
01:36:02,386 --> 01:36:04,096
(He glances at Daisuke.)

2014
01:36:04,655 --> 01:36:06,995
(Chih En keeps glancing at them.)

2015
01:36:07,255 --> 01:36:09,795
For me, facial expressions...

2016
01:36:09,896 --> 01:36:12,066
are my weakest part.

2017
01:36:13,365 --> 01:36:15,266
For Chih En,

2018
01:36:15,365 --> 01:36:19,334
you need more dynamic facial expressions.

2019
01:36:19,335 --> 01:36:22,944
Now, you only have one expression.

2020
01:36:22,945 --> 01:36:24,575
- Yes. - People who watch you...

2021
01:36:24,776 --> 01:36:27,276
won't know what's on your mind.

2022
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:30,285
It even seems like a sad song.

2023
01:36:31,516 --> 01:36:34,454
I hope you can be a bit brighter.

2024
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:35,455
(He needs to practice expressing brightly for the stage.)

2025
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:38,794
But for this round, I will practice properly...

2026
01:36:38,795 --> 01:36:40,625
and show what I've got.

2027
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:42,495
(Peeking)

2028
01:36:43,295 --> 01:36:46,635
(Chih En's observation of Daisuke started since then.)

2029
01:36:46,636 --> 01:36:50,874
(Chih En's observation of Daisuke started since then.)

2030
01:36:50,875 --> 01:36:52,875
Daisuke, show me your facial expressions.

2031
01:36:56,705 --> 01:37:00,276
(A vending machine of expressions that delivers on demand)

2032
01:37:00,846 --> 01:37:03,261
(He learns about facial expressions from the youngest member.)

2033
01:37:03,285 --> 01:37:05,516
(He tries it himself immediately.)

2034
01:37:06,655 --> 01:37:10,624
(He practices expressing whenever he can.)

2035
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:15,466
I want to show people that I have various facial expressions.

2036
01:37:16,596 --> 01:37:18,311
(Chih En, your facial expressions are great.)

2037
01:37:18,335 --> 01:37:19,335
(Chih En gains confidence in facial expressions.)

2038
01:37:19,336 --> 01:37:20,806
Firstly, I'll...

2039
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:25,136
(UNIT 1 of TEAM RHYHM is at the final stages of practice.)

2040
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:29,575
I'll make TEAM RHYTHM win.

2041
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:34,485
Since I joined Universe League,

2042
01:37:34,486 --> 01:37:36,045
I've never won the first place.

2043
01:37:36,415 --> 01:37:39,356
So if I don't win this time,

2044
01:37:39,856 --> 01:37:42,625
my pride will hurt a lot.

2045
01:37:42,926 --> 01:37:45,856
I'll definitely win first place in this round.

2046
01:37:47,466 --> 01:37:50,625
Let's see TEAM RHYTHM's stage now.

2047
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:54,034
TEAM RHYTHM, are you ready?

2048
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:55,705
(There are high expectations.)

2049
01:37:56,035 --> 01:37:58,435
What would a stage set up only with the team's aces be like?

2050
01:37:58,505 --> 01:37:59,676
I'm looking forward to it.

2051
01:38:00,176 --> 01:38:02,646
(How will TEAM RHYTHM's UNIT 1 perform?)

2052
01:38:02,976 --> 01:38:05,645
No matter what will happen, I will...

2053
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:08,346
We will do everything to win.

2054
01:38:08,986 --> 01:38:11,655
I did my best practicing.

2055
01:38:12,016 --> 01:38:14,155
I'll do my best with the aim to win the first place.

2056
01:38:16,026 --> 01:38:17,625
Zhang Shuaibo, you can do it!

2057
01:38:18,295 --> 01:38:20,455
- You can do it! - Ready?

2058
01:38:21,266 --> 01:38:22,295
Go.

2059
01:38:23,495 --> 01:38:24,636
Let's go.

2060
01:38:28,335 --> 01:38:30,534
("Roller Coaster" by Ayumu, Chih En, Daisuke, JL, Steven, )

2061
01:38:30,535 --> 01:38:31,606
(Xie Yuxin, Zhang Shuaibo)

2062
01:38:42,646 --> 01:38:44,086
Why is Chih En better looking today?

2063
01:38:59,636 --> 01:39:00,636
He's full of charms.

2064
01:39:07,646 --> 01:39:09,646
Since when did Steven know how to act cute?

2065
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,856
He's cute.

2066
01:39:33,936 --> 01:39:35,806
Wasn't Chih En's personal color blue?

2067
01:39:35,905 --> 01:39:37,165
Maybe it was red after all.

2068
01:39:49,245 --> 01:39:50,245
(Amazed)

2069
01:40:01,596 --> 01:40:03,695
- He's cute. - This song is for Daisuke.

2070
01:40:14,405 --> 01:40:15,476
He's cute.

2071
01:40:20,945 --> 01:40:22,085
(Chih En is my MVP.)

2072
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:39,966
That's mine.

2073
01:40:52,575 --> 01:40:53,745
He's really cute.

2074
01:41:00,285 --> 01:41:01,625
This team nailed the concept.

2075
01:41:12,136 --> 01:41:13,576
(You're cute. Do you want to debut?)

2076
01:41:20,205 --> 01:41:21,205
(Chih En)

2077
01:41:36,285 --> 01:41:39,926
- You're so cute! - You're amazing!

2078
01:41:40,026 --> 01:41:43,096
- You're handsome! - So cute!

2079
01:41:45,636 --> 01:41:47,834
(TEAM RHYTHM is great.)

2080
01:41:47,835 --> 01:41:48,835
Good!

2081
01:41:49,905 --> 01:41:51,936
(We believed in you.)

2082
01:41:52,505 --> 01:41:54,346
(Satisfied)

2083
01:41:54,705 --> 01:41:57,075
It's my first time seeing TEAM RHYTHM perform like this.

2084
01:41:57,846 --> 01:41:58,846
It's quite different.

2085
01:41:58,847 --> 01:42:02,114
- But it suits them well. - Yes.

2086
01:42:02,115 --> 01:42:04,386
It suits them well, and they're good at it.

2087
01:42:05,016 --> 01:42:07,726
(There is tension within TEAM GROOVE.)

2088
01:42:08,125 --> 01:42:10,686
Everyone's level of perfection is high.

2089
01:42:10,886 --> 01:42:12,766
I was completely immersed in both performances.

2090
01:42:13,396 --> 01:42:15,095
It felt like I was just watching as the audience.

2091
01:42:15,096 --> 01:42:17,616
(Both TEAM BEAT and TEAM RHYTHM's performance was outstanding.)

2092
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:22,105
Thanks for your efforts. They were TEAM RHYTHM!

2093
01:42:22,106 --> 01:42:23,164
Thank you for your work.

2094
01:42:23,165 --> 01:42:25,935
(UNIT 1 of TEAM RHYTHM presented a cute concept for the 1st time.)

2095
01:42:25,936 --> 01:42:28,074
Let's start voting now.

2096
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:29,405
(On-site voting, start)

2097
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:32,345
How can you not vote for me...

2098
01:42:32,346 --> 01:42:33,875
after seeing me like this?

2099
01:42:34,545 --> 01:42:36,716
Even after this?

2100
01:42:37,646 --> 01:42:38,655
Even after this?

2101
01:42:39,615 --> 01:42:41,925
- Please vote for me. - Yes!

2102
01:42:41,926 --> 01:42:43,785
(My votes are for you.)

2103
01:42:43,955 --> 01:42:47,495
Please give me your votes as a present!

2104
01:42:47,825 --> 01:42:50,194
- Please give it to me. - Give it to me.

2105
01:42:50,195 --> 01:42:52,096
- Give it to me. - Daisuke.

2106
01:42:53,066 --> 01:42:57,904
(TEAM RHYTHM is continuing to show their cute charms.)

2107
01:42:57,905 --> 01:43:00,776
(TEAM RHYTHM is continuing to show their cute charms.)

2108
01:43:01,505 --> 01:43:04,645
Three, two, one!

2109
01:43:04,646 --> 01:43:05,646
All right.

2110
01:43:05,647 --> 01:43:07,885
We're stopping the vote now.

2111
01:43:07,886 --> 01:43:10,486
This was TEAM RHYTHM.

2112
01:43:11,415 --> 01:43:13,755
I'm not sure about this. Everyone did well.

2113
01:43:14,056 --> 01:43:16,655
I think we did well,

2114
01:43:17,285 --> 01:43:19,025
but TEAM BEAT and TEAM RHYTHM also did well.

2115
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,825
(Since this is Round 3, all teams perfected their performances.)

2116
01:43:22,365 --> 01:43:25,396
(Which team will win the 1st place?)

2117
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:29,004
(You did well.)

2118
01:43:29,005 --> 01:43:32,204
- You did so well. - My goodness.

2119
01:43:32,205 --> 01:43:33,905
(TEAM RHYTHM came back after performing.)

2120
01:43:33,936 --> 01:43:36,044
You did well.

2121
01:43:36,045 --> 01:43:38,216
- Chih En, you're seriously... - You did well.

2122
01:43:38,476 --> 01:43:40,715
After watching your performance,

2123
01:43:40,716 --> 01:43:42,545
- if I give you my honest feedback, - Yes?

2124
01:43:43,085 --> 01:43:45,516
The only regret is that everyone was too nervous.

2125
01:43:45,686 --> 01:43:48,855
- Yes, you're right. - You didn't enjoy performing.

2126
01:43:48,856 --> 01:43:51,355
Everyone looked so nervous.

2127
01:43:51,356 --> 01:43:55,195
I think the fans must've felt it too.

2128
01:43:56,695 --> 01:43:58,334
I'll announce...

2129
01:43:58,335 --> 01:44:00,695
the on-site interim voting results of the first unit match.

2130
01:44:00,896 --> 01:44:03,034
(Immediately like this?)

2131
01:44:03,035 --> 01:44:04,735
(Feeling nervous)

2132
01:44:04,736 --> 01:44:07,505
Here are the on-site interim voting results of the first unit match.

2133
01:44:07,676 --> 01:44:10,245
- What? Now? - My gosh. Wait. All of a sudden?

2134
01:44:11,045 --> 01:44:12,374
- Oh, my. The votes? - I'll announce...

2135
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:14,685
- the interim on-site voting result. - For real?

2136
01:44:14,686 --> 01:44:15,944
(Please.)

2137
01:44:15,945 --> 01:44:18,015
(Feeling nervous)

2138
01:44:18,016 --> 01:44:20,415
Because the audience responded so enthusiastically,

2139
01:44:21,016 --> 01:44:23,886
I thought, "Maybe we can really win this time."

2140
01:44:24,695 --> 01:44:26,025
Get ready to applaud!

2141
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:27,895
- Yes, get your hands ready. - Look forward to the results.

2142
01:44:27,896 --> 01:44:29,026
Get ready to applaud!

2143
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:30,824
I think we can win.

2144
01:44:30,825 --> 01:44:34,466
It was a volume of cheers I had never heard before.

2145
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:36,435
- It was different. - You're right.

2146
01:44:36,766 --> 01:44:37,904
Seriously. Please.

2147
01:44:37,905 --> 01:44:39,105
(Please.)

2148
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,236
TEAM BEAT was too good.

2149
01:44:42,676 --> 01:44:44,776
Once again, we'll secure first place.

2150
01:44:49,204 --> 01:44:52,145
(Round 3 on-site voting)

2151
01:44:52,675 --> 01:44:53,774
(TEAM GROOVE earned 1,711 points.)

2152
01:44:53,775 --> 01:44:55,544
- That scared me. - That scared me too.

2153
01:44:55,744 --> 01:44:56,944
- What? - Is that high?

2154
01:44:57,584 --> 01:45:00,515
- Isn't it high? - I think it's high.

2155
01:45:00,755 --> 01:45:01,854
(TEAM BEAT's score is up next.)

2156
01:45:01,855 --> 01:45:02,884
Please.

2157
01:45:02,885 --> 01:45:04,453
(TEAM BEAT's score is up next.)

2158
01:45:04,454 --> 01:45:05,524
Please.

2159
01:45:05,525 --> 01:45:08,364
(Round 3 on-site voting)

2160
01:45:08,565 --> 01:45:10,464
(UNIT 1 match)

2161
01:45:10,465 --> 01:45:12,964
Hold on. But...

2162
01:45:12,965 --> 01:45:16,234
(TEAM BEAT got a lower score than TEAM GROOVE.)

2163
01:45:16,664 --> 01:45:21,175
(TEAM RHYTHM's score is revealed last.)

2164
01:45:22,544 --> 01:45:25,614
I really want our team to be first.

2165
01:45:26,145 --> 01:45:28,113
(Please.)

2166
01:45:28,114 --> 01:45:31,345
(Round 3 on-site voting)

2167
01:45:31,755 --> 01:45:36,784
(UNIT 1 match)

2168
01:45:37,185 --> 01:45:40,693
(TEAM GROOVE wins the UNIT 1 match of Round 3.)

2169
01:45:40,694 --> 01:45:45,135
(TEAM GROOVE wins the UNIT 1 match of Round 3.)

2170
01:45:45,794 --> 01:45:48,363
I knew it. The heart worked.

2171
01:45:48,364 --> 01:45:49,404
- Right? - Good job.

2172
01:45:50,234 --> 01:45:53,404
(TEAM RHYTHM ranked 2nd place again.)

2173
01:45:53,734 --> 01:45:54,775
It's okay.

2174
01:45:55,605 --> 01:45:58,104
- Great job, everyone. - Good job.

2175
01:45:58,105 --> 01:45:59,744
(Bummed out)

2176
01:46:01,345 --> 01:46:02,414
- What? - Hey!

2177
01:46:02,685 --> 01:46:04,584
- It's similar. - Not bad.

2178
01:46:04,815 --> 01:46:06,514
It's okay, guys. It's not bad at all.

2179
01:46:06,515 --> 01:46:07,515
(TEAM BEAT is only 12 votes behind.)

2180
01:46:07,516 --> 01:46:10,154
It was worth putting in our efforts.

2181
01:46:10,555 --> 01:46:11,823
We've really narrowed the gap.

2182
01:46:11,824 --> 01:46:14,654
- For real. - I'm proud of you.

2183
01:46:15,265 --> 01:46:17,064
- Great work. - What about first place?

2184
01:46:17,065 --> 01:46:18,464
The score isn't bad.

2185
01:46:18,465 --> 01:46:20,833
What's funny is how we think our score is fine...

2186
01:46:20,834 --> 01:46:23,733
and we're happy that our gap narrowed down...

2187
01:46:23,734 --> 01:46:24,764
despite coming in third.

2188
01:46:24,765 --> 01:46:27,733
It's you guys who narrowed the gap with your performance.

2189
01:46:27,734 --> 01:46:30,043
That's because of how well you performed.

2190
01:46:30,044 --> 01:46:31,744
(Can TEAM BEAT turn the tables?)

2191
01:46:31,975 --> 01:46:33,514
(As it's the last league match, )

2192
01:46:33,515 --> 01:46:35,484
(we'll come from behind and win.)

2193
01:46:39,914 --> 01:46:41,284
(They say you're on a roll.)

2194
01:46:41,555 --> 01:46:43,954
(TEAM BEAT's UNIT 2 performs with desperation.)

2195
01:46:45,755 --> 01:46:46,875
(We should brace ourselves.)

2196
01:46:47,994 --> 01:46:50,425
(TEAM BEAT's intense performance aims to turn the tables.)

2197
01:46:50,824 --> 01:46:52,265
(Nervous)

2198
01:46:52,664 --> 01:46:55,334
(TEAM BEAT's perfect performance tenses up both teams.)

2199
01:46:56,435 --> 01:46:59,374
(The winner of the last league match is finally revealed.)

2200
01:46:59,605 --> 01:47:01,674
- What? - Seriously?

2201
01:47:01,675 --> 01:47:04,443
(Is the result a big twist that shocks everyone?)

2202
01:47:04,444 --> 01:47:06,715
- Oh, my gosh! - Really?

2203
01:47:08,845 --> 01:47:10,044
(How is that possible?)

2204
01:47:10,645 --> 01:47:11,685
That's absurd.

2205
01:47:13,015 --> 01:47:14,355
We did it!

2206
01:47:18,355 --> 01:47:20,653
Did we get the wrong idea?

2207
01:47:20,654 --> 01:47:22,025
(Universe League)
