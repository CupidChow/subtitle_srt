1
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:03,641
Are you slacking off?

2
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:07,010
(Select the Elite 7 to win Round 3, Seven)

3
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:09,021
(You should be ashamed of yourself.)

4
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:12,691
(Jeong Woo, step down.)

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,321
(An objective decision by the directors to win)

6
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:20,130
(We can't have any more regrets.)

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,001
(I don't think we can come in 1st with this performance.)

8
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:27,530
(The directors change the players for the best unit.)

9
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:30,500
(I will announce the final seven.)

10
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:31,970
Universe League.

11
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:34,609
(The last league match by each team's elite unit)

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,580
Representing the teams...

13
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:39,481
(A fierce competition with the teams' pride on the line)

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,680
(Announcing UNIT 1's on-site score)

15
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,420
(Round 3 on-site voting)

16
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:44,489
(TEAM GROOVE placed 1st...)

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,791
(with their mellow confession.)

18
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:49,490
(TEAM RHYTHM placed 2nd again.)

19
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:52,261
(Let's turn the tables!)

20
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,731
(TEAM BEAT in 3rd place has scored a high point.)

21
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,070
(The score gap has narrowed immensely.)

22
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,170
(It's you guys who narrowed the gap with your performance.)

23
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,640
(Can TEAM BEAT win a losing game as hoped?)

24
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:11,779
Boys' dream match, Universe League.

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,809
(Universe League)

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,810
Are you ready?

27
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:19,091
Round Three, Seven.

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,290
I will now reveal...

29
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,660
UNIT TWO's lineup of each team.

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,990
First off, UNIT TWO of TEAM RHYTHM.

31
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:28,761
(Revealing the lineup for TEAM RHYTHM's UNIT 2)

32
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:33,030
(The day of the final Elite Seven selection)

33
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:36,200
All right. Shall we...

34
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:39,470
have a look at "Don't Hit The Brakes?"

35
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:43,309
(UNIT 2's 1st lineup: JL, Steven, Kim Dong Yun, )

36
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,981
(Zen Zen, Ayumu, Li Zhinuo, Eito)

37
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,290
We only ride looking ahead, never look back

38
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:55,321
(Skilled facial expressions with striking fierceness)

39
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:57,590
The song suits JL well.

40
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:59,859
So keep me wild, cross the line, gear up

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,931
All in my sight

42
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:08,839
(Kim Dong Yun seems unstable singing the high notes.)

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,040
Want to be just like me, go crazier, not easy

44
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,139
Think it's easy, and you get roasted harsher

45
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,150
(Steven's rap performance makes the directors smile.)

46
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:20,481
We don't want to hit the brakes

47
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:25,850
(How will the directors evaluate UNIT 2's performance?)

48
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:29,619
- Steven's rap has improved a lot. - Thank you.

49
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,490
- Really? Thank you. - I was shocked.

50
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:34,261
Right. First off...

51
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:37,500
JL, Steven,

52
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,970
(From UNIT 2's 1st lineup, JL and Steven)

53
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,300
and Zen Zen.

54
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,071
JL, Steven, and Zen Zen. You may step down.

55
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,740
- Thank you. - Thank you.

56
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:49,440
- Good luck. - Good luck.

57
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,441
- Good luck. - Good luck.

58
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:52,880
(Kim Dong Yun is at risk of getting replaced again.)

59
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,110
I wasn't satisfied at all.

60
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:56,251
I could've done a lot better.

61
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,951
Like last time, you can go up...

62
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,619
to the stage if you think you can ace it.

63
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,820
(The players to try head to the stage.)

64
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,261
Go up to the stage if you want to give it a shot.

65
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:16,670
It seemed like Dong Yun had a hard time hitting the high notes.

66
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,370
I thought I could sing it...

67
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,281
with more energy.

68
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,311
That was why I stood behind Dong Yun.

69
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:30,251
Many players were after my part.

70
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:31,549
But it was mine.

71
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,490
I want to perform as is.

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,890
I don't want it taken away.

73
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,730
(Daisuke versus Kim Dong Yun versus Zhang Shuaibo)

74
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,359
"Roller Coaster" and "Don't Hit The Brakes."

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,101
I will surely perform in both songs.

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,300
Of course, I want to defend it.

77
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,340
I want to keep performing the song.

78
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,610
I want to perform both songs.

79
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,380
- We only ride looking ahead - We only ride looking ahead

80
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,751
- Never look back - Never look back

81
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:06,821
- We can't be satisfied with this - We can't be satisfied with this

82
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,420
All my choices are right and no wrong

83
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:15,761
(Daisuke sings the high notes with confidence.)

84
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,130
(Still unstable in the high notes)

85
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:21,229
- Stay up until the end - Stay up until the end

86
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,071
We don't want to hit the brakes

87
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,811
(I prepared flower petals.)

88
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
What was that?

89
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,580
That was... You were a magician.

90
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,710
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,381
(Embarrassed)

92
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:38,420
He has a lot in his fist.

93
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,720
His fist has everything.

94
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,820
(Zhang Shuaibo's magical fist is like Doraemon's pocket.)

95
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:44,519
(You're cool, Zhang Shuaibo.)

96
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,790
That was a cool move.

97
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,730
(What is the fate of Kim Dong Yun who can't laugh?)

98
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:54,230
(Which group are the directors watching attentively this time?)

99
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:59,511
(Chih En versus Ayumu versus Mac)

100
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,209
- We only ride looking ahead - We only ride looking ahead

101
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,511
- Never look back - Never look back

102
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,580
- We can't be satisfied with this - We can't be satisfied with this

103
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:12,921
(A sharp evaluation to create the best unit)

104
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,360
- Shall we go on a rage? - Shall we go on a rage?

105
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:19,691
- Pour more gasoline - Pour more gasoline

106
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,560
- Stay up until the end - Stay up until the end

107
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,229
We don't want to hit the brakes

108
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,529
(The 3 players finish without a mistake.)

109
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,630
- Thank you. - Okay.

110
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,900
- Thank you. - Thank you.

111
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:31,099
Give us time. Give us a minute to discuss.

112
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,409
We'll come back with the result.

113
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,510
- Okay. - Okay.

114
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:34,511
(The directors are being careful.)

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,941
No other players can beat him.

116
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,381
From what I see.

117
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,420
- Then... - These four?

118
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:45,690
No. Let's go with this first, and then this.

119
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:46,691
Okay.

120
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:48,621
Okay.

121
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,890
All right.

122
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,900
Eito and...

123
00:05:58,671 --> 00:05:59,671
Ayumu.

124
00:06:00,131 --> 00:06:02,241
I'm sorry. Great work.

125
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:03,741
Thank you.

126
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,941
In their stead,

127
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,011
Daisuke and...

128
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:13,349
Zhang Shuaibo. Go up onstage.

129
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,880
(Daisuke and Zhang Shuaibo are chosen as final players.)

130
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:18,789
We have one more player left...

131
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,491
but have yet to decide on him.

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,261
(Who between the two can't perform?)

133
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:28,561
Can Dong Yun and Chih En...

134
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
What?

135
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:34,030
Perform the chorus part...

136
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,740
again?

137
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,539
- Okay. - Okay.

138
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,470
Hurry. Give it another shot.

139
00:06:43,741 --> 00:06:47,210
I thought about how I could stand out more in this one performance.

140
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,150
(Kim Dong Yun versus Chih En, the last chance to boost themselves)

141
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,729
We only ride looking ahead

142
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,890
Never look back

143
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:04,001
We can't be satisfied with this

144
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:05,270
All my choices

145
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,741
(Continuing to be unstable)

146
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,770
Burn it all down

147
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:14,470
Keep going until the end

148
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:15,839
Stay up until the end

149
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,340
We don't want to hit the brakes

150
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,649
- Thank you. - Thank you.

151
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,951
(An unconfident ending out of nervousness)

152
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,850
- Chih En. - Okay.

153
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,821
(Chih En's performance starts right away.)

154
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:35,860
(Anxious)

155
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:38,431
We don't want to hit the brakes

156
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
Shall we go on a rage?

157
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,400
Pour more gasoline

158
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,671
I keep going even when tired

159
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,510
Stay up until the end

160
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,080
We don't want to hit the brakes

161
00:07:51,611 --> 00:07:52,849
(Chih En wraps up neatly.)

162
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,951
Thank you.

163
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,451
- Thank you. - Thank you.

164
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:57,479
I choose him.

165
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,050
- Me too. - They're on a similar level.

166
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:00,149
- But... - I...

167
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,789
(The final decision takes longer to make.)

168
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,861
This player...

169
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:06,729
Earlier, he also pulled his part off well.

170
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,430
He didn't have this part before.

171
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:12,631
(Which player will be chosen as UNIT 2's final member?)

172
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,040
All right. Now then, the last member...

173
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,241
to join "Don't Hit The Brakes" is...

174
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,080
Chih En.

175
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,321
- Thank you. - Okay.

176
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:36,161
(Being switched out in both units, Kim Dong Yun can't perform.)

177
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:40,960
Let me tell you the reason.

178
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:44,160
Dong Yun. You're stable...

179
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:47,100
when you start.

180
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:51,541
But midway, we can feel how unstable you are.

181
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,610
You should work on your confidence more.

182
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,410
If you fix that for when you perform,

183
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:00,180
- Okay. - it'll be better for the future.

184
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,150
There were many parts where I couldn't focus on you.

185
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,280
Understood. Thank you.

186
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:05,590
Thank you.

187
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,260
I did my best.

188
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,230
But coming in first place is important. I'm okay.

189
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,801
I'll do better in the next performance.

190
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,250
Okay. We have to come in first place, right?

191
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,950
And compared to the other teams,

192
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:37,750
we have five players who won't perform in either song.

193
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:40,989
For the sake of the players who can't perform,

194
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,420
you should work much harder.

195
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,930
You earned the chance to perform in both songs,

196
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,489
but if you fail,

197
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,701
you must feel terrible for the players who couldn't perform.

198
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,770
Players performing in both songs should work harder.

199
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,470
It's only natural.

200
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:55,771
Understood.

201
00:09:58,441 --> 00:09:59,640
(UNIT 1: JL, Shuaibo, Steven, Chih En, Daisuke, Ayumu, Xie Yuxin)

202
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,771
(UNIT 2: JL, Shuaibo, Steven, Chih En, Daisuke, Zhinuo, Zen Zen)

203
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,181
They must be dying to win.

204
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,080
All of them are popular.

205
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,750
(TEAM RHYTHM is hoping to win with their strong lineup.)

206
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,191
Their lineup seemed more powerful.

207
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,590
TEAM RHYTHM was a big rival.

208
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,031
I will now reveal UNIT TWO of TEAM BEAT.

209
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,701
I bet Woong Ki will be in both songs.

210
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:26,401
TEAM BEAT's UNIT ONE...

211
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,869
and UNIT TWO are identical.

212
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,900
(TEAM BEAT's UNIT 1 and UNIT 2 are identical.)

213
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:31,910
What?

214
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:35,209
(TEAM BEAT formed the units with the starting lineup.)

215
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,710
They're the same players.

216
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,010
As we only have nine players,

217
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,380
we decided to use the starting lineup in both units.

218
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,750
(The final lineup is solely with the starting lineup.)

219
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:49,790
Lastly, I will reveal UNIT TWO of TEAM GROOVE.

220
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,791
(The 7 of TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 2)

221
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,970
(The only switched player of Team "Only U" is Seo Jeong Woo.)

222
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:02,000
Prepare for "Butterfly."

223
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,141
- Yes. - Yes.

224
00:11:04,901 --> 00:11:06,441
- Good luck. - Butterfly

225
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:13,911
(The reserves watch them from the seats.)

226
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,579
(UNIT 2's 1st lineup:)

227
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,950
(Park Han, Kwon Hee Jun, )

228
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,349
(Sirin, Koo Han Seo, )

229
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,849
(Kenta, Jang Kyung Ho, )

230
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,291
(Kim Joo Hyoung)

231
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,771
(Putting aside their nervousness, the players perform.)

232
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,370
What I want

233
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:37,999
The sun is shining on you and me

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,609
(Kim Joo Hyung can't hit the high notes.)

235
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,110
To the clouds

236
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,550
(The performance continues with tension.)

237
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:49,880
Do you want to join me?

238
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,589
I'll take you there

239
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,619
(The interim check ends.)

240
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,620
Okay.

241
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,629
Okay. Please stand behind them.

242
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,630
- Okay. - Okay.

243
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:11,810
(The contenders go up onstage.)

244
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:14,210
(The contenders go up onstage.)

245
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,610
"Butterfly" was a chance for me.

246
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:25,051
(2 weeks ago, the day of dividing the parts for "Butterfly")

247
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:29,691
(Highly interested)

248
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,391
When I saw the choreography and the parts,

249
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:36,531
I thought had to perform the song.

250
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:41,840
(Jeong Woo also prepared "Butterfly" while preparing for UNIT 1.)

251
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,940
(With small hope, )

252
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:48,541
(he practiced again and again to perform UNIT 2's song.)

253
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,181
Rather than giving up without trying,

254
00:12:51,411 --> 00:12:52,650
it seemed right to give up...

255
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:54,250
only if all the hard work wasn't enough.

256
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,150
- Jeong Woo. - Yes.

257
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:05,730
(Seo Jeong Woo is up first.)

258
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,271
If I could show him how good I am by putting in the work,

259
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:15,030
I figured there was a chance...

260
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,771
that he would choose me.

261
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,641
I'm glad to have you in my life

262
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:25,281
(Jeong Woo calmly sings the song he practiced.)

263
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,580
Can't be done alone

264
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,890
(He didn't give up on the high notes he wasn't confident about...)

265
00:13:31,891 --> 00:13:33,291
(and managed to hit them.)

266
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,950
(Director Lee is proud to see Jeong Woo's hard work.)

267
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,260
- Okay. - Thank you.

268
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:48,470
I was waiting for my name to be called...

269
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:49,840
with a 0.01 percent hope.

270
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:51,141
- Jae Ho. - Yes.

271
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:54,040
(Next up is Bae Jae Ho.)

272
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,480
This was an opportunity,

273
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:59,480
and I wanted to secure a spot for myself.

274
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,290
What I want can't be done alone

275
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:11,760
(Jae Ho makes sure to precisely sing each note correctly.)

276
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,191
Okay.

277
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,531
Thank you.

278
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,130
Please...

279
00:14:17,661 --> 00:14:20,571
I only thought about how I wanted to perform.

280
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,969
- Dae Yun. - Yes.

281
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,140
(Next up is Kim Dae Yun.)

282
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,610
Spread your wings

283
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,510
(Suddenly, he stops singing.)

284
00:14:29,811 --> 00:14:31,781
(Careful)

285
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:35,421
(He sings the song he practiced enthusiastically.)

286
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,850
(But there are sections he won't sing.)

287
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,150
- Okay. - Thank you.

288
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:39,651
(Director Lee doesn't say anything about it.)

289
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:41,651
- Gi Joong. - Yes.

290
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:45,531
(Next up is Kim Gi Joong.)

291
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:48,830
I was desperate,

292
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,531
so I practiced a lot...

293
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:56,071
to prove myself to Director Lee.

294
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:05,550
I'm glad to have you in my life, once again

295
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:06,750
(Like Dae Yun, he doesn't sing certain sections.)

296
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,510
What I want

297
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:10,920
(To prove himself, )

298
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:14,720
(Gi Joong tries his best.)

299
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,561
(However! He stops singing again.)

300
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,191
(Glancing)

301
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,860
Like a butterfly

302
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,869
Hold on. There's something I must ask.

303
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,201
(There's something I must ask.)

304
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,500
Why are you skipping sections as you please?

305
00:15:33,071 --> 00:15:36,209
(Director Lee is angry with their attitude.)

306
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,849
Gi Joong, have you been practicing your singing...

307
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,750
with your hand here like I instructed?

308
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,781
- Yes, I've been doing that. - Then why...

309
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:49,160
haven't I seen any progress?

310
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,720
(Harsh criticism is delivered for not showing progress.)

311
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:56,729
I practiced my heart out,

312
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,230
but to Director Lee's ears,

313
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,401
my singing was a mess.

314
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:03,970
That...

315
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,041
made me sad.

316
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,571
Really sad.

317
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,980
Three members will be swapped from Team "Butterfly."

318
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:18,550
Got it.

319
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:21,850
(Director Lee takes the risk of swapping out multiple members.)

320
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:25,860
A sliver of hope presented itself.

321
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,759
All I wanted was one of the spots to be mine.

322
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,031
(Please let one of the spots be mine.)

323
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:36,801
- Hee Jun. - Yes?

324
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:38,400
- Hee Jun, step down. - Okay.

325
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:41,771
(Kwon Hee Jun is taken off UNIT 2.)

326
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,010
With Hee Jun gone,

327
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,651
maybe I could be the one taking his spot.

328
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:48,480
- Jae Ho. - Yes?

329
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,749
- Get up there. - Got it.

330
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,980
(UNIT 2 swaps out Kwon Hee Jun for Bae Jae Ho.)

331
00:16:58,421 --> 00:16:59,431
Han Seo, step down.

332
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,730
(Koo Han Seo is taken off UNIT 2)

333
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,830
(The reserves await their chance.)

334
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:08,030
Han Seo was removed,

335
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,270
so who could take his place?

336
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,871
Jeong Woo, get up there.

337
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,870
Jeong Woo.

338
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:20,081
(UNIT 2 swaps out Koo Han Seo for Seo Jeong Woo.)

339
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,020
(And the last member to be replaced)

340
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,391
Joo Hyoung, step down.

341
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,560
(Kim Joo Hyoung is taken off UNIT 2)

342
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:36,630
(The only chance to perform...)

343
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:41,901
(lies with the last spot of this team.)

344
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:43,701
Gi Joong, get up there.

345
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:48,441
(UNIT 2 swaps out Kim Joo Hyoung for Kim Gi Joong.)

346
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:53,250
(Joo Hyoung was replaced and lost his chance to perform.)

347
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:55,381
My heart...

348
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,651
ached. It was like...

349
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:02,161
I had lost everything and was empty inside.

350
00:18:03,161 --> 00:18:06,259
This is my toughest day yet on Universe League.

351
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,631
(This is my toughest day yet on Universe League.)

352
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,299
Of course, it was a bummer.

353
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,671
(It was a bummer.)

354
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:18,840
(The final draft for TEAM GROOVE...)

355
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:21,510
(had their fates go in different directions.)

356
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,210
I felt guilty about taking his spot,

357
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:26,951
but I was desperate to perform onstage too.

358
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:29,581
This is it.

359
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:31,180
(The Elite 7 for UNIT 2 has been drafted.)

360
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,191
Team "Butterfly."

361
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:33,420
- Okay. - Got it.

362
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:35,019
(The Elite 7 for UNIT 2 has been drafted.)

363
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,220
Give it your all...

364
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:38,990
and make this your song.

365
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,460
- Okay. - Got it?

366
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:43,331
I believe...

367
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,831
I made this decision to ensure a win...

368
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,631
for our team.

369
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,640
(The Elite 7 for TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 2)

370
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:59,110
Kenta and Park Han.

371
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:00,181
Gosh, Park Han.

372
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,650
(TEAM GROOVE's top members, )

373
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:03,151
(Kenta and Park Han, perform both songs.)

374
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,091
(Each team presented its Elite Seven for this round.)

375
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,290
(Which team will win the final league match?)

376
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,219
League match Round Three, Seven.

377
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,990
UNIT 2 from each team will now perform.

378
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:18,431
Are you ready?

379
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:22,200
Bring it in, boys.

380
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:24,401
(TEAM GROOVE is currently in 1st place.)

381
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:26,641
Show your talent...

382
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,509
and come home safely. Have fun up there.

383
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,039
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3.

384
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,650
- Let's go! - Let's go!

385
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:33,750
(Go, TEAM GROOVE!)

386
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,049
- Let's go! - You've got this.

387
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,480
(TEAM GROOVE performs 1 last time to secure 1st place.)

388
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,350
(How well will UNIT 2 of TEAM GROOVE do?)

389
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:40,519
- I'll see you later. - Go, team.

390
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,651
- See you soon. - You've got this.

391
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,161
What is the lineup prepared by the directors?

392
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:45,861
TEAM GROOVE, come on out.

393
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,601
(Who will show up this time?)

394
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:52,671
(Anticipating)

395
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:00,710
Since I worked hard...

396
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,980
to make it into the Elite Seven, I'll bring victory to the team.

397
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,780
I only thought...

398
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:09,681
about giving it my all as if my life depended on it.

399
00:20:13,121 --> 00:20:14,150
(Seo Jeong Woo)

400
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:15,219
(They see the member they are rooting for.)

401
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,290
(I dropped out of school to come see Jeong Woo.)

402
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,591
(UNIT 2 of TEAM GROOVE are dressed like male leads from teen cartoons.)

403
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:23,401
(Shy)

404
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,559
(He's handsome, cute, and everything else!)

405
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,029
- How is he that cute? - They're adorable.

406
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,870
The camera loves him.

407
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:30,000
- Kenta? - Yes.

408
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:34,611
TEAM GROOVE, please say hello.

409
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,540
We are Director Lee Chang Sub's...

410
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,110
- sons! - Sons!

411
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:40,351
- Sons! - Sons!

412
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:42,581
My sons?

413
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:43,650
(That startled me.)

414
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:45,250
What about us? We have two dads.

415
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,350
(Laughing)

416
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:50,560
Hi, I'm the tallest son, Kim Gi Joong.

417
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:53,831
Hi, I'm the eldest son, Jang Kyung Ho.

418
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,091
(Kyung Ho)

419
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,860
Okay, the tall ones.

420
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,559
(The troublemaker is jealous.)

421
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,970
Hi, I'm Kenta, his son from Japan.

422
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,970
Hello, I'm Sirin, his son from Thailand.

423
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,370
(Sirin, what are you saying?)

424
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:10,680
- Sirin looks so happy. - Tell me about it.

425
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:12,780
He joined that team and instantly became one of the sons.

426
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,680
(Sirin's former dad is upset.)

427
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:17,421
Hi, I'm Park Han, the son he gave birth to with his vocal cords.

428
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,049
(The genes of a top vocalist!)

429
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,121
I'm Seo Jeong Woo, the son he had from his heart.

430
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,360
(I'll be the one to raise you!)

431
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:27,030
I'm Bae Jae Ho, his youngest son who has been improving.

432
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,631
(Jae Ho)

433
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:30,701
(Good job, my son.)

434
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,299
- UNIT 2 of TEAM GROOVE, - Yes?

435
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,331
What's the song you'll be performing?

436
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:36,401
The song we'll be performing is called "Butterfly,"

437
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,100
which conveys a hopeful message...

438
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:39,941
about spreading your wings to realize your dream.

439
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,610
(My gosh, I can't wait.)

440
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:44,010
Sounds good. Kenta and Han,

441
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,111
you'll be performing once again.

442
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:49,250
How is it? You performed once, but now you're up here again.

443
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,650
Director Lee said...

444
00:21:51,651 --> 00:21:54,121
that TEAM GROOVE's key to victory...

445
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,960
laid in our hands.

446
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,861
- Nice. - Good job, Han.

447
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:01,891
I'll prove to everyone with this performance...

448
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,760
that he wasn't wrong.

449
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,029
(Go, Park Han!)

450
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,729
I practiced immensely...

451
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,470
to make Director Lee proud for having faith in me.

452
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:11,739
(We'll look forward to the performance!)

453
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,910
(Kenta)

454
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:14,641
Sirin, is there a reason...

455
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,310
you must win this match?

456
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,381
Director Lee promised...

457
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,651
to treat us to pork belly if we won.

458
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:27,789
TEAM GROOVE, let's enjoy a team dinner!

459
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,520
- Let's go! - Let's go!

460
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:31,661
He promised to treat them to pork belly.

461
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:33,661
How adorable.

462
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,530
Jeong Woo, I heard a lot happened...

463
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:39,000
while preparing for this round. Please tell us about it.

464
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:45,171
(What ups and downs did Team "Butterfly" face?)

465
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:47,140
(After the members were announced, at the practice room)

466
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,039
Gi Joong, Jae Ho, and Jeong Woo...

467
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,081
joined Team "Butterfly."

468
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,280
Yes!

469
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:54,479
- Welcome. - Yes!

470
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,020
- Applause. - Gosh.

471
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:58,680
You should've seen Gi Joong wailing.

472
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,050
Me? But I didn't cry.

473
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,351
That wasn't me.

474
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,431
I thought Jae Ho suited this song well,

475
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,430
and his expression got better after he got to join us.

476
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,059
- He looks more cheerful. - You're right.

477
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,270
Joining the team has made me happy.

478
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:16,600
Jeong Woo was on Team "Only U,"

479
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:17,840
but he joined this team...

480
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:19,141
after being cut from his original team.

481
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:22,310
While on Team "Only U,"

482
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:25,111
I couldn't stay hidden properly,

483
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,510
which led to me losing my spot.

484
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:33,191
(During the final selection of members for UNIT 1)

485
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:36,891
(Director Lee Chang Sub saw how much he lacked.)

486
00:23:37,191 --> 00:23:39,630
(What you lacked couldn't stay hidden in this song, )

487
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,861
(even after you got to sing different sections.)

488
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,500
(Seo Jeong Woo was removed from Team "Only U.")

489
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:48,671
I can't hide what I lack forever,

490
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,101
which means I have to get better...

491
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,441
so that there's no need...

492
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:58,141
for me to try and hide what I lack.

493
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,110
(He is set to grind mode! Bring on the questions.)

494
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:05,451
Gi Joong, where do you stand when singing...

495
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,590
"We wish to do it?"

496
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:08,049
Do you make this move?

497
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,620
Do you crouch at the front...

498
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:10,691
when singing, "We wish to do it?"

499
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:13,861
This is how I open up my body.

500
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,760
Who can we ask about the details of this move?

501
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,100
This is what I'm having the most trouble with.

502
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:22,270
I'm not sure where my hands should go.

503
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,540
I know I'm bombarding you with questions.

504
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,569
I'm having the most trouble...

505
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,341
with this move during, "Spread your wings."

506
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,840
During practice, Jeong Woo put in the most work.

507
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:33,479
It wasn't just for this song, though.

508
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,550
He's been working hard for his previous performances too.

509
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:38,920
Apart from meal times and a few brief breaks,

510
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:41,319
I witnessed him practicing nonstop.

511
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,391
That's why...

512
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,560
Dancing is like martial arts.

513
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:47,331
You must always be ready to fight.

514
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,229
Like this?

515
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,830
That's right. Martial arts.

516
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,059
Think of it as martial arts.

517
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,999
(This is a dance practice, not martial arts training.)

518
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,340
This. Be ready to guard.

519
00:24:56,341 --> 00:24:58,340
What belt are you in Taekwondo?

520
00:24:58,341 --> 00:24:59,570
Me? I was born in the year of the snake.

521
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:03,181
(Happy New Year in the Year of the Blue Snake.)

522
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:08,250
(Meanwhile, singing can be heard from another practice room.)

523
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,020
(Sirin's working hard on his own in the room.)

524
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:15,450
(In Round 2, he proved himself as a main vocalist...)

525
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:17,390
(as a member of TEAM RHYTHM's bench.)

526
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,460
(He's a good singer!)

527
00:25:19,691 --> 00:25:21,190
(Director Lee recognized his vocal talent...)

528
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:22,391
(and recruited him to TEAM GROOVE.)

529
00:25:24,101 --> 00:25:26,870
(He gives it his all during practice...)

530
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:29,500
(after being picked up by TEAM GROOVE.)

531
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,010
(Working hard)

532
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,611
If I fail this round...

533
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:39,010
and get another yellow card,

534
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,081
I will have to go back to Thailand.

535
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,620
The challenge for me this time around...

536
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:48,790
I want to...

537
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,520
make this stage perfect.

538
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,260
(Sirin was given a yellow card after the previous round.)

539
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,330
Even if I die after this,

540
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:03,000
I want to have done everything I wanted.

541
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,440
Why don't we take it from there?

542
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,469
- Sure. - Got it.

543
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,540
(He's more nervous since only he has a yellow card.)

544
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,611
This is what we altered yesterday.

545
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,709
Start and go

546
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,950
- Move and jump. - Move and jump.

547
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:15,180
As long as we're together

548
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:17,519
We'll take it from "You're my friend."

549
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Sure.

550
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,789
(Meanwhile, Kenta doesn't look happy.)

551
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,621
"Only U" and "Butterfly."

552
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:25,160
I ended the song in the middle for the former...

553
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,191
and am beginning the song in the center for the latter.

554
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:34,470
(UNIT 1's "Only U" ended with him in the center.)

555
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,870
(Kenta also begins "Butterfly" in the center.)

556
00:26:39,871 --> 00:26:43,581
(Kenta also begins "Butterfly" in the center.)

557
00:26:43,881 --> 00:26:47,350
Because I'm being flooded...

558
00:26:47,351 --> 00:26:49,450
with information from both songs,

559
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:52,180
when I practice "Butterfly" after working on "Only U,"

560
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,519
I forget a few things for "Only U,"

561
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,220
which shows the next time I join UNIT 1 to practice.

562
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,690
It makes me nervous...

563
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:05,331
and has me wondering if I should be performing two songs...

564
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,170
during my practice sessions.

565
00:27:08,171 --> 00:27:09,200
(Sighing)

566
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:10,700
Five, six.

567
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:15,040
(Continuing with the dance lessons)

568
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:17,479
Kenta, you have to move faster.

569
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,709
One, two, three.

570
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,709
- You must pick up the pace... - Right.

571
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,451
For the others behind you.

572
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,989
(They practice the choreography again.)

573
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,391
(Colliding)

574
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,620
(The pressure of working on two songs)

575
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:34,130
(Kenta messes up the flow of movements.)

576
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,229
After "start and go..."

577
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,601
(Sorry.)

578
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:40,100
(After the dance lesson, )

579
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:42,999
(TEAM GROOVE slowly goes over the sequence of moves.)

580
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,300
Will everyone know

581
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:46,970
Or won't they?

582
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,880
Kenta, after this,

583
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:53,009
you will move to this spot.

584
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,249
Go ahead. That's right.

585
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,350
"What I want..." Go.

586
00:27:58,351 --> 00:27:59,420
(Kenta's teammates patiently guide the anxious Kenta.)

587
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:00,691
- That's right. - Okay.

588
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,890
And then...

589
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:04,921
I wasn't good enough...

590
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,391
to master the performance,

591
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:12,101
so I practiced over and over again...

592
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,540
and asked my vocal coach numerous times...

593
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,701
about how I should sing my parts.

594
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,210
- Like that. - Got it.

595
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:23,239
(For a better performance, )

596
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,309
(Kenta and Sirin stay strong as they keep on practicing.)

597
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,381
(Kenta and Sirin stay strong as they keep on practicing.)

598
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,750
(A few days later)

599
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:39,860
(Director Lee Chang Sub...)

600
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:42,460
(checks on Team "Butterfly" for the last time.)

601
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:45,331
We go high

602
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,570
I'll take you there

603
00:28:51,371 --> 00:28:52,441
Okay.

604
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,180
There's not a lot of feedback to give you.

605
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:58,410
- You're already good. - Thank you.

606
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,081
- Thank you. - Thank you.

607
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,509
Sirin, I see no issues with you.

608
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,819
Kenta, you're looking good too. That was great.

609
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,049
- Okay. - You're good.

610
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,121
Thank you.

611
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:10,361
Okay. Now, Jeong Woo.

612
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:13,691
Perform by yourself.

613
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,030
- Dance as you come forward. - Got it.

614
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,931
(Jeong Woo sings his section again.)

615
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:21,800
Will we both know?

616
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:25,840
(Watching attentively)

617
00:29:25,841 --> 00:29:29,880
- "Or do we still lack courage?" - "Courage."

618
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,479
- Just do that. - Got it.

619
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,010
- Take it from the top. - Sure.

620
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,881
Or do we still lack courage?

621
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,719
Keep it neat, simple,

622
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,290
and compact.

623
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:44,160
(He fully understands now.)

624
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:46,160
- Jeong Woo, you hold the key. - Okay.

625
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:48,489
I don't mean to pressure you, but... No, be pressured.

626
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,401
Sure. I'll feel the pressure.

627
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:52,999
I can be the one...

628
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,970
to take our performance to the next level,

629
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:58,400
but if I'm not able to play my role,

630
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:02,641
I'll be bringing the whole team down.

631
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:11,180
(Can he go from a baby chick who took his first steps...)

632
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:14,519
(to a butterfly that spreads his wings?)

633
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,161
Doing my best is all I can do at this point.

634
00:30:20,391 --> 00:30:22,930
We'll now watch TEAM GROOVE perform.

635
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:24,959
TEAM GROOVE, are you ready?

636
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,270
Yes!

637
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:28,601
Go, TEAM GROOVE!

638
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,940
- Go, Jeong Woo! - You've got this!

639
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,069
Let's go!

640
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,309
- Let's come out on top. - Go, team!

641
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,370
Go, Team "Butterfly."

642
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:36,540
Relax and be your usual selves.

643
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:39,010
- Let's do this. - Let's pray.

644
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:43,121
- I'm looking forward to this. - Me too.

645
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:45,880
For my director who trusted me enough...

646
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:47,719
to put me in the center,

647
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,920
even though I'm performing two songs,

648
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:50,921
and for my teammates...

649
00:30:50,922 --> 00:30:53,330
who believed in me and worked hard together with me,

650
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:55,861
I'll perform with only the goal of winning.

651
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,570
Ready? Go.

652
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:06,470
No way.

653
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:11,539
- They look good. - Kenta!

654
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,809
("Butterfly" by Bae Jae Ho, Jang Kyung Ho, Kenta, )

655
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,951
(Kim Gi Joong, Park Han, Seo Jeong Woo, Sirin)

656
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:22,790
Jeong Woo has gotten so much better!

657
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:27,891
They all look like someone's first love.

658
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,941
He's just like a puppy.

659
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,260
Kyung Ho's good.

660
00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:30,960
I can't believe Park Han.

661
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:41,171
(Kenta)

662
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,441
(Kenta)

663
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:17,871
Great job.

664
00:33:40,891 --> 00:33:42,030
Gosh.

665
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:50,371
That was cute.

666
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:51,570
- That was cute. - That was cute.

667
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,510
What's with the singing?

668
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,661
That's indeed Han.

669
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,891
- I love you! - I love you!

670
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:50,001
You did great!

671
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:53,331
Kenta!

672
00:34:53,731 --> 00:34:57,069
(You did a great job!)

673
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,969
- Nice! - No problem! Well done!

674
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,069
(Proud)

675
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,371
Han did a great job.

676
00:35:02,711 --> 00:35:03,711
He's good.

677
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,280
- He's good. - He's good indeed.

678
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,780
(Amazed)

679
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:12,420
TEAM GROOVE did really well,

680
00:35:12,751 --> 00:35:14,791
and it made me feel even more nervous.

681
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,960
(Feeling nervous)

682
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:19,021
I feel nervous.

683
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,331
(TEAM GROOVE's performance made the other teams feel nervous.)

684
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:26,569
All right. We'll begin with the voting.

685
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,899
(On-site voting starts.)

686
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,730
The individual votes of the players...

687
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,969
will be added and applied to the team score.

688
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,140
You did so well!

689
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:35,271
Please press O if you enjoyed his performance...

690
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:37,510
and press the X if it was disappointing.

691
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:40,311
I did make a lot of mistakes during my previous performances,

692
00:35:40,851 --> 00:35:42,650
but I never felt intimidated.

693
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:44,220
Gi Joong's voice never cracked.

694
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,291
It would've been four consecutive times if his voiced cracked today.

695
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,520
I can feel myself growing...

696
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:52,661
at this moment.

697
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:54,630
I will never give up.

698
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,490
You were amazing!

699
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:01,001
I think Gi Joong will receive a lot of points this time.

700
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:06,810
(A confession with a song after Gi Joong's sudden confession)

701
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:08,070
Everyone, I...

702
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,839
(I can't do anything without you)

703
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,740
(I must have you)

704
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:14,879
It would be great if you could vote for me.

705
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,980
(Here's another vote for you.)

706
00:36:15,981 --> 00:36:17,120
Please vote for me.

707
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:19,279
Everyone, please vote for me.

708
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,419
- Okay! - Okay!

709
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,689
I voted for you!

710
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,759
- You voted for me? - Yes!

711
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,961
(Kenta)

712
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,160
Dog ears, cat ears... No, rabbit ears.

713
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:30,759
(The cute acts continue for the votes.)

714
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
The hand kiss.

715
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,300
You're an idol star, Seo Jeong Woo!

716
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:38,601
Let's go!

717
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,970
I love you!

718
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,211
Three, two,

719
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,340
one!

720
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,681
Voting will now be closed.

721
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,310
- Let's go! - Let's go!

722
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:50,549
This was TEAM GROOVE.

723
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,180
You may step down after saying goodbye.

724
00:36:52,181 --> 00:36:53,790
- Thank you! - Thank you!

725
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,450
- Thank you! - Thank you!

726
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:56,451
(The performance for TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 2 is over.)

727
00:36:56,891 --> 00:36:58,489
(You did a great job!)

728
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,529
- Thank you! - Thank you!

729
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,660
I did feel restless about it,

730
00:37:01,661 --> 00:37:03,400
but there's nothing I can say as they all did so well.

731
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,061
They did so well.

732
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:08,830
I think they did better than "Only U."

733
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:09,970
- Really? - Yes.

734
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:12,170
All right.

735
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,270
Let's get together again.

736
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:17,211
There's something our directors must do.

737
00:37:17,481 --> 00:37:18,910
You have to think about who to trade.

738
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:19,911
Okay.

739
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:25,780
(Last week, during the announcement of UNIT 1's interim results...)

740
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,621
(TEAM RHYTHM: 1,551, TEAM BEAT: 1,539)

741
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:33,961
(TEAM BEAT was just 12 points behind TEAM RHYTHM.)

742
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,560
Don't get hurt, guys.

743
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:36,561
- Okay. - Okay.

744
00:37:36,562 --> 00:37:37,830
- Let's leave no regrets. - Okay.

745
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:39,700
In 1, 2, 3. TEAM BEAT,

746
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:41,331
- let's go! - Let's go!

747
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,041
- Let's go! - Let's go!

748
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:45,701
- We'll be off. - We'll do well.

749
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,641
- We'll be off. - We'll be off.

750
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
- Let's go! - Let's go!

751
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:51,181
TEAM BEAT feels scary now.

752
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,350
(The other two teams feel very nervous.)

753
00:37:54,351 --> 00:37:57,820
All right. TEAM BEAT's UNIT TWO, please come up onstage.

754
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:01,690
(Very excited)

755
00:38:03,891 --> 00:38:06,791
(This time, we will catch up no matter what!)

756
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:10,030
We lost by a small difference.

757
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:13,570
We might have a chance to turn things around.

758
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,630
I want to show everyone a big comeback.

759
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,541
It feels good today.

760
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,440
You're cool!

761
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:28,109
(Amazed)

762
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,420
(Screaming)

763
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:32,550
(After UNIT 1's "My, My, My,")

764
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,650
(TEAM BEAT's UNIT 2 appeared with conceptual outfits.)

765
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:38,061
(Gosh, I love it!)

766
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,719
(Impressed)

767
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,860
Their outfits look great.

768
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,831
Gosh, check out their outfits. They're ready for battle.

769
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:47,730
TEAM BEAT's outfits are already outstanding.

770
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:49,771
It looks like they are really determined.

771
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,840
Please greet the audience.

772
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,339
- Passion on! - On!

773
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,439
- Spirit on! - On!

774
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,110
- Hello, this is TEAM BEAT! - Hello, this is TEAM BEAT!

775
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:01,710
(My favorite is out again!)

776
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:04,081
Please take turns to say hello as well.

777
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:06,891
Come on! Hello, this is Cha Woong Ki!

778
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,291
(Am I allowed to get up onstage?)

779
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,320
Focus on me, everyone!

780
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,961
Hello, this Nam Do Yoon!

781
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,630
(I'm already focusing on you!)

782
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,731
They all came prepared with something.

783
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:20,201
Champion! Hello, this Keum Jin Ho!

784
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:22,670
(Keum Jin Ho)

785
00:39:25,271 --> 00:39:26,739
- Let's go, Steven. - Steven.

786
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,410
- Let's go. - Take away that title.

787
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:29,771
(That's my title.)

788
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,211
Come on here! I'm Kairi!

789
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,981
"Come on here!"

790
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,880
Turn it on! I'm Kim Hyo Tae!

791
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:39,350
Get it on! I'm Yuito!

792
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:41,950
Hello, I'm the youngest on top! I'm An Yul!

793
00:39:41,951 --> 00:39:43,461
(Woong Ki!)

794
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:47,431
Starting from the team selections and until now,

795
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:51,001
the seven of us were always on TEAM BEAT.

796
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:54,731
We are confident about teamwork more than the other teams.

797
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,200
The 2nd performance of TEAM BEAT for Round 3.

798
00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:00,541
Do Yoon, which song have you guys prepared?

799
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:04,681
It's a song called "On and On" written by EL CAPITXN.

800
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,980
It's a song about continuing to run forward,

801
00:40:06,981 --> 00:40:08,810
even after experiencing failure.

802
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:11,650
I believe it's a song that perfectly suits TEAM BEAT.

803
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:13,951
(Very excited)

804
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,550
- Woong Ki. - Yes?

805
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,919
I heard that "On and On" had the highest notes...

806
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,859
out of all of the TEAM BEAT songs.

807
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
Will you be okay with singing this live today?

808
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,830
I'll be in charge of those high notes.

809
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:27,030
Gosh, Cha Woong Ki!

810
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,800
I found the answer from TEAM GROOVE!

811
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:31,870
(Our team?)

812
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:33,740
When I was practicing my singing,

813
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,641
I worked hard with a picture of Park Han in front of me.

814
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,810
(A picture of me?)

815
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:42,181
It felt like he was watching me.

816
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,181
I'm not sure if it was because of that,

817
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,050
but I could really hit the high notes well.

818
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:48,391
When you are practicing your singing,

819
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,420
you should try the Park Han practice method too.

820
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:54,730
Woong Ki was born to be an idol singer.

821
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:55,760
(Showing off his talent)

822
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:59,161
The Park Han practice method. I should give that a try too. Great.

823
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:00,970
- Yuito. - Yes?

824
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,439
I heard the directors of TEAM BEAT helped you guys a lot.

825
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,871
Yes. Our directors really helped out with our league match.

826
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:11,940
(Getting more excited)

827
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,851
(TEAM BEAT's directors helped out to turn the tables.)

828
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,320
(How was TEAM BEAT's UNIT 2's practice session?)

829
00:41:18,621 --> 00:41:20,050
(D-7 to Round 3, AOMG building)

830
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,220
It feels new to be having a shoot here.

831
00:41:22,891 --> 00:41:24,220
(Knocking)

832
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,189
Hello.

833
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,290
- Hello. - Hello.

834
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,660
- Hello. - You're here.

835
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:30,129
- Hello. - Come on in.

836
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,259
- Hello. - Hello.

837
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,731
(TEAM BEAT's UNIT 2 came to Director YUGYEOM's company.)

838
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,629
(He's happy to meet them here.)

839
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,630
- Hello. - Hey.

840
00:41:36,731 --> 00:41:38,271
- Hello. - Take a seat.

841
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,469
(During the team ranking announcement of Round 1)

842
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,770
(TEAM BEAT, Starting lineup: 966)

843
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:43,810
(Bench: 979)

844
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,681
(Total: 1,945)

845
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,980
(TEAM BEAT placed last with a difference of 312 votes...)

846
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:51,880
(with TEAM RHYTHM in 2nd place.)

847
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:54,090
(Even during Round 2, the Intercept Round, )

848
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:00,760
(they had their new song taken away by TEAM GROOVE.)

849
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,430
(With the 2 tragic consecutive losses, )

850
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:10,940
(TEAM BEAT became greatly disheartened.)

851
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:18,280
(We can't stay on the ground like this.)

852
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:19,681
We can't have any regrets.

853
00:42:20,681 --> 00:42:24,121
(TEAM BEAT prepares for a great comeback.)

854
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,919
(A special push of help from Directors EL CAPITXN and YUGYEOM)

855
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
I was so surprised.

856
00:42:27,451 --> 00:42:29,150
Just for us...

857
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:31,589
I believe this great opportunity was given to us...

858
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,260
for us to achieve a great result.

859
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,831
It feels weird as you guys are here.

860
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:41,070
It's fascinating.

861
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,800
I always do my recording here.

862
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,641
This is the recording studio.

863
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,311
Later...

864
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,410
Our company doesn't have anyone that dances.

865
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:52,439
(He's the only one that dances.)

866
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,411
The dance room was made just for me.

867
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:55,880
At first.

868
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,951
So it's like a practice room made just for you.

869
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:01,251
That's what they did for me.

870
00:43:01,252 --> 00:43:02,790
(YUGYEOM's practice room is specially revealed for them!)

871
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,820
- Shall we go there? - Yes.

872
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,431
- Let's go. - Okay.

873
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,890
(Staggering)

874
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:12,400
- Do Yoon. - I'm sorry.

875
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,370
- Let's not be like this outside. - Right.

876
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:15,570
(Joking)

877
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,739
Shall we try "On and On?"

878
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,740
- Yes. - Yes.

879
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,311
Okay.

880
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:27,110
- What will you do, Woong Ki? - What should I do?

881
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,911
(It's hard for Woong Ki to dance because of his burn.)

882
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,951
- Just sing for us. - Okay.

883
00:43:34,121 --> 00:43:37,021
(Woong Ki will sit and just get vocal training!)

884
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:38,461
- Good luck! - Thank you.

885
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:39,461
- Thank you. - Thank you.

886
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:41,831
Don't feel embarrassed. Think that you are the best.

887
00:43:41,931 --> 00:43:42,931
- Okay. - Let's go.

888
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:50,101
(UNIT 2's "On and On" is shown for the 1st time to Director YUGYEOM.)

889
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,411
(Full of spite)

890
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,940
(Their expressions have changed with the goal of taking the win.)

891
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:00,380
I'm loving life

892
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:03,350
Fill in this moment

893
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:05,350
This vibe that makes my heart beat

894
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,980
This isn't a love song, it's bigger than that

895
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:10,961
(Max power)

896
00:44:11,521 --> 00:44:12,760
(Satisfied)

897
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:14,490
- Turn it on - Okay.

898
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,000
Don't you guys feel it too?

899
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:25,570
The energy feels different as you guys...

900
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,770
- have a different mindset. - Thank you.

901
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:29,811
(TEAM BEAT's energy feels a lot different.)

902
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:31,541
Great work.

903
00:44:31,811 --> 00:44:33,811
I can tell you have been practicing.

904
00:44:34,581 --> 00:44:36,609
- You all have worked hard. - Thank you.

905
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,750
(Feeling proud)

906
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:40,689
I think the energy...

907
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:42,550
felt better than "My, My, My."

908
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,320
But here's the thing.

909
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:48,431
The singing got better than before, but the dancing was disappointing.

910
00:44:50,831 --> 00:44:55,530
("On and On" is a song with a lot of rapping and trendy vibes.)

911
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:03,041
(The point is to express the natural charms well.)

912
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:04,340
I think you can express yourselves more.

913
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:06,311
Let me explain.

914
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,411
You flow to the rhythm,

915
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,780
but you guys feel awkward with grabbing your pants like this.

916
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,650
You have to go with a rebellious attitude.

917
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:17,720
Just imagine yourselves to be hip-hop artists.

918
00:45:18,161 --> 00:45:20,661
- Idol singers cover every genre. - Right.

919
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:22,661
As you'll be onstage,

920
00:45:23,291 --> 00:45:25,430
you have to think that you're the best at that moment.

921
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,431
- Right. - Right.

922
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:29,300
Do Yoon.

923
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,371
- You have to work hard. - Right.

924
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,170
You have strong legs.

925
00:45:34,271 --> 00:45:35,669
Make it simple. If you have strong legs,

926
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,069
- stretch them out more. - Right.

927
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,081
If you don't...

928
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,180
stretch out your legs, the balance looks off.

929
00:45:41,181 --> 00:45:42,181
Do you understand what I'm saying?

930
00:45:42,182 --> 00:45:44,181
I look weird doing this with my height.

931
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:45,850
It has to come down this much.

932
00:45:45,851 --> 00:45:47,020
(Choreography feedback based on physical balances)

933
00:45:47,021 --> 00:45:48,450
- This looks better. - Right.

934
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:49,620
- You get what I'm saying, right? - Yes.

935
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,689
You have to stretch and come down more than you think.

936
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,560
- It can't look like this. - Right.

937
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:57,530
And it feels like you're dancing with your shoulders like this.

938
00:45:57,731 --> 00:46:00,670
Your body has to be warmed up...

939
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:02,700
for you to...

940
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:04,800
go up and down for moves.

941
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,771
It still feels like you're just busy pulling off the moves.

942
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:10,839
You have to push and pull.

943
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,840
(Director YUGYEOM coaches each move in detail.)

944
00:46:11,841 --> 00:46:14,550
I think it'll be great if you could focus on those parts.

945
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,481
We placed last consecutively.

946
00:46:18,981 --> 00:46:22,690
I think that was why our directors helped us out even more.

947
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,590
I want to repay our directors with a win.

948
00:46:26,891 --> 00:46:28,791
And...

949
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,530
I invited my closest friend.

950
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:35,001
(The director's friend?)

951
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:36,570
A rap monster has come...

952
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,340
to help out with your rapping.

953
00:46:39,101 --> 00:46:40,140
Gosh.

954
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:41,240
(Who is here?)

955
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,641
PUNCHNELLO!

956
00:46:43,911 --> 00:46:45,339
(Amazed)

957
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,380
- Gosh! - Gosh!

958
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,450
- Hello. - Hello.

959
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:51,049
- Thank you. - Hello.

960
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,451
- Hello. - Hello.

961
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,720
(His stable rap skills were approved at a rap survival program.)

962
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,260
(He even has a wide musical spectrum.)

963
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,630
(MC Jay Park, Director YUGYEOM)

964
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:09,730
I really love rapping,

965
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:13,170
and I was really excited to hear that there was a rap lesson.

966
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,541
Our director suddenly called for someone.

967
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,481
I wondered what was going on.

968
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,851
It was PUNCHNELLO.

969
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,351
It's such an honor.

970
00:47:23,451 --> 00:47:25,420
It's a great honor.

971
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:27,390
(Please teach us well!)

972
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:29,791
This is a song with a lot of rapping.

973
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:32,061
PUNCHNELLO will help you out with those parts.

974
00:47:32,961 --> 00:47:35,431
- Thank you. - Be confident.

975
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,791
- Okay! - Okay!

976
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:43,431
(The skills of the players are tested first before the lesson.)

977
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,100
Don't set, can you hear it?

978
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:49,271
(PUNCHNELLO listens carefully to review their skills.)

979
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,181
That honey, I need that honey

980
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,180
I ran this far without stopping

981
00:47:53,181 --> 00:47:54,880
Got to keep me up when we funk

982
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,720
(TEAM BEAT's UNIT 2 sings the song without being nervous.)

983
00:48:01,521 --> 00:48:03,820
(The song is nearing its end.)

984
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:09,561
- Thank you. - Thank you.

985
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,670
Well...

986
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,501
personally,

987
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:21,311
it doesn't feel like it's loud enough.

988
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,279
During the rap parts,

989
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,910
it feels like the voices are drifting away.

990
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:29,550
(TEAM BEAT's rapping drifts away.)

991
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,819
If you are going to perform this onstage,

992
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,590
you will need to be a lot more confident.

993
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,319
(The voices sounded weak and unconfident.)

994
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,489
Can you each do your parts?

995
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,621
- Okay. - Okay.

996
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:45,630
(Leader Jin Ho starts with his rap part.)

997
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,871
Got to keep me up when we funk

998
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,601
- Can you do it one more time? - Okay.

999
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,440
(Jin Ho does the same part again.)

1000
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,379
Got to keep me up when we funk

1001
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,750
"Got to keep me up..."

1002
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:06,581
(PUNCHNELLO tries out Jin Ho's part.)

1003
00:49:07,251 --> 00:49:09,319
(Feeling nervous)

1004
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,061
The beat sounds a bit off.

1005
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,260
"I want it, get on..."

1006
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,561
"I want it, get on, I want it."

1007
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:18,899
It doesn't sound like it connects.

1008
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,359
(Jin Ho's rapping didn't sound natural with the connection.)

1009
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,400
Right.

1010
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,530
I think it'll be great if you could work on that.

1011
00:49:24,101 --> 00:49:28,211
(It's Yuito, who was excited for the rap lesson.)

1012
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,711
I think the energy is great,

1013
00:49:30,911 --> 00:49:33,211
but it feels like it's drifting away.

1014
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,411
But...

1015
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:38,251
if I were rapping that part...

1016
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,219
I keep going with my eyes open

1017
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,291
I think I would've...

1018
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,260
brought it inside.

1019
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,220
I would've done that instead of bringing it out.

1020
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:50,930
(He demonstrates himself!)

1021
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:52,860
I think this sounds better.

1022
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:54,399
I can't complain

1023
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,430
I think this will sound really cool.

1024
00:49:56,431 --> 00:49:57,569
(Impressed)

1025
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:58,871
I can't complain

1026
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,501
- Can you do it again? - Yes.

1027
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:06,080
(Yuito tries again after applying the feedback.)

1028
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:07,110
That's great.

1029
00:50:08,211 --> 00:50:09,550
Drop it below, sub-zero

1030
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,351
- It sounds much better. - Right.

1031
00:50:12,451 --> 00:50:14,320
I think it will be great like that.

1032
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:22,061
(Yuito practices it again right away.)

1033
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,600
(I keep going with my eyes open)

1034
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:27,570
The last note usually went up.

1035
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,100
But the teacher said...

1036
00:50:29,101 --> 00:50:30,600
(I keep going with my eyes open)

1037
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:34,771
That I should try to keep the notes inside.

1038
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,969
After getting that feedback,

1039
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:39,710
I wanted to copy it perfectly...

1040
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:42,751
and practice it until it completely became mine.

1041
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,050
- It might not be a rap part, - Yes?

1042
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:47,819
But before we go to the chorus...

1043
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,520
"This right here is going to turn you."

1044
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:51,020
I have this part.

1045
00:50:51,021 --> 00:50:53,220
- Right. - Will you give it a try?

1046
00:50:54,961 --> 00:50:57,799
(Kairi tries the chorus part.)

1047
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,461
Won't it be fun...

1048
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,600
- if you could twist it up? - Right.

1049
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:03,601
This right here is going to turn you

1050
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:06,141
This right here is going to turn you

1051
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:08,210
I think it'll be better to bring up the "you."

1052
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:09,240
- "You." - Right.

1053
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,181
I think that will sound...

1054
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:14,041
a bit more impactful.

1055
00:51:14,581 --> 00:51:16,710
Keep copying the things he did...

1056
00:51:16,711 --> 00:51:18,380
in your heads.

1057
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,020
- You get what I'm saying, right? - Yes.

1058
00:51:20,021 --> 00:51:21,290
(The rap lesson is over! It's time to practice endlessly.)

1059
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,320
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1060
00:51:23,521 --> 00:51:25,390
- Thank you for making the time. - Oh, no.

1061
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:26,420
Thank you.

1062
00:51:27,121 --> 00:51:29,160
- Gosh. - Your feedback...

1063
00:51:29,161 --> 00:51:30,561
will make a really big difference.

1064
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:34,299
- Clap for Teacher PUNCHNELLO! - Thank you.

1065
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,399
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1066
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,170
(We will get 1st place this time no matter what!)

1067
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,240
(A few days later)

1068
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:43,239
- Hello. - Hello.

1069
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,710
- Hello. - Hello.

1070
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:47,581
As a special treat today,

1071
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,451
Director EL CAPITXN...

1072
00:51:49,811 --> 00:51:51,751
has invited VENDORS...

1073
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:53,920
as our vocal instructors.

1074
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:56,220
The vocal lessons of Universe League...

1075
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:00,419
were more focused on...

1076
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,291
getting the overall feel.

1077
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:07,030
VENDORS is a team that is close to...

1078
00:52:07,231 --> 00:52:09,630
EL CAPITXN who made this song.

1079
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:12,041
I was excited as it felt like they were going to teach us...

1080
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,569
how to express the parts.

1081
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,440
(Very excited)

1082
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,739
(TEAM BEAT uses everything possible to win!)

1083
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,680
Can you hit the note in the middle more accurately?

1084
00:52:23,681 --> 00:52:24,720
Okay. I'll give that a try.

1085
00:52:25,981 --> 00:52:28,520
(The lesson goes on for 5 hours.)

1086
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:30,490
- Focus on the pronunciation more. - Okay.

1087
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,090
- Let's do it again. - Okay.

1088
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,090
We'll do it until we get it.

1089
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,360
Right at the beat.

1090
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,831
- Like this. - Okay.

1091
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,570
This isn't an opportunity that comes every day.

1092
00:52:44,271 --> 00:52:46,670
They gave us their full support.

1093
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:47,970
It'll be different this time...

1094
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:51,340
in terms of the quality of the stage and the result.

1095
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,109
We can't back off at this point.

1096
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,780
I really want to win.

1097
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,021
We'll place first in the next round.

1098
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:02,819
Let's check out the performance right away.

1099
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,859
TEAM BEAT, are you ready?

1100
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,561
(The audience is ready to have fun!)

1101
00:53:07,931 --> 00:53:09,089
Let's go.

1102
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,130
(Guys, let's go!)

1103
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,530
Their choreography is cool.

1104
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,731
- Theirs is the best. - Their choreography is cool.

1105
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:19,601
We really might be able to win this time.

1106
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,411
We'll give a good performance and advance to the finals.

1107
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:28,451
We'll do that with all the members of TEAM BEAT.

1108
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:36,282
Ready? Go.

1109
00:53:41,382 --> 00:53:42,790
("On and On" by An Yul, Cha Woong Ki, )

1110
00:53:42,791 --> 00:53:45,061
(Kairi, Keum Jin Ho, Kim Hyo Tae, Nam Do Yoon, Yuito)

1111
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:16,652
(Do Yoon)

1112
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:43,552
Their choreography is cool.

1113
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,931
We should be nervous.

1114
00:55:03,802 --> 00:55:05,471
TEAM BEAT gritted their teeth.

1115
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:13,681
Oh, yes.

1116
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:01,891
- My goodness. - Gosh.

1117
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:51,741
My goodness.

1118
00:57:04,252 --> 00:57:08,022
(TEAM BEAT's UNIT 2 gave a powerful performance.)

1119
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:13,101
(The atmosphere stays heated even after the performance ends.)

1120
00:57:14,232 --> 00:57:15,272
They did well.

1121
00:57:15,502 --> 00:57:17,001
- It was neat. - Yes.

1122
00:57:17,002 --> 00:57:18,471
(It was a satisfying performance for the directors.)

1123
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:21,771
(TEAM BEAT's performance was intense.)

1124
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:22,842
They did well.

1125
00:57:22,911 --> 00:57:24,411
That's TEAM BEAT's style.

1126
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:26,511
- They did so well. - Seriously.

1127
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:28,011
They did well.

1128
00:57:29,882 --> 00:57:30,951
I'm a bit scared.

1129
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:35,451
(TEAM RHYTHM is at a loss for words upon watching TEAM BEAT's stage.)

1130
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,252
They put so much effort into the performance.

1131
00:57:39,192 --> 00:57:42,891
At this rate, we might fail to place first.

1132
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:46,200
(Full of worries)

1133
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:49,101
All right. We'll begin the voting.

1134
00:57:49,272 --> 00:57:50,632
Kim Hyo Tae, let's go.

1135
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:52,040
(Running over)

1136
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,200
- Hyo Tae. - You're so handsome.

1137
00:57:54,201 --> 00:57:55,970
- You're so handsome. - My goodness.

1138
00:57:55,971 --> 00:57:58,510
- You're so talented, Hyo Tae. - Hyo Tae.

1139
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:00,241
- Thank you. - Seriously.

1140
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,350
Just once. Please press it just once.

1141
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:03,612
- Please press it just once. - Seriously.

1142
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:06,822
(Please give him your precious vote.)

1143
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:08,751
Gosh, I want to vote.

1144
00:58:08,752 --> 00:58:10,252
I really want to vote.

1145
00:58:10,351 --> 00:58:12,961
He's giving it his all.

1146
00:58:12,962 --> 00:58:15,021
If they sing "Fighting," they'll receive more votes.

1147
00:58:15,022 --> 00:58:16,962
- Will they do it? - Will they do the killer move?

1148
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:21,661
(He does the killer move right away.)

1149
00:58:22,201 --> 00:58:24,672
(TEAM BEAT's killer move is a must.)

1150
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:28,870
I can't believe he actually did it.

1151
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:29,971
(Laughing)

1152
00:58:31,572 --> 00:58:34,112
(TEAM BEAT's fans know Do Yoon's theme song.)

1153
00:58:34,382 --> 00:58:36,481
(I love it.)

1154
00:58:36,482 --> 00:58:37,580
Please vote for me.

1155
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:38,680
(Very desperate)

1156
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,252
(Please vote for Do Yoon.)

1157
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:43,652
- My goodness! - Please press it just once.

1158
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:45,560
- Vote right now. - Vote right now.

1159
00:58:45,561 --> 00:58:47,991
- Please press O. - Please vote.

1160
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:51,831
- They really seem like a team. - Yes.

1161
00:58:52,431 --> 00:58:53,930
- Please vote. - Please vote.

1162
00:58:53,931 --> 00:58:55,771
- The youngest one. - Please vote.

1163
00:58:55,772 --> 00:58:59,541
Three, two, one.

1164
00:58:59,842 --> 00:59:01,672
The voting is closed.

1165
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:03,571
Thank you.

1166
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:05,072
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1167
00:59:05,811 --> 00:59:07,181
Thank you.

1168
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:09,281
- Good luck. - Okay.

1169
00:59:09,282 --> 00:59:11,652
- Let's go. - Good luck.

1170
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:14,581
- All right. - Let's go.

1171
00:59:15,391 --> 00:59:17,092
Get up.

1172
00:59:17,592 --> 00:59:19,290
(Their competitive spirit is full.)

1173
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:20,660
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1174
00:59:20,661 --> 00:59:22,361
- Good luck. - You got this.

1175
00:59:22,362 --> 00:59:23,761
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1176
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:27,430
- Let's go. - Good luck.

1177
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:28,532
Let's go.

1178
00:59:28,802 --> 00:59:31,601
It's time for the next performance. TEAM RHYTHM, come on out.

1179
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:34,640
(Who will be the members?)

1180
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:36,112
(Curious)

1181
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:40,112
I'm confident that TEAM RHYTHM will place first.

1182
00:59:40,782 --> 00:59:43,811
In terms of performance, dance, singing, and everything else,

1183
00:59:43,982 --> 00:59:47,081
we want to show a perfect stage.

1184
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:54,560
(Their facial expressions show that their favorites are onstage.)

1185
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:56,862
TEAM RHYTHM, please say your greetings.

1186
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:59,362
We'll say hello.

1187
00:59:59,761 --> 01:00:01,700
- Who are we? - TEAM RHYTHM!

1188
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:03,631
- Who are we? - TEAM RHYTHM!

1189
01:00:03,632 --> 01:00:05,571
- Who are we? - TEAM RHYTHM!

1190
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:07,001
(He blew me a kiss, right?)

1191
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:08,371
(Chih En is my MVP.)

1192
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:10,671
Hello, we're TEAM RHYTHM.

1193
01:00:10,672 --> 01:00:12,282
- We're in your care. - We're in your care.

1194
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:15,311
They also took the stage with a completely different vibe.

1195
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,282
Earlier, we saw a merry-go-round. They look like they'll ride horses.

1196
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:20,850
(They went from the princes of an amusement park...)

1197
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,422
(to cowboys.)

1198
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:25,692
Please say hello one at a time.

1199
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,790
I'm Chih En.

1200
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,791
(Chih En)

1201
01:00:30,532 --> 01:00:31,861
I'm Li Zhinuo.

1202
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:33,462
(Li Zhinuo)

1203
01:00:33,661 --> 01:00:34,661
I'm Zen Zen.

1204
01:00:34,662 --> 01:00:36,002
(Zen Zen)

1205
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:37,701
I'm Zhang Shuaibo.

1206
01:00:37,831 --> 01:00:38,871
My goodness.

1207
01:00:39,272 --> 01:00:40,371
Zhang Shuaibo!

1208
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,612
I'm Daisuke.

1209
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:44,811
I'm JL.

1210
01:00:46,081 --> 01:00:47,481
JL!

1211
01:00:47,482 --> 01:00:49,551
- I'm Steven. - My goodness.

1212
01:00:49,552 --> 01:00:50,552
(Steven)

1213
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:52,010
It must be a strong concept, right?

1214
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:53,850
- I think it'll be intense. - I think it'll be intense.

1215
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:56,790
Let's hear what kind of song you prepared.

1216
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:58,052
Please introduce the song.

1217
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:02,430
We prepared a song about the unstoppable race toward dreams,

1218
01:01:02,431 --> 01:01:05,132
"Don't Hit The Brakes."

1219
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:07,532
(They ask people to cheer like professional idols.)

1220
01:01:07,862 --> 01:01:08,902
Chih En.

1221
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,401
You took the stage for the second performance as well.

1222
01:01:11,402 --> 01:01:14,001
Between the two songs, which one was harder?

1223
01:01:14,002 --> 01:01:16,870
"Don't Hit The Brakes" is a song with a strong concept.

1224
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:19,341
After practice, all the members...

1225
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,410
had to lie down on the floor.

1226
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,712
The dance was very difficult.

1227
01:01:23,911 --> 01:01:26,781
The performance must be physically draining.

1228
01:01:26,782 --> 01:01:27,851
Yes.

1229
01:01:28,282 --> 01:01:31,652
We'll show you why TEAM RHYTHM has the best performances.

1230
01:01:32,052 --> 01:01:33,261
All right.

1231
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:36,192
(How did the best performers, TEAM RHYTHM, practice?)

1232
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:38,261
Okay.

1233
01:01:38,902 --> 01:01:41,902
The seven members have been chosen for "Don't Hit The Brakes."

1234
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,700
These three members are the new additions.

1235
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:47,002
Hello.

1236
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:48,541
Hello.

1237
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,310
Hello, I'm Zhang Shuaibo.

1238
01:01:50,311 --> 01:01:51,311
I'm Daisuke.

1239
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,040
(Welcome.)

1240
01:01:53,041 --> 01:01:55,552
We need to work hard this time.

1241
01:01:55,681 --> 01:01:59,181
The 5 of us will perform 2 songs.

1242
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,752
Seriously. Directors, thank you.

1243
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:05,192
- I'll work hard. - Okay.

1244
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,822
(I'm happy to join UNIT 2.)

1245
01:02:08,261 --> 01:02:10,561
When the players got changed,

1246
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:13,401
the directors said...

1247
01:02:13,402 --> 01:02:16,971
that it was done in order to place first.

1248
01:02:17,772 --> 01:02:21,402
Five members will perform two songs.

1249
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:24,910
There's a reason we made that decision.

1250
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:28,842
The next one is the last league match.

1251
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:32,851
We've always placed second.

1252
01:02:33,052 --> 01:02:36,291
I want to put together the talented members...

1253
01:02:36,692 --> 01:02:37,692
this time...

1254
01:02:39,192 --> 01:02:42,391
and win once.

1255
01:02:42,831 --> 01:02:46,961
The five members need to put in a lot of effort.

1256
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:50,572
They need to feel the pressure.

1257
01:02:50,931 --> 01:02:52,541
You need to place first.

1258
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:53,801
- Okay. - Okay.

1259
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:55,241
- Okay. - Okay.

1260
01:02:55,942 --> 01:02:57,311
You can place first this time, right?

1261
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:58,981
- Yes. - Yes.

1262
01:02:58,982 --> 01:03:00,180
- Good luck. - Thank you.

1263
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:01,810
- Thank you. - We'll work hard.

1264
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,652
- We'll work hard. - We'll work hard.

1265
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,581
Let's cheer up and place first.

1266
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:08,581
- Okay. - That sounds good.

1267
01:03:09,022 --> 01:03:10,152
- That sounds good. - Yes.

1268
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:14,160
The concepts are different, so it'll be hard to go...

1269
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:16,232
back and forth.

1270
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,131
It'll be hard.

1271
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:21,802
There'll be much to think about.

1272
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:27,271
(The cute concept was something they haven't done before.)

1273
01:03:27,272 --> 01:03:31,911
(UNIT 1 of TEAM RHYTHM showed the refreshing "Roller Coaster.")

1274
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:40,450
(The vibe of "Don't Hit The Brakes" is completely different.)

1275
01:03:40,451 --> 01:03:44,491
The vibe is really, like, powerful and tough.

1276
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:47,761
And then it's like... Swagger. Cool.

1277
01:03:49,962 --> 01:03:54,361
(They need to prepare for two songs of contrasting styles.)

1278
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,870
It's like, the vibe is totally different.

1279
01:03:56,871 --> 01:03:58,732
We need to do more.

1280
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:03,441
This song is really hard...

1281
01:04:03,442 --> 01:04:07,181
- because it has a very high key. - Yes.

1282
01:04:07,942 --> 01:04:09,712
- We need to practice nonstop. - Yes.

1283
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:12,081
We need to practice a lot.

1284
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:15,052
The dance for "Don't Hit The Brakes..."

1285
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:18,721
is a bit difficult.

1286
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:25,461
(Every move in the choreography contains powerful energy.)

1287
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:28,561
The dance is very hard.

1288
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:31,931
How should I explain it? Each beat contains many moves.

1289
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:35,041
So it'll be difficult to dance in sync.

1290
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:38,870
I'm happy about performing two songs.

1291
01:04:38,871 --> 01:04:40,442
But on the other hand, performing two songs...

1292
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:43,310
requires twice the time...

1293
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:46,251
and twice the effort.

1294
01:04:46,252 --> 01:04:48,681
I don't know if I'll be able to do well.

1295
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:49,951
Okay.

1296
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:54,120
(UNIT 2 begins to practice with worries in their hearts.)

1297
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:56,361
- Ta-da. Boom. - Ta-da. Boom.

1298
01:04:56,362 --> 01:04:58,491
It becomes clearer

1299
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:01,362
(Fierce eyes)

1300
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:04,201
(Everyone makes facial expressions that suits the concept.)

1301
01:05:04,732 --> 01:05:06,101
- Okay. - Yes.

1302
01:05:07,402 --> 01:05:08,402
Daisuke.

1303
01:05:09,002 --> 01:05:10,511
What should I do?

1304
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,212
- Daisuke. - This is...

1305
01:05:14,382 --> 01:05:18,010
(During the performance of the cute and fresh "Roller Coaster,")

1306
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:21,281
(Daisuke was number 1 in expressing the concept.)

1307
01:05:21,282 --> 01:05:22,350
Daisuke, do it like...

1308
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:24,221
(The problem is that he's cute in UNIT 2 as well.)

1309
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:27,691
Daisuke, you don't need to look ahead.

1310
01:05:27,692 --> 01:05:28,692
(Being refreshing was the easiest.)

1311
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:30,732
Cast your eyes down.

1312
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:33,061
Look down and up.

1313
01:05:33,502 --> 01:05:36,430
As you run your hand up, look forward.

1314
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,830
(Stare like this, okay?)

1315
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:39,871
Daisuke.

1316
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:42,342
(One spoonful of sexiness)

1317
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,772
- There you go. - Okay.

1318
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:46,442
(You're the best.)

1319
01:05:47,141 --> 01:05:49,040
(Proud)

1320
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,781
When it comes to "Roller Coaster,"

1321
01:05:50,782 --> 01:05:54,421
I have confidence in facial expressions and such.

1322
01:05:54,422 --> 01:05:56,721
To be honest, UNIT TWO's song is hard.

1323
01:05:58,491 --> 01:06:01,791
(They continue to practice.)

1324
01:06:02,431 --> 01:06:05,461
(They get the details in sync.)

1325
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,661
Daisuke, come in a bit more.

1326
01:06:07,132 --> 01:06:08,901
That's right. Daisuke needs to come closer.

1327
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:11,172
I promised not to stop

1328
01:06:12,132 --> 01:06:13,302
(Hesitant)

1329
01:06:14,672 --> 01:06:15,672
Daisuke.

1330
01:06:15,673 --> 01:06:17,510
(Daisuke continues to make mistakes with the details.)

1331
01:06:17,511 --> 01:06:18,572
Boom!

1332
01:06:20,482 --> 01:06:23,381
Since I was paying attention to the facial expressions,

1333
01:06:23,382 --> 01:06:28,951
I couldn't focus on the dance and singing.

1334
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:33,121
(During the practice that followed)

1335
01:06:34,822 --> 01:06:36,831
Daisuke, this is the center.

1336
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:41,660
(Daisuke continues to struggle with the choreography.)

1337
01:06:41,661 --> 01:06:46,172
The details are very difficult for "Don't Hit The Brakes."

1338
01:06:46,272 --> 01:06:49,342
Since it required a lot of power,

1339
01:06:49,942 --> 01:06:51,411
I didn't know what to do.

1340
01:06:51,911 --> 01:06:54,281
- Boom! - Boom!

1341
01:06:54,282 --> 01:06:55,282
Did the choreography change?

1342
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:56,282
No. It has always been like that.

1343
01:06:56,382 --> 01:06:58,451
I thought this was the move for "Beyond the locked frame."

1344
01:06:59,752 --> 01:07:02,121
(Just like Daisuke, Chih En...)

1345
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:05,090
Ta-da. Boom. That's the dance.

1346
01:07:05,091 --> 01:07:06,420
(and Zhang Shuaibo are new members of UNIT 2.)

1347
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:09,060
Because... The two faces...

1348
01:07:09,061 --> 01:07:10,191
- Okay. - Okay.

1349
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,961
So it's... Boom.

1350
01:07:12,391 --> 01:07:14,332
- Boom. Okay. - Yes.

1351
01:07:15,202 --> 01:07:17,471
Well...

1352
01:07:19,131 --> 01:07:20,772
This time, my team...

1353
01:07:21,141 --> 01:07:23,542
needs to practice a lot.

1354
01:07:24,872 --> 01:07:26,412
My team needs to practice a lot.

1355
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:30,681
No matter how hard it gets, I won't give up.

1356
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:34,051
(Determined)

1357
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:37,292
- Daisuke. - Yes?

1358
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,391
Let's practice with Chih En.

1359
01:07:41,221 --> 01:07:42,221
Let's do it.

1360
01:07:42,222 --> 01:07:44,130
- Five, six, seven, eight. - Five, six, seven, eight.

1361
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:45,931
(The three of them practice to catch up.)

1362
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:50,331
We can't help but work harder...

1363
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,872
because we don't want to do a disservice to the team.

1364
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:56,841
In any case, we'll debut as a team.

1365
01:07:56,942 --> 01:08:00,582
The team's victory will be good for me.

1366
01:08:01,412 --> 01:08:04,581
So I think I need...

1367
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:06,681
to put the team first.

1368
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:11,091
Right now, all the members...

1369
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:13,122
are of one mind.

1370
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:19,532
(The three of them practice hard as a team.)

1371
01:08:20,101 --> 01:08:22,631
(Working hard)

1372
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:24,732
(Glancing over)

1373
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:28,341
(Steven spots the trio's struggle.)

1374
01:08:28,742 --> 01:08:32,841
Since "Don't Hit The Brakes" is a song I'd practiced, it was easy.

1375
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:35,711
I could see that they were struggling,

1376
01:08:36,152 --> 01:08:38,952
so I made an effort to ease their burden.

1377
01:08:40,482 --> 01:08:41,482
Do it like this.

1378
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:44,151
Right now, your fingers are pointing downward.

1379
01:08:44,152 --> 01:08:46,390
(Steven coaches throughout practice.)

1380
01:08:46,391 --> 01:08:47,992
Straighten them like this.

1381
01:08:48,522 --> 01:08:49,630
Okay.

1382
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:50,960
(Staring)

1383
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:53,060
(Working hard)

1384
01:08:53,061 --> 01:08:54,061
By the way, Daisuke,

1385
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:56,971
the details... Ta-da.

1386
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:00,301
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

1387
01:09:00,772 --> 01:09:03,371
Then it goes, ta-da. This hand needs to go forward.

1388
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:04,471
(He copies Steven perfectly.)

1389
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:06,140
(Completely focused)

1390
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:07,711
Ta-da.

1391
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:11,111
Chih En, when you do this, make a fist.

1392
01:09:11,112 --> 01:09:12,112
Okay.

1393
01:09:12,211 --> 01:09:13,351
Keep me wild cross the

1394
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:15,221
Do it like this.

1395
01:09:15,222 --> 01:09:16,421
(He learns the move.)

1396
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:18,452
Zhang Shuaibo and Daisuke.

1397
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:20,491
It becomes clearer

1398
01:09:20,492 --> 01:09:21,561
Look forward.

1399
01:09:21,961 --> 01:09:23,791
Burn it

1400
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:27,261
He must've wanted to focus on his own practice.

1401
01:09:27,402 --> 01:09:31,001
But he used his free time on us...

1402
01:09:31,702 --> 01:09:34,971
to teach us the choreography. I'm so thankful for that.

1403
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:38,442
Zhang Shuaibo, it's still a bit like this.

1404
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,310
A bit like that.

1405
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:46,621
(Their facial expressions and gestures improved thanks to Steven.)

1406
01:09:46,622 --> 01:09:47,652
Is it good?

1407
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:48,881
It's good!

1408
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:52,492
(The day of Round 3 approaches.)

1409
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:57,692
(TEAM RHYTHM is focused on the final dance lesson.)

1410
01:09:59,362 --> 01:10:02,671
(The angles are perfect.)

1411
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:07,872
(UNIT 2 of TEAM RHYTHM boasts their perfect angle and teamwork.)

1412
01:10:08,072 --> 01:10:09,101
What's up with you guys?

1413
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:11,471
How did you guys improve so much?

1414
01:10:12,881 --> 01:10:14,742
What did you guys do?

1415
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:17,951
It was so nice. Let's have a round of applause.

1416
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:19,081
It was great.

1417
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:20,380
(They had perfect teamwork as if they've always been a team.)

1418
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:23,122
Through this performance, I'll show what TEAM RHYTHM is about.

1419
01:10:23,492 --> 01:10:27,492
I'll show why TEAM RHYTHM is number one...

1420
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:28,961
in performances.

1421
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:33,500
This time, all the members...

1422
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:37,372
practiced the two songs diligently for a month.

1423
01:10:37,732 --> 01:10:41,571
To be honest, I'm very confident this time.

1424
01:10:41,572 --> 01:10:43,271
In this round,

1425
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:46,840
the members' minds are becoming one.

1426
01:10:46,841 --> 01:10:49,881
I think we'll be able to place first.

1427
01:10:50,051 --> 01:10:51,880
The first place needs to change.

1428
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:54,381
TEAM RHYTHM will take first place.

1429
01:10:56,221 --> 01:10:57,221
Let's go!

1430
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:00,691
- Zhang Shuaibo, let's go! - Here comes TEAM RHYTHM's stage.

1431
01:11:00,692 --> 01:11:04,692
- TEAM RHYTHM, are you ready? - Let's go.

1432
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:08,961
- Let's go! - Come on.

1433
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:10,072
Let's win.

1434
01:11:10,301 --> 01:11:11,402
Burn the stage.

1435
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:13,042
A difference of 200 points.

1436
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:15,471
(This performance is the last chance to turn the tables.)

1437
01:11:15,942 --> 01:11:17,311
I'm very confident.

1438
01:11:17,412 --> 01:11:19,942
I'll make sure TEAM RHYTHM places first.

1439
01:11:20,782 --> 01:11:22,082
We lost two times.

1440
01:11:22,582 --> 01:11:24,782
We need to take first place in this round.

1441
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:30,850
Chih En, good luck.

1442
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:32,692
Ready? Go.

1443
01:11:34,961 --> 01:11:35,992
They're starting.

1444
01:11:37,832 --> 01:11:38,961
What?

1445
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:44,871
- What? - Steven.

1446
01:11:44,872 --> 01:11:45,901
Oh, my gosh.

1447
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,572
- That's so cool. - Oh, what?

1448
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:50,242
What?

1449
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:53,781
("Don't Hit The Brakes" by Chih En, Daisuke, )

1450
01:11:53,782 --> 01:11:55,711
(JL, Li Zhinuo, Steven, Zen Zen, Zhang Shuaibo)

1451
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:07,461
- Amazing. - JL's rapping...

1452
01:12:21,402 --> 01:12:23,471
- It's perfect for Steven. - Right.

1453
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:32,881
What's gotten into Chih En?

1454
01:13:06,721 --> 01:13:08,221
That's crazy.

1455
01:13:45,452 --> 01:13:46,492
(Chih En)

1456
01:14:03,442 --> 01:14:06,412
- It's like they're possessed. - Oh, my gosh.

1457
01:14:42,782 --> 01:14:43,811
What's he doing?

1458
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:50,591
Zen Zen!

1459
01:15:06,232 --> 01:15:07,301
Zen Zen.

1460
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:33,831
Chih En!

1461
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:35,931
(Zhang Shuaibo)

1462
01:15:36,772 --> 01:15:39,031
(TEAM RHYTHM roots for each other.)

1463
01:15:39,032 --> 01:15:40,072
Good job.

1464
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:41,670
Good job.

1465
01:15:41,671 --> 01:15:45,311
(Well done, TEAM RHYTHM!)

1466
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,082
- Yes. - They nailed it.

1467
01:15:48,412 --> 01:15:49,582
My team is like...

1468
01:15:50,282 --> 01:15:51,851
- a professional idol. - Yes.

1469
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:55,350
Finished. We killed all the other teams.

1470
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:56,391
They were good.

1471
01:15:57,591 --> 01:16:00,461
Oh, what a nice response.

1472
01:16:01,192 --> 01:16:02,221
They were good.

1473
01:16:02,822 --> 01:16:04,162
I'm overwhelmed.

1474
01:16:04,862 --> 01:16:06,232
It was impressive in the beginning.

1475
01:16:07,862 --> 01:16:10,202
(TEAM RHYTHM is no team to be ignored.)

1476
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:14,501
(They gave their all for the last league match.)

1477
01:16:14,772 --> 01:16:17,211
Now, let's start voting.

1478
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:20,310
(Sexy)

1479
01:16:20,311 --> 01:16:21,380
(Chih En is my MVP.)

1480
01:16:21,381 --> 01:16:22,911
(Oh, my gosh!)

1481
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,082
(Busy watching Chih En and voting at the same time)

1482
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,551
You're so good-looking!

1483
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:29,421
(Let me try.)

1484
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:31,721
Daisuke.

1485
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:33,122
(Oh, my.)

1486
01:16:33,662 --> 01:16:35,421
- Daisuke. - Is that Daisuke?

1487
01:16:35,961 --> 01:16:36,961
Daisuke!

1488
01:16:36,962 --> 01:16:39,430
(The youngest's unexpected attack makes them dizzy.)

1489
01:16:39,431 --> 01:16:40,500
He can't do it.

1490
01:16:40,501 --> 01:16:42,361
No matter how sexy he tries to be, he's cute.

1491
01:16:42,362 --> 01:16:43,372
He's so cute.

1492
01:16:45,872 --> 01:16:46,872
(Cute)

1493
01:16:46,873 --> 01:16:47,942
Cute.

1494
01:16:49,042 --> 01:16:50,141
(He's so cute.)

1495
01:16:50,742 --> 01:16:51,772
Please vote for us.

1496
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:53,511
(So cute!)

1497
01:16:55,082 --> 01:16:56,112
(Steven)

1498
01:16:56,582 --> 01:16:57,611
Thank you.

1499
01:16:57,612 --> 01:16:59,181
(I love you.)

1500
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:01,651
(I love you too.)

1501
01:17:01,652 --> 01:17:02,850
- Send us lots of support... - Three,

1502
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:03,891
and vote for us.

1503
01:17:03,992 --> 01:17:05,051
Two,

1504
01:17:05,322 --> 01:17:06,792
- one. - Vote for us.

1505
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:10,692
- So cute! - The voting ends. Well done.

1506
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:14,231
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1507
01:17:14,232 --> 01:17:16,362
(The voting may have ended, but they don't stop expressing love.)

1508
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:20,170
It's hard to guess this round. Everyone did a good job.

1509
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:21,171
(The other teams did a good job.)

1510
01:17:21,172 --> 01:17:22,242
Right.

1511
01:17:22,442 --> 01:17:25,042
No team's theme overlapped.

1512
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:28,441
Okay. We placed 2nd in the 1st round.

1513
01:17:28,442 --> 01:17:30,581
- Yes. - But from what I just saw,

1514
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:32,912
we have a chance to place first.

1515
01:17:33,221 --> 01:17:35,051
You can do it.

1516
01:17:35,282 --> 01:17:37,022
- Well done. - Well done.

1517
01:17:37,721 --> 01:17:39,292
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1518
01:17:39,961 --> 01:17:42,590
(Will they be able to place 1st for the 1st time?)

1519
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:44,430
(Round 3 ends.)

1520
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:47,301
I will reveal the ranking for Round Three.

1521
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:48,661
Please.

1522
01:17:48,662 --> 01:17:51,031
(Revealing the ranking for this round)

1523
01:17:51,032 --> 01:17:53,801
The final ranking is determined...

1524
01:17:54,001 --> 01:17:55,542
after combining the scores of everyone who performed onstage.

1525
01:17:56,141 --> 01:17:58,311
The players' score is calculated with...

1526
01:17:58,612 --> 01:18:00,511
thirty percent on-site voting...

1527
01:18:00,782 --> 01:18:03,081
and 70 percent online voting.

1528
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:04,082
(The score calculation ratio)

1529
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,652
The online voting takes up a lot.

1530
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:08,751
If one player performed twice,

1531
01:18:08,881 --> 01:18:10,891
the on-site voting and online voting...

1532
01:18:11,192 --> 01:18:13,322
are reflected twice.

1533
01:18:13,421 --> 01:18:14,421
That's double the score.

1534
01:18:14,422 --> 01:18:16,692
(How Round 3's score is calculated)

1535
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:17,792
Now,

1536
01:18:18,032 --> 01:18:19,692
I will first reveal...

1537
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:21,702
the on-site voting result.

1538
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:24,072
It's UNIT ONE's result.

1539
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:29,771
("Only U" by TEAM GROOVE's UNIT 1)

1540
01:18:29,772 --> 01:18:34,942
(They mesmerized everyone with their sweet vocals)

1541
01:18:36,282 --> 01:18:41,581
("My, My, My" by TEAM BEAT's UNIT 1)

1542
01:18:41,582 --> 01:18:44,751
(They revealed their fatal charms.)

1543
01:18:45,452 --> 01:18:50,060
("Roller Coaster" by TEAM RHYTHM's UNIT 1)

1544
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:53,561
(They showed off their cuteness and unexpected charms.)

1545
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:56,702
(Round 3 on-site voting)

1546
01:18:57,131 --> 01:18:58,201
(UNIT 1 match)

1547
01:18:58,202 --> 01:18:59,732
Oh, there it is.

1548
01:19:00,572 --> 01:19:01,942
TEAM GROOVE...

1549
01:19:02,372 --> 01:19:03,841
placed first.

1550
01:19:03,971 --> 01:19:05,442
(Feeling proud)

1551
01:19:05,772 --> 01:19:07,511
UNIT TWO's result isn't out yet.

1552
01:19:08,181 --> 01:19:09,341
It's okay. You did a good job.

1553
01:19:09,742 --> 01:19:11,181
- TEAM RHYTHM's in second place. - Good job.

1554
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:13,921
TEAM BEAT's in third place.

1555
01:19:14,022 --> 01:19:16,221
- We have a chance to place second. - Right.

1556
01:19:16,482 --> 01:19:17,551
Let's place second.

1557
01:19:17,851 --> 01:19:19,051
Let's get our hopes up for first place. We never know.

1558
01:19:19,891 --> 01:19:21,291
- Please. - Then...

1559
01:19:21,292 --> 01:19:23,332
the score after combining the second unit's score.

1560
01:19:23,662 --> 01:19:25,492
Here comes TEAM RHYTHM's...

1561
01:19:25,692 --> 01:19:27,202
final on-site voting score.

1562
01:19:27,402 --> 01:19:28,402
Please.

1563
01:19:28,403 --> 01:19:30,101
(Revealing TEAM RHYTHM's final on-site voting score)

1564
01:19:32,702 --> 01:19:35,470
(Round 3 on-site voting)

1565
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:37,042
(Total: 3,036)

1566
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,542
- What? - What?

1567
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:40,782
What?

1568
01:19:41,612 --> 01:19:44,381
- It's 3,036. - What?

1569
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:46,211
- That's TEAM RHYTHM. - One second.

1570
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:49,051
- That's lower than I expected. - Hold on.

1571
01:19:49,992 --> 01:19:52,251
- It's lower than "Roller Coaster." - You're right.

1572
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,761
The first unit's score was higher.

1573
01:19:55,761 --> 01:19:58,832
Here comes TEAM BEAT's final on-site voting score.

1574
01:19:59,192 --> 01:20:00,402
Please.

1575
01:20:02,702 --> 01:20:04,130
Oh, TEAM BEAT.

1576
01:20:04,131 --> 01:20:05,201
(Making a fuss)

1577
01:20:05,202 --> 01:20:07,100
(Round 3 on-site voting)

1578
01:20:07,101 --> 01:20:09,141
(Total: 3,204)

1579
01:20:09,971 --> 01:20:13,170
(TEAM BEAT's final score: 3,204)

1580
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:14,782
It's 3,204.

1581
01:20:15,582 --> 01:20:17,152
Awesome!

1582
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:23,750
(TEAM BEAT beat TEAM RHYTHM for the on-site voting.)

1583
01:20:23,751 --> 01:20:26,792
- That's crazy. - We finally avoided third place.

1584
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:28,921
(Emotional)

1585
01:20:29,522 --> 01:20:30,961
(Exclaiming)

1586
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,232
(Shocked)

1587
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:37,201
(TEAM BEAT's score makes TEAM RHYTHM nervous.)

1588
01:20:37,202 --> 01:20:39,331
Next is TEAM GROOVE's...

1589
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:41,872
final on-site voting score.

1590
01:20:45,641 --> 01:20:48,211
(What?)

1591
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:52,380
(Round 3 on-site voting)

1592
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:54,022
(Total: 3,362)

1593
01:20:54,522 --> 01:20:57,192
It's 3,362.

1594
01:20:57,692 --> 01:21:00,362
TEAM GROOVE placed first for the on-site voting.

1595
01:21:01,061 --> 01:21:02,061
Good job.

1596
01:21:02,062 --> 01:21:04,430
(TEAM GROOVE's final score: 3,362)

1597
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:06,261
See? I told you.

1598
01:21:06,702 --> 01:21:07,902
Good job, guys.

1599
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:10,301
We still placed second. Come here.

1600
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,001
Finally!

1601
01:21:15,442 --> 01:21:18,340
First of all, this is still amazing.

1602
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:20,841
It was worth your effort.

I thought we did a good job.

1610
01:21:35,792 --> 01:21:39,792
But the result wasn't so good. I was quite disappointed.

1611
01:21:40,902 --> 01:21:41,960
It's okay.

1612
01:21:41,961 --> 01:21:44,201

1776
01:27:37,202 --> 01:27:40,140
There are only three players left.

1777
01:27:40,141 --> 01:27:43,572
Who placed 1st in the 1st team?

What?

1799
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:36,491
It's double Steven's score.

1800
01:28:36,492 --> 01:28:38,702
- Gosh. - It's over 400,000.

1801
01:28:39,131 --> 01:28:41,970
Thank you to everyone...

me, and not only me, but...

1805
01:28:49,471 --> 01:28:51,072
TEAM RHYTHM as well...

1806
01:28:53,082 --> 01:28:54,311
Thank you so much.

1807
01:28:55,311 --> 01:28:58,651
We've been working hard for the previous missions.

1808
01:28:58,652 --> 01:29:00,752
But sadly, we didn't get first.

1809
01:29:01,322 --> 01:29:05,691
So getting first place with TEAM RHYTHM with your help...

1810
01:29:07,221 --> 01:29:09,461
It's such an honor for us.

1811
01:29:09,462 --> 01:29:11,902
So I hope you continue supporting not only me but...

1812
01:29:12,002 --> 01:29:13,461
all of TEAM RHYTHM as well.

1813
01:29:13,462 --> 01:29:14,730
And other teams as well...

1814
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:18,032
because we all deserve to be recognized.

1815
01:29:18,141 --> 01:29:19,971
Thank you so much. I love you.

1816
01:29:20,242 --> 01:29:21,511
Thank you, guys.

1817
01:29:23,572 --> 01:29:25,411
First of all,

01:29:25,412 --> 01:29:27,680
thank you for your votes.

1819
01:29:27,681 --> 01:29:31,981

1826
01:29:44,431 --> 01:29:45,462
(Announcing TEAM GROOVE's individual ranking)

1827
01:29:45,662 --> 01:29:46,832
Gosh.

1828
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,940
I think their starting players are the same.

1829
01:29:51,941 --> 01:29:53,041
(After the announcement)

1830
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:55,412
I think their first is Park Han.

1831
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,771
I think so too.

1832
01:29:57,641 --> 01:30:00,310
The team in 2nd place will get 3 yellow cards.

1833
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:01,380
(3 yellow cards for TEAM GROOVE in 2nd place)

1834
01:30:01,381 --> 01:30:04,821
TEAM GROOVE will receive yellow cards for the first time.

1835
01:30:04,822 --> 01:30:06,151
(TEAM GROOVE's first yellow cards)

1836
01:30:06,152 --> 01:30:09,792
I was worried and scared.

1837
01:30:09,952 --> 01:30:12,992
(With one more yellow card, Sirin will be eliminated.)

1838
01:30:13,362 --> 01:30:15,560
Who will be the first player...

1839
01:30:15,561 --> 01:30:17,591
to receive a yellow card in TEAM GROOVE?

1840
01:30:19,801 --> 01:30:21,430
Let's check the individual ranking.

1841
01:30:21,431 --> 01:30:24,231
(Announcing TEAM GROOVE's individual ranking)

1842

1843
01:30:26,742 --> 01:30:28,572
will be getting yellow cards.

1844
01:30:29,511 --> 01:30:31,511
The 14th player who will receive a yellow card is...

1845
01:30:32,282 --> 01:30:34,541
- I think it's Gangdong. - Gangdong.

1846
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:35,752

01:30:49,162 --> 01:30:50,191

(Online vote: 28,371, Total: 28,565)

1857
01:30:52,702 --> 01:30:54,801
He would've been in the 14th place if he hadn't performed in UNIT 2.

1858
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:56,032
You're right.

1859

- The lineup is the same here. - It's the same.

1892
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:04,301
The starting lineup and bench players stay the same.

1893
01:32:04,971 --> 01:32:06,672
- There's a thin line between them. - You're right.

1894
01:32:07,672 --> 01:32:09,672
Joo Hyoung is a starting player, even though he didn't perform.

1895
01:32:10,212 --> 01:32:11,511

Now, Park Ju Won and Park Han...

1940
01:33:44,231 --> 01:33:45,301
are left.

1941
01:33:46,002 --> 01:33:49,412

01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:51,941

Park Han.

1946
01:33:58,351 --> 01:33:59,421

(Starting lineup: Park Han, On-site vote: 244 and 273)

1951

1955
01:34:14,931 --> 01:34:17,231
- Park Ju Won. - Ju Won!

1956
01:34:19,872 --> 01:34:24,412
Thank you for making me realize that I am someone...

1957
01:34:25,412 --> 01:34:27,112
who can receive so much love.

1958
01:34:28,381 --> 01:34:32,952
I think I still have a lot more to show.

1959
01:34:33,221 --> 01:34:37,191
I'll prepare more and work even harder.

1960
01:34:38,221 --> 01:34:41,091
Thank you for giving me such an undeserved position.

1961
01:34:44,231 --> 01:34:45,601
Congratulations.

1962
01:34:46,902 --> 01:34:48,431
Thanks to my fans,

1963
01:34:48,931 --> 01:34:53,372
my days feel like a dream.

1964
01:34:53,672 --> 01:34:55,112
Thank you so much.

1965
01:34:55,811 --> 01:34:59,612
I’ll show you many more amazing sides of myself. Thank you.

1966
01:35:01,141 --> 01:35:02,152
All right.

1967
01:35:02,752 --> 01:35:05,880
TEAM GROOVE, please move to your seats.

1968
01:35:05,881 --> 01:35:06,881
Thank you.

1969
01:35:07,152 --> 01:35:11,491
The third place team, TEAM BEAT, please come to the stage.

1970
01:35:11,492 --> 01:35:12,591
TEAM BEAT, please come on out.

1971
01:35:14,662 --> 01:35:15,662
Have a safe trip.

1972
01:35:15,663 --> 01:35:17,832
- We'll be back safely. - We'll be back safely.

1973
01:35:18,091 --> 01:35:20,431
- It's okay. - We're good.

1974
01:35:21,032 --> 01:35:24,501
If Hyo Tae, Li Zhiwei,

1975
01:35:24,502 --> 01:35:27,071
and Jin Ziming don't make it to the top three,

1976
01:35:27,072 --> 01:35:28,912
there'll be six starting players, right?

1977
01:35:31,172 --> 01:35:34,940
The 3rd-place team will receive 6 yellow cards.

1978
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:36,082
(TEAM BEAT, the 3rd-place team, is getting 6 yellow cards.)

1979
01:35:37,811 --> 01:35:40,381
Currently, Kim Hyo Tae, Li Zhiwei,

1980
01:35:40,822 --> 01:35:43,992
and Jin Ziming have one yellow card each.

1981
01:35:45,221 --> 01:35:47,322
If they receive another yellow card,

1982
01:35:47,761 --> 01:35:50,190
they'll be eliminated from Universe League.

1983
01:35:50,191 --> 01:35:52,130
(Elimination from Universe League)

1984
01:35:52,131 --> 01:35:55,672
Now, let's see who'll receive the yellow cards.

1985
01:35:56,072 --> 01:35:58,231
Let's check out the individual ranking.

1986
01:35:58,801 --> 01:36:00,471
It's going to be fine.

1987
01:36:02,742 --> 01:36:05,542

1997
01:36:26,902 --> 01:36:27,902

1998
01:36:27,902 --> 01:36:28,902
(Online vote: 19,767, Total: 19,767)

1999
01:36:29,002 --> 01:36:30,671
(Two players got eliminated.)

2000
01:36:30,672 --> 01:36:32,941
- I'll announce the starting lineup. - Oh, my gosh.

2001
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:35,572
Even the starting players get yellow cards.

2002
01:36:38,742 --> 01:36:40,440
The seventh player who'll receive a yellow card...

2003
01:36:40,441 --> 01:36:44,411

2004
01:36:44,412 --> 01:36:45,952

(Starting lineup: Kim Hyo Tae, Total: 20,539)

2007
01:36:50,851 --> 01:36:52,322
Hyo Tae is eliminated.

2008
01:36:55,992 --> 01:37:00,931
(Now, TEAM BEAT has only 6 players left.)

2009
01:37:01,162 --> 01:37:02,671
The sixth player who will receive a yellow card...

2010
01:37:02,672 --> 01:37:03,901

2015
01:37:11,172 --> 01:37:12,641
(Starting lineup: An Yul, Total: 32,900)

2016

The 4th place, who will receive a yellow card...

2018
01:37:18,412 --> 01:37:20,020
(Who'll be the last to receive a yellow card on TEAM BEAT?)

2019
01:37:20,021 --> 01:37:21,351
is Yuito.

2020
01:37:22,122 --> 01:37:23,122
Yuito.

2021
01:37:23,123 --> 01:37:24,151
(Starting lineup: Yuito, Total: 33,471)

2022
01:37:24,152 --> 01:37:25,152
Yuito.

2023
01:37:25,492 --> 01:37:27,761
Everyone except the top three received a yellow card.

2024
01:37:27,862 --> 01:37:30,862
Now, let's see who avoided the yellow card...

2025
01:37:31,032 --> 01:37:33,061
and came in the top three.

2026
01:37:34,832 --> 01:37:36,202
- The third place is... - Jin Ho,

2027
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:38,901
Kairi, Woong Ki.

2028
01:37:38,902 --> 01:37:40,601
(Who won the 3rd place on TEAM BEAT?)

2029
01:37:43,712 --> 01:37:45,612
Keum Jin Ho.

2030
01:37:45,712 --> 01:37:47,111
(Starting lineup: Keum Jin Ho, Total: 42,970)

2031
01:37:47,112 --> 01:37:48,141
Thanks for your efforts.

2032
01:37:50,252 --> 01:37:53,681
I'll continue to announce the first player.

2033
01:37:54,152 --> 01:37:55,152
The first player is...

2034
01:37:55,153 --> 01:38:00,322
(Between Cha Woong Ki and Kairi, who will win the 1st place?)

2035
01:38:02,032 --> 01:38:04,532
Cha Woong Ki. Congratulations.

2036
01:38:05,832 --> 01:38:07,701
- Oh, my. - My goodness.

2037
01:38:07,702 --> 01:38:10,401
(Starting lineup: Cha Woong Ki, On-site vote: 270 and 250,)

2038
01:38:10,402 --> 01:38:13,300
(Online vote: 264,699, Total: 265,219)

2039
01:38:13,301 --> 01:38:15,511
Being on Universe League...

2040
01:38:16,042 --> 01:38:19,180
has brought me a lot of happiness...

2041
01:38:19,181 --> 01:38:20,712
and good fortune.

2042
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:23,912
While performing in Round Three,

2043
01:38:24,712 --> 01:38:26,282
I felt a happiness that could not be traded for...

2044
01:38:26,381 --> 01:38:29,221
or compared to anything.

2045
01:38:30,122 --> 01:38:34,521
I think I was very lucky to share...

2046
01:38:35,122 --> 01:38:39,502
that stage with my team.

2047
01:38:50,372 --> 01:38:53,712
It’s upsetting and sad...

2048
01:38:55,551 --> 01:38:57,011
that we have to say goodbye...

2049
01:38:57,452 --> 01:39:00,782
to three members of our team.

2050
01:39:05,051 --> 01:39:08,961
But the remaining team members...

2051
01:39:08,962 --> 01:39:12,701
(A promise to the team members who have run toward the same dream)

2052
01:39:12,702 --> 01:39:15,332
will work even harder to create an amazing stage.

2053
01:39:15,931 --> 01:39:20,202
I want to say to our team... Those who have already left,

2054
01:39:21,242 --> 01:39:23,941
those who will leave today, the ones staying,

2055
01:39:24,341 --> 01:39:27,311
and the directors,

2056
01:39:27,941 --> 01:39:31,451
that I love you all.

2057
01:39:31,452 --> 01:39:33,020
(Expressing his heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has been with him)

2058
01:39:33,021 --> 01:39:37,822
Thank you so much for giving me so much love...

2059
01:39:38,322 --> 01:39:39,591
that I don't deserve.

2060
01:39:40,691 --> 01:39:43,091
With this love as my strength,

2061
01:39:45,662 --> 01:39:48,261
I will definitely debut this time.

2062
01:39:48,702 --> 01:39:49,702
Thank you!

2063
01:39:52,641 --> 01:39:54,341
Yes, thank you for your efforts.

2064
01:39:56,271 --> 01:39:57,612
Thank you so much for voting for me,

2065
01:39:58,672 --> 01:40:01,111
even though I'm lacking in many ways.

2066
01:40:01,112 --> 01:40:02,480
I'll do my best.

2067
01:40:02,481 --> 01:40:03,811
(Starting lineup: Kairi, Total: 65,444)

2068
01:40:04,252 --> 01:40:05,252
Thanks for your efforts.

2069
01:40:08,422 --> 01:40:10,422
Well, it's unfortunate.

2070
01:40:11,091 --> 01:40:14,691
Kim Hyo Tae, Li Zhiwei and Jin Ziming will...

2071
01:40:15,462 --> 01:40:18,832
have to leave Universe League. Thank you for your hard work.

2072
01:40:23,131 --> 01:40:24,171
Everyone, come here.

2073
01:40:24,172 --> 01:40:26,371
(Bidding goodbye warmly)

2074
01:40:26,372 --> 01:40:28,572
- See you soon. - I love you.

2075
01:40:28,912 --> 01:40:29,971
See you, guys.

2076
01:40:31,811 --> 01:40:35,011
It was a meaningful journey for me.

2077
01:40:35,412 --> 01:40:37,551
I'm leaving with a lot of lessons learned.

2078
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:40,020
I simply started late.

2079
01:40:40,021 --> 01:40:42,152
My dream has always been this.

2080
01:40:42,252 --> 01:40:44,091
I don't want to give up.

2081
01:40:44,292 --> 01:40:47,362
It was such a glorious moment.

2082
01:40:47,521 --> 01:40:48,560
I was very happy.

2083
01:40:48,561 --> 01:40:49,591
(Hoping this is a stepping stone)

2084
01:40:49,862 --> 01:40:52,902
We will now start the trade.

2085
01:40:53,301 --> 01:40:54,501
The trade.

2086
01:40:54,502 --> 01:40:55,872
(The trade to make the best team)

2087
01:40:56,202 --> 01:40:58,631
The trade is the scariest.

2088
01:40:59,441 --> 01:41:00,441
Goodness.

2089
01:41:01,441 --> 01:41:02,811
What's going to happen?

2090
01:41:09,311 --> 01:41:10,680
Following the result of Round Three,

2091
01:41:10,681 --> 01:41:12,251
TEAM RHYTHM in 1st place has 2 tickets.

2092
01:41:12,252 --> 01:41:13,621
(1st place TEAM RHYTHM has 2 trade tickets.)

2093
01:41:13,622 --> 01:41:16,850
TEAM GROOVE in 2nd place has 1 trade ticket.

2094
01:41:16,851 --> 01:41:18,551
(2nd place TEAM GROOVE has 1 trade ticket.)

2095
01:41:21,822 --> 01:41:24,792
(TEAM BEAT could not earn a trade ticket.)

2096
01:41:25,332 --> 01:41:27,832
This is unfair to our team members.

2097
01:41:29,072 --> 01:41:30,931
We can't get our revenge.

2098
01:41:33,672 --> 01:41:36,171
Now then, we will start the trade with TEAM RHYTHM.

2099
01:41:36,172 --> 01:41:38,880
Directors TEN and YANGYANG, please come forward.

2100
01:41:38,881 --> 01:41:41,181
(TEAM RHYTHM has 2 trade tickets.)

2101
01:41:41,612 --> 01:41:42,912
We couldn't trade players...

2102
01:41:43,381 --> 01:41:45,980
from TEAM GROOVE until now.

2103
01:41:45,981 --> 01:41:48,351
But now that we've beaten TEAM GROOVE,

2104
01:41:48,452 --> 01:41:50,851
we can finally trade players...

2105
01:41:51,652 --> 01:41:54,221
from TEAM GROOVE.

2106
01:41:54,492 --> 01:41:57,631
I thought about who the directors might trade.

2107
01:42:00,931 --> 01:42:02,572
Our team is full of aces.

2108
01:42:02,971 --> 01:42:04,532
I don't want to lose anyone.

2109
01:42:05,431 --> 01:42:06,871
I don't want to lose my aces.

2110
01:42:06,872 --> 01:42:08,471
(TEAM GROOVE might lose players.)

2111
01:42:08,672 --> 01:42:11,811
TEAM GROOVE has never lost a player.

2112
01:42:12,542 --> 01:42:15,042
This is what the other teams felt.

2113
01:42:15,441 --> 01:42:16,881
I understood them.

2114
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:20,452
My heart started to grow heavy.

2115
01:42:29,391 --> 01:42:31,061
First off,

2116
01:42:31,992 --> 01:42:34,131
all players of TEAM RHYTHM...

2117
01:42:34,561 --> 01:42:37,601
did a great job from the beginning.

2118
01:42:38,202 --> 01:42:41,341
YANGYANG and I have thought things through...

2119
01:42:41,801 --> 01:42:43,941
and decided on the players...

2120
01:42:44,212 --> 01:42:45,511
to release.

2121
01:42:46,612 --> 01:42:50,782
(Release is mandatory in trading.)

2122
01:42:51,252 --> 01:42:52,322
The first player...

2123
01:42:52,782 --> 01:42:54,622
TEAM RHYTHM will release is...

2124
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:56,792
Please, not me.

2125
01:42:58,691 --> 01:43:02,090
After looking at the individual rankings,

2126
01:43:02,091 --> 01:43:05,532
I thought I was likely to be released...

2127
01:43:05,832 --> 01:43:07,362
to be traded for another player.

2128
01:43:07,662 --> 01:43:12,001
(Which player will be released from TEAM RHYTHM?)

2129
01:43:12,002 --> 01:43:13,501
Kim Dong Yun.

2130
01:43:13,502 --> 01:43:15,270
(TEAM RHYTHM's 6th place Kim Dong Yun is released.)

2131
01:43:15,271 --> 01:43:16,741
Player Kim Dong Yun.

2132
01:43:16,742 --> 01:43:20,712
(TEAM RHYTHM's 6th place Kim Dong Yun is released.)

2133
01:43:23,311 --> 01:43:24,350
But they took him last time.

2134
01:43:24,351 --> 01:43:25,381
(During trade)

2135
01:43:25,981 --> 01:43:27,680
Please announce the player you will scout.

2136
01:43:27,681 --> 01:43:28,681
(Who will they scout?)

2137
01:43:28,682 --> 01:43:30,622
All right.

2138
01:43:30,992 --> 01:43:32,151
The player we'll trade is...

2139
01:43:32,152 --> 01:43:33,591
(With Kim Dong Yun)

2140
01:43:33,891 --> 01:43:35,691
It's mean if they choose us.

2141
01:43:37,332 --> 01:43:39,532
I wish they choose two from TEAM GROOVE.

2142
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:43,231
From TEAM GROOVE, the amazing vocalist...

2143
01:43:43,471 --> 01:43:45,841
and great dancer, Han.

2144
01:43:46,641 --> 01:43:48,672
I thought they could take Han.

2145
01:43:49,372 --> 01:43:50,441
I have this feeling...

2146
01:43:50,971 --> 01:43:53,112
they could take Ju Won back.

2147
01:43:53,712 --> 01:43:57,252
(2nd place Park Ju Won, who was scouted during trade?)

2148
01:43:58,681 --> 01:44:00,381
- TEAM GROOVE's... - No!

2149
01:44:02,521 --> 01:44:04,051
- TEAM GROOVE's... - No!

2150
01:44:04,992 --> 01:44:06,021
No!

2151
01:44:07,162 --> 01:44:08,760
You're finally experiencing this.

2152
01:44:08,761 --> 01:44:10,662
(Laughing)

2153
01:44:11,091 --> 01:44:12,902
- Ju Won? - Is it Ju Won?

2154
01:44:13,702 --> 01:44:16,601
If we win first, I think Ju Won...

2155
01:44:16,902 --> 01:44:19,301
will come to our team. "Okay, it's going to be Ju Won."

2156
01:44:20,072 --> 01:44:22,971
(JL wishes Park Ju Won to come back.)

2157
01:44:23,441 --> 01:44:26,612
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the slightest hope...

2158
01:44:26,881 --> 01:44:28,911
they would call out...

2159
01:44:28,912 --> 01:44:30,712
my name.

2160
01:44:31,981 --> 01:44:34,751
(Will TEN and YANGYANG scout 2nd place Park Ju Won?)

2161
01:44:34,752 --> 01:44:36,691
(Or 1st place Park Han?)

2162
01:44:37,622 --> 01:44:41,992
(Or is it another player from TEAM GROOVE?)

2163
01:44:43,231 --> 01:44:46,162
(What is the result?)

2164
01:44:46,743 --> 01:44:50,473
(Who are Directors TEN and YANGYANG scouting from TEAM GROOVE?)

2165
01:44:50,474 --> 01:44:53,813
(Who are Directors TEN and YANGYANG scouting from TEAM GROOVE?)

2166
01:44:54,925 --> 01:44:56,354
(Nervous)

2167
01:45:00,825 --> 01:45:02,125
Seo Jeong Woo.

2168
01:45:02,864 --> 01:45:06,103
(Nominating TEAM GROOVE's 3rd place Seo Jeong Woo)

2169
01:45:06,104 --> 01:45:07,433
- What? - Jeong Woo?

2170
01:45:07,434 --> 01:45:10,734
(Nominating TEAM GROOVE's 3rd place Seo Jeong Woo)

2171
01:45:13,875 --> 01:45:15,304
Seo Jeong Woo.

2172
01:45:18,514 --> 01:45:20,314
Now that's a strong player.

2173
01:45:20,944 --> 01:45:22,144
Seo Jeong Woo.

2174
01:45:23,354 --> 01:45:28,584
(The players are shocked by the unexpected trade result.)

2175
01:45:28,585 --> 01:45:32,295
(The players are shocked by the unexpected trade result.)

2176
01:45:33,325 --> 01:45:34,425
Don't go.

2177
01:45:34,825 --> 01:45:36,595
They're taking a strong player.

2178
01:45:38,535 --> 01:45:41,334
Jeong Woo has a charm...

2179
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,434
our team doesn't have.

2180
01:45:43,675 --> 01:45:46,274
He's like a new face.

2181
01:45:46,505 --> 01:45:48,773
And the final song...

2182
01:45:48,774 --> 01:45:51,344
suits him well.

2183
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:53,384
That's why we've come to this decision.

2184
01:45:53,385 --> 01:45:54,385
(A bold decision)

2185
01:45:54,585 --> 01:45:55,984
They've been mean since Chih En.

2186
01:45:57,915 --> 01:45:59,925
Dong Yun and Jeong Woo...

2187
01:46:00,385 --> 01:46:02,255
have been traded.

2188
01:46:02,524 --> 01:46:04,053
Please move...

2189
01:46:04,054 --> 01:46:06,063
to your new teams. Thank you.

2190
01:46:06,064 --> 01:46:08,864
- No, Jeong Woo. - You can't leave like this.

2191
01:46:08,965 --> 01:46:09,965
Jeong Woo.

2192
01:46:09,966 --> 01:46:12,233
(Jeong Woo must leave the team he was in since Round 1.)

2193
01:46:12,234 --> 01:46:14,364
Jeong Woo. You can't leave us like this.

2194
01:46:15,564 --> 01:46:16,933
Jeong Woo is crying.

2195
01:46:16,934 --> 01:46:18,534
(Jeong Woo ends up crying.)

2196
01:46:18,535 --> 01:46:21,175
I feel sad having to say goodbye to my team members.

2197
01:46:21,644 --> 01:46:23,943
I've bonded with them a lot.

2198
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:24,944
(The players and Director Lee are also sad.)

2199
01:46:24,945 --> 01:46:25,983
It was a bummer.

2200
01:46:25,984 --> 01:46:28,585
(The players and Director Lee are also sad.)

2201
01:46:29,755 --> 01:46:31,884
- Hi. - Hi.

2202
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:34,754
- Hi. - Jeong Woo!

2203
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:35,755
Long time no see.

2204
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:38,154
I can't forever be upset about it.

2205
01:46:38,755 --> 01:46:42,064
I'll try my best to adjust to TEAM RHYTHM.

2206
01:46:47,364 --> 01:46:49,004
Jeong Woo in TEAM RHYTHM is far from what I imagined.

2207
01:46:49,005 --> 01:46:50,005
Seriously.

2208
01:46:50,006 --> 01:46:52,875
Now then, you have one trade ticket left.

2209
01:46:53,375 --> 01:46:56,345
Please announce the player you'll release.

2210
01:46:57,075 --> 01:47:00,545
The player TEAM RHYTHM will release is...

2211
01:47:02,814 --> 01:47:05,825
(Will it be 1 of the 4 who couldn't perform?)

2212
01:47:06,455 --> 01:47:10,394
(Or is it the team's last place, Xie Yuxin?)

2213
01:47:14,564 --> 01:47:15,594
Hiroto.

2214
01:47:15,595 --> 01:47:16,664
(TEAM RHYTHM's 13th place Hiroto is released.)

2215
01:47:16,665 --> 01:47:19,363
Please stand up, Hiroto.

2216
01:47:19,364 --> 01:47:22,264
(TEAM RHYTHM's 13th place Hiroto is released.)

2217
01:47:25,104 --> 01:47:27,403
Please announce the player you'll scout.

2218
01:47:27,404 --> 01:47:29,443
(Who are the directors going to scout?)

2219
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:30,915
The player we'll scout is...

2220
01:47:31,774 --> 01:47:33,684
Don't you think it'll be from our team?

2221
01:47:34,415 --> 01:47:38,014
(Is the second scout going to be from TEAM GROOVE again?)

2222
01:47:39,255 --> 01:47:42,995
(Or is it from TEAM BEAT at risk?)

2223
01:47:43,925 --> 01:47:44,925
TEAM GROOVE's...

2224
01:47:44,926 --> 01:47:47,125
(Once again)

2225
01:47:48,825 --> 01:47:49,894
Really.

2226
01:47:50,434 --> 01:47:52,665
Universe League is truly cruel.

2227
01:47:53,635 --> 01:47:56,005
The next trade could be Park Han.

2228
01:47:57,904 --> 01:48:00,375
The first trade was Jeong Woo.

2229
01:48:00,705 --> 01:48:03,974
It was nerve-racking.

2230
01:48:05,175 --> 01:48:06,944
When Jeong Woo's name was called out,

2231
01:48:07,684 --> 01:48:09,585
I expected them...

2232
01:48:10,585 --> 01:48:13,024
not to choose us again...

2233
01:48:14,354 --> 01:48:16,954
and thought I had failed to prove myself.

2234
01:48:16,955 --> 01:48:19,364
("I had failed to prove myself.")

2235
01:48:20,465 --> 01:48:23,863
(Who will be traded from TEAM GROOVE?)

2236
01:48:23,864 --> 01:48:27,534
(Who will be traded from TEAM GROOVE?)

2237
01:48:27,535 --> 01:48:28,604
Park Ju Won.

2238
01:48:29,934 --> 01:48:34,444
(TEAM GROOVE's 2nd place Park Ju Won is scouted.)

2239
01:48:34,774 --> 01:48:36,715
(I knew it.)

2240
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:40,013
Park Ju Won.

2241
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:42,244
(The directors bring back Ju Won who was taken away in Round 2.)

2242
01:48:42,245 --> 01:48:43,285
- Yes. - Ju Won.

2243
01:48:45,415 --> 01:48:46,455
That's it.

2244
01:48:47,024 --> 01:48:48,984
Taking him back is amazing.

2245
01:48:50,854 --> 01:48:52,795
Why are you scouting him?

2246
01:48:53,425 --> 01:48:55,465
I personally thought...

2247
01:48:55,934 --> 01:48:59,263
he was a player with an important role in TEAM RHYTHM...

2248
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,665
who always did his best.

2249
01:49:01,564 --> 01:49:03,903
I've always wanted...

2250
01:49:03,904 --> 01:49:07,104
Park Ju Won to be on TEAM RHYTHM.

2251
01:49:07,705 --> 01:49:09,414
Come back home.

2252
01:49:09,415 --> 01:49:11,813
(Come back home now.)

2253
01:49:11,814 --> 01:49:15,014
Great. Hiroto and Park Ju Won have been traded.

2254
01:49:15,285 --> 01:49:18,614
Please move to your new teams.

2255
01:49:21,455 --> 01:49:22,523
Great work.

2256
01:49:22,524 --> 01:49:24,154
- I've learned a lot in this team. - No.

2257
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:26,094
- Good job until now. - Thank you.

2258
01:49:26,095 --> 01:49:28,425
Good luck no matter where you are.

2259
01:49:28,894 --> 01:49:30,063
It's time to go home.

2260
01:49:30,064 --> 01:49:31,594
(Laughing)

2261
01:49:31,595 --> 01:49:32,763
Great work.

2262
01:49:32,764 --> 01:49:34,803
Do well in TEAM RHYTHM. Good luck.

2263
01:49:34,804 --> 01:49:37,705
- Park Ju Won! - Park Ju Won!

2264
01:49:38,705 --> 01:49:39,903
(Park Ju Won has returned to TEAM RHYTHM.)

2265
01:49:39,904 --> 01:49:41,604
- Hi. - Hi.

2266
01:49:42,205 --> 01:49:44,114
- Welcome back. - Welcome back.

2267
01:49:45,575 --> 01:49:47,944
This is your real home.

2268
01:49:48,514 --> 01:49:50,585
It's like I've come back home.

2269
01:49:51,014 --> 01:49:53,654
During that short time,

2270
01:49:54,585 --> 01:49:58,224
I've had a great experience.

2271
01:50:00,925 --> 01:50:03,034
They took the 2nd and 3rd-place players.

2272
01:50:03,035 --> 01:50:04,464
Yes, 2nd and 3rd-place players.

2273
01:50:04,465 --> 01:50:06,734
(Scouting the high-ranking players from TEAM GROOVE)

2274
01:50:07,205 --> 01:50:08,933
(TEAM RHYTHM reinforces its strength.)

2275
01:50:08,934 --> 01:50:11,934
We will now move on to the second-place team's trade.

2276
01:50:12,075 --> 01:50:14,375
Director Lee Chang Sub, please come onto the stage.

2277
01:50:16,215 --> 01:50:17,274
Chang Sub.

2278
01:50:18,814 --> 01:50:21,484
(Anxious, Director YUGYEOM also gets up.)

2279
01:50:21,845 --> 01:50:23,353
Please, Chang Sub.

2280
01:50:23,354 --> 01:50:26,154
Somehow, TEAM BEAT is...

2281
01:50:26,825 --> 01:50:28,353
Who is TEAM GROOVE going to pick?

2282
01:50:28,354 --> 01:50:29,755
- Gosh. - It's us.

2283
01:50:29,925 --> 01:50:31,554
It has to be us.

2284
01:50:37,535 --> 01:50:38,964
Now then.

2285
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:42,364
We will proceed with the trade right away.

2286
01:50:42,804 --> 01:50:45,474
The player our team will release is...

2287
01:50:46,904 --> 01:50:49,415
Being released scares me more.

2288
01:50:50,474 --> 01:50:51,914
(Anxious)

2289
01:50:51,915 --> 01:50:54,285
- Why do I have a hunch it'll be me? - I think it'll be me.

2290
01:50:56,385 --> 01:50:58,513
I expected it to be Joo Hyoung...

2291
01:50:58,514 --> 01:51:01,724
or Dae Yun who couldn't perform in the recent round.

2292
01:51:04,054 --> 01:51:09,664
(Which player from TEAM GROOVE will be released?)

2293
01:51:09,665 --> 01:51:11,534
Kim Dae Yun.

2294
01:51:11,535 --> 01:51:14,835
All right. Please stand up, Kim Dae Yun.

2295
01:51:15,165 --> 01:51:17,303
- Please. - Bye.

2296
01:51:17,304 --> 01:51:20,304
(TEAM GROOVE's 12th place Kim Dae Yun is released.)

2297
01:51:22,474 --> 01:51:25,075
Please announce the player you will scout...

2298
01:51:25,245 --> 01:51:26,644
from TEAM BEAT.

2299
01:51:28,045 --> 01:51:29,245
Guys, hold hands.

2300
01:51:29,455 --> 01:51:30,754
My hands are sweaty.

2301
01:51:30,755 --> 01:51:32,654
- It's okay. - I'm sorry.

2302
01:51:33,524 --> 01:51:36,893
(TEAM BEAT has to say goodbye to one of their teammates.)

2303
01:51:36,894 --> 01:51:41,125
Two players crossed my mind.

2304
01:51:41,564 --> 01:51:44,864
It was Woong Ki and Kairi.

2305
01:51:45,035 --> 01:51:47,134
Both showed off...

2306
01:51:47,135 --> 01:51:49,005
their vocal skills...

2307
01:51:49,135 --> 01:51:52,304
in "My, My, My" and "On and On."

2308
01:51:54,604 --> 01:51:58,575
The player I will scout from TEAM BEAT is...

2309
01:52:00,314 --> 01:52:05,483
(Who will be traded from TEAM BEAT?)

2310
01:52:05,484 --> 01:52:07,223
(Who will be traded from TEAM BEAT?)

2311
01:52:07,224 --> 01:52:08,624
An Yul.

2312
01:52:08,625 --> 01:52:11,053
I see. An Yul.

2313
01:52:11,054 --> 01:52:12,624
(TEAM BEAT's 5th place An Yul is scouted.)

2314
01:52:12,625 --> 01:52:14,625
- An Yul. - Really?

2315
01:52:14,825 --> 01:52:17,063
- An Yul. - For real?

2316
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:18,135
(TEAM BEAT's 5th place An Yul is scouted.)

2317
01:52:20,465 --> 01:52:21,505
Our youngest.

2318
01:52:22,135 --> 01:52:26,404
I wanted to strengthen our vocal skills.

2319
01:52:26,944 --> 01:52:30,044
And the character and image...

2320
01:52:30,045 --> 01:52:31,915
An Yul has...

2321
01:52:32,075 --> 01:52:33,385
suit...

2322
01:52:34,345 --> 01:52:36,554
TEAM GROOVE well.

2323
01:52:37,255 --> 01:52:38,684
Hence, I am scouting him.

2324
01:52:38,885 --> 01:52:42,153
Kim Dae Yun and An Yul have been traded.

2325
01:52:42,154 --> 01:52:45,354
- Please move to your new teams. - Bye.

2326
01:52:45,625 --> 01:52:46,665
Thanks for everything.

2327
01:52:47,325 --> 01:52:49,594
- Good work. - Thanks, guys.

2328
01:52:49,595 --> 01:52:51,965
- Great work. - Thanks.

2329
01:52:52,535 --> 01:52:53,535
Goodness.

2330
01:52:54,205 --> 01:52:56,874
- Please give me a moment. - Don't cry.

2331
01:52:56,875 --> 01:52:59,745
- Please give me time. - Our youngest.

2332
01:53:00,575 --> 01:53:02,174
Please give me a minute.

2333
01:53:02,175 --> 01:53:03,313
(Upset, An Yul can't lift his head.)

2334
01:53:03,314 --> 01:53:06,075
- Please give me time. - He's crying.

2335
01:53:06,314 --> 01:53:08,245
Yul, our youngest.

2336
01:53:09,554 --> 01:53:11,585
We practically brought you up.

2337
01:53:13,054 --> 01:53:14,755
You still...

2338
01:53:14,854 --> 01:53:17,124
learned a lot from TEAM BEAT's members...

2339
01:53:17,125 --> 01:53:19,053
and from us too.

2340
01:53:19,054 --> 01:53:20,824
You can pull it off on that team, right?

2341
01:53:20,825 --> 01:53:22,064
(You can pull it off on TEAM GROOVE, right?)

2342
01:53:22,864 --> 01:53:26,634
How could you take my strong players?

2343
01:53:26,635 --> 01:53:28,205
That was mean of you.

2344
01:53:29,934 --> 01:53:30,973
(Starting lineup:)

2345
01:53:30,974 --> 01:53:31,974
(JL, Steven, Zhang Shuaibo, Chih En, )

2346
01:53:31,975 --> 01:53:33,004
(Park Ju Won, Seo Jeong Woo, Daisuke)

2347
01:53:33,005 --> 01:53:34,303
(Bench: Eito, Mac, James, Zen Zen, )

2348
01:53:34,304 --> 01:53:35,443
(Li Zhinuo, Ayumu, Xie Yuxin)

2349
01:53:35,444 --> 01:53:36,773
(Starting lineup: Park Han, Kenta, Kim Joo Hyoung, )

2350
01:53:36,774 --> 01:53:37,943
(Jang Kyung Ho, Kwon Hee Jun, Sirin, Koo Han Seo)

2351
01:53:37,944 --> 01:53:38,944
(Bench:)

2352
01:53:38,945 --> 01:53:40,013
(Kim Dong Yun, Kim Gi Joong, He Junjin, )

2353
01:53:40,014 --> 01:53:41,014
(An Yul, Hiroto, Bae Jae Ho, Yeo Gangdong)

2354
01:53:41,014 --> 01:53:42,014
(Starting lineup:)

2355
01:53:42,015 --> 01:53:43,754
(Cha Woong Ki, Kairi, Keum Jin Ho, )

2356
01:53:43,755 --> 01:53:45,154
(Kim Dae Yun, Yuito, Nam Do Yoon)

2357
01:53:45,654 --> 01:53:48,354
With the league match complete, the numbers of remaining players are...

2358
01:53:48,484 --> 01:53:50,694
fourteen from TEAM RHYTHM in first place,

2359
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:53,495
fourteen from TEAM GROOVE in second place,

2360
01:53:54,024 --> 01:53:56,535
and 6 from TEAM BEAT in 3rd place.

2361
01:53:56,694 --> 01:53:58,294
In total, 34 players remain.

2362
01:53:58,295 --> 01:53:59,295
(34 players have survived.)

2363
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:02,164
However, only a certain number of players can go to the finals.

2364
01:54:02,165 --> 01:54:03,474
(The players who can go to the finals)

2365
01:54:04,005 --> 01:54:05,675
And that's 21 players.

2366
01:54:05,835 --> 01:54:08,245
(13 players are to be eliminated.)

2367
01:54:11,045 --> 01:54:12,274
It's only the starting lineup.

2368
01:54:13,785 --> 01:54:15,444
I think it's 1-on-1.

2369
01:54:16,614 --> 01:54:17,654
Only the starting lineup.

2370
01:54:18,215 --> 01:54:20,585
What happens to us?

2371
01:54:21,125 --> 01:54:23,994
The last debut battle.

2372
01:54:23,995 --> 01:54:25,553
Who will be the 21 players...

2373
01:54:25,554 --> 01:54:28,324
to perform in the live show?

2374
01:54:28,325 --> 01:54:34,363
(Which 21 players will perform on the final stage?)

2375
01:54:34,364 --> 01:54:38,074
(Tomorrow at 6pm)

2376
01:54:38,075 --> 01:54:39,874
(Finally)

2377
01:54:39,875 --> 01:54:41,745
(Those advancing to the finals)

2378
01:54:45,915 --> 01:54:47,643
(The last hurdle before the debut)

2379
01:54:47,644 --> 01:54:50,715
(Who will advance to the finals?)

2380
01:54:51,054 --> 01:54:53,754

01:54:53,755 --> 01:54:56,424
