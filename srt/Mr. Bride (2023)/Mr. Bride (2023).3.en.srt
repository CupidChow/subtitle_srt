00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,870
Have you ever heard of the saying that the kanji for "person" represents two people supporting each other?

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,960
But please take a good look at this.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,890
Clearly, only the person on the right is putting in all the effort.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,670
Meanwhile, the other one is putting his entire weight on him.

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,520
Um, Sir.

7

What kind of class is this?

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,710
Up till recently,

9
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,820
I thought I had to be the person on the right, for the person I liked to reciprocate my feelings.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,580
No, really. If only you'd be my "wife".

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,650
I'd love to!

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,910
That invitation was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,580
With me as your "wife", I won't let there be

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,210
a single speck of dust.

15
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,720
With me as your "wife", having an unbalanced diet will be unthinkable.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,410
However,

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,950
it seems like I was working hard in the wrong way.

18
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,250
- I meant to support her,
- What are you doing?

20
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,780
- but it only gave her pressure.
- It's okay. I'm doing it because I want to.

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,670
Because I'm the "wife".

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,580
Why do you have to work so hard just because you're the "wife"?

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,050
Even though there's nothing I can offer in return.

24

she was the one who reached out to me.

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,840
Which is why, I'd like to at least pay for things if we're going to live together.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,060
In other words, I'll be the pillar of the family.

- I look forward to working with you.
- I look forward to working with you.

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,190
And so, we're officially living together

32
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,940
as a "wife" and the pillar of the family that support each other.

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,030
Any questions at this point?

34
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,010
- Sir, question.
- Yes, Akamine?

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,330
Doesn't that mean

36
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:07,000
both of you are merely housemates living together for mutual benefit, especially in her case?

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,170
How do you plan on going beyond such a relationship?

Even if you think it's okay, I'm not sure if I'll be able to remain a "wife" till tomorrow morning.

You should blame it all on me.

because you were charmed by his housekeeping abilities. Is that right?

It's just as you said.

"Wife" is just a figure of speech.

The terms "wife" and "housemate" may be used interchangeably.

102

In other words, you're saying that you don't harbour any feelings for him,

103

not even a single ounce of romantic feelings for him?

- Shh. Come here.

We're trying to keep the fact that we're living together a secret.

184
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,410
Even though we're just sharing an apartment, a man and woman living together will definitely invite gossip.

What kind of gossip?

Yeah.

why not try backing off a little?

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,040
Either way, we can't share an apartment if I don't get through this tea party.

352
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,110
All I can do now is work hard on this.

353
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,450
This reminds me, how much was it?

354
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,680
How much?

355
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,700
How much did all the ingredients and stuff cost?

356
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,760
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

357
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,830
Let's see...

358
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,000
[SPECIALTY SUGAR COOKIES STORE]

359
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,220
[SUGAR COOKIES SET A - 8,100 YEN]
[SUGAR COOKIES SET B - 8,400 YEN]

360
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,280
Sugar cookies?

361
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,070
I've been thinking of trying to bake some.

362
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,110
Woah, they're really well done for a first try.

363
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:09,370
I-It's not what you think!

364
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:12,150
I do enjoy baking.

365
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,980
But, that day, the ones I made didn't turn out cute at all.

366
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,620
I felt kind of emba--

367
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,120
I felt bad about it.

368
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,310
You shouldn't let that bother you.

369
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,850
But...

370
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,750
I'd hate for people to think that's all I can do.

371
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,230
Hanazuma.

372
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,110
I get it.

373
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,110
Actually, in the first year I joined,

374
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,510
a senior asked me to make one of my specialties and bring it to the flower viewing.

375
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,200
I could've turned them down, but I decided to be stubborn for some reason.

376
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,600
In the end, I just repacked a few side dishes I bought from the deli of a department store.

377
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:11,270
From then on, I was seen as the "perfect bride", and here we are today.

378
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,860
I didn't know about that.

379
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm also the type who will give my all in order to not disappoint the people around me.

380
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,380
So I completely understand how you feel.

381
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,330
You know,

382
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,830
seeming like that's all you can do is important too.

383
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,430
Or perhaps I should say,

384
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,970
letting others see your failures is important.

385
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,160
If you can reveal your weaknesses to even just one person,

386
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,940
it'll make life a lot easier.

387
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:02,860
I think, the always cheerful version of you aside,

388
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,280
showing your frustration has an edge to it too.

389
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,930
With that said...um, sorry for sounding like a know-it-all.

390
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,690
Alright, let's eat!

391
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,390
As I've said, hurry up and tell me what you think already.

392
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:34,760
As I've said, I can't possibly tell someone from HR what I really think about the company!

393
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,420
But my superior told me to collect responses of what our young employees truly think.

394
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,490
I promise this won't affect your performance appraisal.

395
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,510
As if I'd take your word for it.

396
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,800
Besides,

397
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,220
aren't there are tons of other young employees?

398
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,270
Does it even matter?

399
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,670
What's with you? Do you want to go home and see her so badly?

400
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,930
Not really, since I'm backing off right now.

401
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,710
Backing off? What do you mean?

402
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,020
Yamamoto, are you using love tactics?

403
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,120
Yes, that's what I'm doing!

404
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,800
But it's not working out anyway, is it?

405
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,850
That's not true.

406
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,410
With this, I'll make sure

407
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,910
she returns my feelings.

408
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,020
In that case, we can keep at this, right?

409
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,100
Excuse me!

410
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,830
We'll have two highballs.

411
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,170
Don't just order more!

412
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,010
"Sorry, I'm having a terrible hangover.

413
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,390
This will be all for breakfast."

414
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,850
Is this a gorilla's breakfast?

415
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,990
I had too many drinks!

416
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,970
[THANKS FOR BREAKFAST. HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON.]

417
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,650
What's this?

418
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,040
My tactic is working?

419
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,900
Or is it not?

420
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,460
I don't know anymore!

421
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,690
- Um--
- Hayami!

422
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,890
Shall we...do this today too?

423
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,190
Oh, right.

424
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,780
Next is...

425
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,740
the meringue.

426
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,670
[YAMAMOTO: SORRY, I'LL BE HOME LATE AGAIN TODAY.]

427
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,460
Today too?

428
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:10,180
[GOT IT! I'VE GOT SOMETHING ON AS WELL SO IT'S OKAY!]

429
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,280
Welcome back. Did you go drinking with someone?

430
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,480
I can drink with whoever I want.

431
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,480
But what happens if one of you gets a boyfriend or girlfriend?

432
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,600
- She's my--
- I'm Akamine Reina.

433
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,200
Yamamoto and I joined the company at the same time.

434
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,400
You're not a suitable candidate for cohabiting with Chihiro.

435
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,480
I disapprove of your cohabitation!

436
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,620
I want to know how you truly feel.

437
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,810
What should we do, moving forward?

438
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,710
Well...

439
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,020
[MASAMI]

440
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,720
What's up?

441
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,290
I made the perfect sweet red bean paste this year too.

442
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,380
Huh? What are you talking about?

443
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,100
What? Hayami didn't tell you?

444
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,460
Again?

445
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,040
Seems like I'm hopeless.

446
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,190
Hayami!

447
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,030
Welcome home. You're back earlier than expected.

448
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,620
Um, this is...

449
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,950
Why did you hide it from me?

450
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,590
The fact that my brother invited you to a tea party, and more importantly, the fact that he's against our cohabitation!

451
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,510
Sorry.

452
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:16,050
I wanted to prove that I can at least bake a cake on my own without your help.

453
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,180
Is that why you've been staying behind with Hanazuma?

454
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,230
Gosh...

455
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,940
If that's the case, you should have said so!

456
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,190
My tactics were totally meaningless!

457
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,170
Tactics?

458
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:41,730
Um, anyway! You don't have to do all this, because I'll convince my brother somehow.

459
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,420
It's fine, you don't have to convince him.

460
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,190
What?

461
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,460
It's just...I agree with what your brother said.

462
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,610
I can't even bake a cake on my own, and yet I want to live together with you.

463
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,940
That's probably too presumptuous of me.

464
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,020
After all this time, what are you saying now?

465
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,540
- Who cares about th--
- Also,

466
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,200
Yamamoto.

467
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,130
There's someone you like, right?

468
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,290
What?

469
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,020
Recently, you've been distancing yourself and coming home late.

470
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,290
- That's because--
- If it gets inconvenient for you to continue being my "wife",

471
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,000
it's perfectly fine, you can just let me know.

472
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,110
I think it would be a good reason for dissolving this cohabitation arrangement.

473
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,070
Are you stupid?!

474
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,680
What?

475
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,600
I mean,

476
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,410
it's true that there's someone that I like.

477
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,040
- I knew it! Then all the more--
- But that's...

478
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,590
That's...

479
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,250
That's different from being a "wife".

480
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,570
In other words,

481
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,340
even though there's someone that I like, she's just someone that I like.

482
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,500
Since we're nowhere near having mutual feelings for each other, I can't afford to miss out on living as a "wife"

483
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,150
all because of that.

484
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,720
Anyway, I'm not about to

485
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:22,060
give up on being your "wife" so easily.

486
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:26,620
As the pillar of the house, please take a firm stance on this!

487
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,700
Okay.

488
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,890
That settles it.

489
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,800
Now, let's figure out what to do with these.

490
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:41,890
They aren't fluffy at all. I put in so much effort to make the meringue foamy too.

491
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,310
That's probably because the meringue is over-beaten.

492
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,990
Really?

493
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:54,000
Over whipping the meringue will dry it out instead, and the cake wouldn't be fluffy.

494
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,750
That's how it works?

495
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,340
Sorry for wasting food.

496
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,960
Don't worry, I won't let it go to waste.

497
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,020
In the first place,

498
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,980
there's absolutely no way you can win my brother over

499
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,420
with just a single cake.

500
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,290
After all, my second brother, Kaoru, is a pâtissier.

501
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,060
Oh, really?

502
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,280
Does that mean he tasked me with the impossible right from the start?

503
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,770
Sorry about that.

504
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:32,970
When it comes to me, my brother gets triggered and will suddenly turn into a toxic mother-in-law.

505
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,170
I see.

506
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,550
But it's okay.

507
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,060
Refusing to give up is your strong point, isn't it?

Yes.

00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,120
Wow.

- Nice to meet you too.
- Please don't get too familiar with her.

He's totally in his mother-in-law mode.

00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,120

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,150
Hayami, what have you brought?

00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,490
It's here.

525
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:13,230
I tried to bake a chiffon cake.

526
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,750
Oh, deary me.

527
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:23,500
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,650
This was the best I could do.

529
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,560
Is that so?

530
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,840
I regret to inform you, but I do not approve of your cohabitation.

531
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,490
Having to live with someone who can't even bake a cake satisfactorily

532
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,050
will only be a burden to Chihiro.

533
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,310
Please, hold on.

534
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:49,760
I wasn't able to bake a cake,

535
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,160
but I would like to prove that I'm a suitable candidate for cohabiting with him using another method.

536
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,160
- Another method?
- Yes.

537
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,300
[LIVING WITH YAMAMOTO CHIHIRO]

538
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,720
Now,

539
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:13,680
I will be presenting to you, what is the value of me living together with Yamamoto, from his viewpoint.

540
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,950
A presentation?

541
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,150
I see, so that's your plan.

542
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,120
Firstly,

543
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,750
you're assuming that there are no advantages for Yamamoto to live with someone who's bad at housework.

544
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,640
Rather than a give and take, he only "gives".

545
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,450
That's what you're worried about, isn't it?

546
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,550
- Exactly.
- With regards to that,

547
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:41,050
I'm paying for all the living expenses, so he "takes" in this aspect.

548
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,220
That's news to us. Isn't it, Masami?

549
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,870
But if we're talking about living expenses, he can just stay with us. It's the same thing.

550
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:53,600
As compared to staying with us, what are the advantages for him to stay with you?

551
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,530
That will be...

552
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:02,020
the fact that he will become a "God of Sales" from living with me.

553
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,600
[GOD OF SALES]

554
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,040
"God of Sales"?

555
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,120
People who can do everything themselves are unable to see through the eyes of someone who is bad at housework.

556
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,360
For example, the convenience of household appliances. As someone working in the sales department of its manufacturer,

557
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,100
wouldn't that be a critical weakness?

558
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,480
To resolve this issue, if he lives with someone who is hopeless at doing housework,

559
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,220
he'll be able to open his eyes to new perspectives.

560
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,380
Failures may give rise to other things as well.

561
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,650
For example, take a look at this.

562
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,980
What's this?

563
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:47,570
Yamamoto turned my failed chiffon cake into cake rusk.

564
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:53,160
Slice the failed chiffon cake thinly.

565
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,370
Sprinkle on granulated sugar, then place in the oven and bake.

566
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,660
It becomes cake rusk!

567
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,740
What I'm trying to say is,

568
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:13,200
my cohabitation with Yamamoto is a sharing of knowledge,

569
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,560
it brings about an effective synergy,

570
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,380
so ultimately, it's a win-win situation.

571
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,220
Knowledge, synergy, and win-win...

572
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,410
Fantastic!

573
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,870
Kaoru, don't be fooled by those English terms!

574
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,090
On top of that, these are delicious. Masami, try some too.

575
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,570
- I don't--
- Here, say "Ahh."

576
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,820
Well, it's delicious.

577
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,580
But will Chihiro really be okay without me?

578
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,450
That child tends to push himself too hard all the time. Without me there to watch over him--

579
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,220
- Don't worry, Mother.
- What?

580
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,540
- No, I mean, Masami.
- Yes?

581
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:07,640
I care for your brother as much as both of you do.

582
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:13,030
No matter what happens, I will protect him.

583
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,700
Hayami...

584
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,380
Alright, then. However...

585
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,470
Let me set this straight.

586
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,330
If you hurt my precious brother,

587
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,950
I will never forgive you.

588
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,220
Masami, what you saying?

589
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,310
You don't have to worry about that either.

590
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,770
Please, look at this.

591
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,790
[WRITTEN OATH]

592
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,150
- What's this?
- A written oath?

593
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,200
That's right.

594
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,260
During our cohabitation,

595
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,910
I solemnly swear to not lay a finger on your precious brother.

596
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,920
[I WILL NOT LAY A FINGER ON HIM.]

597
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,360
I see.

598
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,930
That's how far you're willing to go.

599
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,500
Hayami.

600
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,230
I leave Chihiro in your hands.

601
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,340
Thank you for trusting me.

602
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Chihiro, isn't that great?

603
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,610
No...

604
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,880
It's not.

605
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,440
It's great,

606
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,150
but it's not.

607
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,300
I see how it is...

608
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,420
I'm glad we managed to pull it off.

609
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,150
Well...

610
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,480
I guess.

611
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,720
They even gave us sweets and stuff to bring back.

612
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,870
Your brothers may have strong personalities, but they're nice people.

613
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:59,010
Their strong personalities are the problem.

614
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,420
I'm being serious,

615
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,080
but the person who gets with you will be really blessed.

616
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,130
Why are you saying that?

617
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,980
I'm talking about...the person you like.

618
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,320
I'll give you my fullest support.

619
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,280
Which reminds me, I wanted to set some ground rules.

620
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:28,620
Previously, you mentioned that living as a "wife" is important to you.

621
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,460
But let's say,

622
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,320
one day, your feelings become mutual.

623
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,600
What shall we do with this cohabitation arrangement?

624
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,990
Mutual feelings, huh?

625
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:47,740
Making an agreement like this is important when sharing an apartment, you know?

626
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,970
Don't worry about it.

627
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,650
Right now, there's no chance of it happening at all.

628
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,100
What? No way, you give up too easily.

629
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,100
I'm sure the other party will fall in love with you if they knew of your strengths.

630
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,650
That's what you think.

631
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,270
I guess...

632
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,750
If a miracle happens

633
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,920
and our feelings become mutual,

634
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,900
I won't be able to continue being a "wife", as you'd expect.

635
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,480
Ah, you're right. Of course.

636
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,710
You'd want to be together with the person you truly like.

637
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,950
Wait.

638
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,290
What was that reaction?

639
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,680
Huh?

640
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,620
Could it be that

641
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,890
you'll feel lonely?

642
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,620
N-No, no! That's not...

643
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,720
the case, is it?

644
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,520
Sorry, I'm confused about my own feelings.

645
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,110
Hayami.

646
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,700
Can we hold hands?

647
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,750
Where did this come from?

648
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,490
You won't lose sight of-- I mean, I know my way back.

649
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:27,890
Besides, I promised your brother I wouldn't lay a finger on y--

650
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:36,790
That means you can't lay a finger on me, but it's fine if I'm the one initiating it.

651
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,960
Um...

652
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,410
I've decided

653
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,470
to stop backing off after all.

654
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,080
Um, Yamamoto?

655
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,920
Maybe we should try out to see how compatible we are.

656
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,490
Do you want to try it out?

657
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:19,730
Even if it's just a trial, I'm going all out.

658
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,830
Don't try to escape.
