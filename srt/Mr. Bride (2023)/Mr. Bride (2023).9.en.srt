Yes, Masami, you buzzed in first!

For some reason, a man other than Chihiro visited Hayami's family home as her boyfriend!

What common issue amongst couples came up as a result of that?

Yes, Kaoru?

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,590
The "who likes the other person more" problem, right?

I felt that it'd be embarrassing doing it at home.

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,020
Maybe it's because we were already living together before we started dating.

178
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,410
Well, that might be it, but--

179
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,700
Oh, I'm glad you've acknowledged it.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,900
I want Yamamoto to focus on his own goals.

181
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,530
Or rather, I'm thinking that I need to step up to help Yamamoto more

182
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,450
as his girlfriend, you know?

183
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,390
Then isn't there only one thing you can do for him?

184
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,170
Good morning, Yamamoto.

185
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,800
Good morning.

186
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,980
What are you doing?

187
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,860
You've got your regular sales work and you do all the housework, right?

188
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,070
So you don't have any time to think about the contest, do you?

189
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,420
That's why I figured I'd do the housework.

190
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,230
- Um, but--
- It's okay.

191
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,190
I can cook simple meals if you're not picky about flavors

192
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,520
so you can rest your mind at ease and focus on the contest.

193
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,050
Okay.

194
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,370
Okay, but!

195
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,970
They're really burnt! The eggs!

196
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,410
I got it.

197
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,750
He ended up re-cooking everything for me...

198
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,910
What, really? I can have this?

199
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,040
Of course! This is for everyone to share.

200
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,330
Wow, this guaranteed to be tasty.

201
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,520
You should have some too, Hayami.

202
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,300
I'm Saori Miyashita, a food researcher.

203
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,170
Miyashita's popular for the recipe videos she uploads online.

204
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,630
Her ideas are so original.

205
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,870
I'm going to use potato chips as the crumb

206
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,480
to make non-fried double potato croquettes.

207
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,650
The idea to coat potatoes with more potatoes is incredible, right?

208
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,790
Indeed. It looks so delicious.

209
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,110
And for our upcoming microwave sales promotion

210
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,630
the plan is to use sweets created by Miyashita.

211
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,690
- I see.
- Something smells really tasty.

212
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,810
Hey, Yamamoto! Come and have some too.

213
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,840
Ooh, really?

214
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,480
Go ahead.

215
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,200
Chihiro?

216
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,320
Saori?

217
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,600
Long time no see.

218
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,400
How is it?

219
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,180
No, that's not it...

220
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,990
Say, Yamamoto?

221
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,490
I didn't get a chance to ask you today, so...

222
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,440
How exactly do you know Miyashita?

223
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,550
I guess she was an acquaintance-ish person when I was in college?

224
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,650
An acquaintance?

225
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,510
You could say we were in the same class...

226
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,290
So classmates.

227
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,180
Sorry, she's my ex-girlfriend.

228
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,280
I thought so. It could kinda sense it.

229
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,000
But it's not what you think. We were only together for a bit.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,460
She said she didn't need two moms, so she dumped me.

231
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,840
He got dumped by this ex-girlfriend because she said she didn't need two "mothers"!

232
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,910
- Um...
- Yeah...

233
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,770
I had no idea she'd become famous through her recipe videos.

234
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,740
Oh, and I'll take care of cleaning up.

235
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,060
No, it's okay. I might not be able to cook, so at least let me handle this.

236
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,280
Don't go breaking any plates then!

237
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,920
I'm not that clumsy.

238
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,990
Look, what did I say?

239
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,520
Hold up.

240
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,400
I'll grab some things to clean up with, so don't touch any of that.

241
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,560
It's dangerous.

242
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,450
- Okay.
- Good.

243
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,950
When I got home today

244
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,250
the circuit breaker had been tripped for some reason...

245
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,920
so everything inside of my freezer had been defrosted.

246
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,170
So I'm going to use all of my thawed ingredients

247
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,530
to make a week's worth

248
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,140
- of food prep.
- I bet I'd be useful if I were a girlfriend like her.

249
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,030
I'm going to try my best. Perhaps I'll add some broccoli too.

250
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,480
Miyashita?

251
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,170
Hayami!

252
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,180
I've come up with a number of recipe ideas so I was hoping to perhaps get some feedback from Kasuga.

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,920
Wow, you've already thought of so many in a day?

254
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,750
We live in an era right now where anyone can release their own recipes.

255
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,110
On social media and the like.

256
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:07,300
So food researchers have to compete on their own ground, in a sense.

257
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,050
I say that, but I haven't really organized my ideas properly and I'm not confident at all.

258
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,510
As you can see by how I'm mulling over this.

259
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,580
But having so many suggestions put forward

260
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,300
is extremely helpful from the perspective of a salesperson.

261
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,050
I'm sure Kasuga will be thrilled too.

262
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,000
Um.

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,760
Yes?

264
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,110
My apologies if I'm mistaken, but...

265
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,830
Could it be that you and Chihiro are a couple?

266
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,320
How did you know?

267
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,620
I just happened to catch a glimpse of your lunch spread.

268
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,480
How it looked was really familiar to me.

269
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,920
I see.

270
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,400
But that doesn't mean anything at all.

271
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,530
I was just simply thinking that if my hunch was right that you two are such a good match.

272
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,510
Sorry for suddenly bringing this up.

273
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,960
Not at all.

274
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,320
I don't know if you would call us a 'perfect match' as such...

275
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:24,780
If anything, one of us is the carer and the other is the troublemaker.

276
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,860
The troublemaker?

277
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,200
Oh, forget I said anything. Sorry.

278
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,540
- I'll be going now.
- Oh, okay!

279
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,440
She can cook, she's hard working,

280
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,450
and she's personable.

281
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,480
How did Yamamoto let such a catch get away?

282
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,690
Comparing yourself to his ex is a waste of time, so stop it already.

283
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,500
But you know what?

284
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,980
I've realized that I'm completely useless to Yamamoto as his girlfriend.

285
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,070
Well, if you can't be of use to him as his girlfriend

286
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,370
why don't you think of how you can help him as his husband?

287
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,470
As his husband?

288
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,220
It's no use.

289
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,370
Hot springs? What brought this up out of the blue?

290
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,380
Apparently,

291
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,400
ideas are more likely to come to you when you're relaxed

292
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,320
rather than when you're racking your brains over them.

293
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,160
Oh? Did you hear that from someone?

294
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,530
Yeah, kinda.

295
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,280
And I figured that it's a husband's job to wash away their wife's built-up fatigue.

296
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,760
Understood!

297
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,850
Then I will gratefully accept and go on this trip.

298
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,000
Really?

299
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm so glad!

300
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,970
Now then, time to eat.

301
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,180
But...

302
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,090
this also means that we're not at home.

303
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,800
Uh, nothing.

304
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,290
Then let's go.

305
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,530
Right.

306
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,180
Akamine? What are you doing here

307
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:43,150
Getting the juicy gossip about you and Hayami going on a trip to the hot springs

308
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,040
is easier to me than finding out tomorrow's weather forecast.

309
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,750
What the heck? Talk about terrifying.

310
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,630
Don't tell me you're staying in the same ryokan inn as well?

311
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,290
I'll have you know

312
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,210
that while you're acting like the pervert you are at the hot springs

313
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,580
I'll be coming up with a new product that'll win the contest.

314
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,510
You're submitting an entry to the contest too?

315
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,770
Indeed. Super-lover-boy Hanazuma's all in too.

316
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,470
And Koga's entering too.

317
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,410
What?! Koga too?

318
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:20,440
Well then, I'll be catapulting back to Tokyo to think of an idea

319
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,240
so you can give in to the temptation dangling in front of you

320
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,660
and lose sight of what you really want.

321
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,770
Wait, Akamine.

322
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,320
Oh? What do you have to say to me?

323
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,760
If you can talk the talk

324
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,910
then I've got the guts to stand my ground too.

325
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,690
And what do you mean by that?

326
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,410
I will not

327
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,620
lay a finger on Hayami today.

328
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,130
Remember those words.

329
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,120
If you break that promise then I'll tattoo those words onto your forehead!

330
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,100
Bring it on!

331
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,760
This place is pretty spacious.

332
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,410
Why are the futons already laid out?

333
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,950
Oh, I asked the ryokan staff to set them up.

334
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:17,050
I figured you're probably tired so it'd be good for you to rest whenever you like.

335
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,850
Rest...

336
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,230
And what about this?

337
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,130
Nice, huh? I got a room with a private outdoor bath.

338
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,490
I figured you could relax better this way.

339
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,890
In the room's private outdoor bath.

340
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,520
Relax.

341
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,670
I can't do this.

342
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,010
Everything she says sounds so risqué.

343
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,880
What's wrong?

344
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,200
I'm going to soak in the big public bath!

345
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm the kind of guy who likes to sit and stretch out in a big bath!

346
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,930
I mean, my legs are tired from all the working, so...

347
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,710
Okay, let's hop right into the baths!

348
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,590
Yes, it's complete!

349
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,810
What do you think about this?

350
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,910
A fully automatic all-rounder housework machine!

351
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,480

What in the world is that?

353
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,790
As you can plainly see

354
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,490
it's obviously a fully-automated machine that does all of your housework!

355
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,060
That's clearly not feasible.

[New Product Contest: Electric Cart Business Proposal]
An electric cart?

370
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,590
Kind of like those electric wheelchairs you see older people riding around town on.

371
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,340
The aging population in Japan is only going to increase, so I think there will be more demand for these.

372
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,150
We can think about creating rental spots in the future, so I'm also

373
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,890
going to propose how we can expand the business as well.

374
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,210
Your submission is way more convincing than ours!

375

Acting like a pervert?

379
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:47,560
He hasn't even come up with an idea and yet he's off on a trip to the hot springs with Hayami.

380
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,500
- What?
- But you gave him an ultimatum

381
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,010
so he's not going to do anything sleazy, right?

382
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,310
Right. He said he wouldn't lay a finger on her.

383
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,580
Could it be that

384
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,880
the hot spring trip is me imposing myself on him too?

385
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,650
If you're going on a hot-spring trip, you'll need to prepare properly too.

386
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,480
You're the older one in this relationship, after all.

- Hm?
- Well,

388
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,910
if you're going to the hot springs, then the whole not being able to do it at home thing isn't a problem either, right?

389
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,210
No way!

390
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:35,350
I mean, this trip is s-so that

391
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,880
Yamamoto can c-come up with an idea for the contest!

392
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,640
But you want Yamamoto to focus on his goal, right?

393
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,630
- Yes.
- Then it's the perfect chance.

394
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,230
And Yamamoto might come up with a good idea

395
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,160
if he gets that monkey off his back.

396
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,320

Back-up power?

I mean, a problem when there's a power outage

436
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,280
is that you can't use your fridge, right?

437
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:30,660

No, it's fine. Something up?

I can't get through to Hayami,

469
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,310
but I forgot that there's a discount coupon for the inn.

470
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:51,850
Why are you bringing that up? I don't get it.

471
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,910
Oh, didn't she tell you?

472
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:57,740
I was the one who suggested the place you're staying at today.

473
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,980
- What?
- She called me the other day.

474
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,110
It's no good.

475
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,750
Hello, Miyashita?

476
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,340
Sorry for calling you out of the blue.

477
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,620
Um, there's something I'd like to ask you.

478
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,650
She asked me when I got inspiration for my recipes.

479
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:24,350
So I told her that I'm most inspired when I'm relaxing at those hot springs.

480
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,610
And that's why she suddenly brought it up...

481
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,110
But it's so admirable of her to go to such lengths for her boyfriend.

482
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:38,270
Hayami seemed concerned and said that one of you was the carer and the other the troublemaker.

483
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,690
What?

484
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,900
Yet she doesn't give up and comes up with so many ways to try to help you.

485
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:50,490
I could really tell that she cares for you.

486
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,050
Anyway, I should get going now. I'll send the coupon to you.

487
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,170
Thanks.

488
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,910
No worries.

You haven't done anything wrong.

493
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,820
I was the one who left for some fresh air.

494
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,560
Sorry.

495
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,620
I just kinda felt

496
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,570
pathetic.

497
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,420
I try to help you,

498
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,720
but all I do is end up being a burden to you.

499
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,530
You're not a burden at all.

500
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,140
But

501
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:18,050
you need to focus on working on your proposal

502
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,790
yet...

503
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:24,070
I'm focusing on other silly things.

504
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,780
Silly things?

505
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,680
Um, you know...

506
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,030
We're at a hot spring

507
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,030
and that means we're not at home,

508
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,830
so...

509
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:48,560
Are you talking about the whole feeling embarrassed doing it at home business?

510
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,320
Oh, but!

511
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,220
I know now that you have no intention of doing that

512
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,110
today, so it's okay.

513
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,510
No.

514
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,310
To be honest with you,

515
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:18,880
I made up my mind today to not lay a finger on you.

516
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:27,730
It seems like there are a lot of people vying for that Okinawa trip with you

517
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,610
so I figured that I need to come up with a good proposal,

518
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,850
yet...

519
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,680
you look irresistible in a yukata

520
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,040
and now that I think about it, this is a hot-spring date!

521
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,480
That's why

522
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,100
I...

523
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,940
got all panicked.

524
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,860
So

525
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,650
I'm really sorry

526
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,180
if I ended up

527
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,860
hurting you because of that.

528
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,690
Um,

529
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,780
if you'll allow me to say one thing...

530
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,390
I've been truly happy lately.

531
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,840
Sometimes I panic and spin my wheels,

532
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,770
but just being with you

533
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,990
makes my heart feel full.

534
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,260
But, you know what?

535
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,030
If

536
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,790
you seriously

537
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,460
want to get closer to me

538
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,420
or

539
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,630
feel like you're missing

540
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,240
something today

541
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,610
then I feel the same way.

542
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,040
Yamamoto.

543
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,520
So

544
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,750
if you feel the same way

545
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,940
let's

546
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,780
go back to our room.

547
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,250
Please tell me

548
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,970
if there's anything you

549
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,520
like or dislike.

550
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,670
Tell me everything, please.

551
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,100
I

552
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,680
want to know everything.

553
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,800
Okay.

554
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,000
Also,

555
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,290
I really want to cherish today

556
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,200
but I'm sorry if I can't perform.

557
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,180
Yamamoto.

558
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,650
Maybe...

559
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,050
Yes?

560
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,200
Maybe...

561
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,820
I should be the one saying that.

562
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,960
I mean, I'm the older one here

563
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,300
and I'm the one who should be in the position to care for you.

564
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,310
Care?

565
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,370
No.

566
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,790
That's got nothing to do with age. It's my job.

567
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,570
No, but I...

568
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,730
was and still am your husband before I became your girlfriend.

569
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,730
Well, if you're going to bring that up,

570
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,330
then I'm both your wife and boyfriend.

571
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,440
Honestly, what are we rambling about?!

572
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,280
You're right.

573
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,590
Listen, Yamamoto.

574
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,950
Yes?

575
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,620
Let's do this, together.

576
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,190
Dreams...

577
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,680
Husband, girlfriend, boyfriend,

578
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,320
older or younger...

579
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,520
I don't think any of that matters right now.

580
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,530
I also want to know

581
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,650
what you like

582
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,350
and what you dislike.

583
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,600
So...

584
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,990
Let's do this,

585
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,350
together.

586
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,440
Okay.

587
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,470
[I will not lay a finger on Hayami today!]

588
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,200
When did you get this temporary tattoo made?

589
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,210
It's done!

590
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,350

[All Housework Tasks Sharing App]

592
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,270
I have to text Hayami right away!

593
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,800
You should save it for later. Look at how late it is.

594
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,190
12:07 a.m.?! That means...

595
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:22,930
"Today" is over...

596
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:27,040
Come on, that's splitting hairs!

597
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,540
In any case, you can't bother them.

598
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,490
You don't want to end their relationship, Koga?!

599
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,470
Well, I suppose I might be the one

600
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:41,450
who ends up stopping them.

601
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,300
Gosh, I'm starting to get nervous.

602
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,910
You'll be fine.

603
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,970
I think the fridge with back-up power is a great idea.

604
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,900
I actually shelved that idea.

605
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,930
What?

606
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,490
Thanks to you, I've come up with an idea

607
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,050
that's more like us.

608
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,660
Really?

609
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:12,060
Here. Take a look at this, if you like.

610
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,610
Okay.

611
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,750
Okay, I'm off.

Handheld All-in-One Vacuum Cleaner.
[Proposal for a new style of cleaning]

613
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,800
What I am proposing is a stick-type

614
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,980
and handheld vacuum cleaner set.

615
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,920
Existing products are made

616
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,650
with the assumption that only one person will use them.

617
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,310
As such,

618
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,620
cleaning ends up being the job of one person.

619
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,640
However, with this product

620
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,820
two people can use the regular vacuum and the handheld vacuum cleaner at the same time.

621
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,400
Cleaning should not be done on your own.

622
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,060
I believe it can become a household chore

623
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,810
that can be done with someone else.

624
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,960
What? No winning proposals?!

625
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,310
So no winning trip to Okinawa?

626
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,890
Well, that's how it seems.

627
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,200
No way...

628
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,050
Now, now, don't be like that. I have to apologize to you too, Yamamoto.

629
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,780
No, that's okay.

630
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,100
This whole contest has given me a little boost in confidence.

631
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,380
I will view this as a starting point and do my best.

632
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,650

635
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,780
Yes, just the one.

636
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:51,240
It's a shame about the contest.

637
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,120
Well, I had a feeling it would end up like this.

638
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,160
Despite what they say, big corporations have lots of hurdles and hoops.

639
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,270
They really do.

640
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,100
I hope the company becomes more open.

641
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,380
Or perhaps we need to get outside

642
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,780
if we want openness.

643
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,170
What?

644
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,700
Hayami.

645
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,370
Oh, it's Yamamoto.

00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,550
Hey, what's up?

647
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,430
Hayami, can I buy some expensive meat tonight

648
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,220
to celebrate the end to the contest?

649
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,000
Of course. I'll try to get home as early as possible.

650
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,800
Bye.

651
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,680
Anyway, I should get going.

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,470
Hello?

653
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,970
Yes, it's okay.

00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:20,570
it's better for us to keep a distance now.

Does that mean you want a breakup?
