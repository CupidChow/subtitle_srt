My senior in the sales department, Honoka Hayami.

00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,900
She's the top performing sales person and known to all as the ideal wife.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,700
But indeed, the person who marries someone like Hayami is truly a lucky guy!

00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,440
she was actually a super slovenly person who couldn't even be bothered to take the trash out.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,070
I need to take out the trash today.

27

From a casual remark, Yamamoto became Hayami's wife.

Mass-produced? That's impressive!

91
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,660
It was the first time he put together a proposal and had it go through.

92
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,930
He's been studying really hard and wanted lots of advice from me.

It sounds like he's working hard.

He works from morning to night and then comes over to my place after work to study.

so he's been staying over at my place lately.

But, but! Listen, Koga!

107
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,970
That means Yamamoto is focused on work and doesn't prioritize his personal life, right?

108
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,320
I guess so.

Eight months? That long?

112

So you're saying he's leaving Hayami high and dry!

It seems like she works on weekends too.

117
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,770
He said that Hayami's busy as well, so they don't have to go out of their way to see each other.

No! Long-distance relationships are all about effort and timing!

119
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,410
Yamamoto's at fault for being busy when Hayami's busy too. Terrible timing.

They decided on that together.

That's obviously Hayami gritting her teeth through her loneliness!

122

I really can't leave Hayami in Yamamoto's hands.

Honoka has already found happiness with Yamamoto.

128
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,900
How could you remove him? That's the same as taking her happiness away from her!

Huh? What do I do? How should I welcome him back?

It's been so long that I don't know what to do.

180

Listen, Hanazuma.

223
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,820
There are three "senses" important to surprises.

224
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,300
The first one is: a sense of specialness.
[Sense of Specialness]

225
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
It's extremely important to invite them to something that's

226
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,130
a leap out of the daily grind and into the out-of-the-ordinary.

227
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,120
Please wait a second. I'll write this down.

Pretend it's a regular meal out and actually invite them

229
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,250
to a dinner at a special hotel. That's a classic.

230
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,880
Decorate the room with roses for a special feel

231
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,480
and gift them expensive accessories.

232
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,990
They're not bad ideas either.

233
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,380

A sense of ease.
[Sense of Ease]

236
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,470
A sense of ease?

237
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,070
I'm not talking about the target; I'm referring to yourself.

238
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,910
When you try to organize a surprise, there's a tendency

239
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,270
to worry about what might happen if you mess up.

240
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,280
I do!

241
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,540
If your mind is full of negative thoughts like that

242
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,420
then you get more panicked, more awkward, and eventually fail.

243
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,880
That's why it's very important to give yourself peace of mind and a sense of ease.

244
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,120
You could prepare a lot until your concerns are gone,

245
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,970
or get some buddies involved to reduce your number of tasks.

246
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,070
So taking care of my mental health is also one of the keys to success!

247
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,220
And finally...

248
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,090

A sense of unity!

250
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,300
When you plan a surprise

251
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,590
there's an urge to want to show off by saying,

252
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,510
"I thought of this," or

253
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,930
"I picked that!"

254
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,710
Definitely!

255
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,850
But that's a no-no! You get others involved and say

256
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,090
"This was made by such-and-such," and

257
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,680
"That was picked by so-and-so."

258
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,230
Put them in the spotlight.

00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,200
- By doing so...
- By doing so...

260
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,530

261
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,290
"Everyone's worked so hard for me!"

262
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,720

I apologized to her, but she won't forgive me.

297
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,200
And I have no idea why she's angry!

298
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,350
Wouldn't apologizing without knowing why she's angry have the opposite effect?

299
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,840
But men should be the ones who fold here, right?

300
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,350
What? I'd totally hate some guy thinking he's the bigger person for folding without knowing why I'm angry.

301
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,710
Huh? That's the wrong move?

That's just for some stress relief! A change of pace!

308
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,510
Anyway, I figured I hadn't spoken properly to my wife recently

309
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,860

349
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,360
Every month on payday.

350
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,790
See?

351
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,030
She's turned it in a pressed flower here and framed it.

352
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,480
Oh, that's lovely.

353
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,680
Your wife must look forward to it.

354
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,580
I'm sure there are people who don't want flowers.

355
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,860
But it always brings a smile to my wife's face.

356
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,750
And it creates good memories, so I cherish this custom.

357
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,910
Memories...

358
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,070
I think I've thought of a great idea!

359
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,250
A surprise party?

360
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,690
Sounds great.
[Two days until the party]

361

Please come too, Koga!

362
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,660
I'm invited too?

363
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,740
Then I'm looking forward to it.

364
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,910
I'll do my best to prepare for it!

365
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,940
By the way...

366
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,530
Does Yamamoto like things like this?

367
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,630
I don't know,

368
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,360
but I'm sure he'll be thrilled since you're putting in so much effort.

369
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,540
[The day before the party]

370
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,720
Are you still working on that?

371
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,480
Hello.

372
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,000
Honoka asked me to give her the receipts,

373
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,330
so I'm just totaling the amount.

374
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,240
What's that?

375
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,400
Oh, this?

376
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,330
I bought it during my lunch break since the party's tomorrow, right?

King of Destruction?
[Alcohol content: 45%]

378
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,850
Akamine,

379
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,190
don't tell me you're going to make Yamamoto drink this?

380
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,720
It's an old, famous brand of shochu!

381
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,910
And it's got a great name.

382
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,020
- What?
- Nope. I'm confiscating this.

383
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,230
Give that back to me!

384
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,330
Stop trying to think about destruction and cooperate more!

385
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,360
No!

386
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,560
I won't accept that! It's the first time Yamamoto will be back in a long time!

387
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,900
- No!
- No to your 'no'!

388
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,560
NO!

389
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,880
You

390
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,160
have got some nerve doing this.

391
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,780
What?

392
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,420
Going to such lengths for the partner of someone you like.

393
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,820
How admirable!

394
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,160
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

395
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,610
Unfortunately, I can see right through you.

396
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,350
You still like Hayami.

397
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,780
You haven't graduated at all!

398
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,610
Just be honest to yourself already.

399
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,650
Trying your heart out for the partner of the person you like

400
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,860
won't bear any fruit for you! It's pointless.

401
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,810
You have two options left.

402
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,950
Be a man and give up on Hayami,

403
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,510
or steal Hayami from Yamamoto!

404
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,970
- What?
- Well, I suppose you should give it your all for this party.

405
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,820
Maybe Hayami will think you're a capable junior colleague of hers.

406
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:51,350
All I'm saying is that you just have to move up from 'capable junior colleague' to 'capable man.'

407
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,500
And maybe this is the perfect chance?

408
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,320
Argh, just cut it out!

409
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,740
If you're not going to help,

410
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,800
then I'm banning you from the party!

Honoka is the one most looking forward to Yamamoto's return.

413

I'm going to make this the best party ever

and have Honoka's smile all to myself!

415
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,520
Excuse me? There's no way you'd ever get away with that.

416
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,940

417
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,940
Very well.

421
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,510
You'll regret

422
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,630

Yamamoto and Koga's flight is scheduled to arrive at 5 p.m.

428
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,390
As such, I believe they should be here by 6:30 p.m.

429
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,440
Where's Hayami?

430
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,120
She's tied to work during the daytime today,

431
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,780
so I've got her keys.

432
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:23,550
I have also received her permission to use the kitchen and fridge.

433

memories!

437

- Memories?
- Yes, I believe what's ultimately important

438
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,690
is the time you've spent and the memories you've made to date.

441
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,880
I see. So that's why you wanted me to bring this.

442
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,750
What's that?

443
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,230
It's our family album packed with Chihiro's cuteness.

444
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,440
I thought it'd be nice to use photos to decorate the apartment.

445

I've also printed out other photos.

446

I've never seen this before!

Ooh, this takes me back! It's a photo of when we went camping.

525
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,450
One's probably enough...

[Beef bone]

527
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,860
- What's that for?
- The soup written down here

528
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,710
is a recipe I taught Chihiro.

529
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,060
I figured, while I'm at it, I might as well make

530
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,780
a low-and-slow bouillon rather than a consommé.

531
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,140
And how long will that take?

532
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,570
Four hours.

533
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,180
I see.

534
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,970
So that means we can't use the stove for four hours.

535
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,940
Fried rice, rice porridge, lasagna...

536
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,080
No. I can't make any of them without the stove.

537
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,050
What can I make, what can I make?

539
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,110
Ooh. Frozen vegetables? How responsible of her.

540
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,470
But it clearly looks like it hasn't been used.

541
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,980
Maybe she's copying Chihiro.

542
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,600
You even knew I'd leave my vegetables to rot,

543
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,160

and made sure to freeze them before leaving.

545
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,710

546
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,010
I want to monopolize you.

547
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,010
She's copying him?

549
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,280

Oh? You're pretty good at that.

552
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,940
Hearing that from a pro makes me really happy.

553
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,270
You must have practiced a lot.

554
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,150
Yes.

555
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:00,110
Honoka practiced her heart out too.

556
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,330
Her cake came out beautifully during the practice runs.

557
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:08,240
So the cake recipe was yours until it turned into rusks, then.

558
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,070
Yes, I suppose so.

559
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,700
I guess that recipe is my memory with her.

560
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,000
I think, the always cheerful version of you aside,

561
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,030
showing your frustration

562
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,480
has an edge to it too.

563
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,430
I think I will be able...

564
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:38,050
to make you happier than Yamamoto.

565
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,790

566
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,030
I miss you so much.

567
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,160
You are not okay at all.

568
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,080
Trying your heart out for the partner of the person you like

569

00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,100
Thank you very much.

573
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,700
Hey, are you sure you don't want to put this up? Chihiro was so cute at his coming-of-age ceremony!

574
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,180
Look at him in his suit. It's like his Shichi-Go-San childhood ceremonies!

575

There's no need to thank me.

I never would have been able to manage anything near this on my own.

587
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm sure this will show Yamamoto just how much everyone missed him.

588
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,180
It's been so long since we've seen him that I'm getting a little nervous.

Is something the matter?

591
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,950
Well, having Koga with him is great and all,

592
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:40,320
but he was shipped off to Fukuoka without warning to do work unfamiliar to him

593
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,260
so I'm sure he must've felt really lonely for a long time.

594
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,500
He said he missed everyone too.

595
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,720
So...

596
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Let's give him a really warm welcome home.

597
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,710
Yamamoto is working hard over in Fukuoka too.

598
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,390
It's good that we both have fulfilling work lives.

599
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,110
I'm sure she really is just putting up with the loneliness.

600
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,840

00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,420
Hm?

Honoka, is that what you really want?

603
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:24,420
In actual fact, you wanted to be alone with him, didn't you?

604
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,890
I thought so.

605
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,550
No, that's not it.

606
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,560
I mean, I really appreciate all of these

608
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,570
I can't wait for Yamamoto to see everything.

609
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:51,510
And I'm sure Yamamoto would be happier being welcomed back

610
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,270

611
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,500

- Have him all to yourself.

00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,580
No, why are you apologizing?

704
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,850
It's my fault for not making it back home yesterday.

705
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:37,550
Well, that is kind of part of it, I guess...

706
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,330
- Anyway, can I eat all of this now?
- Sure.

707
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:48,470
Oh, but that fried rice is the only thing I made.

708
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,380
Hey, stop. Eat the delicious dishes

709
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,060
that everyone else made. Why are you eating that one first?

710
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,290
Well, because

711
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:04,060
you made this for me, right?

712
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,760
I guess, but...

713
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,950
Thank you for the food.

714
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,980
Are you crying?

715
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,560
My work in Fukuoka is really fulfilling

716
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:49,290
and so I'm trying my best.

717
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,600
I know.

718
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,940
But

719
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,850
I

720
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,630
really missed you.

721
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,840
Me too.

722
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,970
You did well to send everyone home yesterday.

723
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,170
I mean, my big brothers

724
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,370
probably wouldn't leave unless they got to see me.

725
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,470
And you know Akamine.

726
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,950
She'd do anything to get in our way.

727
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,060
Well, about that...

728
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,170
Actually,

729
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:42,860
my desire to have you all to myself

730
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,830
got exposed.

731
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,960
Hayami.

732
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,830
What is it?

733
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,750
Oh, I forgot to say something very important.

734
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,630
Welcome home.

735
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,920
Good to be back.

736
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,390
And...

737
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,990
What is it?

738
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:31,630
Is it okay if we spend all of today at home?

739
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,550
No?

740
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,080
Of course I'm fine with that!

741
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,990
- Really?
- Really.

742
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,050
Geez.

743
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:54,080
Make sure you prepare yourself later.

744
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,580
Hey, how about you stop eating that?

745
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,250
Eat all of the other tasty things.

746
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,040
No, this one is all mine.

747
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,500
- But the others actually taste good.
- Thank you for this.

748
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,890
Yum!

749
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,890
Why?

750
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,820
Stop that.

751
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,360
[MR. BRIDE]

752
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,890
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

753
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,480
In the first place, why am I not an ideal bride just because I can't do housework well?

754
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,730
Hayami, you're not hopeless at all.

755
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,240
It's great!

756
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,500
If I were to live with someone,

757
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,190
I'd like it to be you.

758
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,830
As an inexperienced "wife,"

759
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,020
As an inexperienced pillar of the house,

760
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,670
- I look forward to working with you.
- I look forward to working with you.

761
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:51,400
Even if you think it's okay, I'm not sure if I'll be able to remain a "wife" till tomorrow morning.

762
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,690
You homewrecker!

763
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:58,230
As his brother, or essentially, as his "mother,"

764
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,040
I disapprove of your cohabitation!

765
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,810
Hayami,

766
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,490
you are out!

767
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:09,160
I'm well-known for being the walking love machine!

768
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,800
Mamma mia!

769
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,220
No matter what happens, I will protect him.

770
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,200
I've decided to stop backing off after all.

771
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,600
- Do you like--
- No...

772
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,180
I'm just a little interested in you.

773
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,980
- I also have to work hard.
- Hmm?

774
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,720
Both of you look so compatible together!

775
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,000
You can't look away.

776
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,700
Vegetables, if left alone far too long turn into liquids.

777
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,300
Your facial expression really changes fast.

778
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,350
You're not allowed to think about Yamamoto

779
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:48,360
because you're my girlfriend right now.

780
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,090
Yamamoto, will you come over and be my "wife"?

781
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,760
I'm not the "wife" who belongs to you alone.

782
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,590
What?

783
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,740
Are you jealous?

784
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,000
You should fall in love, 33-year-old!

785
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,650
You seem extremely unwilling to let go of Yamamoto.

786
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,500
What is it you want from me?

787
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,920
I want to monopolize you.

788
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,900
- Welcome home.
- I'm home.

789
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,330
That way my suave side is saved exclusively for my crush.

790
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,210
I like you, Honoka.

791
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,380
She must've been a goddess in her previous life!

792
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,090
"To Stand Firmly Against."

793
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,930
My idol's happiness is my happiness!

794
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:36,840
The only person who is able to stop her is you.

795
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,990
- Honoka.
- Chihiro.

796
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,270
I love you!

797
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,400
I'm the one who likes you more.

798
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,300
I miss you so much.

799
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,180
You are not okay at all.

800
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,760
Let's do this, together.

801
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,830
From now on, there's only one person I'd want to say,

802
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:16,280
"have a safe trip" or "welcome back" to.

803
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,530
My... "wife"

804
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,760
can only be you.
