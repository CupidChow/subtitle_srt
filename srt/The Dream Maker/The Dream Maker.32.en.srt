What's wrong?

The song you just sang

18
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:45,434
with him is...

19
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:49,354
Inappropriate.

20
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:50,954
How is it inappropriate?

21
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:52,954
That's a duet

22
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:56,115
for married couples.

23
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:02,195
We were just singing,
not as husband and wife.

24
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:05,475
You don't even know him.

25
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:08,555
The two of you just sang in public

26
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:10,675
like a couple.

27
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:13,075
Don't you feel embarrassed?

28
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:14,754
Why should I be embarrassed?

29
00:02:15,395 --> 00:02:17,634
As you said, I don't know him at all.

30
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,675
Besides, strangers on TV
play married couples all the time.

31
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,434
They are actors, but you're not.

32
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:27,395
They're actors,
while I'm just a wonton vendor.

33
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:29,495
So I'm only allowed to sell wontons?

34
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,154
You know that's not what I meant.

35
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:33,194
What did you mean?

36
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:36,474
- Good!
- Good!

00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:37,914
Ms. Sun,

38
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,555
it's my turn! Time to sing with me.

39
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:41,874
Okay! Coming!

40
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,995
Come on, sing with her.

41
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:50,034
This is awkward.

42
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:50,714
Coming!

43
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,675

Pay me!

62
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:41,474
Come out!

63
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:42,115

Come out here!

65
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:45,075
- Come out here!
- Come out!

66
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:46,995
We'll just wait here.

67
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,235
- Out!
- I'm watching you!

68
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:52,474
Right here.

69
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:53,914
Guo Fugui!

70
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:54,855
Mr. Guo.

71
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:55,835
Get out!

72
00:03:55,874 --> 00:03:57,034
- Get off!
- Get off!

73
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:58,474
You'd better calm down.

74
00:03:58,795 --> 00:03:59,474
I'm getting off.

75
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:00,254
Get out!

76
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:02,675
Why is it closed?

77
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,515
Buddies, I've been having a hard time.

78
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:09,214
We've had no orders for so long, right?

79
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:09,955
Moreover,

80
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:13,754
if I continue to run it,
I'll continue to lose money.

81
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,515
One day,

82
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,155
all the money I've earned these years

83
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:18,434
won't cover the losses.

84
00:04:18,715 --> 00:04:21,295
So I have to shut it down in the end.
That makes sense, right?

85
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:24,874
Look, whether you shut it down or not
isn't our business.

86
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:28,155
But before you shut it down,

87
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,754
shouldn't you settle our wages?

88
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:31,555
Am I right?

89
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:32,434
- Yes!
- Yes!

90
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:33,035
Pay us!

91
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:34,155
Ms. Li,

92
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:35,954
look at this contract.

93
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:38,314
They're keeping the prices way too low.

94
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:40,115
We'll hardly make any profit.

95
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:48,795
Is there really no way out, Changyuan?

96
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:52,795
Ms. Li,

97
00:04:53,434 --> 00:04:54,675
you can ask Xiaohai

98
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,235
about how much I drank
just to land these orders.

99
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:00,235
It almost cost my life in Nanzhou.

100
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:01,595
It's useless to say that.

101
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:03,475
We all know it's been hard for you.

102
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:06,834
But some of these orders are canceled,
or prices are pushed down.

103
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,394
Do you think someone is

104
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,355
deliberately trying
to ruin Yuehai's reputation?

105
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,394
You're not the first ones
to bring this to me.

106
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,394
Right now, orders are scarce everywhere.

107
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,475
Warehouses at many companies

108
00:05:18,795 --> 00:05:20,834
are piled high with goods
they just can't sell.

109
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,754
We're trying to solve this.

110
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:25,194
Mr. Zheng went
to ask for supportive policies,

111
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:26,995
trying to gain orders
from the government.

112
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,394
That would be great.

113
00:05:29,715 --> 00:05:30,915
Back in the day,

114
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,795
we had a flood of orders.

115
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:35,475
How come they stop placing orders?

116
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:37,834
Lack of orders.

117
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:39,874
Low prices.

118
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,754
Guo Fugui, stop right there!

119
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:43,754
- Stop!
- Stop!

120
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,936
(Yuehai Town People's Government,
Yuehai Town Committee)

121
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:49,514
What's going on?

122
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:51,595
Someone's dying here!

123
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,995
- What are you all doing?
- Stop!

124
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:56,314
- What?
- What happened?

125
00:05:58,555 --> 00:05:59,074
Stop!

126
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,155
Stop!

127
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:04,754
Kill me

128
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:05,754
if you dare!

129
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:06,274
Stop it!

130
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:07,915
Stop fighting!

131
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:08,874
Fighting is wrong.

132
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:10,035
He owes us money.

133
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:10,795
What's going on?

134
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:11,295
He owes us!

135
00:06:12,074 --> 00:06:12,675
They hit me.

136
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:13,754
They're killing me.

137
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:16,795
Were you mugged?

138
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:19,475
Come on. Be serious!

139
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,475
They put a sack over my head.

140
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,954
I don't even know who hit me.

141
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:24,184
Guo Fugui!

142
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:26,274
It's smart of you to come here.

143
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:27,074
We planned

144
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:27,834
to drag you here.

145
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:28,555
Come on!

146
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,995
If you don't pay us,

147
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:32,074
we'll fight you to the death!

148
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:33,834
- Pay up!
- Pay up!

149
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:36,074
Stop!

150
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,355
What are you all doing?

151
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:38,915
Stop fighting!

152
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:39,634
Ms. Li.

153
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,475
This is the town government!
Don't go too far!

154
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:42,314
Calm down.

155
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:43,355
Ms. Li.

156
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:43,995
Guo Fugui, stop.

157
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:44,595
To be clear,

158
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:46,355
we came here for you.

159
00:06:46,595 --> 00:06:48,115
Guo Fugui refuses to pay us!

160
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:48,774
Exactly!

161
00:06:49,434 --> 00:06:51,355
Guo Fugui, what's going on?

162
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:52,874
Ms. Li.

163
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:55,954
No orders, no work!
How can I pay them then?

164
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:56,934
Listen,

165
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:59,355
- you must pay them on time.
- Yes.

166
00:06:59,355 --> 00:07:01,394
You can't blame them
because you have no orders.

167
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:01,915
Yeah.

168
00:07:01,915 --> 00:07:02,834
It's not their fault.

169
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:05,035
Well...

170
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:07,874
Gao Xuemei!

171
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:11,314
Ms. Li,
you just reminded me of something.

172
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,115
This has nothing to do with my workers.

173
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:15,295
Gao Xuemei should be to blame, right?

174
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:17,634
Back then, she convinced us
to build an industrial park.

175
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:18,795
And I ended up like this.

176
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:22,634
She went on and on
about building modern factories.

177
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,834
She said
the printing industry would boom.

178
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:25,795
As a result?

179
00:07:25,874 --> 00:07:26,754
You deserve a beating.

180
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:27,754
Are you even human?

181
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:28,314
I'm human!

182
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,475
- You were thrilled when making money.
- Totally thrilled.

183
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:32,314
- In a crisis, you blame her?
- Why blame me?

184
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:32,814
Did I?

185
00:07:32,915 --> 00:07:34,235
Did she hold a gun to your head

186
00:07:34,274 --> 00:07:35,475
and force you to sign a deal?

187
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:36,235
Did I force you?

188
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:36,995
You're 50!

189
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:38,115
You're not a kid anymore.

190
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:39,434
Be responsible for your actions!

191
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:40,074
Be responsible!

192
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:41,855
- What?
- Watch your tongue, or I'll hit you!

193
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:42,795
He will hit you!

194
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:43,334
You two...

195
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:45,874
Calm down.

196
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:46,915
Calm down.

197
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:47,715
Solve the problem.

198
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:48,555
Solve it.

199
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:49,754
Ms. Li.

200
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:50,675
Look, they are

201
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:52,634
husband and wife!

202
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:53,795
So he's helping her!

203
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:54,394
Back off!

204
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:55,384
I'm not related to them,

205
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:56,555
- but I'll kick you!
- How dare you!

206
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:57,194
Careful!

207
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:58,235
What!

208
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:00,115
You've sobered me up!

209
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:00,675
Enough.

210
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:01,555
Be serious!

211
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:02,675
- Let's talk.
- Come on.

212
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:03,235
Mr. Guo.

213
00:08:03,995 --> 00:08:07,754
You've signed contracts with them.
You can't violate the contracts.

214
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:09,954
Even if you want to fire them,

215
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:12,475
you have to pay their wages first.

216
00:08:13,314 --> 00:08:15,675
Ms. Li, I'm not unreasonable.

217
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:18,074
What else can I do in a hard time?

218
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:19,514
In that case,

219
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,394
even if Mr. Zheng gets orders
from the government,

220
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:23,954
you can't take them?

221
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:25,434
Orders from the government?

222
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:26,915
Printing orders are short,

223
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,155
so the town government
can't just stand by.

224
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:31,155
Mr. Zheng isn't here today

225
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:33,794
because he's gone to the county
to secure government orders.

226
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,794
All the county authorities are included.

227
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:39,034
Just think how many orders it will be.

228
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:40,235
Really?

229
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:43,315
Ms. Li, my printery is quite productive.

230
00:08:47,355 --> 00:08:47,874
A car!

231
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:49,955
It's Mr. Zheng.

232
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:52,835
It's Mr. Zheng.

233
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,075
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng.

234
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,355
What's going on?

235
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,154
Please help us.

236
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:56,695
What's up?

237
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:59,514
Mr. Zheng,
Mr. Guo didn't pay his employees.

238
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:01,514
Yet he still wants government orders.

239
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:02,914
Mr. Zheng.

240
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:04,874
Guo Fugui, you've got nerve!

241
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:06,754
Don't play innocent with me.

242
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:09,154
You have a fancy car and a good house.

243
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,995
Yet you don't pay your workers?

244
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:13,235
You think you can get orders? You wish!

245
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:13,774
Mr. Zheng,

246
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:15,674
if I can gain government orders,

247
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:18,034
I'll pay them part of their wages first.

248
00:09:18,154 --> 00:09:18,995
That's possible.

249
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:20,754
What do you think?

250
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:21,294
I...

251
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,554
I think
paying only part definitely won't do.

252
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,955
You have to settle their wages

253
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,274
before seeking orders.

254
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:30,215
Ms. Li.

255
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:31,174
Well,

256
00:09:31,355 --> 00:09:33,914
if I pay them all their wages,

257
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:35,955
I'll get the orders,

258
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:36,855
right?

259
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,674
Are you haggling with me?

260
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:42,014
Okay, I'll pay them!

261
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,215
I'll do it.

262
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:44,115
Great!

263
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:44,955
I'll pay you.

264
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:46,874
- Good!
- Good!

265
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:47,634
- Mr. Li.
- Thanks.

266
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:48,134
Thank you.

267
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:49,914
Tan, go back with him later.

268
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:51,715
Get this resolved today.

269
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:52,475
Okay.

270
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:54,794
Alright, problem solved. Go back.

271
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:55,335
- Okay.
- Okay.

272
00:09:55,674 --> 00:09:56,174
Thank you.

273
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:58,235
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

274
00:09:58,355 --> 00:10:00,634
Don't resort to violence
again in any case.

275
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:02,034
We'll definitely help you.

276
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,115
No fighting! We can talk things out.

277
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:11,914
Mr. Zheng,

278
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:15,394
you didn't get the orders, did you?

279
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:17,794
You saw through me.

280
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:19,914
Mr. Xia warned me

281
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:24,475
not to ask the county for help
every time a problem arises.

282
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,115
Let's figure it out ourselves.

283
00:10:29,674 --> 00:10:32,394
Once Guo Fugui has paid all the wages
he owes,

284
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:33,914
I need to talk to him.

285
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:36,274
♪How deep♪

286
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:38,914
- ♪I love you♪
- Mr. Xie.

287
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:42,154
You're still here.

288
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:43,595
What?

289
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:47,674
Living outside the home,
you've become a neat guy.

290
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:48,955
That's true.

291
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,514
I used to wash up at home too

292
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:53,235
before getting into bed.

293
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,315
Are you coming home for dinner tonight?

294
00:10:56,835 --> 00:10:58,115
Xiaoyu misses you.

295
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,274
Is it Xiaoyu who misses me?

296
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:01,914
Xiaoyu misses me?

297
00:11:03,394 --> 00:11:04,855
Sure.

298
00:11:05,115 --> 00:11:06,435
Not just she misses you.

299
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,154
The workers miss you too.

300
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:12,355
Ms. Gao, it's not easy for you

301
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:13,514
to support many people.

302
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:15,075
Times are tough now, after all.

303
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:16,835
But I need to make it clear.

304
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:18,874
Today, I really wasn't

305
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:21,195
standing up for you.

306
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:22,835
It was not for you.

307
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,514
Guo Fugui was just so infuriating.

308
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:26,835
He deserved it.

309
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:29,595
And I don't think
what he said is entirely wrong.

310
00:11:29,595 --> 00:11:32,235
If you hadn't insisted
on expanding production back then,

311
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:33,914
would things have gotten messy?

312
00:11:33,914 --> 00:11:35,274
Wait, Xie Chunlai.

313
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,955
What do you mean by that?

314
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,475
I insisted on expanding production?

315
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:41,315
I did it all for Yuehai's development

316
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:42,855
and our family, you know?

317
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:47,034
Yeah. Sounds really nice.

318
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:50,355
For our family,
investing over ten million yuan?

319
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:52,274
Is that an investment?

320
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:53,355
- What's wrong?
- It's a gamble!

321
00:11:53,394 --> 00:11:54,195
That is insane!

322
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:54,835
A gamble?

323
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:56,435
It's an investment, okay?

324
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:57,674
- You've bet our home.
- Ridiculous.

325
00:11:57,674 --> 00:12:00,115
I'm telling you,
if Mr. Zheng secures government orders,

326
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,554
you might get through it.

327
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:04,595
Otherwise, I'm telling you, Ms. Gao,

328
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:05,794
you'll be in a mess.

329
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:06,315
Come on.

330
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:07,274
That's enough.

331
00:12:07,554 --> 00:12:08,754
Are you coming back or not?

332
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,195
To where?

333
00:12:11,715 --> 00:12:12,874
Home! Where else?

334
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,115
But I am home.

335
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,394
Here is my home.

336
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:18,835
Fine. Excellent.

337
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:19,514
- Sorry.
- Ms. Gao.

338
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:20,134
I'm sorry.

339
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:21,115
Forget what I said.

340
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,674
The workers miss me.

341
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:23,715
No one misses you.

342
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:24,355
You stay here.

343
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:25,154
I'm eating lamb,

344
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,235
bear paw, deer tail,

345
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:27,274
- roasted duck,
- Whatever.

346
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:28,435
- glutinous rice duck,
- Fine.

347
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:30,274
- braised duck,
- You look like a duck!

348
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:31,355
- shredded duck,
- You shredded duck!

349
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:32,195
and sausage.

350
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:37,914
Glutinous rice duck.

351
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:57,715
Mr. Xie.

352
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:59,075
You know what?

353
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,075
When you stood up for Xuemei,

354
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:02,995
Xuemei was so happy.

355
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:05,995
You clearly care about her so much.

356
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:07,914
Why can't you compromise?

357
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:09,595
Can't you make up with her?

358
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:11,595
Do you have to say hurtful things?

359
00:13:13,715 --> 00:13:14,914
Xuemei told me

360
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:17,528
that you came home several times
when I was in hospital.

361
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:19,274
She was actually quite happy,

362
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,754
even though you were putting on airs.

363
00:13:23,274 --> 00:13:24,995
But you stopped coming home again.

364
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,835
If I hadn't become Acting Town Mayor,

365
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,355
maybe nothing would have happened.

366
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:36,995
Put simply, it's just about saving face.

367
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,554
So, after all these years of marriage,

368
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:41,874
are you really going
to be angry for life then?

369
00:13:44,195 --> 00:13:44,794
Answer me.

370
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:47,394
What's more important?
Your face or Xuemei?

371
00:13:51,274 --> 00:13:52,154
Face is important.

372
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:55,595
Xuemei is also important.

373
00:13:56,874 --> 00:13:58,315
Why don't you ask Xuemei

374
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,195
what's more important? Business or me?

375
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:08,394
Mr. Zheng, you can't do this to me!

376
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:09,835
That's not what you said earlier!

377
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:10,394
You...

378
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:11,995
I never said the order was secured.

379
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,595
You can't treat me like this.

380
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,754
I've already paid all their wages!

381
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:18,634
That's what you should do.

382
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,075
That's what you owed them.

383
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,394
But I didn't have to pay them urgently!

384
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:24,475
I know workers have it hard,

385
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:27,674
but I'm not having it easy either!

386
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:30,075
The moment I wake up each day,
I'll think about costs.

387
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:32,034
The printery building costs money.

388
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:33,754
Equipment repairs cost money.

389
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,154
And my loan interest.

390
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,995
It's all about money!

391
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,595
Look at my hair.

392
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:43,995
I'm losing hair under great pressure.

393
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:45,955
I'll be bald soon!

394
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:49,554
If I can't get the orders,
I'm shutting down my business.

395
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:55,874
Don't worry.

396
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:57,634
Even though I didn't get the order,

397
00:14:58,075 --> 00:14:59,235
I will definitely

398
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:01,315
help you solve your problem.

399
00:15:02,554 --> 00:15:03,435
Easier said than done.

400
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:05,955
I don't even know if this can be done.

401
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,634
One month. Okay?

402
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,715
Within one month,
I will definitely get you orders,

403
00:15:14,034 --> 00:15:14,874
believe it or not.

404
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:17,355
I believe it.

405
00:15:17,554 --> 00:15:19,955
I absolutely believe in you, always.

406
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:23,195
But I have one small request.

407
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:24,715
Over the next month,

408
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:27,235
before the orders come in,

409
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:30,715
I want to stay here.

410
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:33,315
Stay where?

411
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,034
Wherever you are, I'll be there.

412
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,315
I've made your bed.

413
00:15:42,794 --> 00:15:43,315
Thanks.

414
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:43,894
Not at all.

415
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:51,914
Has this quilt been aired?

416
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:53,315
Of course.

417
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:55,435
Hygiene has been promoted.

418
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:57,274
Five Do's and Four Upliftings, remember?

419
00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:58,475
Yes.

420
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:02,355
Toothpaste, toothbrush,
and towel, preferably white ones.

421
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,435
Looks clean.

422
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:07,355
Get me a new pair of slippers.

423
00:16:08,274 --> 00:16:09,355
Slippers? You wish!

424
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,394
You really look like a slipper.

425
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:12,995
I just don't get it.

426
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:14,794
Why didn't they just beat you to death?

427
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:17,195
Mr. Zheng, what's wrong?

428
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,874
I still haven't secured any orders.

429
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:22,235
Is asking for new slippers too much?

430
00:16:23,554 --> 00:16:24,955
I just said one month.

431
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,874
It's only been half an hour.
Why are you nagging me already?

432
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:29,955
I fear you'll forget.

433
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,674
Just a friendly reminder.

434
00:16:32,955 --> 00:16:33,715
Get him slippers.

435
00:16:34,475 --> 00:16:36,034
Mr. Zheng!

436
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,955
Meng, what time is breakfast tomorrow?

437
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:39,835
6 AM.

438
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:41,394
Could you save it for me?

439
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,475
I usually get up at 8 AM.

440
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,435
No way!
If you can't get up, you miss it.

(Conference Room)

442
00:16:59,034 --> 00:16:59,794
Here's the thing.

443
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:01,995
I failed to get orders

444
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:04,635
from the authorities.

445
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,034
All of Yuehai is short on orders.

446
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:12,074
Many printery owners
can't even pay wages.

447
00:17:12,794 --> 00:17:14,754
Guo Fugui has already moved in here.

448
00:17:14,995 --> 00:17:16,195
Since he has started it,

449
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:18,195
others might follow suit.

450
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:19,754
We won't be able to handle it.

451
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,675
We need to find a way to make him leave.

452
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,594
I don't think it'll be that simple.

453
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,514
You all saw him, right?

454
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:27,875
How tricky Guo Fugui is!

455
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:29,875
When he paid the workers this afternoon,

456
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:32,034
you know what he looked like?

457
00:17:32,195 --> 00:17:33,944
It's like he was paying
with his own blood.

458
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:34,915
If those 'monkeys'

459
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,915
really can't pay wages again,

460
00:17:37,554 --> 00:17:39,074
they will all move in here.

461
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:41,034
That's why I called you here.

462
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,195
Let's brainstorm solutions together.

463
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:44,475
Well, it...

464
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:46,034
What can we possibly do?

465
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:46,635
I...

466
00:17:46,995 --> 00:17:48,274

Okay, got it.

484
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:33,675
We'll discuss it in a meeting.

485
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:36,155
Great, thanks a lot.

486
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:42,034
What? Is Ms. Chang unwilling to help?

487
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:42,715
No.

488
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:44,074
Ms. Chang said

489
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,915
that to hire a top star,
it'll cost at least this much.

490
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:49,235
10,000 yuan?

491
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:50,915
No way.

492
00:18:51,435 --> 00:18:52,195
100,000?

493
00:18:53,594 --> 00:18:54,915
That's too much

494
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:56,915
even for a Hong Kong star.

495
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:58,475
I paid 15,000 for a "master". Cheaper.

496
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,195
You wish it could be 100,000.

497
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:02,594
One million!

498
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:13,274
O-One million? Are you kidding?

499
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:15,235
Impossible! How could one star
cost a million?

500
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,975
That's just impossible.

501
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,155
Plus, Ms. Chang said

502
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:19,794
this is already the best price.

503
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,114
With one million, I could build a road!

504
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:25,354
Exactly!
Film a road-building commercial.

505
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:27,074
Work on the road and ad simultaneously.

506
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:28,155
If we had a million,

507
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:29,195
why bother filming an ad?

508
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:30,875
I think we should just scrap the ad.

509
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:31,594
Drop it.

510
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:33,875
No way! We must film the ad.

511
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:37,034
We've hired the crew
and paid for the ad slot.

512
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:38,554
No refunds.

513
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,554
Then what do we do?

514
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:49,034
Film it, but with someone else.

515
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:51,735
Chinese Mainland celebrities
are good too.

516
00:19:52,114 --> 00:19:52,834
Sure.

517
00:19:53,195 --> 00:19:55,195
But do you have connections
to reach them?

518
00:19:55,314 --> 00:19:56,034
I don't know any.

519
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,074
Do any of you know one?

520
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:59,274
Who would know a celebrity?

521
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:00,834
I don't know any either.

522
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,834
So what do we do?

523
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:05,794
How about we film one of us?

524
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:26,314

00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:28,635

526
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,114
Help him up.

527
00:20:30,475 --> 00:20:30,975
Okay.

528
00:20:31,594 --> 00:20:32,094
Help him up.

529
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,235
Watch the steps!

530
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:39,475
Mr. Zheng is back.

531
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:41,915
- Exhausted.
- What happened?

532
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:43,754
He can barely walk straight.

533
00:20:44,395 --> 00:20:45,554
I sprained my ankle.

534
00:20:46,635 --> 00:20:48,235
Mr. Zheng, are you hurt?

535
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:49,074
No, I'm fine.

536
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,034
Everything's okay.

537
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:52,514
Just a bit tired. I'll rest and be fine.

538
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:54,554
Go ahead with the meeting.

539
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:55,675
I'll listen.

540
00:20:56,675 --> 00:20:58,074
How did this happen?

541
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:01,715
Mr. Zheng.

542
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:05,274
You all talk. I'm listening.

543
00:21:05,715 --> 00:21:07,395
Go on. I'm fine.

544
00:21:07,754 --> 00:21:08,794
I'm listening.

545
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,155
Go on.

546
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:15,514
Mr. Zheng.

547
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:16,135
Well...

548
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:17,794
Let him rest here for now.

549
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:19,235
He won't leave.

550
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:20,435
He's tired from filming.

551
00:21:28,675 --> 00:21:29,475
Mr. Xie,

552
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,675
how did they film the commercial?

553
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:33,475
How did it tire Mr. Zheng out?

554
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:42,114
I want to know too.

555
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:46,995
It was blocked off tight.
I couldn't see a thing.

556
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,915
They want an air of mystery.

557
00:21:50,314 --> 00:21:52,995
And they put up a "No Visitors" sign.

558
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:54,754
Not even a fly could get in.

559
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:55,875
So mysterious.

560
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:03,034
It's extra tiring
doing something you're not good at.

561
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:04,334
Right.

562
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:07,195
Let's go on.

563
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:08,074
Okay.

564
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,834
Mr. Zhao, I won't walk you out.

565
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:12,354
Alright.

566
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:12,915
Thanks.

567
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:13,635
I hope

568
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:15,074
you'll place orders soon.

569
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,274
Definitely.

570
00:22:16,354 --> 00:22:16,875
Don't worry.

571
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:17,395
Take care.

572
00:22:17,395 --> 00:22:18,074
See you.

573
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:18,995
I have to go.

574
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:19,875
Ms. Yang,

575
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:23,195
it's getting chilly.
You need to wear more.

576
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:25,114
Ms. Li.

577
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:28,235
Do you feel better after your bath?

578
00:22:28,435 --> 00:22:29,754
Much better.

579
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,395
I'm sorry to bother you.

580
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:34,314
You have to pick me up every week.

581
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:36,274
It's no trouble.
It's the least we can do.

582
00:22:36,834 --> 00:22:37,875
Xiaohai isn't here.

583
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,475
From now on,
see this place as your home.

584
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:42,274
Exactly!

585
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,554
Tell us anytime you need anything.

586
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:48,235
Meng, I need to talk to you.

587
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:49,294
Okay.

588
00:22:49,314 --> 00:22:50,514
Ms. Yang, I have to go.

589
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:51,334
Go ahead.

590
00:22:52,314 --> 00:22:53,715
Let me comb your hair.

591
00:22:58,675 --> 00:22:59,915
Your hair is so nice.

592
00:23:00,235 --> 00:23:01,114
Still so thick.

593
00:23:01,274 --> 00:23:02,074
Full and dense.

594
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:04,635
Qiuping.

595
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:06,114
Qiuping.

596
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:07,915
Let me do it.

597
00:23:08,114 --> 00:23:09,034
Okay, Lili.

598
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:09,635
Ms. Yang.

599
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:10,435
Lili.

600
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:12,574
Here are my drawings. Take a look.

601
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:15,754
Ms. Yang,

602
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:18,235
it's been over two months
since your last haircut.

603
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,915
I brought my kit specially
to cut it for you today.

604
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:22,834
Good.

605
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:23,834
Hand it to me.

606
00:23:54,754 --> 00:23:55,354
Qiuping.

607
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:58,794
Picasso is truly amazing.

608
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,794
He gives me so much inspiration.

609
00:24:01,155 --> 00:24:01,834
Yes.

610
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:03,955
Breaking chains is powerful.

611
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,995
Coming from the old society,

612
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:08,715
we had to break those chains.

613
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:10,715
Don't underestimate me.

614
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:12,675
I'm a new-era woman too.

615
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:14,955
You're absolutely right.

616
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:17,354
But we're talking about an artist,

617
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:19,635
not breaking chains.

618
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:21,574
Lili.

619
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,514
I think
you could become a good designer.

620
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,314
Designer?

621
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:28,114
Exactly.

622
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:30,274
I saw the box you designed

623
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:32,514
and those handicrafts you made.

624
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:34,635
From the materials to the colors,

625
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:37,594
they look beautiful and unique.

626
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:40,875
I did them just for fun.
I can't make money from them.

627
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:44,114
Why not? Designers are highly respected.

628
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,915
A single creative idea
can generate enormous value.

629
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:49,754
Once products are created
from creative ideas,

630
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:51,875
the creators can receive royalties
from them.

631
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:55,435
For instance,

632
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:58,435
these hairs represent earnings.

633
00:24:58,915 --> 00:24:59,995
Say there are 100 hairs.

634
00:25:00,155 --> 00:25:02,235
One of them belongs to you.

635
00:25:06,235 --> 00:25:07,034
I understand.

636
00:25:07,955 --> 00:25:10,834
My creativity can turn into money.

637
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:13,875
Moreover,
designers can become business partners,

638
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,034
exerting significant influence
on the company.

639
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:19,155
What you need now is an opportunity
and a platform.

640
00:25:19,594 --> 00:25:20,475
Be careful.

641
00:25:22,995 --> 00:25:23,754
This is exhausting.

642
00:25:23,834 --> 00:25:24,475
Mr. Zheng.

643
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:26,834
Tell Hailuo to boil some water for me.

644
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:28,495
Okay.

645
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:32,354
Mr. Hailuo, please boil water.

646
00:25:34,235 --> 00:25:35,235
What happened?

647
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,514
Mr. Zheng sacrificed himself for art.

648
00:25:40,314 --> 00:25:42,354
He filmed an advertisement for Yuehai.

651
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:24,514
You're here.

652
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:26,475
I'm so tired.

653
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:28,475
Xie, could you massage my back?

654
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:31,995
Were you sleeping?

655
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,354
Too exhausted.

656
00:26:44,074 --> 00:26:44,794
You look so tired.

657
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:49,034
Mr. Zheng, this might not be your forte.

658
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:51,074
Just focus on being the Secretary.

659
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:55,354
If you're too tired,
I'll do it tomorrow.

660
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:57,195
I could do it.

661
00:26:57,514 --> 00:26:59,314
Sounds good. You do it.

662
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:00,034
Alright.

663
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,135
What exactly were you filming?

664
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:06,314
The most dangerous trials.

665
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:08,794
Feels good.

666
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:09,794
Will Yuehai

667
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:11,955
look dangerous in the ad?

668
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:15,155
Yes. Do this side too.

669
00:27:19,794 --> 00:27:20,354
Good.

670
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:21,354
Feeling better now?

671
00:27:21,395 --> 00:27:21,895
Yeah.

672
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:22,814
Comfortable.

673
00:27:24,114 --> 00:27:25,995
Go back and sleep.

674
00:27:27,435 --> 00:27:30,594
I'll scrub your back with soap in a bit.

675
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:32,274
You'll sleep well.

676
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,995
What TV drama are we watching today?

677
00:27:39,195 --> 00:27:39,715
Ms. Yang.

678
00:27:40,655 --> 00:27:42,235
You'll know soon, Ms. Yang.

679
00:27:42,915 --> 00:27:45,354
I invited people of different ages

680
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:47,274
to preview the commercial

681
00:27:47,314 --> 00:27:48,794
Mr. Zheng made.

682
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:51,955
Speak freely and share your feedback.

683
00:27:58,995 --> 00:28:00,395
I worked as an actor once.

684
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:02,915
It's quite satisfying actually.

685
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,514
Being an actor is truly exhausting.

686
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:06,314
It's not easy.

687
00:28:06,715 --> 00:28:08,635
But I think the team worked even harder

688
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:09,675
than I did.

689
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:12,114
Let's give a round of applause
for the team.

690
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:12,735
Come on.

691
00:28:15,915 --> 00:28:17,435
Mr. Zheng, I trust you.

692
00:28:17,594 --> 00:28:19,114
Your ad will definitely impress us.

693
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:20,794
Not that good.

694
00:28:21,195 --> 00:28:21,695
Alright.

695
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:22,935
- I'm playing it.
- Go ahead.

696
00:28:23,155 --> 00:28:24,034
It's finally done.

and hasn't come back.

746
00:31:14,794 --> 00:31:16,554
I'll have Zhang take you home.

747
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:17,554
Zhang!

748
00:31:18,074 --> 00:31:18,675

- Yes?

749

750

Mr. Zheng,
everyone has to have a first time.

751
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:32,834
Thanks for your hard work.

752
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:35,034

753
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:43,395

754

761

766
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:50,995

767

770

Ms. Li, don't you think so?

771

he always shouted...

772
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:05,395

778

00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:19,534
Bye.

933
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:37,955
Well...

934
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:40,955
You just closed up your stall?

935
00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:43,795
Perfect timing.

936
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:48,995
Let's sing a song together.

937
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,514
Singing now?

938
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:53,915
Won't we disturb others?

939
00:40:54,194 --> 00:40:56,395
It's fine. They're at work now.

940
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:57,755
Let's try.

941
00:40:58,634 --> 00:40:59,634
I...

942
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:12,315
I'm not good at it.

943
00:41:13,034 --> 00:41:13,634
I'll start.

944
00:41:17,915 --> 00:41:18,714
I'll sing first.

on Sunday,
I went to the mall and then...

960
00:42:21,634 --> 00:42:22,315
A dress?
