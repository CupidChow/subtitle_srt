(Chunmei Printery)

18
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:48,755
Well,

19
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:50,555
we're at 100 now.

20
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,915
It's okay. We're old acquaintances.
50 is fine.

21
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:55,854
Hai,

22
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:59,835
we help Ms. Gao move the goods.

23
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:02,555
Just forget about the deputy mayor.

24
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:05,495
Okay.

25
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:08,034
50 will do, Xiaoyu.

26
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:08,934
I'm leaving.

27
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:11,594
Hai, why only 50?

28
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,914
Can't we charge Ms. Gao's family
the normal rate?

29
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:15,115
Yeah, Hai.

30
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:16,874
Didn't we agree on the rules earlier?

31
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:19,314
How can we keep working if you do this,

32
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:19,814
right?

33
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:20,795
- Yeah! Right?
- Exactly!

34
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:21,395
Enough! Stop!

35
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:23,934
See?

36
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:27,194
You idiots have zero
situational awareness.

37
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:28,194
Xiaoyu.

38
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:30,355
Can you add a bit?

39
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:33,874
We did set rules earlier.

40
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:38,874
Wait. Yang Xiaohai, what do you mean?

41
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:40,355
You saw it yourself.

42
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:41,754
We set the rules.

43
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,194
The current price,

44
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:44,515
doesn't work.

45
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:47,555
Yang Xiaohai, how could you do this?

46
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:49,194
I kindly found you work,

47
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:51,474
and you repay me
by demanding a higher price.

48
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:53,555
I don't care about your rules.

49
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,914
Take 50 or leave it. That's all I have.

50
00:02:59,434 --> 00:02:59,934
Okay.

51
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,235
Then I'll go to Ms. Gao and the others.

52
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:03,455
Hai.

53
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:06,134
What?

54
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:07,075
Yang Xiaohai!

55
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:08,355
What are you doing?

56
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:09,835
Who allow you to go in?

57
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:15,154
Yang Xiaohai, what do you want?

58
00:03:18,795 --> 00:03:20,034
Who let you in?

59
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,955
Mom, they're charging too much.

60
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,075
50 yuan isn't even enough!

61
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:24,675
Stop making such a racket.

62
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:26,474
Can't handle this small matter?

63
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:30,194
Come check these accounts.

64
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:39,434
Start from here.

65
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:42,194
Yes, up here.

66
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:43,015
Okay.

67
00:03:46,194 --> 00:03:48,714
Yang Xiaohai! Long time no see.

68
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:52,634
Seems you've landed big business lately.

69
00:03:58,314 --> 00:03:58,835
Ms. Gao,

70
00:03:59,914 --> 00:04:01,434
we helped move all your stuff.

71
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,395
Charging market rates is fair,

72
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:05,914
right?

73
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:06,955
No problem.

74
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:08,795
I understand market rules.

75
00:04:09,355 --> 00:04:12,355
But aren't you overcharging?

76
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:22,555
Ms. Gao,

77
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:24,915
during the typhoon,

78
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:27,834
our whole crew rushed
to the dock to help you.

79
00:04:28,514 --> 00:04:30,035
True, we moved the machinery

80
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:31,954
after the typhoon hit.

81
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:34,874
And today, we worked hard too,

82
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:37,434
unloading this entire truck.

83
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:38,874
Charging this much

84
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:41,035
is reasonable, right?

85
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,415
It is indeed.

86
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:46,915
You did help me greatly
at the dock that day.

87
00:04:47,434 --> 00:04:48,754
I remember you well.

88
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,595
A loyal and righteous young man.

89
00:04:51,235 --> 00:04:53,274
But why act like this today?

90
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:54,694
Come on.

91
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,834
Xuemei, please review these accounts.

92
00:04:57,995 --> 00:04:59,995
Okay. I'll review them properly.

93
00:05:03,995 --> 00:05:05,855
So you're talking about favors today?

94
00:05:05,915 --> 00:05:06,754
Forget business.

95
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,434
No matter how much you moved,

96
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,795
I'll pay you.

97
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:10,995
Name your price.

98
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:18,834
Name it.

99
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:25,115
Too shy to say it?

100
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:26,456
How about this?

101
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:28,514
Take as much as you want from there.

102
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:29,995
Keep whatever you take.

103
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:32,355
Consider it the Money God's gift.

104
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,314
No need to feel awkward.

105
00:05:57,954 --> 00:05:58,555
No.

106
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:00,434
But I'm telling you, Yang Xiaohai.

107
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,634
However much you take,

108
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:04,795
it's not earned by labor.

109
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,834
It's traded on personal favors.

110
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:09,834
Understand?

111
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:21,675
I'll leave now.

112
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:36,115
I need to see Mr. Zheng tomorrow
to resolve this.

113
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:42,434
These kids are getting out of hand!

114
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:46,355
Has everyone besides Xuemei
faced this issue?

115
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:47,514
- Yeah, Mr. Zheng.
- Yes.

116
00:06:47,514 --> 00:06:48,475
Here are the receipts.

117
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:49,774
Tan.

118
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:51,215
Tan.

119
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:52,995
(Secretary's Office)
What did you city inspectors do?

120
00:06:53,235 --> 00:06:53,735
No.

121
00:06:53,855 --> 00:06:54,355
Mr. Zheng.

122
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:55,074
What did you do?

123
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,754
This isn't Mr. Tan's fault.

124
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:57,995
After the typhoon,

125
00:06:57,995 --> 00:06:58,995
manpower was needed.

126
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:00,475
Besides Binhai Road, Mr. Tan

127
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:01,595
had a lot on his plate.

128
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:03,834
Yang Xiaohai and his group went too far.

129
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:05,634
Of course, I'm at fault too.

130
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:07,995
I knew about their high-priced moving.

131
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,475
They helped me during the typhoon,

132
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,475
so I thought I'd just let it be high.

133
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,355
I didn't think much.

134
00:07:13,754 --> 00:07:14,394
I never expected

135
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,035
it would fuel their greed. You know.

136
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:17,535
Okay.

137
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:19,394
You cared about Yang Xiaohai.

138
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:20,715
What about others?

139
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:22,680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

140
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:27,160
Tan, I'm asking you.

141
00:07:27,874 --> 00:07:29,995
Mr. Zheng, well...

142
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:31,595
Actually, I investigated this.

143
00:07:31,595 --> 00:07:34,194
It's not just
Yang Xiaohai's problem alone.

144
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:35,314
Then whose problem is it?

145
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:39,394
There's someone else leading them.

146
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:40,274
Who?

147
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:44,715
Mr. Zheng, look, I think
you should calm down first, okay?

148
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:45,434
Calm down.

149
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:46,274
Listen. Maybe

150
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:47,595
you should talk to Desheng?

151
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:48,954
How is he involved?

152
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:52,874
What do you mean?

153
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:56,555
Are you saying

154
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:59,754
it's my nephew, Zheng Zhiqiang, right?

155
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:07,715
City inspectors!

156
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:09,634
Grab your gear if you're done.

157
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:11,314
If not, eat faster. We need to patrol.

158
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:12,434
Come on.

159
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:13,514
Hurry up! Assemble!

160
00:08:13,555 --> 00:08:14,434
Assemble!

161
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,115
Mr. Tan, they haven't
finished eating yet.

162
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:22,434
Why patrol now?

163
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:23,795
Forced moving.

164
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,834
These guys run away when you show up.

165
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:27,754
And they're back
once you leave. Annoying.

166
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:29,874
Finished eating? Hurry up.

167
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:31,954
Assemble under the bike shed.

168
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:32,855
You eat.

169
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:33,514
- Okay.
- You eat.

170
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:41,554
(Grand Piano)

171
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:46,914
Drive slower.

172
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:49,075
Don't you know this piano is expensive?

173
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:51,634
Okay, boss.

174
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:58,195
Do you think we'll run
into those people today?

175
00:08:58,475 --> 00:08:59,355
Who?

176
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:01,235
Xiaohai and his crew.

177
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:03,835
No.

178
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:06,315
We're not that unlucky.

179
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:09,034
How would they know
where I'm coming back from?

180
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,874
They say they're everywhere now.

181
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:12,914
Elusive.

182
00:09:13,394 --> 00:09:14,355
All over the place.

183
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:17,195
It's fine.

184
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,034
Wake up!

185
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,328
Oh, my!

186
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,504
What are you doing
blocking the road here?

187
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:51,794
Mr. Dog, the road ahead is too bumpy.

188
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:54,835
The piano is so valuable.
What if it gets damaged?

189
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,794
We'll help you carry it in.

190
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:58,595
Let us see it too.

191
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:00,034
Just tell me how much you want.

192
00:10:00,235 --> 00:10:00,735
Mr. Dog,

193
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,634
the fish that day was pretty pricey.

194
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:03,955
Qiang,

195
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:06,874
how much did that meal cost us again?

196
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:09,315
Seems like over 1,000.

197
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:11,394
You see, a piano is so heavy.

198
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:13,435
It can't be cheaper
than that meal, right?

199
00:10:13,435 --> 00:10:15,315
Why don't you just rob me?

200
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,754
You can't say that, Mr. Dog.

201
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:18,154
This isn't robbery.

202
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:19,794
We're helping you move your stuff.

203
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,754
And we're just trying to make a living.

204
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:23,174
Well...

205
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:25,174
Hai, lunchtime?

206
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:27,754
Lunchtime!

207
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:29,355
- Lunchtime!
- Lunchtime!

208
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:29,955
Let's go!

209
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:32,115
Bao, treat Mr. Dog to something nice.

210
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:32,955
Got it.

211
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:33,914
Gently!

212
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:36,235
Get down!

213
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:37,355
You! Get down!

214
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:38,835
My treat!

215
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:40,274
What treat?

216
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,595
Yes! Untie the ropes!

217
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,754
Open the gate.

218
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:47,215
Unload.

219
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:47,995
Unload the piano.

220
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:49,774
Stop.

221
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:50,414
Move it.

222
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,075
Why hold me back?

223
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:55,034
I don't want to eat.
I don't want noodles.

224
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:56,874
I'm not hungry. Why would I eat noodles?

225
00:10:58,315 --> 00:10:58,955
Slow down.

226
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:01,235
People below, move!

227
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:02,794
One, two...

228
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,455
What now?

229
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,274
Dog, the restaurant doesn't...

230
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:12,514
Isn't the piano made of steel?

231
00:11:13,835 --> 00:11:14,715
Forget it. Move it.

232
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:15,235
Hurry! Go!

233
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:15,914
As Qiang says,

234
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:16,715
let's move it.

235
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:19,115
Let go of me!

236
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:26,435
I'll run you over!

237
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:28,554
What are you spouting?
Running people over?

238
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:31,355
Close it properly. Quick!

239
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:37,154
Get out of the way!

240
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:40,514
Dog, have you lost your mind?

241
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:47,615
Move!

242
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:04,955
Murder!

243
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:05,695
Murder!

244
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:07,315
How could you hit us?

245
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:08,134
Go!

246
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:08,975
Get them!

247
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:18,394
Once it's dirty, it's hard to fix!

248
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:39,090
(Haoyue Bridge)

249
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:55,235
Mr. Zheng, where are you rushing off to?

250
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:57,394
Zhiqiang is using my name
to force relocations.

251
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:58,355
I'll deal with him.

252
00:12:58,554 --> 00:12:59,235
Zhiqiang?

253
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:00,995
Did you check it out?

254
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:02,914
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li, it's bad!

255
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:04,874
Fight on Fuyu Road!

256
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:11,394
Stop fighting!

257
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:12,835
Stop!

258
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:13,674
Stop!

259
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:14,254
Stop it!

260
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:15,115
Enough fighting!

261
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:16,794
Don't fight!

262
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:17,874
Don't fight!

263
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:18,995
Stop hitting!

264
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:19,654
Go!

265
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:20,475
No violence!

266
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:21,455
Come here!

267
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,914
Don't fight!

268
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,715
Stop fighting! It's crazy!

269
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,514
So what if you're rich?

270
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:03,674
So what if you're rich?

271
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:08,554
Yang Xiaohai!

272
00:14:09,154 --> 00:14:09,720
What is this?

273
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:25,674
Hit him! If you dare hit him,
do it in front of me.

274
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:29,075
Don't provoke him.
He really will hit me!

275
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:32,115
Does your grandma know
you're fighting out here?

276
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:38,034
Stop fighting!

277
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:39,014
Ge away!

278
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:40,034
No more fighting!

279
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,435
Ms. Li, hurry. Save me!

280
00:14:43,835 --> 00:14:45,475
They beat me so badly I can't breathe.

281
00:14:45,914 --> 00:14:46,595
I'm dying.

282
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,235
Fatty, what nonsense are you spouting?

283
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,674
Look! Look at them!

284
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,034
Everyone, stop!

285
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:56,595
I said stop!

286
00:14:58,394 --> 00:14:58,894
Stop!

287
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:04,315
Nobody move!

288
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:10,075
You monkeys, have you earned
enough money? Huh?

289
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:12,034
You done doing business?

290
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,394
Mr. Zheng!

291
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:16,154
They're bullying us too much!

292
00:15:16,475 --> 00:15:19,595
I'm telling you, they raised the price
and forced us out.

293
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:20,995
They threw the first punch!

294
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:21,575
They...

295
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,394
Look! What they did to me!

296
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:24,315
They hit us like this!

297
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:26,235
We fought back
because they pushed us too far!

298
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:27,355
Exactly, Mr. Zheng.

299
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:31,115
Seven or eight of them ganged up on me,
trying to kill me!

300
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:34,435
Mr. Zheng, they smashed my piano.

301
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,274
I can't swallow this insult.

302
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:38,034
Mr. Zheng, how can we tolerate this?

303
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:38,534
Mr. Zheng.

304
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,835
It seems you just don't
respect the town government at all.

305
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,435
Well, I am right here.

306
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:53,475
Who threw the first punch?

307
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:55,195
Who smashed the piano?

308
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:59,394
They will all get what they deserve.

309
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:02,874
I will make sure
they give you an explanation.

310
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:04,615
But

311
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:07,235
if you dare cause more trouble,

312
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,874
Yuehai will not
welcome you doing business here.

313
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:14,235
Get me to the hospital.

314
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:42,995
Mr. Zheng.

315
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:51,435
Let me tell you all.

316
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:53,274
I get why it happened,

317
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,955
but be careful from now on.

318
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:55,634
Yes.

319
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:56,715
If you have any problem,

320
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,914
seek help from the government promptly.

321
00:16:59,174 --> 00:16:59,674
Yes.

322
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:00,595
No violence allowed!

323
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:01,274
Right.

324
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:01,835
Hear me?

325
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:02,835
Yes, Mr. Zheng.

326
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:03,754
You're right.

327
00:17:03,794 --> 00:17:04,435
You're right.

328
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:05,455
Go back now.

329
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:06,415
Mr. Zheng.

330
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:08,715
- You deserved it.
- Let's go.

331
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:10,955
How does that idiom go?

332
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,655
- It's called, "You reap..."
- What you sow.

333
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,955
Yes, reap what you sow.

334
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,995
We all fought,
so why release them first?

335
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:23,094
Mr. Zheng.

336
00:17:23,235 --> 00:17:23,735
Mr. Zheng.

337
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:24,675
Mr. Zheng.

338
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,114
Mr. Zheng, talk this out calmly.

339
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:26,754
Uncle!

340
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:27,675
Unfair!

341
00:17:27,675 --> 00:17:28,314
Don't stop me.

342
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:30,114
Talking about fairness?

343
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:31,554
Do you have a death wish?

344
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,955
You use my name
to carry out forced evictions

345
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:35,594
and loaf around all day,

346
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:37,074
jealous of others' success.

347
00:17:37,675 --> 00:17:40,354
Can't make it yourself,
so you bully people? A bunch of thugs!

348
00:17:42,274 --> 00:17:42,834
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng,

349
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:43,475
are you okay?

350
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:44,235
I'm fine.

351
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:46,695
I'm fine.

352
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:48,475
Come on, let's go check in the clinic.

353
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:50,915
Lock them all up!

354
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:54,155
Mr. Zheng, that's easy for you to say.

355
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:55,314
But...

356
00:17:55,314 --> 00:17:55,814
Slow down.

357
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:56,314
We've got

358
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:57,354
nowhere to hold them.

359
00:17:57,754 --> 00:17:59,514
How do we feed so many people?

360
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:00,879
I don't care.

361
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:02,594
You must solve this.

362
00:18:02,834 --> 00:18:03,334
Wait...

363
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:06,195
You little fool!

364
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:10,754
Ms. Li, how should we handle this?

365
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:13,875
I agree with Mr. Zheng.
They must be locked up for a few days.

366
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:16,034
I also agree with that.

367
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:17,635
But there are so many.

368
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,594
At the police station,
it's just me and Wang.

369
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,794
Then at least lock
up the ringleaders, right?

370
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:24,514
We must crush their arrogance
and teach them a lesson.

371
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:25,915
Yes.

372
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:28,114
Everything you said makes sense.

373
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:30,475
Even if we only detain the leaders,

374
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,395
we still don't have enough space.

375
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:37,995
I have a place.

376
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,146

377
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:17,354
Hai, what's wrong?

378
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:20,254
Nothing.

379
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:25,635
Don't worry.

380
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:28,675
As long as they don't
transfer us to the county,

381
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,034
they can't hold us long.

382
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,834
We'll be out in three to five days max.

383
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:34,155
But,

384
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,995
what do we do after we get out?

385
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:39,955
What else can we do?

386
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:42,514
Break up.

387
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,034
Hai, what are you thinking?

388
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:55,635
I'm thinking

389
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,274
how to explain to my grandma.

390
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:01,395
She's home alone.

391
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:03,544
No one cares for her.

392
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:06,712
Yang Xiaohai,

393
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:09,754
your grandma's here.

394
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:20,814
Let's go.

395
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:34,175
Go on.

396
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:55,034
Grandma.

397
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,395
Ms. Li, why did you
bring my grandma here?

398
00:21:03,675 --> 00:21:04,955
If I didn't bring her here,

399
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:07,475
she kept insisting you must be dead.

400
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:11,235
Only by bringing her here
could I prove you're alive.

401
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:27,415
Grandma.

402
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:31,915
I was wrong.

403
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:41,074
Grandma, I've already
punished him for you.

404
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,314
Take me back.

Zhang,

407
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:20,195
thanks for bringing me food.

408
00:22:20,314 --> 00:22:21,395
It's nothing.

409
00:22:21,794 --> 00:22:23,614
- I'll bring some tomorrow.
- No need.

410
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:26,554
- Okay, take care.
- I'm leaving.

411
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:28,354
Take care.

412
00:22:28,475 --> 00:22:29,034
Got it.

413
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:30,114
You have to give me a time.

414
00:22:31,114 --> 00:22:31,614
Really?

415
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:33,794
Then it's settled.

416
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:53,794
Need two people to help move this.

- Okay.
- Coming.

how come you didn't see anything?

435

438
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:13,656
forget their faces.

439
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:15,875
I couldn't make out any of them.

440

Take your time. Think carefully.

441
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:23,314
I remember

442
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:25,594
that the guy who hit me wore a mask.

443
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,475
What mask?

444
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,195
A Guan Yu mask.

445
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:32,175
Guan Yu?

446
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,135
Sir,

447
00:26:36,354 --> 00:26:37,995
based on brake mark dimensions

448
00:26:38,114 --> 00:26:39,114
and travel direction,

449
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:40,675
we can preliminarily conclude

450
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,475
suspects set up roadblocks

451
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,475
to puncture tires and stop trucks.

452
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:46,475
This is likely where

453
00:26:46,794 --> 00:26:47,834
they placed spike strips.

454
00:26:48,114 --> 00:26:49,675
When trucks passed, tires burst.

455
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:52,195
They knocked drivers out
during inspections

456
00:26:52,475 --> 00:26:53,435
and robbed the cargo.

457
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:05,435
Go check there.

458
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:06,254
Alright.

459
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:16,995

Forest on one side, reeds on the other.

462
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:27,794
Clearly, the suspects

463
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,875
pre-scouted this location.

464
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,432
So they could strike immediately
when trucks arrived.

465
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,074
Go check over there.

466
00:27:41,114 --> 00:27:42,395

if this continues,

474
00:27:51,594 --> 00:27:53,794
I'm afraid no one
will do business with us.

475
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:56,195
I know.

476
00:27:56,995 --> 00:27:59,675
It's worse than we thought.

477
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:01,995
Neighboring townships, including Yuehai,

478
00:28:02,034 --> 00:28:03,594
reported similar incidents.

479

But rest assured.

480

We've contacted county police.

We're back.

Everyone,

491
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:28,475
our site investigation
and analysis reveal

492
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:32,754
that the crimes occurred
between 11 PM and 3 AM.

493
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:35,314
Locations are scattered,

494
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:37,034
(Yuehai Master Plan)
but we believe

495
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:40,834
they cluster around Yuehai Jingang Road,
near suburban intersections

496
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:43,754
with heavy nighttime truck traffic.

497
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:47,074
Besides, to monitor truck movements,

498
00:28:47,314 --> 00:28:48,675
they chose stakeout spots

499
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:51,834
typically 300 to 500 meters from targets

500
00:28:52,274 --> 00:28:54,354
with good visibility and concealment.

501
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:56,895
Like slopes, reed marshes,

502
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:58,435
and trees.

503
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:00,594
I think

504
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:02,475
since we're waiting

505
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:03,794
for county backup,

506
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:06,354
let's launch our own operation now.

507
00:29:06,715 --> 00:29:07,675
Let's make an example.

508
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:08,955
Explain your plan.

509
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:10,754
Here's my plan.

510
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:12,754
The area under the bridge

511
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:14,475
has a wide view.

512
00:29:14,715 --> 00:29:15,915
If spotted,

513
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:17,754
suspects could escape at night.

514
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:19,274
Our inspection team has numbers.

515
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,114
I'll lead them

516
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:22,074
to ambush there.

517
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:24,114
There are some other

518
00:29:24,274 --> 00:29:26,314
easier hideouts for them.

519
00:29:26,635 --> 00:29:28,155
Chief Tian, you and Wang

520
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,395
cover one spot.

521
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:31,094
Mr. Zheng, Xie,

522
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:33,034
(Stakeout)
Lin and Qingtian,

523
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:36,235
you four cover two more sites.
That should do it.

524
00:29:36,554 --> 00:29:38,415
Then Ms. Li,

525
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:40,074
you and Meng

526
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:43,195
take the walkie-talkies
and stay at the office.

527
00:29:43,554 --> 00:29:45,834
We tested that equipment
during the typhoon, right?

528
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:47,554
Its coverage distance is limited.

529
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,074
So, with you staying at the town office,

530
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:53,314
everyone will report directly to you
if anything happens.

531
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:54,635
Then you relay it out.

532
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:56,635
I think this plan is quite thorough.

533
00:29:58,514 --> 00:29:59,014
Alright.

534
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,875
Let's proceed with your plan for now.

535
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,554
Everyone, stay safe.

536
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:07,514
If those fools back off now,

537
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:09,715
there's really nothing I can do.

538
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:12,074
But if they dare
to keep committing crimes,

539
00:30:12,715 --> 00:30:14,195
we must catch them.

00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:15,406
(Bandit)

541
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:32,235
Ms. Li, two trucks at north pass,

542
00:30:32,475 --> 00:30:33,754
heading towards east pass.

543
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:35,074
North pass is secure.

544
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:39,034
Copy that.

545
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:44,794
Mr. Tan, trucks approaching east pass.

546
00:30:45,114 --> 00:30:47,114
Trucks approaching east pass.

547
00:30:59,995 --> 00:31:01,235
North pass is secure.

548
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:04,014
Copy that.

549
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:08,195

Mr. Xie, what movement?

554
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:24,955
Keep reporting the situation.

We're behind schedule.

557
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:41,514
I haven't been
to the construction site for days.

558
00:31:41,514 --> 00:31:43,834
It's causing major delays.

559
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:45,915
I can't keep it up.

560
00:31:49,235 --> 00:31:49,875
Mr. Tan.

561
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:52,675
None of us can keep this up.

562
00:31:53,114 --> 00:31:55,314
Mr. Lin just said
he can't afford the delays.

563
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,195
As for me, I need to go to Shenzhen.

00:31:59,955 --> 00:32:03,915
I need to bring some investors
to inspect Yuehai.

566
00:32:06,155 --> 00:32:07,834
This isn't just a minor delay,

567
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:08,375
Mr. Tan.

568
00:32:08,715 --> 00:32:09,354
Exactly.

569
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:11,314
Ms. Li is almost at her limit too.

570
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:13,114
At dinner,

571
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:14,715
she was almost nodding off.

572
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:15,395
Right?

573
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:16,175
Yes.

574
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:17,155
So, can you handle it?

575
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,754
Me? I can handle it.

576
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:19,594
Can you handle it?

577
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:21,915
M-Master,

578
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:23,395
can I handle this or not?

579
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:24,875
Whether you can or not, it won't do.

580
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,195
We can't keep
deploying everyone like this.

581
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,314
Mr. Tan, look.

582
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:31,875
These highway robbers
are wearing us out.

583
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:34,034
The whole team is drained.

584
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:37,235
Over a week,
and we haven't even seen anyone.

585
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:39,754
I understand.

586
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,834
This situation really

587
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:45,034
is disrupting everyone's regular work,

588
00:32:45,074 --> 00:32:46,594
and more importantly, your health.

589
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,715
It's truly not right.

590
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:49,514
So how about this?

591
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:52,754
From now on, everyone focus
on your own tasks.

592
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:56,034
I'll keep the city inspectors going
for a few more days.

593
00:32:56,195 --> 00:32:58,715
And I'll discuss with Chief Tian,

594
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:00,995
and apply to the higher-ups again

595
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:03,014
for more police support, okay?

596
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:04,915
Take care of yourself too, Mr. Tan.

597
00:33:05,435 --> 00:33:06,436
Apply to the higher-ups.

598
00:33:07,314 --> 00:33:08,635
Mr. Zheng, what do you think?

599
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,274
Mr. Zheng? Mr. Zheng!

600
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:12,955
What's wrong?

601
00:33:13,235 --> 00:33:14,034
- Mr. Zheng!
- Mr. Zheng!

602
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:14,715
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

603
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:17,955
Where were we?

604
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:28,594
Mr. Tan,

605
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:31,514
situation!

606
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,955
There really is a situation.
Quick, notify them!

607
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:55,955
Situation on the suburban road
west pass. Requesting backup.

608
00:33:56,915 --> 00:33:57,754
West pass?

609
00:33:57,955 --> 00:33:58,594
Yes, west exit.

610
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:08,475
Fan,

611
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:09,875
don't act rashly.

612
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:11,154
We must stay calm right now.

613
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,995
Let's observe for a moment, okay?

614
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:15,714
Mr. Tan, flashlight.

615
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:17,475
Turn it off.

616
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:18,435
Off.

617
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:23,234
Mr. Tan, someone's over there.

618
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:24,395
Where?

619
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:24,895
There.

620
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:28,074
Someone's there.

621
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,835
Oh, no. Has the robbery
already happened?

622
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:33,755
Go check it out.

623
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,375
Sir!

624
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:37,895
Sir!

625
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:40,755
Sir, are you okay?

626
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,154
Mr. Tan, no one up there.

627
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:43,795
He's badly hurt.

628
00:34:44,435 --> 00:34:44,995
Sir.

629
00:34:48,074 --> 00:34:48,920
Quick, they're here!

630
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:49,935
Go!

631
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:52,875
Stop! Don't move!

632
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:53,554
Stop!

633
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:56,714
Just two people.

634
00:34:59,355 --> 00:34:59,855
Well...

635
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:01,355
What do you want?

636
00:35:02,074 --> 00:35:03,234
Don't you dare act rashly!

637
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:06,514
I'm warning you.
You've broken the law, you understand?

638
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:12,114
Fan! What are you doing?

639
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:14,154
Y-You have no respect for the law!

640
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:15,915
I'm the deputy mayor of Yuehai Town.

641
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,194
I've already notified Chief Tian.
Do you know him?

642
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:19,654
You... Hello?

643
00:35:22,355 --> 00:35:23,554
You dare take off your mask?

644
00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:25,154
I want to see who you really are!

645
00:35:46,795 --> 00:35:49,034
What are you waiting for?
Get the goods loaded!

646
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:57,514
In the truck!

647
00:35:58,315 --> 00:35:58,835
Get in!

648
00:36:19,954 --> 00:36:25,355
(Pingchuan County)

649
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:25,855
Tan.

650
00:36:26,194 --> 00:36:26,755
Mr. Zheng.

651
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:27,755
You're awake.

652
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:28,915
- Mr. Zheng.
- You're awake.

653
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:29,835
No, don't move.

654
00:36:29,915 --> 00:36:30,475
No, Mr. Zheng.

655
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:31,795
The doctor said don't move.

656
00:36:32,034 --> 00:36:33,415
The doctor said so. Be good.

657
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:34,295
Got it?

658
00:36:34,634 --> 00:36:35,714
Mr. Zheng, listen...

659
00:36:35,714 --> 00:36:36,395
I know.

660
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:38,275
If I catch that rat,

661
00:36:38,594 --> 00:36:40,034
I'll beat him to death!

662
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:41,915
Don't worry.

663
00:36:41,955 --> 00:36:44,355
Mr. Tan, thank goodness.
You're finally awake.

664
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:44,935
Chief Tian.

665
00:36:45,634 --> 00:36:46,234
Talk later.

666
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:48,514
No, he just woke up!

667
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:50,475
- Cut us some slack.
- He just woke up!

668
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,594
There's only two of us. We need
to hurry, or the suspects will get away.

669
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:55,835
Tell us the specifics.

670
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:58,034
Lie down.

671
00:36:58,634 --> 00:36:59,275
Lie down!

672
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:00,835
Please lie down.

673
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:01,835
Take your time.

674
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:06,995
La-Last night,

675
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:09,514
there were

676
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:12,154
six...

677
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:16,674
It was pitch black.

678
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:19,634
And honestly, we were panicking.

679
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:22,875
Don't rush. Say whatever comes to mind.

680
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:26,194
Anyway, there were at least five people.

681
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:30,475
And two trucks.

682
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:31,674
Small trucks?

683
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:33,875
They drove trucks?

684
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:36,408
Anything else?

685
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:40,074
They

686
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,355
were all wearing these plastic masks.

687
00:37:45,674 --> 00:37:47,074
Wh-What kind of masks?

688
00:37:48,395 --> 00:37:50,114
All sorts of masks.

689
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:52,915
But I remember there was

690
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:54,435
a Guan Yu.

691
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,395
Guan Yu?

692
00:37:59,634 --> 00:38:00,955
Guan Yu is easy to spot.

693
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:03,154
What else?

694
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,514
And well,

695
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:08,674
their clothes

696
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:10,755
were pretty ordinary.

697
00:38:11,714 --> 00:38:12,440
Here's the thing.

698
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:15,594
The previous victims
were all knocked out from behind.

699
00:38:16,154 --> 00:38:18,154
Mr. Tan, you're the only one
who saw them.

700
00:38:19,554 --> 00:38:21,194
Think hard. What else can you remember?

701
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:25,514
What are you waiting for?
Get the goods loaded!

702
00:38:25,714 --> 00:38:26,214
Get in!

703
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:34,755
That's all.

704
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:37,534
Alright.

705
00:38:38,114 --> 00:38:39,275
Mr. Tan, rest well.

706
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:40,475
We'll go investigate.

707
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:41,395
Thanks, Chief.

708
00:38:41,395 --> 00:38:41,995
We're leaving.

709
00:38:41,995 --> 00:38:42,995
Thank you.

710
00:38:46,614 --> 00:38:47,114
Mr. Zheng.

711
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:47,674
Don't move!

712
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:49,714
The doctor said
the wound'll reopen if you get up.

713
00:38:50,514 --> 00:38:52,214
Alright, I'll support your head.

714
00:38:52,395 --> 00:38:53,034
Okay.

715
00:38:53,395 --> 00:38:54,234
Well... Mr. Zheng,

716
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:59,234
there was something
I didn't tell Chief Tian just now.

717
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:00,875
What is it?

718
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:05,435
It's about that Guan Yu...

719
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:06,475
What about him?

720
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:08,995
Well, it's possible

721
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:11,995
that I was too nervous

722
00:39:12,395 --> 00:39:14,995
and didn't hear clearly, or misheard.

723
00:39:15,475 --> 00:39:16,034
But...

724
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:19,355
Stop beating around the bush!
Spit it out!

725
00:39:21,114 --> 00:39:23,475
That Guan Yu's voice

726
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:25,674
resembles someone.

727
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:27,395
Who?

728
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:30,435
Zhiqiang.

729
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:42,554
This dish really goes well with rice.

730
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:43,995
It goes well with rice.

731
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:46,114
If you like it, I'll...

732
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:48,455
Having dinner?

733
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:49,034
You're here.

734
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:49,955
- Stay for dinner.
- We're just eating.

735
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:50,714
No, I've eaten.

736
00:39:50,915 --> 00:39:53,315
I need Zhiqiang for something.
Come here.

737
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,034
What is it?

738
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:01,234
Did Decheng find Zhiqiang a job?

739
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:02,634
Probably.

740
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,114
- Why draw the curtain?
- What happened?

741
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:12,895
No idea.

742
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:19,755
What are you looking for?

743
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:30,134
Uncle.

744
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,554
Uncle, what are you looking for?

745
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:45,795
Uncle.

746
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:01,755
Where were you last night?

747
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:05,674
I was at home.

748
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:07,514
Be honest.

749
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:12,594
Uncle, what are you implying?

750
00:41:12,714 --> 00:41:13,674
What am I implying?

751
00:41:14,835 --> 00:41:16,234
Don't you know what I'm implying?

752
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:20,475
Mr. Tan was stabbed last night.

753
00:41:22,995 --> 00:41:23,674
Who did it?

754
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,554
How is Mr. Tan?

755
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:26,674
Stop lying to me.

756
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:27,955
I want the truth.

757
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:30,714
Where were you last night?

758
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,234
Uncle, you don't really think
I did it, do you?

759
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:36,795
How would I dare?

760
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:39,154
I really was home last night.

761
00:41:42,514 --> 00:41:43,114
Decheng,

762
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:46,915
Zhiqiang isn't lying.

763
00:41:47,955 --> 00:41:49,514
He was home last night.

764
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:01,315
Desheng,

765
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:03,554
are you sure

766
00:42:04,714 --> 00:42:07,634
he was home the whole night
and didn't go out?

767
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:24,435
Desheng, let me be honest with you.

768
00:42:25,234 --> 00:42:26,315
This is serious.

769
00:42:27,275 --> 00:42:28,315
There are a lot

770
00:42:28,795 --> 00:42:30,154
of young men his age out there,

771
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,475
setting up roadblocks to loot supplies.

772
00:42:34,355 --> 00:42:35,275
Last night, Mr. Tan

773
00:42:36,275 --> 00:42:38,154
was stabbed while on patrol.

774
00:42:38,634 --> 00:42:39,955
He's in the hospital right now.

775
00:42:40,714 --> 00:42:42,514
He told me someone's voice
sounded exactly

776
00:42:42,995 --> 00:42:43,875
like Zhiqiang's.

777
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:48,194
Desheng, lying for him

778
00:42:48,955 --> 00:42:49,915
is not good for him.

779
00:42:58,074 --> 00:43:01,395
