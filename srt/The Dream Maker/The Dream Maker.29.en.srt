00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:39,841
Why do you talk so much?

17
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:42,642
If you won't listen, leave.
Don't disturb others.

18
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,921
What's it to you? Who are you anyway?

19
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:46,242
I'm Wang Lili. So what?

20
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:47,928
This is the town office.

21
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:49,481
Stop, or I'll call the leaders.

22
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:50,442
Go ahead, call them.

23
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,321
I will.

24
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:00,341
You.

25
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:01,502
Come here.

26
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,121
Put your hands down.

27
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,162
Please sit.

28
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:09,401
What's Wang Lili got to do with him?

29
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:10,922
Your mouth... your mouth stinks.

30
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:19,762
Now, hands on your hips.

31
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:23,522
Turn your head to the left.

32
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:28,681
Difficulties vanish.

33
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:33,642
Thank you.

34
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:42,721
Turn your head to the right.

35
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,922
Health remains.

36
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:52,561
Turn your head to the left.

37
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:56,281
Difficulties vanish.

38
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:00,841
Turn your head to the right.

39
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,762
Health remains.

40
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:06,601
Good. Face forward.

41
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:08,601
That feels great.

42
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:09,922
Yeah.

43
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,881
That's all for our warm-up exercises.

44
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:15,881
Next, let's invite Professor He
to teach us personally.

45
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:16,881
A round of applause.

46
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,441
Everyone,

47
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:35,642
my assistant caused you all

48
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:38,322
some trouble earlier.

49
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,161
I possess unique energy.

50
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:43,642
I'm different from you all.

51
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,841
The preparatory exercises just now

52
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,522
were meant to help me

53
00:03:48,881 --> 00:03:51,441
establish a harmonious energy field
with you.

54
00:03:51,762 --> 00:03:54,042
This special energy of mine

55
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:58,042
is here to bring you benefits.

56
00:03:58,841 --> 00:03:59,922
What benefits, you ask?

57
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:03,681
In life, there are essentially
two things:

58
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:08,121
money and health.

59
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:19,781
Money.

60
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:31,442
The spring breeze of reform
swept through Yuehai.

61
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,962
The night school grandly opened,
welcoming spring.

62
00:04:41,361 --> 00:04:45,082
According to Meng Xiaoli's
incomplete count,

63
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,864
in the offices, meeting rooms,
and courtyard of our town government,

64
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,442
over 400 residents of Yuehai gathered.

65
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:52,322
It was packed.

66
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:53,682
Outside the courtyard,

67
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,440
countless more were asking questions
right through the walls.

68
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:00,481
Classes ran from 7 PM to 10 PM,

69
00:05:01,082 --> 00:05:03,721
yet residents lingered,
unwilling to leave.

70
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:05,002
Just like me.

71
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:16,962
Mr. Xie, don't stop.

72
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:17,962
- I haven't.
- Keep going.

73
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:19,762
You weren't there.

74
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:21,361
The scene was, you know.

75
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,642
Everyone's eyes lit up
like they were seeing gold.

76
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,562
They were gleaming.

77
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:26,801
The town government compound
looked resplendent.

78
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:30,082
Factory owners and ordinary folks

79
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:32,041
sat together as family,
listening closely.

80
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,002
They discussed how to make money

81
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,122
and how to prosper together.

82
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:38,082
They praised
how well the night school ran.

83
00:05:38,202 --> 00:05:39,401
Knowledge is power.

84
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:40,442
Using all strokes,

85
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:41,921
our residents swam freely in...

86
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:44,241
Sir, lower your voice.
We can hear you in the hallway.

87
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:49,202
They swam freely in our Yuehai.

88
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:52,041
Mr. Xie,

89
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:54,360
I didn't expect you
to be so good at organizing.

90
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,024
The first night school session

91
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,642
was organized so quickly.

92
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:00,442
And the results are so good.

93
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:03,601
It is thanks to your excellent idea.

94
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:04,841
Mr. Zheng said himself.

95
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,122
"Ms. Li's idea was excellent.

96
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:08,801
It keeps pace with the times,

97
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,841
lifting our Yuehai to a new level.

98
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,481
But we mustn't be satisfied.

99
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:16,401
We must make it bigger, stronger,
and achieve real success."

100
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,281
Wait. Hold on.

101
00:06:19,642 --> 00:06:21,082
Mr. Xie,

102
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,481
could you please convey this
to Mr. Zheng again?

103
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:27,921
We can't blindly chase
after scale and speed

104
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:29,962
when running the night school.

105
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:34,281
We need to advance gradually,
staying grounded.

106
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:40,082
- Alright?
- I think so too.

107
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,601
I had no clue yesterday.

108
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:47,601
- Yes.
- Got something today.

109
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:49,361
Class is starting. Where are you going?

110
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,082
Yes. I need to make a call.
Be right there.

111
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:51,762
You go ahead.

112
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:52,322
Zheng.

113
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:06,481
(Welcome to use the public phone.
Coin slot)

114
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:07,122
Zheng.

115
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:08,082
Got class?

116
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:08,781
Yes.

117
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,095
(City Construction Archives)

118
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:25,582
Hello?

119
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,522
Mr. Zheng, I knew it was you.

120
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:31,281
I've been waiting.
What took you so long?

121
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:32,762
Stop talking.

122
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,601
Listen to me.
I'm in a hurry to get to class.

123
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:36,882
About the night school teachers,

124
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,601
you must vet them carefully.

125
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:42,202
Here's the thing. At the place
where I'm having class right now,

126
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:43,962
my classmate come from everywhere.

127
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:47,202
They told me
that many people across the country

128
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:49,304
are taking advantage
of 'knowledge explosion'

129
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,992
to pose as masters and experts
and deceive people everywhere.

130
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,801
So we must be extra cautious
when selecting teachers.

131
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:55,801
Do you hear me?

132
00:07:56,682 --> 00:07:57,882
We are on the same page.

133
00:07:58,481 --> 00:07:59,882
Well,

134
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:01,481
I just went to see Ms. Li.

135
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:02,962
I was about to tell you this.

136
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,801
I did the screening,
and Ms. Li double-checked.

137
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,082
The person we chose

138
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:09,522
is the top expert in the nation.

139
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:11,281
He'll boost our night school.

140
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,921
Don't worry. Everything is excellent.

141
00:08:14,522 --> 00:08:16,382
So let's get back to work, okay?

142
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:17,442
I need to go.

143
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,041
Mr. Tan has no problem with it at all.

144
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,322
Okay, that's settled. Bye.

145
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:23,642
Alright.

146
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:32,001
Xie. Xie. Xie.

147
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:33,202
- I...
- Wait a second.

148
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:33,841
I need to eat.

149
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:36,162
I have a lot to do.
I haven't eaten today.

150
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,402
I want to discuss a problem with you.

151
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:40,241
Okay, let's talk there.

152
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:40,861
No, no.

153
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:42,121
We can talk while I eat.

154
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:43,042
Xie.

155
00:08:44,322 --> 00:08:46,282
We shouldn't discuss this
in front of everyone.

156
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,001
I have some issues to discuss with you.

157
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:49,962
What's wrong?

158
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,282
Take a look at this first.

159
00:08:55,202 --> 00:09:00,001
On the ten key issues about Xie Chunlai
acting as the mayor of Yuehai.

160
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,202
You wrote this?

161
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:03,101
Yes, I did.

162
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:05,162
You're full?

163
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,001
Then get a life.

164
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,521
Xie, you...

165
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,481
Don't get emotional, okay?

166
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:12,402
I'm not emotional.

167
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:13,282
I don't have time.

168
00:09:13,282 --> 00:09:14,121
- Wait.
- I don't have time.

169
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:14,641
Take a look.

170
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:17,001
My report is based on facts.

171
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:19,521
I put it down on paper
only after careful consideration.

172
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,361
You're jealous?

173
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:21,761
Why would I be?

174
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,841
My night school is a huge success,
a sensation.

175
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:24,802
You're jealous.

176
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:25,962
What do you mean?

177
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,761
Listen, don't try to run away.

178
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:30,082
You need to face the problem.

179
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:31,641
I'm not avoiding it.

180
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:32,682
I haven't eaten all day.

181
00:09:32,721 --> 00:09:33,601
Listen to me.

182
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:34,402
I was hesitant

183
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:35,601
about whether to mention it.

184
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,562
Now I see
that I was absolutely right to do so.

185
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:38,402
You're running away.

186
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,442
Now recall carefully.
Let me help you recall.

187
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,521
When you proposed
launching this night school,

188
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:44,442
what was your goal?

189
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:47,082
It was to help ordinary people, right?

190
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,761
To help those without good jobs,

191
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:50,162
so they could gain knowledge

192
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:51,682
and master a skill.

193
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:54,241
That's how they could improve
their lives. Correct?

194
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:55,841
That's why we all supported you.

195
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,656
Both Lin and I were on your side.

196
00:09:57,656 --> 00:09:58,648
Now look at this mess.

197
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:00,402
A sensation?

198
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,082
What are they teaching?

199
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:03,042
His teachings

200
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,922
prioritize money,
and that is problematic.

201
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,082
You're narrow-minded.

202
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:08,042
I'm narrow-minded?

203
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,841
You need this night school most.

204
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:11,601
I'll definitely sign you up, okay?

205
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:12,282
Leave it to me.

206
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:13,361
Xie Chunlai,

207
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:14,442
these ten points...

208
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,001
No. We're done talking.

209
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,008
I'm the acting mayor.

210
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,481
I'll take all the responsibility.

211
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,202
- Even if you're the mayor...
- Mr. Tan.

212
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:22,962
- If you mess up...
- The night school issue

213
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,322
stops here.

214
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:24,902
No.

215
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:25,721
What? Why?

216
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,082
We see an issue, we fix it.

217
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,121
- We must seek truth from facts.
- Okay?

218
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:31,361
I want you to read this carefully.

219
00:10:31,402 --> 00:10:31,902
We...

220
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:33,542
Yes.

221
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:36,001
- What?
- When I've calmed down,

222
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:37,841
I will definitely read through

223
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,962
the problem report
you wrote specifically for me.

224
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:42,001
But I'm not calm now.

225
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,761
Alright, so when will you be calm?

226
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:46,481
Is there ever a calm moment in Yuehai?

227
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:47,322
I'm starving.

228
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,202
What do you mean?

229
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:53,241
I mean 'striving.' For perfection.
It's my work attitude.

230
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:56,182
Fine.

231
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:57,361
Xie Chunlai, listen.

232
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:58,721
While you're eating,

233
00:10:58,802 --> 00:10:59,761
calm yourself down.

234
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,481
And read that report.

235
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,802
There's no avoiding this.

236
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,282
Professor He.

237
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:14,682
Professor He.

238
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:24,841
What's wrong?

239
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:26,442
Are you feeling unwell?

240
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,402
It's nothing. Don't worry too much.

241
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:29,761
It's not a big problem.

242
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:32,042
Professor He encountered
some things recently.

243
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:33,442
Related to alien technology.

244
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:34,881
What?

245
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:36,202
Alien technology?

246
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,082
Related to alien technology?

247
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:39,442
Alien technology?

248
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:41,761
Professor He,

249
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:44,481
could you tell us
about alien technology today?

250
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,322
Alien technology.

251
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,761
- Yeah.
- What does that mean?

252
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,641
What does 'alien technology' mean?

253
00:11:50,322 --> 00:11:51,042
Jie.

254
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,121
- Xie.
- Xie.

255
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:55,361
Xie.

256
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:56,442
No.

257
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:58,442
It's Xie.

258
00:11:59,082 --> 00:11:59,682
Well,

259
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,361
it's not J-I-E.

260
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:02,442
It's X-I-E.

261
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:07,721
Professor He
mentioned alien technology earlier.

262
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,162
Well,

263
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:10,521
Mr. Xie,

264
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:13,442
as the saying goes well,

265
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:15,042
cosmic secrets stay hidden.

266
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:18,841
It seems inconvenient for me to speak

267
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:21,001
about these things here.

268
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:22,721
Right.

269
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,464
Professor He's visit here
wasn't easy to arrange.

270
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:27,562
Professor He, look.

271
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,282
Under this stage and outside

272
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:34,182
are all pairs of eyes
eager to devour knowledge, right?

273
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:36,162
If you don't share something, I'm afraid

274
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:37,802
you can't leave.

275
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:39,721
Tell us a bit, Professor He.

276
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:40,601
Tell us a bit.

277
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:41,241
Alien tech.

278
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:41,761
Tell us.

279
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:42,322
Tell us.

280
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:42,962
Welcome!

281
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:43,962
Welcome!

282
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:45,202
Alright.

283
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:46,082
Tell us.

284
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:47,442
Tell us.

285
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:49,422
Alright.

286
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,162
I'll tell you all.

287
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:55,922
- Good.
- Good.

288
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:02,922
Well, many years ago,

289
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:07,841
I was going deep into the mountains
for some meditation.

290
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,761
Strolling a mountain path,

291
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:15,802
I found a large, glowing stone.

292
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:17,802
Was it a gemstone?

293
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:18,761
A big stone.

294
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:20,562
After I got closer to it,

295
00:13:20,761 --> 00:13:23,082
I suddenly felt dizzy and lightheaded.

296
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,562
At that moment, I just fainted.

297
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:26,802
I knew nothing more.

298
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,001
When I opened my eyes,

299
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:32,601
I discovered I was in outer space.

300
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,402
- Outer space?
- Outer space?

301
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:40,402
Outer space.

302
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:42,202
It wasn't something on Earth anymore.

303
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:44,501
Then I'll go attend
to Yuehai matters, alright?

304
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:47,682
After I got up there,

305
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:52,082
I even met an alien.

306
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:53,241
I remember...

307
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:56,881
I remember his name was David.

308
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,442
- David?
- David?

309
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:00,641
After that,

310
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,841
I again knew nothing.

311
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,521
They sent me back to Earth.

312
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:09,521
Then I discovered
they had placed a device

313
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:14,562
here in my head.

314
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:24,802
Why are your hands shaking?

315
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:26,221
Look.

316
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:28,501
Look.

317
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,001
What?

318
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:32,902
Look.

319
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:34,442
There really is one?

320
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,202
It's there. It's really there.

321
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:38,761
How incredible!

322
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:39,361
It's there.

323
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,282
- What thing?
- What is it?

324
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:42,322
There's this thing on it.

325
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:44,481
About this size, inside the brain.

326
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:45,322
Xiaoyu, you saw it?

327
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:46,202
I saw it. There.

328
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:46,782
This big.

329
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:48,562
That photo.

330
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:49,682
No.

331
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,162
Let go first. Let go.

332
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:56,202
Listen to what happened next.

333
00:14:57,361 --> 00:14:58,241
I found a doctor,

334
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:02,001
and he said he didn't know what it was.

335
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,162
And he had no way to remove it.

336
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,202
Also,

337
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:09,601
that thing

338
00:15:10,082 --> 00:15:11,641
and my central nervous system

339
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:13,922
were intertwined.

340
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,562
It couldn't be removed?

341
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:19,841
The alien technology
is way too advanced.

342
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:21,521
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

343
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,802
You know what? After that, I discovered

344
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:30,802
I'm not quite
like normal people anymore.

345
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:35,082
I hear sounds you can't hear,

346
00:15:36,121 --> 00:15:40,162
I see things you can't see,

347
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,322
and I can do things

348
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,322
you can't even imagine,

349
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,402
things you could never do.

350
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:49,802
What things?

351
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,162
- What things?
- What things?

352
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:52,601
- What things?
- What things?

353
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,682
- What things?
- What?

354
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:57,521
For example,

355
00:15:58,802 --> 00:15:59,601
right now,

356
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:01,282
I have

357
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:05,322
a strong perception.

358
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:11,962
I sense that one person here

359
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:13,562
is feeling very unwell.

360
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,761
Very unwell.

361
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:20,881
- Mom, are you unwell?
- No.

362
00:16:23,962 --> 00:16:24,962
I'm unwell.

363
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:25,841
Her neck.

364
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:30,361
It's a male.

365
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:32,841
- A man?
- It's a man?

366
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:34,481
In his thirties.

367
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:36,601
Curly hair.

368
00:16:40,922 --> 00:16:41,422
It's me.

369
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:45,521
His stomach should be a bit...

370
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:46,682
Yes, it's me.

371
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:49,802
It's me. I have a toothache.

372
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:50,361
Right?

373
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:50,861
Yes.

374
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:52,121
Amazing.

375
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:53,682
So incredible.

376
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:55,162
Amazing.

377
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:55,782
Wait.

378
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,042
Professor He, how'd you know?
You're so amazing.

379
00:16:58,042 --> 00:16:59,202
You saw it?

380
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:03,782
Young man,

381
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:06,801
come here.

382
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:08,602
Sit here.

383
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,162
Hurry.

384
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:10,721
Go.

385
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:11,801
- Go.
- Go over.

386
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:12,561
Get it checked.

387
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:13,962
- Go.
- Rare opportunity.

388
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:14,642
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

389
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:15,721
Let Professor He check it.

390
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:16,561
Hurry.

391
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:19,942
Really.

392
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:21,202
Unbelievable.

393
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:23,561
Young man,

394
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:25,521
sit.

395
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:27,102
Sit?

396
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:27,781
Yes.

397
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:29,561
Now,

398
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:30,561
tell me,

399
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:31,761
about the tooth.

400
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:33,962
Which one is it?

401
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:37,602
What's causing the pain?

402
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:39,102
Tell me.

403
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:42,001
It's that... well...

404
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:44,882
It's this big molar back here.

405
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,162
This molar here.

406
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:48,882
It's been rotten for over two months,

407
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:51,122
but these past few days
it's been really painful.

408
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:52,682
It hurts so much I can't sleep.

409
00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:54,162
Right here, this big molar.

410
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:55,902
Okay.

411
00:17:56,362 --> 00:17:57,602
I won't touch you.

412
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,202
Just sit right there.

413
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:03,682
And I can pull out that painful tooth.

414
00:18:04,521 --> 00:18:05,642
Professor He, you mean

415
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:08,922
the tooth will fall out
with you not touching me?

416
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,021
Okay, sit properly.

417
00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:16,504
Don't be afraid.

418
00:18:30,882 --> 00:18:32,202
Spit it out. The tooth's out.

419
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:34,321
- It's out?
- It's out?

420
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,321
- Is it out?
- Is it out?

421
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:35,736
Is it out?

422
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:36,761
- How is it?
- Did it fall out?

423
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:37,880
Really?

424
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:42,172
Is it out then?

425
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,000
Nothing!

426
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,081
It's... it's still there.

427
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:48,422
Still there?

428
00:18:48,922 --> 00:18:49,521
Yes.

429
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:51,721
It's still there.

430
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:53,081
This shows your tooth...

431
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:55,448
your rotten tooth is very stubborn.

432
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,081
Here, let me take a look.

433
00:19:02,962 --> 00:19:03,721
So smelly.

434
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:07,241
It's not your mouth that stinks.

435
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:08,922
It's that rotten tooth that stinks.

436
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:09,821
Sit tight.

437
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:09,221
Go.

438
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:10,382
Go.

439
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:12,981
Spit it out. The tooth's out.

440
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:15,882
- Is it out?
- Is it out?

441
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:17,241
Is it out?

442
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:37,761
It's out!

443
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:40,402
- It's out!
- It really is out!

444
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:41,362
My tooth is really out!

445
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:42,162
It is out!

446
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:44,321
Amazing!

447
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:45,761
Master He, it really came out!

448
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:46,962
The hospital said

449
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,281
this tooth needed surgery to be removed.

450
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:51,122
Master, you're incredible!

451
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:58,162
Magical!

452
00:20:58,842 --> 00:20:59,882
Master, you are amazing.

453
00:21:00,481 --> 00:21:01,081
Professor He,

454
00:21:01,202 --> 00:21:04,241
can your energy cure any illness?

455
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:05,882
Of course.

456
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:07,801
Professor He, besides pulling teeth,

457
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,442
you can treat other illnesses too?

458
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:09,942
Yes.

459
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:11,162
Then, how about this?

460
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:13,402
Ms. Li, our mayor, has been hospitalized

461
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:14,721
for some time.

462
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,741
So, could you go and see her?

463
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:17,862
Right?

464
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:18,882
- Yes.
- Yes.

465
00:21:19,842 --> 00:21:21,081
It's fine. Ms. Li is fine.

466
00:21:21,842 --> 00:21:23,761
Everyone, calm down. Ms. Li is fine.

467
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,521
Everyone is very worried about Ms. Li.

468
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,642
But Ms. Li is fine.
Sorry for worrying you.

469
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:29,261
Sorry.

470
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:30,422
Wait.

471
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,001
Are we getting paid by the day?

472
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:34,781
Yes.

473
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:40,682
Everyone,

474
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:43,842
the universe needs rest.

475
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:45,761
The mayor also needs rest.

476
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,642
And of course, I need rest too.

477
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:49,842
Tomorrow,

478
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:55,041
Ms. Li

479
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:58,001
will be cured instantly.

480
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:01,241
- Good!
- Good!

481
00:22:02,962 --> 00:22:03,462
Good!

482
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:08,122
Thank you.

483
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:08,942
Thank you.

484
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:11,402
Thank you.

485
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:13,801
- Professor He.
- Professor He, wait.

486
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:17,922
Professor He,
so we're agreed for tomorrow.

487
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:18,882
Right? You...

488
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,021
Professor.

489
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:24,568
Don't take him to the hospital tomorrow.

490
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:25,801
Wait, I...

491
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:26,362
You heard me.

492
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:28,728
Take care, Professor He.

493
00:22:32,761 --> 00:22:33,481
You're doing well.

494
00:22:34,162 --> 00:22:35,362
But you must keep exercising.

495
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:37,882
When you have time,
stroll around the corridor more

496
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:39,481
in your wheelchair

497
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,362
and get some fresh air.

498
00:22:41,642 --> 00:22:42,602
Okay, thank you.

499
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,162
Next week,
I'll schedule another checkup.

500
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:47,842
If there are no issues,
you can be discharged.

501
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:48,662
Okay.

502
00:22:49,122 --> 00:22:50,741
This way, Master.

503
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:05,842
It's just ahead.

504
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:09,622
Master He.

505
00:23:09,962 --> 00:23:10,462
Mr. Xie.

506
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:11,261
Master He.

507
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:13,241
Let's... let's go back first.

508
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:14,842
W-What are you doing, Mr. Xie?

509
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:16,382
Alright.

510
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,342
Well, please wait a moment.

511
00:23:19,741 --> 00:23:20,241
Over here.

512
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:20,741
Wait.

513
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:23,662
Come here.

514
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:25,642
You just left him there?

515
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:29,241
What?

516
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:29,882
Come on.

517
00:23:31,602 --> 00:23:32,561
- What?
- Alright.

518
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:36,122
What's this?

519
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:37,880
What did I say last night?

520
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:39,162
Mr. Xie,

521
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:41,561
I'm doing this for Ms. Li's sake.

522
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,081
I thought this through.

523
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:45,922
Think about how long
Ms. Li has been resting.

524
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:47,032
She hasn't recovered.

525
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:49,402
If Master He cures her completely today,

526
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:50,882
- wouldn't that be great?
- Great for whom?

527
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:52,682
How does it concern you? Leave.

528
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:53,962
It's for Ms. Li's sake.

529
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:55,202
For my sake?

530
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:01,942
Ms. Li.

531
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:08,801
This must be Ms. Li?

532
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,488
Master He, sorry about that.

533
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:11,922
Push her.

534
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:14,162
What's wrong? What are you doing?

535
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:15,041
Just relax.

536
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:15,642
This is?

537
00:24:19,202 --> 00:24:19,922
Ms. Li,

538
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,682
this is Professor He Bin,
a nationally renowned expert.

539
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:24,602
Ms. Li,

540
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:27,081
I specifically invited Master He
here today for you.

541
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:28,642
He's here to treat you.

542
00:24:29,442 --> 00:24:31,320
Wherever Master He goes,

543
00:24:31,422 --> 00:24:33,001
he cures illnesses without medicine.

544
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:35,481
My tooth hadn't been fixed for years.

545
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:37,902
Master He
pulled it out yesterday. Right?

546
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:39,842
Ms. Li, Professor He is amazing.

547
00:24:39,842 --> 00:24:40,402
Yes.

548
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:41,281
We all saw it.

549
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,521
He fixed several of my teeth.

550
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,682
No pain at all.

551
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:45,281
Us too.

552
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:45,942
Look.

553
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:49,362
Jie.

554
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:51,521
My surname is Xie. Call me Xie.

555
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:55,081
Mr. Xie.

556
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:00,962
Who ranks higher, her or you?

557
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:03,402
She's the head. I'm the deputy.

558
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,321
Thank you for your kindness.

559
00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:11,122
My doctor has already treated me.

560
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:13,202
I'll be discharged in a few days.

561
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,642
I can already sense it.

562
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:25,402
The thing in Ms. Li's lower back
is quite stubborn.

563
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:26,642
What thing?

564
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:27,801
- What?
- What thing?

565
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:28,581
Well...

566
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,561
Right, she has a doctor.
Maybe we should call it a day.

567
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:32,801
Mr. Xie. Mr. Xie.

568
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:35,122
Master He, please.

569
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:54,898
(Ward 05,
Nurse in Charge: Zeng Qingying)

570
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:23,162
Alright. You can stand up now.

571
00:26:25,081 --> 00:26:25,842
So fast.

572
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,721
Master, it's done?

573
00:26:27,642 --> 00:26:29,481
Come on. One, two, three, up!

574
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:30,622
Come on.

575
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,642
Ms. Li, one, two, three, up!

576
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,642
One, two, three, up!

577
00:26:35,081 --> 00:26:36,642
One, two, three, up!

578
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:38,882
One, two, three, up!

579
00:26:39,281 --> 00:26:40,922
One, two, three, up!

580
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,241
One, two, three, up!

581
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,122
One, two, three, up!

582
00:26:45,362 --> 00:26:46,962
One, two, three, up!

583
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:50,622
Up!

584
00:26:51,202 --> 00:26:51,702
Up!

585
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:13,241
- Good!
- Good!

586
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,162
- Good!
- Good!

587
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:17,842
Ms. Li is standing!

588
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,058
She can even walk!

589
00:27:28,882 --> 00:27:29,382
Ms. Li!

590
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,602
Don't touch me!

591
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:31,882
Ms. Li, are you okay?

592
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:32,642
That can't be.

593
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:33,422
Doctor!

594
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:34,362
Master, what happened?

595
00:27:34,682 --> 00:27:35,362
Faith.

596
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:36,362
Faith?

597
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,561
She lacked a little bit.

598
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:38,182
Yes.

599
00:27:38,202 --> 00:27:38,761
Come on.

600
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:39,442
Hurry.

601
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:40,721
Don't move.

602
00:27:41,561 --> 00:27:42,481
The key is faith.

603
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,241
It's fine.

604
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:44,721
You just lacked faith.

605
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:45,761
What's with the crowd?

606
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,202
Nothing to see here. Leave.

607
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,801
After Dr. Hou examined the scans,

608
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:54,041
he helped reset her joints.

609
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:56,801
A blessing in disguise.

610
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,481
She's fine now. Don't worry.

611
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:02,362
She must be extremely careful
not to get injured again.

612
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:03,821
Yes.

613
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,041
Mr. Xie meant well.

614
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:08,642
But Qiuping suffered terribly.

615
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:09,741
Well...

616
00:28:10,362 --> 00:28:11,682
As long as she's okay.

617
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:12,362
Mr. Xie,

618
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:17,162
there really are too many fraudsters
in society nowadays.

619
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:19,041
But what I never expected was

620
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,162
that even you guys fell for it too.

621
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,561
Professor He's been in the papers.

622
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:25,561
But I didn't believe it.

623
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:29,442
I saw it with my own eyes.
He channeled energy right there

624
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,402
and pulled that tooth right out
without touching it.

625
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:34,962
Does being in the papers
guarantee he's not a fraud?

626
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:37,922
We've seen plenty of this kind of thing
around here.

627
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:38,781
Well,

628
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:40,922
the person whose tooth pulled by him

629
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,241
might very well be his plant.

630
00:28:42,362 --> 00:28:42,862
Wait.

631
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:43,741
Fatty.

632
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,041
Over here.

633
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,682
Here's what happened.

634
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:48,041
Ms. Li wasn't sincere enough.

635
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:49,081
It's about faith.

636
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:50,362
Fatty, are you his plant?

637
00:28:50,382 --> 00:28:52,061
What plant? What? No.

638
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:53,241
Not at all.

639
00:28:53,362 --> 00:28:55,081
Fatty, open your mouth.

640
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:57,122
Let me see which tooth he pulled.

641
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:06,546
(Outpatient Department)

642
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,842
How's your back?

643
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,241
It's only been a few days.

644
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:14,442
I can manage.

645
00:29:15,682 --> 00:29:18,442
Qiuping, discharge papers are ready.

646
00:29:20,001 --> 00:29:21,561
Who told you to rush it?

647
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:22,922
Shouldn't she stay longer?

648
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,642
Mom, don't blame Dad.
I asked him to do it.

649
00:29:26,202 --> 00:29:27,842
I'm worried
about all the work piling up.

650
00:29:27,922 --> 00:29:28,842
I need to get back.

651
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:30,922
But you need
to let your back heal properly.

652
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:31,922
What's the rush?

653
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,882
Qiuping's parents,

654
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:34,122
- Director Jiang.
- Hello.

655
00:29:34,202 --> 00:29:36,521
Don't worry. She can be discharged now.

656
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:39,442
See? Director Jiang has said okay.

657
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:41,162
I'm fine. I can leave.

658
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,122
Stop worrying.

659
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,721
Sorry, but there's something else

660
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:46,721
that I need to report to Ms. Li.

661
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:48,321
Go ahead.

662
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,602
We'll step out.

663
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:51,682
- Thanks.
- Okay.

664
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:58,904
Hurry. It's about to start.

665
00:29:59,384 --> 00:30:00,248
Where are you going?

666
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:01,602
Hurry.

667
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:08,481
So, that's the situation.

668
00:30:08,962 --> 00:30:09,721
What will you do?

669
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:12,122
I've got it.

670
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:14,662
By the way,

671
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,922
you must be very careful
with your condition.

672
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,481
No strenuous activity at all.

673
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:20,602
This illness can cause long-term issues,

674
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:21,761
and it'd be serious.

675
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:23,162
I understand.

676
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:30,360
(Ward 05,
Nurse in Charge: Zeng Qingying)

677
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:32,202
Why are you running?

678
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:33,081
- Come back.
- Where are you going?

679
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:35,761
Come back. Your legs.

680
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:36,442
Hurry.

681
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:36,942
What's this?

682
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:37,561
I don't know.

683
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:38,241
Can you check?

684
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:38,801
Come back.

685
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,041
You can't run like that.

686
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:41,041
Stop running.

687
00:30:42,122 --> 00:30:42,761
Excuse me.

688
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,842
Where is everyone going?

689
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:47,544
They're going to Professor He's class
to receive cosmic energy.

690
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:48,281
We'll miss it.

691
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:49,402
Haven't finished yet.

692
00:30:54,994 --> 00:31:01,266
(Welcome Professor He to Yuehai)

693
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:12,162
Mr. Xie, what are you doing?

694
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:14,642
Is night school canceled?

695
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:17,642
It's not canceled.

696
00:31:18,602 --> 00:31:19,442
It's important.

697
00:31:20,402 --> 00:31:22,602
Need to think it over more,
take a pause. Understand?

698
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:24,761
I need to rethink it too.

699
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:26,682
Professor He shouldn't come.

700
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:28,984
Everything's on hold.

701
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:33,682
But Mr. Xie,

702
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:34,362
well...

703
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:34,981
What?

704
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:37,122
I just heard

705
00:31:37,241 --> 00:31:39,602
Professor He's gone to the square
to start his class.

706
00:31:43,081 --> 00:31:43,682
He's started?

707
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,162
Did you all hear that?

708
00:31:58,442 --> 00:32:00,122
Yes!

709
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,682
Xiaohai,
do I really have to wear this thing?

710
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,202
It looks awful.

711
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:07,241
Just put it on. This master is amazing.

712
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:08,442
He cures everything.

713
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,402
Hear that?

714
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,842
Yes.

715
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:13,402
I can't hear.

716
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,481
Changyuan, wrong place for you?

717
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:23,521
Trying to summon rain?

718
00:32:23,882 --> 00:32:25,321
That's superstitious stuff.

719
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:26,682
This is pure science.

720
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:29,162
Yeah. You know who brought him here.

721
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:29,962
My husband, Xie.

722
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:31,241
Have faith.

723
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,721
- Okay.
- Sit tight.

724
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:33,882
Even the master is silent.

725
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:35,481
Everyone, stand up.

726
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:54,402
Pick up the pots in your hands.

727
00:32:59,442 --> 00:33:03,081
Use the pots to receive cosmic energy.

728
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:04,842
Left.

729
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:07,402
Left.

730
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:08,842
Right.

731
00:33:11,162 --> 00:33:11,842
Forward.

732
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:15,402
Back.

733
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:21,682
Scoop the cosmic energy in
with your pots.

734
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:27,842
Good.

735
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:29,202
Now,

736
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:32,761
the cosmic energy is now in your pots.

737
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,001
When you get home,

738
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,761
fill the pot with water and boil it.

739
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:37,882
That water will cure all diseases.

740
00:33:38,122 --> 00:33:42,001
- Cure all diseases!
- Cure all diseases!

741
00:33:42,362 --> 00:33:44,001
See? It cures all diseases.

742
00:33:56,442 --> 00:33:57,321
Listen to me,

743
00:33:58,402 --> 00:34:00,281
you need to trust in science.

744
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:02,232
Do you realize
what you're actually doing?

745
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:07,682
Ms. Li, we're receiving cosmic energy.

746
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:08,362
Right?

747
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:10,041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

748
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:10,762
Right?

749
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:12,001
- Exactly.
- Right.

750
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:15,081
The pots on your heads right now

751
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:17,322
are just regular aluminum pots.

752
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,442
They can't even pick up Earth's
satellite signals,

753
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,561
let alone alien energy

754
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:24,521
or cosmic energy.

755
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:27,641
Also, all that stuff he's spouting

756
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:30,041
was exposed in the newspaper
half a year ago

757
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:32,762
as a scam called the 'information pots.'

758
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:33,661
See?

759
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:35,962
If you doubt me,
look it up in the papers.

760
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,722
His claims about curing all diseases

761
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:40,882
and gathering heaven and earth's energy.

762
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:43,121
The script is identical.

763
00:34:43,802 --> 00:34:46,882
It's all lies. Don't be fooled.

764
00:34:47,362 --> 00:34:48,121
Information pots?

765
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:48,882
Ever heard of it?

766
00:34:48,882 --> 00:34:49,641
It's fake?

767
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:50,481
Well...

768
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,521
We must believe in science.

769
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:54,402
It's a scam?

770
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:59,201
Ms. Li, I know about that scam
you mentioned.

771
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,882
But that scam has nothing to do with me.

772
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:05,121
That was superstition.

773
00:35:05,242 --> 00:35:07,121
What I do is science.

774
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,001
Yes.

775
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:08,802
Believe in science.

776
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:10,242
- Science.
- Science?

777
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,041
Granny, put it on.

778
00:35:11,081 --> 00:35:12,681
Professor He,

779
00:35:12,842 --> 00:35:15,601
you claim the water
from your pot cures all diseases.

780
00:35:15,802 --> 00:35:17,521
What scientific basis is there for that?

781
00:35:18,322 --> 00:35:20,120
What's the substance's
scientific name then?

782
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,601
And its chemical formula?

783
00:35:22,201 --> 00:35:24,882
Well, current cosmic science

784
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,456
has many things we don't understand.

785
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:28,802
So I can't explain it to you.

786
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:29,601
Professor He,

787
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,601
you claim your cosmic energy
can cure all diseases,

788
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:34,121
isn't that correct?

789
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:34,822
Yes.

790
00:35:34,962 --> 00:35:35,462
Okay.

791
00:35:36,962 --> 00:35:39,081
We have an elderly person here right now

792
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:41,336
- who's been disabled in both legs
- That's you!

793
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:42,322
with mobility issues.

794
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:44,481
Can you use your cosmic energy

795
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:46,081
to cure her legs?

796
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:48,001
Sincerity leads to miracles.

797
00:35:49,402 --> 00:35:51,521
As long as the patient has enough faith,

798
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:53,242
she will surely recover.

799
00:35:54,081 --> 00:35:56,322
You can be cured.
Granny, what did I tell you?

800
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:57,201
Put it on.

801
00:35:57,561 --> 00:35:58,322
Professor He,

802
00:35:58,521 --> 00:36:00,001
so according to you,

803
00:36:00,362 --> 00:36:02,481
for any patient you treat,

804
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:06,362
if they happen to get better,
it's your credit.

805
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:10,641
If there's no effect,
it's because the patient lacks faith.

806
00:36:11,561 --> 00:36:13,762
Professor He, that's well said.

807
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,962
No matter what,
you always come out right and correct.

808
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:18,041
Ms. Li,

809
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:22,001
if you insist on measuring my intentions
with your petty mind,

810
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:23,362
I can't do anything.

811
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,201
But we all saw with our own eyes

812
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:28,722
Professor He pulled out Fatty's tooth
with cosmic energy.

813
00:36:29,081 --> 00:36:29,601
That's true.

814
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:30,802
- Yes.
- Yes.

815
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:32,402
- Right.
- Exactly.

816
00:36:32,402 --> 00:36:34,681
Even Ms. Li knows
the master pulled out my tooth.

817
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:35,842
Because I had faith.

818
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,962
His so-called
'cosmic energy' pulling teeth?

819
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:40,722
I can do that too.

820
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,601
Because it has nothing to do
with cosmic energy.

821
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:47,561
He used this medicine I have in my hand.

822
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:49,422
Medicine?

823
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:50,322
What medicine?

824
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:50,902
Medicine?

825
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:51,722
What is it?

826
00:36:51,722 --> 00:36:52,344
What medicine?

827
00:36:53,322 --> 00:36:54,081
What medicine?

828
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:56,402
What is this stuff?

829
00:36:58,962 --> 00:36:59,681
What medicine?

830
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,481
What medicine?

831
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:11,201
Now we'll have the doctor

832
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:15,201
extract tissue samples
from around your gums for testing.

833
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:16,521
Willing to cooperate?

834
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:18,161
What's in it for me?

835
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:22,802
What do you want?

836
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:25,601
A dental implant.

837
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:26,842
A gold one.

838
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,762
The thing is, these past few days,

839
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,842
I can't chew anything or eat meat
without that tooth.

840
00:37:32,322 --> 00:37:32,822
Fine.

841
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:35,322
We can give you a free dental implant.

842
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:38,601
But if you want a gold one,
you'll have to arrange that yourself.

843
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:39,981
Let's begin.

844
00:37:50,722 --> 00:37:52,521
Doctors at Yuehai People's Hospital

845
00:37:52,802 --> 00:37:55,641
extracted traces of a drug residue

846
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,481
from the tissue of Fatty's teeth.

847
00:37:57,962 --> 00:38:00,362
Tests confirmed it as arsenic trioxide.

848
00:38:00,442 --> 00:38:01,481
What? Arson?

849
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:02,001
What arson?

850
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:02,601
Arson?

851
00:38:02,601 --> 00:38:03,121
What?

852
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:03,922
Arson?

853
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,762
Commonly known as arsenic.

854
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:08,362
What? Arsenic?

855
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:09,641
That's deadly.

856
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:11,041
Poison.

857
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,041
It's poison.

858
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:15,201
It's this bottle of
'Bone-Melting Powder' in my hand.

859
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,242
Don't swallow your saliva.

860
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:20,922
Don't spit at me.

861
00:38:20,962 --> 00:38:22,041
Quiet. Listen to her.

862
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:23,121
Stop shouting. Listen up.

863
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:24,442
Professor He,

864
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:28,641
you obtained this drug
through unofficial channels, right?

865
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:31,842
Aren't you afraid of poisoning someone
with improper dosage?

866
00:38:33,681 --> 00:38:35,201
Isn't this disregard for life?

867
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:37,922
I... I need to go to the hospital.

868
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:41,561
And his so-called 'cosmic energy'

869
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:43,362
is just a diversion.

870
00:38:43,561 --> 00:38:45,922
It's meant to distract the patient.

871
00:38:46,081 --> 00:38:48,882
Then, under the guise
of locating the tooth,

872
00:38:49,081 --> 00:38:49,842
he applies this

873
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:53,282
near the decayed tissue and nerves.

874
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:56,041
Within seconds,

875
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:59,402
the decayed tissue and nerves
are destroyed.

876
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:00,601
Then,

877
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:03,882
Professor He just needs

878
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,442
to apply slight pressure casually

879
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:08,201
and the rotten tooth comes out.

880
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:10,601
It detaches naturally.

881
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,161
It's not Xie's fault, right?

882
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:19,282
He's too cunning. A big fraudster.

883
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:20,722
- Exactly.
- Xie's not to blame.

884
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,322
Look at him. How could he?

885
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:24,561
I knew it was a scam all along.

886
00:39:24,882 --> 00:39:25,601
Carry me back.

887
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:27,081
Should we stay a bit longer?

888
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:28,561
No. Carry me back now.

889
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,481
I'd rather watch TV at home.

890
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:31,601
Let's go.

891
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:32,521
Okay.

892
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:36,041
Nonsense. Absolute nonsense.

893
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:37,322
Cease baseless accusations.

894
00:39:37,521 --> 00:39:38,962
Are my accusations baseless?

895
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,081
Come with me
to the People's Hospital now.

896
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:44,922
We'll confront each other
before all the doctors.

897
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,802
Or we can check your pockets right here

898
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:49,242
in front of everyone

899
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:52,001
and see if
you're carrying this drug I'm holding.

900
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:52,601
- Search him.
- Search him.

901
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,641
- Search him.
- Check his pockets.

902
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:58,521
Check his pockets.

903
00:39:58,762 --> 00:39:59,362
You...

904
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,402
you certainly have no right
to search me.

905
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:02,561
I can't reason with you.

906
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:04,362
You don't understand science.
I won't argue.

907
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:06,362
Are you done, Professor He?

908
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:10,601
Leave Yuehai now.
You're not welcome here.

909
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,802
Yuehai people don't want you here.

910
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:14,481
Get out of Yuehai.

911
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:15,121
Let him go.

912
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:16,762
- Out!
- Get out!

913
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:27,722
I'll leave immediately.

914
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:30,362
I'll use the science you reject

915
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,481
to cut off your income stream.

916
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:36,481

- Beat him up!

917
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:38,481

- Beat him to death!

00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:07,962
Something this big happened.

936
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:09,402
Are you okay?

937
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:10,141
I'm fine.

938
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:11,842
This is a serious issue.

939
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:13,561
Why didn't you tell me?

940
00:41:14,081 --> 00:41:16,681
You let that fraud
pretending to be a master

941
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:18,041
deceive the public.

942
00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:20,481
Yes, even I could see that.

943
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,922
Isn't he just a pot seller?

944
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:23,121
Meng.

945
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:24,041
Meng.

946
00:41:24,161 --> 00:41:26,242
Ms. Li, don't be so angry.

947
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:27,322
I admit my mistake.

948
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:29,121
On this issue, Lin and I

949
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:31,601
both must take responsibility.

950
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:32,181
Yes.

951
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:35,842
But I must emphasize
that Xie's intentions were good.

952
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:37,762
No one expected it to turn out this way.

953
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,282
Of course,
we didn't catch the problem in time.

954
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,882
We did want to report to you, but...

955
00:41:42,882 --> 00:41:44,001
Why didn't you do it sooner?

956
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:47,081
As deputy mayors and committee members,

957
00:41:47,362 --> 00:41:49,521
you delayed reporting
and kept me in the dark.

958
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:51,160
And you didn't handle it.

959
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:52,882
We were worried about you.

960
00:41:55,802 --> 00:41:56,442
Where's Xie?

961
00:41:57,322 --> 00:41:58,201
Xie...

962
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:01,322
Xie, hurry.

963
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:04,922
Ms. Li,
about the Yuehai night school matter...

964
00:42:05,362 --> 00:42:06,041
Don't go. Stay.

965
00:42:06,161 --> 00:42:07,222
You stay. You all stay.

966
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:09,922
I, Xie Chunlai,

967
00:42:10,442 --> 00:42:12,121
forsaken principles and lost judgment.

968
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:15,362
I failed to cut losses in time,
nearly causing disaster.

969
00:42:17,282 --> 00:42:19,722
I've deeply reflected on my mistakes.

970
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:20,762
I was wrong.

971
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:22,722
I was truly wrong.

972
00:42:23,762 --> 00:42:24,762
I wrote a self-criticism.

973
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:28,021
Ms. Li, I'll accept
any punishment you give.

974
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:30,242
Self-criticism.

975
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:34,161
Respected Yuehai Town Committee,

976
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:36,362
I, Xie Chunlai...

977
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,201
Xie Chunlai!

978
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,282
- Gullibly believed...
- What's wrong with you?

979
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:40,362
Science master.

980
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:42,442
What did you tell me on the phone?

981
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:44,802
Didn't you claim
the list was reviewed by Ms. Li?

982
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:46,561
You've become quite capable,
haven't you?

983
00:42:46,601 --> 00:42:47,101
Hypocrite...

984
00:42:47,242 --> 00:42:49,001
You must write
a thorough self-criticism.

985
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,362
Write until Ms. Li is satisfied.

986
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:51,681
Did you hear me?

987
00:42:51,762 --> 00:42:53,521
- It has caused serious damage...
- Alright, enough.

988
00:42:53,521 --> 00:42:54,601
Stop reading it. Enough.

989
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:58,882
Mr. Zheng,
Mr. Xie has written his self-criticism.

990
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:00,922
No major losses have occurred yet.

991
00:43:02,402 --> 00:43:03,722
Go away. Don't touch me.
