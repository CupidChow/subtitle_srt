(Yuehai Dock)

17
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,013
There are five of us.

18
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:43,653
Let's go.

19
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:48,412
Zhiqiang, why are you
carrying so few things?

20
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:51,000
Even if Dad doesn't come back,
I'll return soon.

21
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,052
What for?

22
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:57,692
Desheng.

23
00:01:59,173 --> 00:01:59,692
Desheng.

24
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:01,973
- Mr. Zheng.
- I'm looking for someone.

25
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:02,973
Alright, Mr. Zheng.

26
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:06,212
Desheng.

27
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:09,592
Desheng.

28
00:02:10,776 --> 00:02:12,253
Where are you going?

29
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:16,452
Desheng, Ms. Li said

30
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:19,773
that a city must
uphold its spirit, character,

31
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:20,852
and civility.

32
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,373
She is right.

33
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:24,053
Since she's right,

34
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:25,653
why should we oppose it?

35
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,732
I-I'm not opposing it.

36
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:28,773
But your leaving

37
00:02:28,973 --> 00:02:30,493
looks like a silent protest.

38
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:32,373
I'll be the bad guy no matter what.

39
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:33,452
Desheng.

40
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:36,213
Well...

41
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:38,852
Decheng.

42
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:41,773
Your big brother and I
have lived our whole lives

43
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,612
without anyone finding fault with us.

44
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,732
Now your brother's name

45
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:48,892
was announced over the loudspeaker.

46
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:50,692
The whole town knows.

47
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,292
He feels so ashamed.

48
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:56,333
It feels like the sky has fallen.
He can't stay.

49
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:58,732
Enough, why are you saying that?

50
00:02:58,852 --> 00:02:59,773
But we really...

51
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:00,933
Enough, say no more.

52
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:02,572
Decheng.

53
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,773
Sorry I embarrassed you.

54
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:11,448
To further improve

55
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,452
the overall sanitation level in Yuehai,

56
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:15,973
the Health Management
Regulation specifies

57
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,093
the reward and penalty measures.

58
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:21,533
First: No littering.

59
00:03:21,852 --> 00:03:23,813
No public urination or defecation...

60
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:31,412
V-Violators will be f-fined five yuan.

61
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:34,653
Well...

62
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:35,692
Desheng.

63
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,773
Ms. Li, thank you.

64
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:41,653
I have to pay the fine.

65
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,333
Desheng...

66
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:46,852
But...

67
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:55,813
Ms. Li.

68
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:58,653
Your idea is very good.

69
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,813
But putting it into practice takes time.

70
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:04,933
We can't rush it too much.

71
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:11,373
Mr. Zheng, do you know why I'm rushing?

72
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:15,732
Watermelon, my favorite.

73
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:17,013
- Have some watermelon.
- Okay.

74
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:19,533
I want to eat watermelon in China, too.

75
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:20,973
Look at that.

76
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:22,533
It's good.

77
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:23,653
It's good.

78
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:24,412
Is it good?

79
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:25,133
Thank you.

80
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,040
Are you getting this?

81
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:28,653
This is serious.

82
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:38,412
Stop it.

83
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:40,213
Oh my.

84
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:41,333
I told you.

85
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:49,812
I really like Yuehai.

86
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:52,893
I like its chaos and energy.

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,852
But my father wants to invest

88
00:04:55,852 --> 00:04:57,453
in a city with potential.

89
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,573
Yuehai remains a rural area.

90
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:04,213
Mr. Zheng,
those are Monica's exact words.

91
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:06,973
I've been thinking.

92
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:09,528
On this matter,

93
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:11,612
I was indeed too eager

94
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:13,973
for quick results.

95
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:17,612
We missed the opportunity.

96
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,133
We must face our problem.

97
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:23,412
Hooligan!

98
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:23,973
Who?

99
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:24,932
The one in blue.

100
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,133
What did you do?

101
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,213
Mr. Zheng, where did Desheng go?

102
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:52,893
Hello, everyone in Yuehai.

103
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,213
My name is Zheng Desheng.

104
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:00,172
Well...

105
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,052
Last night,

106
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:05,013
I dumped the garbage

107
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,893
casually onto the ground

108
00:06:09,773 --> 00:06:11,573
for my own convenience.

109
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:16,732
I was wrong.

110
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:19,064
I caused trouble

111
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:21,292
for my brother.

112
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:25,732
And of course,

113
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,693
for everyone.

114
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:29,432
I...

115
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:32,492
I really regret it.

116
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:35,333
You know.

117
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,093
I also saw what they played

118
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:41,693
on TV.

119
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,492
Some of our habits

120
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:46,893
are quite bad.

121
00:06:47,973 --> 00:06:50,412
We're not exactly clean.

122
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:52,760
I think

123
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,453
it's time to change.

124
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,533
Let's start today.

125
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,013
Starting with me.

126
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:05,693
Everyone should lend a hand.

127
00:07:06,932 --> 00:07:07,732
Together,

128
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:13,013
we will surely do better.

129
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:15,573
Well...

130
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,412
I-I'm done.

131
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,333
Well said. Let's do it.

132
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:39,093
Wait.

133
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:39,893
Get to work.

134
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:40,693
Wait for me.

135
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:44,773
Attention please.

136
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:46,492
Starting today,

137
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:47,773
we will carry out

138
00:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,893
a full-scale
cleanup and improvement campaign.

139
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,732
This will cover every street

140
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:55,612
and every single household.

141
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:57,732
Each household cleans

142
00:07:58,453 --> 00:07:59,372
its own doorstep.

143
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:02,052
Each street will
have a designated leader.

144
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:04,492
They will be responsible.

145
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,852
Tan, announce the specific plan.

146
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:11,573
Okay.

147
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,252
Here is

148
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,533
our management plan.

149
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,612
First: Due to
insufficient police personnel,

150
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:23,052
our town government
will establish its own management team.

151
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,573
This team will be called

152
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:26,773
the City Management Team,

153
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,052
consisting of you people.

154
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,732
Sorry, I wasn't aiming at you.

155
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:42,053
Excuse me, what's your name?

156
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:43,333
Zhuangzhuang.

157
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,532
I must criticize you.

158
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,612
How can you sleep while I'm speaking?

159
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:48,973
And look at you.

160
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:51,413
How can you serve the people like this?

161
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:54,372
Serve the people.

162
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:55,573
Be serious.

163
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,256
Why did I write "Serve the People"

164
00:08:59,256 --> 00:09:00,372
on the blackboard?

165
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:00,632
(Serve the People)

166
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:01,053
(Yuehai Town People's Government,
Yuehai Town Committee)

167
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:01,973
Because this team

168
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:04,573
will exist to serve the people.

169
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,136
This team

170
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,293
is empowered by the people of Yuehai.

171
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,008
Got it?

172
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:11,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

173
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:14,492
(These people were
Yuehai's first city inspectors.)

174
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,008
(They grew alongside urbanization,)

175
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:20,248
(helping new urban residents)

176
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:22,264
(strive towards better lives.)

177
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,462
Maintain city order.

178
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,944
Maintain city order.

179
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,012
Manage the environment.

180
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,053
Manage the environment.

181
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:32,693
Second: We'll properly

182
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:34,413
add public toilets

183
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,933
to the ready-built streets.

184
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,360
(No public urination or defecation)
♪Who can still remember♪

185
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:42,372
Third: We'll build markets and groceries

186
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:44,413
in central residential areas.

187
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:45,772
Yeah, over there.

188
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:47,333
Vegetables go that way.

189
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:50,293
Seafood and meat stay here.

190
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,453
Find your stalls.

191
00:09:51,612 --> 00:09:54,532
From now on,
each vendor stays at their own stall.

192
00:09:54,852 --> 00:09:55,813
It'll be permanent.

193
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:56,852
Think of it as home.

194
00:09:57,053 --> 00:09:58,333
Keep it clean and tidy,

195
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,372
spotless and well-organized.

196
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:01,492
Remember.

197
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:02,652
Starting tonight,

198
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,213
I'll come to inspect

199
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,813
at 7:10 PM every day.

200
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:09,213
Whoever fails to keep the stall clean

201
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:10,333
will be kicked out.

202
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:11,252
Got it?

203
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:12,173
- Got it.
- Got it.

204
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,372
Okay.

205
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,132
Fourth: Set up

206
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:16,933
a designated livestock farming area.

207
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:18,652
Residents with large numbers

208
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:20,093
of poultry or livestock

209
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,772
must keep them there.

210
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,532
Don't take offense.

211
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,532
Yuehai is a city now.

212
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:28,732
It must differ
from the countryside, right?

213
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:30,132
You'll get used to it.

214
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,732
Ducks. Chickens.

215
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:33,293
This way.

216
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,612
Once we're there,
we'll sort it out, okay?

217
00:10:36,132 --> 00:10:36,933
Over here.

218
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,584
(When you feel sad, watch the sunrise.)

219
00:10:41,584 --> 00:10:43,054
(It will warm your heart.)

220
00:10:57,612 --> 00:10:59,933
More greenery, more warmth.

221
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,492
Plant hope, nurture prosperity,

222
00:11:02,732 --> 00:11:04,053
and enhance our city's image.

223
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,213
Good saplings.

224
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:07,933
Desheng.

225
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:09,053
Ms. Li.

226
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,173
Want a sapling?

227
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:12,973
No, thanks.

228
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,293
I'm still struggling.

229
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,612
I'm trying

230
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,053
to fix up that house

231
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,413
so we can settle down here.

232
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:27,012
We'll hold off on buying saplings.

233
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:29,492
No problem. I'll gift you one.

234
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:30,612
No, no.

235
00:11:30,852 --> 00:11:31,372
Ms. Li.

236
00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:32,173
It's okay.

237
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:32,892
- Take it.
- I can't.

238
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,333
- It's auspicious.
- No. Well...

239
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,053
It's auspicious.

240
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:36,173
All the best.

241
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:37,492
It's auspicious?

242
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:38,532
Alright then.

243
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,772
Thank you, Ms. Li.

244
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:40,852
Desheng.

245
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:44,213
Do you truly want to settle down here?

246
00:11:44,492 --> 00:11:45,173
Of course.

247
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:46,693
Would you like some advice?

248
00:11:49,053 --> 00:11:49,413
Well...

249
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:52,532
That'd be nice.

250
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:54,012
I'm listening.

251
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:55,933
Be careful.

252
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:56,532
Go.

253
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:57,413
I'll go first.

254
00:11:57,652 --> 00:11:58,772
Yeah, tilt it.

255
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,213
Steady it from below.

256
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:00,892
Hold it steady.

257
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:01,413
Okay.

258
00:12:01,413 --> 00:12:02,012
Careful now.

259
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:02,973
Watch the table corner.

260
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,093
The corner. Slow down.

261
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:05,813
Yeah, keep going.

262
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:06,573
Keep going.

263
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:07,012
Slow down.

264
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:07,612
Careful.

265
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:08,132
The legs.

266
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:09,252
Be careful.

267
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:10,372
This table is precious.

268
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:11,173
Be careful.

269
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,372
You're not helping.

270
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,453
So be quiet.

271
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:14,732
Stop barking orders.

272
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:16,813
Zhiqiang is right.

273
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:17,213
Okay.

274
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,053
This table has seen many years.

275
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:22,372
Dad, you're just favoring him.

276
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:22,892
Watch it.

277
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:23,652
Zhiqiang.

278
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,293
Put it in the middle of the room.

279
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,053
We'll eat soon.

280
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:29,293
Got it, Dad.

281
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:31,413
Put the table in the center.

282
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:31,933
Desheng.

283
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:32,453
Got it.

284
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:32,973
Uncle.

285
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:33,973
Uncle Dongfu.

286
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:34,372
Desheng.

287
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,333
Hello, sis-in-law.

288
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:35,973
Give it to me.

289
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:36,973
Hello, Desheng.

290
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:38,093
Ma'am.

291
00:12:38,252 --> 00:12:39,012
Come on in.

292
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:40,652
Desheng, you're amazing.

293
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:41,772
You basically

294
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:44,252
moved all our family heirlooms over.

295
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:46,652
This door.

296
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,093
- And these windows.
- The windows.

297
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,453
I remember these.

298
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:53,652
How did you come up with this idea?

299
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:56,293
It wasn't my idea.

300
00:12:56,532 --> 00:12:58,892
Ms. Li suggested it.

301
00:12:59,173 --> 00:13:03,413
I moved the windowsills and door frames
from our old house.

302
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,132
It looks just like our old house, right?

303
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:07,693
Yeah.

304
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:11,612
Actually, Ms. Li

305
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:13,252
is very nice.

306
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:14,892
No airs about her.

307
00:13:15,453 --> 00:13:17,132
She's capable and hardworking.

308
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,252
Most importantly,
she truly cares about us.

309
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:21,612
Yeah.

310
00:13:22,053 --> 00:13:22,492
Yeah.

311
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:23,293
Right?

312
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:25,532
Lin, let me show you something.

313
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:27,732
This mark is my height at thirteen.

314
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,453
This is twelve, and this is ten.

315
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:30,852
This is from when I was eight.

316
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,693
"Serve the country loyally".

317
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:33,372
(Serve the country loyally)

318
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:34,372
I carved that too.

319
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,093
It was my childhood wish and ambition.

320
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:39,933
Zhiqiang, let's measure your height.

321
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:40,612
Okay.

322
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:41,612
Hold this.

323
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,293
You're quite tall.

324
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:45,772
Really?

325
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:47,132
You're almost my height,

326
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:48,492
maybe even taller.

327
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:49,612
Really?

328
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:51,372
Come on, guys.

329
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:52,453
Measure your height.

330
00:13:52,453 --> 00:13:52,952
Come on.

331
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:54,852
Me?

332
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,132
You're taller.

333
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:57,053
Tallest.

334
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:58,252
Come on, kiddo.

335
00:13:58,453 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm a bit shorter.

336
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:01,693
A bit shorter? You're a lot shorter.

337
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:03,892
You need nutrition.

338
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,132
Let me take a photo of you guys

339
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:07,772
with your uncle.

340
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,852
Let's take a photo.

341
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:09,453
Okay.

342
00:14:10,372 --> 00:14:11,413
Look over here.

343
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:13,532
Okay, one, two, three.

344
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:14,213
Done.

345
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:21,112
♪Ambition surges like the Yangtze♪

346
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:25,048
♪Great causes follow the Party's lead♪

347
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,599
♪Sweat soaks this passionate land♪

348
00:14:31,813 --> 00:14:34,772
Mr. Zheng, that design
might not be so good.

349
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,532
Xuemei, what a coincidence.

350
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:39,532
I was looking at the uniform

351
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:41,372
you designed for our city inspectors.

352
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:42,413
- Yeah.
- Good job.

353
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:43,132
Well done.

354
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:44,293
Don't mention it.

355
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,372
It's my duty as Xie's family member.

356
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,132
Here's the invitation

357
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:49,573
to the opening ceremony.

358
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:52,772
Best wishes for the grand opening.

359
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:55,096
(Invitation)

360
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:56,652
Well...

361
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:58,933
That's it.

362
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:01,293
Then I'll be going.

363
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:02,132
Take care.

364
00:15:02,293 --> 00:15:03,813
Alright, I won't see you out.

365
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:07,772
Xuemei.

366
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:11,173
Is something bothering you?

367
00:15:11,173 --> 00:15:13,093
Why are you sighing?

368
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:15,732
Come on, just tell me.

369
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:16,732
Take a seat.

370
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:17,933
Come on.

371
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,933
No wonder they say that you have eyes

372
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,413
that see everything.

373
00:15:22,693 --> 00:15:23,892
Stop flattering me.

374
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,053
Really, I mean it.

375
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:28,732
Let me be honest with you.

376
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:30,732
At this point,

377
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:33,213
our opening is our closing.

378
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:35,612
What do you mean?

379
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,213
Look, Mr. Zheng.

380
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:39,612
Back in Jiangku,

381
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:42,173
the factory was small with few workers.

382
00:15:42,612 --> 00:15:45,573
Having fewer orders
wasn't a problem for us.

383
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:47,933
But now we're in Yuehai.

384
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:50,252
With a bigger factory and more workers,

385
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,892
the orders can't keep up.

386
00:15:53,772 --> 00:15:54,612
To be honest.

387
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:56,612
The order I'm working on

388
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:58,372
is already the last one.

389
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,132
Then why are you opening?

390
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,573
We got the plot

391
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,372
and renovated everything.

392
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:04,732
We're ready to go.

393
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,293
What should I do?

394
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:11,173
What about the others?

395
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:13,813
Our factory is the biggest.

396
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:14,973
Even we can't hold up,

397
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:16,492
let alone the smaller ones.

398
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:19,012
Two have already closed down.

399
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:22,852
It's serious. Why didn't Xie tell me?

400
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:25,213
I asked him to tell you.

401
00:16:25,372 --> 00:16:26,413
But he said

402
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:29,532
that he must set an example as a cadre

403
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:32,173
and not bother the higher-ups
with private matters.

404
00:16:32,293 --> 00:16:33,973
But this isn't a private matter.

405
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:36,732
Xie should have told me.

406
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:38,053
He lacks awareness...

407
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:40,213
Wasn't Changyuan helping you get orders?

408
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,813
Yeah, Changyuan does know many clients.

409
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:45,333
But the costs were low
back in the countryside.

410
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:46,813
Now the costs are higher.

411
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:48,772
And the order hasn't kept up.

412
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:50,132
So...

413
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,293
Alright, I see.

414
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:54,973
You have extra mouths to feed,
but your income hasn't increased.

415
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,333
Right? Is that it?

416
00:16:56,453 --> 00:16:57,892
Yeah, that's it.

417
00:16:58,173 --> 00:17:00,213
Alright, I'll figure something out.

418
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:01,892
That's great.

419
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:05,173
With your word, I feel relieved.

420
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,772
Okay, no problem. Leave it to me.

421
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:09,893
How much is it?

422
00:17:10,092 --> 00:17:10,973
Fifty cents each.

423
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:11,613
Fifty cents?

424
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:12,853
Mr. Zheng.

425
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:14,572
Mr. Zheng.

426
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,092
Mr. Tan, what's wrong?

427
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:19,052
Didn't I give you 90 yuan
for reception expenses?

428
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:20,933
You didn't write a receipt.

429
00:17:21,052 --> 00:17:22,532
I'll do it once I'm back.

430
00:17:22,532 --> 00:17:23,772
Financial regulations.

431
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:24,693
Come on.

432
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:25,693
Have a cigarette.

433
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:26,492
No, no.

434
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:27,052
Come on.

435
00:17:27,052 --> 00:17:27,693
Come on.

436
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:28,812
- I can't.
- Have one.

437
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:30,252
I'll spend as little as possible

438
00:17:30,532 --> 00:17:31,653
and return the rest to you.

439
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:32,613
Okay.

440
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,360
(Zheng Decheng)

441
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:37,893
Mr. Zheng, one more thing.

442
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:39,572
Ms. Gao

443
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,173
is holding
the factory opening ceremony today.

444
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:45,492
Isn't Ms. Li there?

445
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:46,772
Yeah.

446
00:17:55,853 --> 00:17:56,732
Go wait for me.

447
00:17:57,973 --> 00:17:58,893
Get going.

448
00:17:58,893 --> 00:18:00,213
Something I shouldn't hear?

449
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:01,012
Seriously.

450
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:02,973
Here, take your ticket.

451
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:08,413
What's wrong?

452
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,173
Got a problem with Ms. Li?

453
00:18:10,373 --> 00:18:10,933
It's not that.

454
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,572
I don't have a problem with her.

455
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,453
Let me make it clear.

456
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:15,933
I'm definitely

457
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,653
not talking behind anyone's back, okay?

458
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,572
Got it, just spit it out.

459
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,653
I-I just want to say

460
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:24,572
that Gao Xuemei's factory has a problem.

461
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:25,812
What problem?

462
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:28,732
She's hired over 20 workers.

463
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,492
What's wrong with it?

464
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:31,613
I...

465
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,532
Have you forgotten? Back in 1981,

466
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:35,224
the State Council issued a document.

467
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:37,693
Policies and regulations
on non-agricultural

468
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:39,373
self-employment in urban areas.

469
00:18:40,812 --> 00:18:41,373
That one.

470
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:44,092
I remember now.

471
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:47,052
It's the policy

472
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:49,933
that self-employed individuals
can only hire seven workers?

473
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:51,453
That's it.

474
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:52,332
Oh no.

475
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,893
T-This is troublesome.

476
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:58,572
The other factories?

477
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,572
They haven't opened yet.

478
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:02,173
But they're preparing for it.

479
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,252
Once they open,

480
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:07,052
they'll all face this issue
to some degree.

481
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:09,413
More factories mean bigger problems.

482
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,492
Why worry before it happens?

483
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:13,693
Let them open first, and then we'll see.

484
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:15,213
Getting factories running

485
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:16,703
is the top priority.

486
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:17,373
You understand?

487
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:19,772
Come here, let me tell you.

488
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,413
Let them open the factories, right?

489
00:19:22,853 --> 00:19:23,492
After that,

490
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:26,133
survey each factory thoroughly.

491
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,213
Tally the worker count.

492
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:29,693
Then draft me a report.

493
00:19:30,092 --> 00:19:30,492
Okay.

494
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:32,292
Make the report detailed.

495
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:35,413
Take your time. Cover everything.

496
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:37,413
Stop nodding.

497
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:38,332
Do you understand?

498
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:39,693
Yeah, you want a report.

499
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:40,853
I'll document

500
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:42,092
every piece of data.

501
00:19:42,173 --> 00:19:43,613
But then what?

502
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,572
Then... Watch me.

503
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:53,052
I'm watching. Go on.

504
00:19:54,492 --> 00:19:55,413
What am I doing?

505
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:57,973
I got it.

506
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,693
Turning a blind eye.

507
00:19:59,693 --> 00:20:01,453
You have to make me spell it out?

508
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:02,613
But I...

509
00:20:02,653 --> 00:20:03,653
Go back and tell Xie.

510
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:05,453
Only six workers

511
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,373
are allowed at the opening ceremony.

512
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:09,373
Not one more.

513
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:14,732
Bottoms up.

514
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:16,173
Mr. Zheng.

515
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:17,373
This liquor

516
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:18,413
is top-notch.

517
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:19,012
Towel.

518
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,373
Don't bother.

519
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,492
I'll take care of him.

520
00:20:21,492 --> 00:20:22,292
One more.

521
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:23,653
Come on, one more.

522
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:24,613
I'll go first.

523
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:25,653
Fill it up.

524
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:27,133
In that case...

525
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:28,092
Fill it up.

526
00:20:28,732 --> 00:20:29,492
Fill it up.

527
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:31,772
You're coming to Yuehai
with such sincerity.

528
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:32,853
As the Secretary,

529
00:20:33,213 --> 00:20:35,492
I must welcome you
with equal sincerity, right?

530
00:20:35,532 --> 00:20:36,413
I'll fill mine too.

531
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:36,973
How?

532
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:37,592
Like this.

533
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:38,853
I'll fill mine too.

534
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:40,572
With this, right?

535
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:41,572
A full cup.

536
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:42,693
Here we go.

537
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:43,933
Towel, Mr. Zheng.

538
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:45,292
Come on.

539
00:20:45,572 --> 00:20:46,133
Mr. Zheng.

540
00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:46,732
Fill it up.

541
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:47,173
Come on.

542
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:47,933
Come on.

543
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:48,772
Come on.

544
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:50,173
You sure can hold your liquor.

545
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:51,732
I'll drink.

546
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,693
I must toast you with my full heart.

547
00:20:56,732 --> 00:20:58,173
Keep it steady.

548
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:01,453
I'm not drunk yet. Keep pouring.

549
00:21:01,572 --> 00:21:03,413
My stomach's a bit empty.

550
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:04,413
Easy.

551
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:05,373
I can drink more.

552
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:06,812
I'm not drunk.

553
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:07,453
Yeah.

554
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:08,133
You...

555
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:10,453
Be careful.

556
00:21:10,732 --> 00:21:11,973
Easy...

557
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:13,133
See? You're drunk.

558
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:13,853
Well...

559
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:15,693
Well...

560
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:17,613
Slow down.

561
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:19,453
D-Don't hold me.

562
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:21,532
Listen to me.

563
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,012
We drank well.

564
00:21:24,213 --> 00:21:24,653
Yeah.

565
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,653
He's a good leader.

566
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:27,572
Yeah.

567
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:28,772
Straightforward.

568
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:31,893
In your local lingo, it's "absolutely".

569
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:34,613
Mr. Zheng.

570
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:36,973
I like you.

571
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:39,492
I like you.

572
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:41,693
Let's do this again.

573
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:45,173
We'll drink again till we're wasted.

574
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:46,052
Absolutely.

575
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:46,613
Absolutely.

576
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:47,653
Give me a hug.

577
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:50,133
I drank on an empty stomach.

578
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:51,133
We'll drink again

579
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:51,812
after the food.

580
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:52,492
No problem.

581
00:21:52,532 --> 00:21:53,252
We'll drink.

582
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:55,288
See you tomorrow.

583
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:55,973
I'm off.

584
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:57,453
Let's go.

585
00:21:58,052 --> 00:21:59,693
See you tomorrow. You hear me?

586
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,572
See you tomorrow in Yuehai.

587
00:22:02,213 --> 00:22:03,532
- Heard you.
- Absolutely.

588
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,173
Tomorrow.

589
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:05,092
Yuehai.

590
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:05,572
Yuehai.

591
00:22:05,653 --> 00:22:05,973
Okay.

592
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:06,812
See you in Yuehai.

593
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:07,653
You must come.

594
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:08,413
Absolutely.

595
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:09,732
Alright, let's go.

596
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:11,052
We'll drink in Yuehai.

597
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:11,853
Bye.

598
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:13,772
Take it easy.

599
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:14,328
Be careful.

600
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:15,732
Be careful.

601
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:16,653
Hold him.

602
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:18,173
Slowly.

603
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:23,252
Mr. Zheng, are you okay?

604
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:24,173
I'm fine.

605
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:25,933
Just a bit dizzy.

606
00:22:26,252 --> 00:22:27,012
Get me some tea.

607
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:27,772
Okay.

608
00:22:30,613 --> 00:22:32,133
Was the money

609
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:33,973
enough for the bill earlier?

610
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:35,213
I can top it up.

611
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:36,732
It's okay. It wasn't much.

612
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:37,613
- Forget it.
- No.

613
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:38,613
I have to pay you.

614
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:39,812
Absolutely.

615
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:41,112
We'll settle it later.

616
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:42,893
How did I end up

617
00:22:42,933 --> 00:22:44,812
talking with a full Northeast accent?

618
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:47,373
"Absolutely", "no problem".
It all just came out.

619
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:49,012
Their way of talking is infectious.

620
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:52,772
Those folks from the Northeast...

621
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:55,133
Mr. Zheng, why didn't you

622
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:56,853
use the towel I handed you?

623
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:58,933
I did use it.

624
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:01,052
Didn't I wipe the sweat off?

625
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:03,613
The towel wasn't for that.

626
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:06,532
It was for you

627
00:23:06,572 --> 00:23:09,092
to spit out the drink
when they weren't looking.

628
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:12,653
I can't do that. Don't do that again.

629
00:23:12,693 --> 00:23:13,336
So embarrassing.

630
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,012
It's not like I can't drink.

631
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:15,942
You...

632
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:18,453
It makes you look insincere.

633
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:19,133
Don't do that.

634
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:21,572
But you shouldn't drink like that.
It's bad for your health.

635
00:23:21,572 --> 00:23:22,213
Still no.

636
00:23:22,532 --> 00:23:22,853
Yeah.

637
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,373
Never do that again.

638
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:27,893
Mr. Zheng, you're truly impressive.

639
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,133
One versus Northeast Five.

640
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:31,853
You could really hold your liquor.

641
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:41,413
I'll tell you the truth too.

642
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:43,693
Listen, I went to

643
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:46,572
throw up in the bathroom twice

644
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:50,373
and went back to drinking with them.

645
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:53,453
There was only one thought in my head.

646
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:54,653
I had to

647
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:56,693
hang in there.

648
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:58,413
I had to make it

649
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,092
and take them down.

650
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,492
Yeah, you got them.

651
00:24:02,092 --> 00:24:03,133
- I did?
- You did.

652
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:03,572
Yeah.

653
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:04,453
Good to know.

654
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:05,012
Here.

655
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:06,732
Thank you.

656
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,092
Thank you.

657
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:09,933
Here.

658
00:24:10,772 --> 00:24:12,092
Have some tea to sober up.

659
00:24:12,413 --> 00:24:12,853
Here.

660
00:24:14,332 --> 00:24:14,853

00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:19,252
Okay.

663
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:22,693
Hot.

664
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:24,853

666
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:32,933
Tastes good.

667
00:24:34,492 --> 00:24:36,693
D-Did he agree to go to Yuehai?

668
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:39,133
Yeah, he did.

669
00:24:39,373 --> 00:24:40,373
That's good.

670
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:45,572
If they go to our printery in Yuehai,

671
00:24:46,453 --> 00:24:48,732
that will be our first step
towards victory.

672
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:49,973
Yeah.

673
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,012

769
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:10,332
Quiet now.

770
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,312
Let's warmly celebrate

771
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:14,933
the grand opening of Chunmei Printery.

772
00:28:15,213 --> 00:28:16,252
May their business thrive.

773
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:18,572
Alright.

774
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:20,973
Alright.

775
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,973
May your business thrive.

776
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:53,332
Stand closer together.

777
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:54,492
Yeah.

778
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:55,413
Alright.

779
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:58,332
Everyone, stand near Ms. Li.

780
00:28:58,413 --> 00:28:58,893
Closer.

781
00:28:58,933 --> 00:28:59,812
Okay, look this way.

782
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:01,292
Everyone, smile.

783
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:03,173
Okay, one, two, three.

784
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:06,413
Happy grand opening.

785
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:12,613
That's it.

786
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:13,292
Looks good.

787
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:14,252
Get it for my opening.

788
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:15,653
Sure thing.

789
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:17,973
Make yourselves at home.

790
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:19,012
Feel free to look around.

791
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:21,332
Take a seat.

792
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,893
Have a seat.

793
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:24,332
You know...

794
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:25,812
Look after everyone.

795
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,133
I'm going to change.

796
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:28,933
What for? I even forgot your gloves.

797
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:30,173
Put them on now.

798
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:31,012
I'm in a hurry.

799
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:31,960
Let me get changed.

800
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:33,092
We've taken the photos.

801
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:34,168
Look after everyone.

802
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:34,973
Stop showing off.

803
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:37,012
I...

804
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:39,532
Have some water.

805
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:40,373
Ms. Li.

806
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:41,973
I think it's about time.

807
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:42,772
Let's get going.

808
00:29:43,252 --> 00:29:44,012
Go back first.

809
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:45,772
I need to talk to Xuemei later.

810
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:50,292
Xie.

811
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:03,213
Coming right away. I got this.

812
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:08,973
Go ahead.

813
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:10,812
Have some water.

814
00:30:11,772 --> 00:30:12,732
This is so nice.

815
00:30:12,732 --> 00:30:13,453
Very impressive.

816
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:14,213
The light.

817
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:15,092
So luxurious.

818
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:16,853
Make yourselves comfortable.

819
00:30:20,012 --> 00:30:20,893
"I got this."

820
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:22,893
What does she mean?

821
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:24,252
What does she know?

822
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:29,653
You got changed.

823
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:30,853
It's more elegant.

824
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:31,772
You look good.

825
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:33,532
Mr. Xie, I've been waiting for you.

826
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:34,812
My factory is opening soon.

827
00:30:35,092 --> 00:30:36,572
The water issue is still pending.

828
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:38,052
Still? It's been so long.

829
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:38,772
Have a look.

830
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:39,413
Please.

831
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:40,292
But I'm busy here.

832
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:40,653
You...

833
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:41,173
I'm busy.

834
00:30:41,252 --> 00:30:41,772
Please.

835
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:42,572
- See you.
- Honey.

836
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:44,173
Honey. Ms. Li.

837
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:45,373
Before 6:00 PM.

838
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:46,853
Auspicious.

839
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:47,853
Ms. Li.

840
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:51,812
Ms. Li, the workers are here.

841
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:53,492
Okay, thank you.

842
00:30:53,772 --> 00:30:54,092
What?

843
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,853
Ms. Gao, the town government

844
00:30:56,092 --> 00:30:57,653
is giving you an opening gift.

845
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,252
We'll install a telephone line for you.

846
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:03,613
That's great!

847
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:05,133
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

848
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,332
I've been waiting day and night,

849
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:08,933
and finally, we have a telephone.

850
00:31:09,373 --> 00:31:10,532
How can I ever thank you?

851
00:31:10,613 --> 00:31:11,933
You're truly a timely rain,

852
00:31:12,213 --> 00:31:13,332
a godsend.

853
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:14,532
Where would you

854
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:15,973
like the phone installed?

855
00:31:16,213 --> 00:31:17,613
- Come here.
- Okay.

856
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:18,613
I have it in mind.

857
00:31:18,653 --> 00:31:19,213
Come on.

858
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:19,893
Thank you.

859
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:20,492
Over here.

860
00:31:20,853 --> 00:31:22,052
Right here.

861
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:23,133
That corner.

862
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:24,933
- Alright.
- The little table.

863
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:25,332
Okay.

864
00:31:25,413 --> 00:31:25,933
Okay.

865
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:28,653
Ms. Li.

866
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:30,373
Thank you so much.

867
00:31:30,732 --> 00:31:32,572
I've been to the post office
countless times.

868
00:31:32,572 --> 00:31:34,012
But the lines are endless.

869
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:36,252
Only the town government
could get this done.

870
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:38,693
Wonderful.

871
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:40,373
Sir.

872
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:42,492
Ms. Gao, we've checked.

873
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:44,853
The wiring needs to come from the back.

874
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:46,853
Your house is big. Wiring's tricky.

875
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:48,213
So...

876
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,213
Could you spare some hands to help us?

877
00:31:50,653 --> 00:31:51,332
No problem.

878
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:52,092
Xiaoyu.

879
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:53,052
Hurry.

880
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:55,092
Find some workers to help run the wires.

881
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:56,532
Please follow me.

882
00:31:56,732 --> 00:31:58,012
Go with her.

883
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:58,893
Thank you.

884
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:00,772
Sir.

885
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:01,853
Over here.

886
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:02,693
Okay.

887
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:03,933
Come on.

888
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:04,332
Sir.

889
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:06,413
Just tell me if you need

890
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:06,933
more help.

891
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:07,832
That's enough.

892
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:08,732
Okay.

893
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:09,453
Take it slow.

894
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:10,812
Be careful.

895
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:11,893
Yeah, keep up.

896
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:12,693
Keep up.

897
00:32:13,173 --> 00:32:13,772
Keep up.

898
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:15,812
Such a long line

899
00:32:16,173 --> 00:32:17,012
catches a big fish.

900
00:32:17,772 --> 00:32:18,933
It's auspicious.

901
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:19,613
Come on.

902
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:20,613
Easy now.

903
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:21,693
Watch your step.

904
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:23,012
Slow down.

905
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:24,693
Keep up.

906
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:26,772
What a long cable.

907
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,572
It means big business.

908
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:38,693
Be careful.

909
00:32:38,772 --> 00:32:39,532
Okay.

910
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:40,213
Ms. Gao,

911
00:32:41,213 --> 00:32:42,252
you've got many workers.

912
00:32:42,532 --> 00:32:43,173
Ms. Li.

913
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:46,332
We need workers to expand the business.

914
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:49,173
Supporting over 20 people isn't easy.

915
00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:50,373
Oh, Xiaoyu.

916
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:52,133
Tell them to make extra dishes.

917
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:54,052
- Okay.
- Ms. Li, stay for lunch.

918
00:32:54,092 --> 00:32:56,092
Our cook makes excellent food.

919
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:57,373
I have work to do.

920
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:58,092
Next time.

921
00:32:58,292 --> 00:32:59,933
But it's mealtime, anyway.

922
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:00,933
Don't be shy.

923
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:02,252
Ms. Gao,

924
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:03,492
you said

925
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:05,453
you have over 20 workers?

926
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:07,292
Of course.

927
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,532
Paying them all is tough.

928
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:12,252
I have to go.

929
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:14,772
Are you in a rush?

930
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:16,893
- Ms. Li.
- Wait for me.

931
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:17,853
Slow down.

932
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:18,973
Bye, Ms. Gao.

933
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:20,012
Take care.

934
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,413
Visit often, Ms. Li.

935
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:31,332
Qiuping, I found it.

936
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:33,133
(Dongjiang Government Document)
This was

937
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:34,973
issued on July 7, 1981.

938
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:36,332
Turn to Article 5.

939
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:38,092
Read me the specifics.

940
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:41,368
Self-employed businesses

941
00:33:41,732 --> 00:33:44,092
are generally operated
by one person or a family.

942
00:33:44,532 --> 00:33:45,213
When necessary,

943
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:47,772
with the approval of the AIC,

944
00:33:48,173 --> 00:33:50,252
they can hire one or two assistants.

945
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:53,532
Businesses with
advanced or special technology

946
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:54,812
may take on two to three,

947
00:33:55,213 --> 00:33:56,772
but no more than five apprentices.

948
00:33:57,332 --> 00:34:00,332
Contracts must be established
for both assistants and apprentices,

949
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:02,373
specifying both parties'
rights, obligations,

950
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,812
term, and compensation.

951
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:05,492
Contracts must be certified

952
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:08,012
by the local Administration
for Industry and Commerce.

953
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:10,132
Zhang, a few newspapers

954
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:12,853
had articles related to hiring quotas.

955
00:34:12,973 --> 00:34:14,012
Could you find them?

956
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:15,052
Sure.

957
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:23,052
Qiuping, I found them.

958
00:34:23,572 --> 00:34:24,492
I took a look.

959
00:34:24,893 --> 00:34:27,000
Those who violated
these employment regulations

960
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,253
faced serious penalties.

961
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:29,933
Some were even arrested.

962
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:31,773
That serious?

963
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:36,072
Zhang,

964
00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:38,572
make a few copies of these newspapers.

965
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:40,853
Take them to the bus to Yuehai.

966
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:43,973
There should be one in about an hour.

967
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:45,212
I need them today.

968
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:45,973
Okay.

969
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,492
Thank you very much.

970
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:57,532
Mr. Tan.

971
00:34:59,893 --> 00:35:02,333
Mr. Tan, are you aware of this document?

972
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:09,333
No, I've never heard of it.

973
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:09,893
What is this?

974
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:11,333
It was issued in 1981.

975
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:13,813
Policies for non-agricultural
self-employed individuals.

976
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:17,733
It sets hiring quotas
for self-employed individuals.

977
00:35:18,572 --> 00:35:21,132
I went to Gao Xuemei's factory
to install a phone.

978
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:23,973
She has over 20 workers there.

979
00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:25,453
Xie...

980
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:27,212
What?

981
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:31,733
Xie... I...

982
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:33,453
Here's the thing.

983
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,212
Xie is a deputy mayor.

984
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:36,532
So we often remind him,

985
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:38,453
"Your wife runs this factory.

986
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:40,373
You must be careful
not to violate regulations."

987
00:35:40,373 --> 00:35:42,052
None of you knew about this?

988
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:43,612
We had no idea.

989
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,092
I didn't know.

990
00:35:45,172 --> 00:35:46,293
Does Mr. Zheng know?

991
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:47,973
Mr. Zheng...

992
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:50,212
Mr. Zheng...

993
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:51,853
Mr. Zheng.

994
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:53,293
If he knew,

995
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,373
he would have reminded us, right?

996
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,293
So I figure he didn't know.

997
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:58,413
Mr. Tan.

998
00:35:59,212 --> 00:36:00,532
To be safe,

999
00:36:01,212 --> 00:36:03,172
we should take immediate measures.

1000
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,092
Well, Ms. Li.

1001
00:36:06,132 --> 00:36:07,893
What measures do you suggest?

1002
00:36:08,212 --> 00:36:09,528
I think we should notify

1003
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:11,413
Gao Xuemei to suspend all work

1004
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:14,373
and wait to speak with Mr. Zheng first.

1005
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:14,933
Yeah.

1006
00:36:15,212 --> 00:36:17,052
But if we shut it down...

1007
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:18,692
Ms. Li, I think

1008
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:20,733
you may have to reconsider this issue.

1009
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:22,132
Because shutting them down

1010
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:23,733
is not feasible.

1011
00:36:23,813 --> 00:36:24,933
It would be too abrupt

1012
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,733
without a buffer period, right?

1013
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:27,492
In that case,

1014
00:36:27,692 --> 00:36:28,572
they might...

1015
00:36:28,572 --> 00:36:29,773
Mr. Tan.

1016
00:36:29,973 --> 00:36:30,572
Take it easy.

1017
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:32,092
You just said

1018
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:34,052
that Mr. Zheng didn't take action

1019
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,052
because he didn't know
about this document.

1020
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:38,733
- Yeah.
- But now we do.

1021
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:41,092
And we know the serious implications.

1022
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:43,692
We can't just sit back and do nothing.

1023
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:45,692
We absolutely can't gamble on luck.

1024
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:47,532
- Right?
- Absolutely not.

1025
00:36:48,612 --> 00:36:49,373
How about this?

1026
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:57,413
Meng.

1027
00:36:58,612 --> 00:36:59,012
Meng.

1028
00:36:59,132 --> 00:36:59,853
Wait.

1029
00:37:00,692 --> 00:37:01,373
Do me a favor.

1030
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,973
Go to the printery and tell Gao Xuemei

1031
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:05,132
to suspend operations

1032
00:37:05,212 --> 00:37:06,492
and await further instructions.

1033
00:37:07,212 --> 00:37:08,373
And give her this.

1034
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:09,532
Tell her it's from me.

1035
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:10,733
Explain to her.

1036
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:13,293
I'm doing this for her and Yuehai.

1037
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:14,253
Got it.

1038
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:19,452
Meng, where are you going?

1039
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:20,172
What's the rush?

1040
00:37:20,612 --> 00:37:22,813
Ms. Li sent me to deliver a notice
to Chunmei Printery.

1041
00:37:23,212 --> 00:37:23,933
Let us tag along.

1042
00:37:24,012 --> 00:37:24,652
We need to

1043
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:25,492
fix our outfits.

1044
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:26,172
Too big.

1045
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:27,253
Sure, then.

1046
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,172
Ms. Gao, this order is finished.

1047
00:37:31,212 --> 00:37:32,632
When will we get the next order?

1048
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:33,773
Listen.

1049
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:35,212
If we don't get more work soon,

1050
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,373
I'll shut that machine off.

1051
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:37,572
Watch your step.

1052
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:39,933
Stack them neatly, or they won't fit.

1053
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:41,893
Be careful.

1054
00:37:42,413 --> 00:37:43,933
Listen to Mr. Jin.

1055
00:37:43,973 --> 00:37:44,813
Stack them neatly.

1056
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:47,893
Mom, the phone's ringing.

1057
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:49,253
Phone call.

1058
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:50,612
I'll get it.

1059
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:52,492
Come back. I got this.

1060
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:54,692
Make sure they stack them neatly.

1061
00:37:58,413 --> 00:37:59,532
Phone call.

1062
00:38:01,132 --> 00:38:01,813
Hello?

1063
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:04,212
Mr. Zheng.

1064
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:05,652
Well,

1065
00:38:05,813 --> 00:38:08,092
the phone was just installed
and you're calling already.

1066
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:11,012
What?

1067
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:12,333
They're coming?

1068
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:14,333
Great.

1069
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:16,092
I happen to have some great liquor

1070
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:17,092
for them.

1071
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:18,172
Okay.

1072
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:21,692
Mr. Jin.

1073
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:23,773
Mr. Jin, come here.

1074
00:38:23,973 --> 00:38:24,572
Coming.

1075
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,052
Keep the machine running.

1076
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:27,000
We've got work.

1077
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:28,773
- Great!
- Right?

1078
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:30,492
Learn to adjust the equipment

1079
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:31,933
from your master.

1080
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:32,853
Teach her.

1081
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:33,813
Okay.

1082
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:35,492
- What's wrong?
- Ms. Gao.

1083
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:37,973
A town government cadre
is looking for you.

1084
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:38,813
Who is it?

1085
00:38:42,012 --> 00:38:42,453
Ms. Gao.

1086
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:43,212
Meng.

1087
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:45,092
Why are you back here? What is it?

1088
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:46,973
Ms. Li sent me to tell you

1089
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:48,572
to suspend all your work.

1090
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:51,773
And she asked me

1091
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:53,692
to give you this note.

1092
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:56,973
Suspend work?

1093
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:58,773
Why? She's shutting us down?

1094
00:38:58,813 --> 00:38:59,933
I don't know why.

1095
00:39:00,453 --> 00:39:02,532
She sent me to inform you.

1096
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:03,773
Go to work.

1097
00:39:03,813 --> 00:39:05,293
But she's telling us to shut down.

1098
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:06,293
Get back to work.

1099
00:39:06,453 --> 00:39:08,052
Did Ms. Li say anything else?

1100
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,333
She told me to give you this note.

1101
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,293
And she told me to tell you

1102
00:39:15,612 --> 00:39:17,973
that she's doing it for you and Yuehai.

1103
00:39:20,052 --> 00:39:21,532
Alright, I see.

1104
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:22,572
Thank you.

1105
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,853
- Is it for real?
- Enough.

1106
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:26,045
We're suspending all work.

1107
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,172
Enough. Go ahead.

1108
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,012
Go on.

1109
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:31,544
Go ahead.

1110
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:32,333
Ms. Gao.

1111
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:33,253
Ms. Gao.

1112
00:39:34,612 --> 00:39:35,652
When will we resume work?

1113
00:39:35,813 --> 00:39:36,733
Why are we shut down?

1114
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,328
And nothing is

1115
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:39,132
- for sure.
- Easy.

1116
00:39:39,612 --> 00:39:40,612
Let me explain.

1117
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:41,172
Yeah.

1118
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,652
We need to know.

1119
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:44,172
What's going on here?

1120
00:39:44,973 --> 00:39:45,813
We need to work.

1121
00:39:45,893 --> 00:39:46,413
Right?

1122
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:47,773
What's wrong?

1123
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:48,773
What happened?

1124
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:50,200
Why did you come in?

1125
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:51,933
We heard the noise.

1126
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:52,813
Who are they?

1127
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:53,492
So many people.

1128
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:54,293
Who are they?

1129
00:39:54,612 --> 00:39:55,492
What's going on?

1130
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:56,413
So many people.

1131
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:57,293
Why did you come in?

1132
00:39:57,293 --> 00:39:57,893
Who are they?

1133
00:39:58,253 --> 00:39:59,413
They're city inspectors.

1134
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:00,492
The cadres sent

1135
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:01,532
the city inspectors

1136
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,652
to shut us down.

1137
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:03,733
Why are you

1138
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:04,532
shutting us down?

1139
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:06,212
Get out.

1140
00:40:06,253 --> 00:40:06,773
No.

1141
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:08,532
Get out.

1142
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,652
Get out.

1143
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:10,373
Calm down.

1144
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:12,212
Stop it.

1145
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:13,293
Watch them.

1146
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:14,172
I'll find Ms. Li

1147
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:15,692
at the office.

1148
00:40:17,652 --> 00:40:20,052
Mr. Tan, this is serious.

1149
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,453
These are the consequences.

1150
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,052
Mind your conduct.

1151
00:40:28,413 --> 00:40:29,012
Ms. Li.

1152
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:30,933
Ms. Li.

1153
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:32,212
It's bad.

1154
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:35,052
They're fighting at the printery.

1155
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:36,333
They're fighting?

1156
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:38,692
Ms. Li.

1157
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,212
What happened?

1158
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:43,293
Nothing.

1159
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:44,733
What happened?

1160
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,373
Let's go see.

1161
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:46,253
Let's go.

1162
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:49,933
Mr. Zheng.

1163
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:51,453
Well...

1164
00:40:52,413 --> 00:40:53,092
I hope

1165
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,373
your factory's production

1166
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,373
matches your drinking capacity.

1167
00:40:59,652 --> 00:41:00,733
Rest assured.

1168
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,132
Even though Yuehai is newly built,

1169
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:06,172
we use top-notch machinery.

1170
00:41:06,612 --> 00:41:07,212
That is...

1171
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:21,012
Is this seasickness or drunkenness?

1172
00:41:21,293 --> 00:41:22,092
Seasickness.

1173
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,172
Definitely seasickness.

1174
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:25,933
You know how much Mr. Zheng drinks.

1175
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:26,532
Yeah.

1176
00:41:26,572 --> 00:41:27,692
Mr. Zheng meant to say

1177
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:30,172
that our printing machines
are the latest model.

1178
00:41:30,692 --> 00:41:31,453
The latest.

1179
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:33,092
You know what?

1180
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:35,172
The price matters the most.

1181
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:45,453
Why are you fighting?

1182
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,092
Stop it.

1183
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:48,132
Calm down.

1184
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,092
Let's talk.

1185
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:49,572
Stop it.

1186
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,492
Let's talk.

1187
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:51,733
You...

1188
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:52,413
Come on.

1189
00:41:52,532 --> 00:41:53,652
Come on. Hurry.

1190
00:41:53,893 --> 00:41:54,453
Calm down.

1191
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:57,492
Stop it.

1192
00:41:58,172 --> 00:41:58,733
Come on.

1193
00:41:58,733 --> 00:41:59,853
Calm down. Okay?

1194
00:42:00,092 --> 00:42:00,692
Let's talk.

1195
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:01,293
Step aside.

1196
00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:02,253
- Step back.
- Make way.

1197
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,453
- What's going on, Ms. Li?
- Ms. Gao.

1198
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:06,733
Did you really send them
to shut us down?

1199
00:42:06,773 --> 00:42:08,012
Did you get the note?

1200
00:42:08,132 --> 00:42:08,733
What?

1201
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:11,172
Your factory must pause operations.

1202
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:12,532
On what grounds?

1203
00:42:13,172 --> 00:42:14,933
You're such a pretty young lady.

1204
00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:16,293
But this isn't a pretty move.

1205
00:42:16,692 --> 00:42:17,333
What happened?

1206
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:18,172
How did it happen?

1207
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:19,933
We wanted to fix our clothes.

1208
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:21,373
Then they started fighting.

1209
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,253
We went in

1210
00:42:22,453 --> 00:42:24,052
and they attacked us.

1211
00:42:24,092 --> 00:42:24,733
Seriously?

1212
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:26,572
And you.

1213
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,373
Why did you bring them?

1214
00:42:28,532 --> 00:42:29,733
I heard there was a fight.

1215
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,132
So I brought some people.

1216
00:42:31,172 --> 00:42:32,132
That's unnecessary.

1217
00:42:32,813 --> 00:42:34,212
What a total mess.

1218
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:37,333
Xie.

1219
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:39,172
Xie.

1220
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:40,893
Xie.

1221
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:42,172
You're finally back.

1222
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,853
This is serious.

1223
00:42:44,572 --> 00:42:45,092
Look.

1224
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:46,212
They heard about the fight.

1225
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:47,052
Take a look.

1226
00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:49,132
Ms. Li brought all these people

1227
00:42:49,492 --> 00:42:50,172
to shut us down.

1228
00:42:50,172 --> 00:42:50,692
Your eye.

1229
00:42:50,893 --> 00:42:51,492
What about it?

1230
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:52,212
It's red.

1231
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:52,973
Red?

1232
00:42:53,373 --> 00:42:54,293
It doesn't matter.

1233
00:42:54,492 --> 00:42:56,132
They're shutting us down.

1234
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:56,856
Who did this?

1235
00:42:57,532 --> 00:42:58,453
- They did.
