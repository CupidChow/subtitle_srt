=Episode 36=

16
00:01:39,436 --> 00:01:41,976
I was planning to sign the contract
with Yang Xiaohai tomorrow.

17
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:43,757
What?

18
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:47,236
Wang Lili has decided to go to Nanzhou.

19
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:49,796
Why?

20
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:52,837
Didn't you give her the blank contract?

21
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:55,117
Did she make any outrageous demand?

22
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:58,917
Not really. But Yuehai
can't meet her demand.

23
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:01,677
Like what?

24
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,117
A bigger stage.

25
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:09,837
So she thinks Yuehai
isn't big and good enough.

26
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:13,077
Maybe

27
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:15,716
I'll go talk to her.

28
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:35,476
Alright. Any other issues?

29
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:39,317
If not, we'll

30
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:40,957
listen to the mayor's hotline.

31
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,797
Ms. Li, hello. I want to ask

32
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:49,876
whether Yuehai can build
some star-rated hotels.

33
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:53,716
Every time we receive important clients,
we can't arrange their accommodation.

34
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,316
Forget about star-rated hotels,

35
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,397
we don't even have space
to build regular hotels now.

36
00:02:59,837 --> 00:03:01,077
They all want land.

37
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:03,277
There's not a plot left.

38
00:03:04,277 --> 00:03:04,920
Li.

39
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:07,414
Write up a land-use application.

40
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:08,677
Make it comprehensive.

41
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:10,916
When I go
to the county office to report,

42
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:12,636
I'll talk to Mr. Xia about it.

43
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:13,716
Okay.

44
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:15,517
Play the next one.

45
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:16,036
Okay.

46
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:19,916
Ms. Li, it's Wang Lili.

47
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,237
I know you must be very sad
that I'm going to Nanzhou.

48
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:26,168
But I'm not leaving
because Yuehai or you

49
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:27,196
aren't good.

50
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:29,077
But the world is big.

51
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:31,117
I shouldn't just stay in Yuehai.

52
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:34,077
You told me that I'm a genius.

53
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,196
I deserve a better stage, don't I?

54
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:40,344
Qiuping,

55
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:43,397
I'd like to invite you to dinner tonight
at the Super Dog.

56
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,916
Must come, okay?

57
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,036
She is really something.

58
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:50,997
She bullies Ms. Li and acts righteous.

59
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:53,957
Exactly! This Wang Lili
is way out of line.

60
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,117
Don't go! Why should you go?

61
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:58,237
How dare she bullies Ms. Li.

62
00:03:58,557 --> 00:03:59,517
It's really outrageous.

63
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:04,036
Ms. Li, don't take it to heart.

64
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,117
Talented people
are always proud and insolent.

65
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:25,516
Ms. Li, don't take it to heart.

66
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:26,756
Life will teach her a lesson.

67
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:33,876
Hello.

68
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,037
Hello, Lili.

69
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:37,797
Qiuping.

70
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:39,797
I won't go to the Super Dog.

71
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:42,117
But we still need to eat.

72
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,480
Just come over.

73
00:04:43,946 --> 00:04:45,557
I'll treat you to a meal in our canteen.

74
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:47,876
Okay.

75
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:53,557
Meng, play the next one.

76
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:55,477
Okay.

77
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:58,597
Ms. Li, hello.

78
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:01,516
I want to ask... Well...

79
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,396
Thanks.

80
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:07,316
Sit.

81
00:05:08,797 --> 00:05:10,756
Take a seat. Let's have a simple meal.

82
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:21,316
Dive in.

83
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:39,037
Have some soup.

84
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:53,720
Did you change cooks?

85
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:57,196
No. Same ones
as when you were attending night school.

86
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:01,436
Maybe because you're leaving.

87
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:03,956
I know I'm being quite selfish.

88
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:11,477
But if I don't do this,
I'm afraid I'll regret it.

89
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,117
I want to see the world.

90
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:18,956
You told me,

91
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,237
you are my lighthouse.

92
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:25,117
I can do it.

93
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:29,048
Lili.

94
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:31,717
Nanzhou is a big city.

95
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:34,076
With many people and fierce competition.

96
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,157
You need to mentally prepare yourself.

97
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,316
Definitely.

98
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,032
But I believe

99
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,876
someone I value
will always have a bigger stage

100
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,536
and shine just as brightly,

101
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,956
no matter where they are.

102
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,797
I knew you'd understand me.

103
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:29,717
Thank you.

104
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:33,237
Lili,

105
00:07:34,477 --> 00:07:35,997
no matter where you go, never forget

106
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:39,396
Yuehai is where you got your start.

107
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:41,956
And Yuehai won't forget you.

108
00:08:34,676 --> 00:08:35,796
Do you like Wang Lili?

109
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:38,036
Yes.

110
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:39,957
I-I like her.

111
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:43,796
She gave this to you.

112
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:47,992
(Beautiful Sea)

113
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,352
(Beautiful Sea)

114
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,396
(Just letting you know,
we're a couple now.)

115
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,597
(Here's a postcard for you
with both our names.)

116
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:08,276
(Wait for your postcard.)

117
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:55,928
Gosh!

118
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,437
Trash!

119
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,744
Who is it? No swearing
in the movie theater!

120
00:10:04,357 --> 00:10:06,136
Master, what are you doing here?

121
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:07,036
Yang Xiaohai.

122
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,437
Have you wasted all those skills

123
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:11,437
you learned from me over the years?

124
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,156
You didn't go to Guangzhou with me.

125
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,512
You chose to go against me
and start a movie theater.

126
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,592
Then do it properly.

127
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:18,717
What kind of decor is this?

128
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:20,440
This chair has even grown teeth.

129
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:22,520
What's wrong, Master?

130
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,117
It pinched my butt! How dare you ask!

131
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:25,597
Master, let me tell you.

132
00:10:25,997 --> 00:10:28,077
Funds are limited right now.

133
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:31,357
I have to prioritize getting these
essential infrastructure projects up.

134
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:33,876
Things like chairs and tables
are secondhand ones.

135
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:35,896
Just bear it. I'll upgrade step by step.

136
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:38,317
You never listen to me,
and now you're paying.

137
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:41,117
You can't make the movie theater thrive.

138
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:55,237
Running a movie theater
is just like running a restaurant.

139
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,676
Many people come and go
every single day.

140
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,317
You have to please the majority

141
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:01,636
to make it work.

142
00:11:02,516 --> 00:11:02,916
Got it.

143
00:11:03,556 --> 00:11:05,197
It's all about reputation and service.

144
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:08,056
Look at this decor of yours
and those chairs.

145
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:09,197
What's wrong?

146
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:10,997
Within three days after opening,

147
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:12,636
the chairs will pinch people's butts.

148
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:13,836
With my light weight,

149
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:14,876
it pinched me so hard.

150
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:16,396
What about those heavier?

151
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,040
Are you going to compensate them?

152
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:19,237
How much will that cost?

153
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:22,676
Step by step? Nobody's waiting for you.

154
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,077
Absurd!

155
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:30,366
Master.

156
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:33,117
I know you don't want me
running a movie theater.

157
00:11:33,477 --> 00:11:35,197
But I've already rented the space.

158
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,237
I have to make it work now.

159
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,156
Yang Xiaohai,
where's your determination?

160
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:40,796
Where's your determination?

161
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:42,437
You're my only apprentice.

162
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:43,544
If you embarrass me,

163
00:11:43,717 --> 00:11:44,916
how do I keep my reputation?

164
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:48,472
Just about money, right?

165
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:49,916
I'll become a shareholder.

166
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:55,317
Master, opening a movie theater
is pretty risky.

167
00:11:55,477 --> 00:11:56,632
I can swallow the loss.

168
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,676
I do it because I like it.

169
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:01,796
But I don't want to drag you into this.

170
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:03,717
Am I still your master?

171
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:04,676
Yes.

172
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:05,916
Then listen to me.

173
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:08,597
Yang Xiaohai, listen up.

174
00:12:09,036 --> 00:12:10,117
You chose to go against me

175
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:12,664
and run a movie theater,
so do it with conviction.

176
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:14,168
Make it work.

177
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:15,636
Make it successful, okay?

178
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:16,837
Got it.

179
00:12:17,357 --> 00:12:18,516
Don't worry about me.

180
00:12:19,036 --> 00:12:21,756
I'm way more experienced
than you in making money.

181
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:22,957
Got it?

182
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:27,597
So what's next, Master?

183
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:30,156
Next, you do nothing.

184
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,876
Drop everything you're doing
and wait for my word.

185
00:12:36,077 --> 00:12:36,997
Have an egg tart.

186
00:12:37,636 --> 00:12:38,808
Here are toothpicks.

187
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:39,992
Drink some tea.

188
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,636
Thank you.

189
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:41,676
Thank you.

190
00:12:43,717 --> 00:12:45,400
Said to hold the meeting at my company,

191
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:46,756
but at Super Dog every time.

192
00:12:47,077 --> 00:12:48,437
Can we at least be professional?

193
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:49,437
Xuemei.

194
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:53,036
This counts as our chamber's
second conference room, right?

195
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:54,796
Seems more like your second home.

196
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:56,437
You're here every other day.

197
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,312
By the way, about the parking spaces.

198
00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:02,706
More cars come to the industrial park,

199
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:04,197
but they park messily,

200
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,264
always blocking the firefighting access.

201
00:13:06,597 --> 00:13:08,248
I propose designating a parking zone

202
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:10,360
in the industrial park.

203
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:13,304
We register internal vehicles
and charge external ones.

204
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:14,396
How's it?

205
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:15,357
I agree.

206
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:15,916
Agreed.

207
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,916
This works.

208
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,197
Organized and profitable.

209
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:20,317
That works.

210
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:25,437
One more thing.

211
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:31,576
That Yang Xiaohai,
Changyuan's apprentice,

212
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,400
wants to open a movie theater.

213
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:34,437
Xuemei.

214
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:35,676
- Forget it.
- Yes.

215
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:37,676
At first, I didn't think
it'd be profitable.

216
00:13:37,957 --> 00:13:40,477
But he is so motivated and determined.

217
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:41,876
And I've been thinking

218
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:44,156
more people are going
to cinemas these days.

219
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:47,317
It's a small venture anyway.
A million yuan investment tops.

220
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:50,597
I'll put in 100,000 yuan for one share.

221
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,432
Anyone interested can sign up.

222
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:54,317
Alright.

223
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:54,676
Look.

224
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:56,216
Xiaohai is my apprentice.

225
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:58,276
For his startup,

226
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,916
I could cover one million yuan myself.

227
00:14:00,117 --> 00:14:01,796
I didn't want to tell you.

228
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:03,556
Later, Xuemei convinced me.

229
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:05,837
Better to make money together.

230
00:14:06,237 --> 00:14:06,796
Well,

231
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:10,156
100,000 yuan per person
for ten shares total.

232
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,117
Completely voluntary.
I'll cover any shortfall.

233
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:15,516
Xuemei, you're in for 100,000.

234
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:17,357
I won.

235
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,597
Full flush with all triplets.

236
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:22,837
Ms. Gao, I'll get one share.

237
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:23,597
Okay.

238
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:24,556
One share, right?

239
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:26,077
I'll record it.

240
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:26,876
No, wait.

241
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:29,077
Ten shares total
and each can only get one share.

242
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:29,876
One per person.

243
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:30,957
I'll take one.

244
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:31,992
Okay, you're in.

245
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:33,197
Then I'll get one too.

246
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,237
- Hold on.
- Okay.

247
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:34,636
I'm in.

248
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,317
Fatty? Where's Fatty?

249
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:37,756
Here! What's up?

250
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,717
Fatty, play it for me.

251
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:40,876
I'll go to the restroom.

252
00:14:41,036 --> 00:14:41,837
Mr. Guo.

253
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:42,957
Aren't you in?

254
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:43,556
Me?

255
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:45,317
It's 100,000 yuan per share.

256
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,237
100,000 yuan. I'll think about it.

257
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,117
100,000 yuan, ten people.

258
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,237
Perfect in every way. How great.

259
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:53,997
Don't be such a killjoy.

260
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,837
Alright, count me in for one share.

261
00:15:02,156 --> 00:15:02,916
I'll record it.

262
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:03,717
Good.

263
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,396
Come on.

264
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,117
Attention, here's an announcement.

265
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:16,837
(Yuehai Town's first movie theater,)

266
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,636
(Quanmei Cinema)
(Quanmei Cinema, is finally open!)

267
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:21,797
(Ten shareholders of the movie theater)

268
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,357
(invite all the residents for movies.)

269
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:25,796
(Free admission on opening day.)

270
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:28,717
(Seats are limited.
First come, first served.)

271
00:15:28,717 --> 00:15:29,317
(Grand Opening of Quanmei Cinema)

272
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:30,437
Welcome!

273
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:31,437
Welcome!

274
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:32,317

- All here.

275
00:15:32,477 --> 00:15:33,396
Congratulations!

276
00:15:33,756 --> 00:15:34,904
My apprentice, Yang Xiaohai.

277
00:15:35,396 --> 00:15:36,036
My apprentice.

278
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:37,477
Support him.

279
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:40,636
Free admission sure draws a crowd.

280
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:41,117
Yes.

281
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:42,197
Support us.

282
00:15:43,512 --> 00:15:45,784
- Find your seats.
- My apprentice, Yang Xiaohai.

283
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:46,556
Support him.

284
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:47,957
- Support him.
- Hurry up!

285
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:50,396
Congratulations!

286
00:15:50,437 --> 00:15:51,636
We'll always show good movies.

287
00:15:51,704 --> 00:15:52,676
Come to watch then.

288
00:15:52,676 --> 00:15:53,597
(Grand Opening of Quanmei Cinema)

289
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:54,957
Welcome!

290
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:56,477
- No one else coming!
- Liu!

291
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,437
Liu, come take a photo for us!

292
00:15:58,756 --> 00:15:59,396
Photo time!

293
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:00,556
Photo time!

294
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:02,597
(Movies for Today)
Come on, photo time!

295
00:16:02,717 --> 00:16:03,916
- Wait!
- Wait!

296
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,437
- Wait!
- Wait!

297
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:06,837
- Wait!
- Wait!

298
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:08,440
Come on.

299
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,696
Okay.

300
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:09,368
Wait!

301
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,117
Not ready.

302
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:11,717
Okay, come on.

303
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:13,597
Look here.

304
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:48,984
You and I learn from...

305
00:16:50,317 --> 00:16:51,117
(The same master.)

306
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:52,837
The same master.

307
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:54,837
(So why hold a grudge?)

308
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,156
So why hold a grudge?

309
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,317
(Enough talk.)

310
00:16:58,676 --> 00:16:59,676
Enough talk.

311
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:00,916
Make your move.

312
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:02,276
- Make your move!
- Make your move!

313
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:29,157
Mr. Xiaohai.

314
00:17:30,157 --> 00:17:31,917
Look, it's like this again.

315
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:32,756
Just a moment.

316
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:40,116
That many?

317
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:50,076
Wang, how many days have we been open?

318
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:51,917
28 days.

319
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:53,836
28 days.

320
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:55,556
(Wu Sanpang, 2 people, March 21)
Wu Sanpang.

321
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:57,397
Xu Jinsheng.

322
00:17:59,116 --> 00:17:59,836
My master?

323
00:17:59,836 --> 00:18:00,568
(Qian Changyuan, 3 people, Mar 16th)

324
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:03,906
(Qian Changyuan, 3 people, Mar 16th)

325
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:05,516
(Qian Changyuan, 5 people, March 18th)

326
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:05,997
Xiaohai.

327
00:18:07,677 --> 00:18:08,197
Master.

328
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:08,877
(Snack Store)

329
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:09,477
You go in.

330
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,197
Okay.

331
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:11,717
Master.

332
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:14,157
Have a chat.

333
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:14,997
What is it?

334
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:17,596
Didn't we agree

335
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:19,397
that each shareholder every month

336
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:22,356
can bring a maximum
of five people for free?

337
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:23,756
- Right. So?
- Right?

338
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:25,397
Look.

339
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:27,756
You've brought way too many.

340
00:18:28,116 --> 00:18:28,677
I exceeded it?

341
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:29,437
Yes.

342
00:18:30,116 --> 00:18:32,556
If other shareholders

343
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,356
follow your example, this isn't proper.

344
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,157
Well, no big deal.

345
00:18:38,836 --> 00:18:40,756
Have them pay for it.

346
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:41,877
Check how much I'll pay.

347
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:44,237
Five people. I'll pay you now.

348
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:46,717
Wait, Master, that's not what I meant.

349
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:49,957
I mean, if everyone
watches movies on credit,

350
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,836
I couldn't track finances properly.

351
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:53,397
Things will go wrong.

352
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:56,836
And one more thing.

353
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,556
Could you stop switching reels

354
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:01,677
midway?

355
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:04,076
The audience hates it.

356
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:06,717
Honestly, this is serious.

357
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,076
Take today for example.

358
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:10,756
Only a dozen people actually

359
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:12,036
paid for tickets.

360
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:13,836
After all expenses,

361
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:16,836
we're nearly 10,000 yuan
in the red this month.

362
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,556
That much?

363
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:20,437
Yes.

364
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:23,316
Master.

365
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:26,520
You said

366
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,437
running a business isn't child's play.

367
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:29,957
Yes.

368
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:31,717
So is this movie theater a business?

369
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:32,917
Yes.

370
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:33,637
Right.

371
00:19:34,316 --> 00:19:35,516
Then since it's a business,

372
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:37,157
should we act by rules?

373
00:19:37,316 --> 00:19:37,957
Yes.

374
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:38,717
Exactly.

375
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,316
Wait, are you lecturing me now?

376
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:41,556
I...

377
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:42,877
How dare you!

378
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,556
No offense.

379
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:44,997
Am I still your master?

380
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,756
Yes, you are.

381
00:19:46,796 --> 00:19:47,677
Master, no offense.

382
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:48,477
Please sit.

383
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:49,917
There you go.

384
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,237
I'm just worried about the losses.

385
00:19:53,036 --> 00:19:53,556
Come sit.

386
00:19:59,237 --> 00:19:59,596
Master.

387
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:01,596
Are you okay?

388
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:02,316
I'm okay.

389
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:03,197
Xiaohai.

390
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:06,276
Some shareholders

391
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,516
treat friends to movies for face.

392
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:09,756
It's no big deal.

393
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:12,997
Listen.

394
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:17,036
Rules matter, but sometimes

395
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:20,356
personal connections matter more.

396
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:22,516
Well, you

397
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,957
gather all shareholders for a meeting.

398
00:20:25,197 --> 00:20:27,556
Let's figure out ideas and strategies.

399
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:29,276
With my brains,

400
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:31,076
this place wouldn't lose money.

401
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:34,796
No begging here.

402
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:38,076
Wang, don't speak to elders like that.

403
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:39,197
Be polite.

404
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,796
Mr. Xiaohai, we have rules, right?

405
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,637
Yes, we have rules.

406
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:45,917
But he's an elderly

407
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:47,717
and deserve courtesy.

408
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:48,997
Be polite.

409
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:51,836
- What if other customers come?
- Wang.

410
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:53,556
Do as he said.

411
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:05,437
Here, eat it.

412
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:14,477
Take it easy. There's more if you want.

413
00:21:25,957 --> 00:21:28,397
It's free. On the house.

414
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:29,516
Yes, it's free.

415
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:34,957
Actually, I just want to watch a movie.

416
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:36,316
Which one?

417
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:38,556
S-Street...

418
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:40,197
Street Angel, right?

419
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:41,677
Yes. Street Angel.

420
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:42,316
Have it?

421
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:42,877
Yes.

422
00:21:43,116 --> 00:21:44,637
I keep all these classics.

423
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,756
- Wonderful.
- Got it.

424
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:48,696
Sir, the movie is free too.

425
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:50,516
My treat, okay?

426
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:51,877
Yes, it's free.

427
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:53,836
Go inside. I'll get it ready.

428
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:54,584
Well,

429
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:57,076
I understand the rules you said.

430
00:21:57,637 --> 00:22:00,437
I'll make sure
he doesn't disturb other customers.

431
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:02,437
Well, for Street Angel,

432
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,917
I'll pay for the whole venue. My treat.

433
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:05,756
No, no.

434
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:07,397
I can't accept it.

435
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:09,997
You said rules matter.

436
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:11,116
Rules matter.

437
00:22:11,356 --> 00:22:12,796
Take it. Don't make this awkward.

438
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:14,488
Master, this matters

439
00:22:14,872 --> 00:22:15,877
more than rules.

440
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:19,116
Sir, you go ahead.

441
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:20,276
I'll go prepare.

442
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:20,836
Go on.

443
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:21,756
Okay, let's go.

444
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:22,946
Street Angels.

445
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,197
Come on, let's watch while you eat.

446
00:22:25,197 --> 00:22:26,637
Don't worry, I'll carry it.

447
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:30,296
Sir,

448
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,877
take this.

449
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:34,637
Go in and eat while you wait.

450
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,677
Take any seat.

451
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:38,036
Sit wherever you want.

452
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:38,877
Alright.

453
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:45,756
Master.

454
00:23:17,304 --> 00:23:17,637
(Chats under 5 minutes)

455
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:18,596
Ms. Li.

456
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,957
How's that matter
we discussed last time going?

457
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,677
When can I get a plot of land
to build a hotel?

458
00:23:25,276 --> 00:23:27,437
Mr. Liang, we've submitted
the land application

459
00:23:27,556 --> 00:23:29,076
to the higher-up last month.

460
00:23:29,596 --> 00:23:32,316
You know, there are
procedures to follow.

461
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:33,997
The county secretary is busy.

462
00:23:34,437 --> 00:23:35,917
We need to give him some time, right?

463
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:38,796
Wait, Ms. Li.

464
00:23:39,197 --> 00:23:41,877
Time is money. Efficiency is life.

465
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:43,997
Tell me if you lack land,

466
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:45,437
I'll go somewhere else.

467
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:53,877
Next.

468
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:56,276
Hello, Ms. Li.

469
00:23:56,556 --> 00:23:57,516
Hello. Have a seat.

470
00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:00,677
Ms. Li, you remember me, right?

471
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:01,997
I came here last month.

472
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:03,997
Kind of remember.

473
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:06,316
You want to build a factory here, right?

474
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:07,397
Yes.

475
00:24:07,677 --> 00:24:09,677
I've visited your industrial park
several times.

476
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:11,076
I really like it.

477
00:24:11,877 --> 00:24:13,556
But there's no space left inside.

478
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:15,276
So I wonder

479
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:17,796
if you could build
another industrial park.

480
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:19,437
Not just me.

481
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:22,556
Several other bosses I know
want to move their factories to Yuehai.

482
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:26,036
Well, we don't have the conditions

483
00:24:26,157 --> 00:24:27,756
to build another industrial park.

484
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:29,976
The main issue is

485
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:31,516
that we have no large plots available.

486
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,397
I'm sorry
you made this trip for nothing.

487
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:36,717
Alright then,
I'll come back another time.

488
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:37,596
Okay.

489
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:39,896
I'll walk you out.

490
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,116
Please stay.

491
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:41,677
It's fine.

492
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:43,917
Ms. Li.

493
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:44,397
Ms. Li.

494
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:45,356
- Well, Ms. Li.
- Ms. Li.

495
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:46,836
You're all here about land?

496
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:47,957
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

497
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:48,477
Yes.

498
00:24:48,677 --> 00:24:50,556
We'll try our best
to resolve this land issue.

499
00:24:50,877 --> 00:24:52,957
Go back and wait for updates.

500
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,917
Ms. Li, do you have a timeframe?

501
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:56,516
Yes, give me a specific date.

502
00:24:56,677 --> 00:24:57,432
Maybe next month.

503
00:24:57,677 --> 00:24:59,556
Next month.
We'll update as soon as possible.

504
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:00,477
Okay.

505
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:01,516
Okay, we'll leave then.

506
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:02,397
Okay.

507
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:02,997
Let's go.

508
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:25,477
Hello.

509
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:29,076
Mr. Xia, this is Li Qiuping.

510
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:31,836
Qiuping? What's up?

511
00:25:32,316 --> 00:25:33,036
Mr. Xia.

512
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:34,917
Next month on the 8th

513
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:37,116
is the 3rd anniversary
of our industrial park.

514
00:25:37,596 --> 00:25:38,637
We'll organize an event.

515
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:40,756
We'd like to invite you and Mr. Guan

516
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:42,796
to come to inspect our work.

517
00:25:43,437 --> 00:25:45,157
Okay, let me check my schedule.

518
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,637
I'll come if I'm available.

519
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:48,756
Mr. Xia.

520
00:25:49,877 --> 00:25:51,997
Most of the tax revenue we've submitted

521
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:53,276
over the past few years

522
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,437
is from the factories
in the industrial park.

523
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:57,197
It's been open for long.

524
00:25:57,717 --> 00:26:00,036
I think you should show up

525
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:02,877
and cheer self-employed individuals up.

526
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:04,836
Alright.

527
00:26:06,556 --> 00:26:07,544
Next month on the 8th,

528
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,917
Mr. Guan and I will go to Yuehai.

529
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:11,516
Fantastic!

530
00:26:12,076 --> 00:26:14,316
It's settled then. We'll pick you up.

531
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:15,957
Okay, that's it.

532
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:19,276
Okay.

533
00:26:19,756 --> 00:26:20,316
Thank you.

534
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:21,157
You're welcome.

535
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:27,836
W-Winter melon.

536
00:26:30,276 --> 00:26:31,917
Give me some. I was about to get more.

537
00:26:32,596 --> 00:26:33,157
I knew it.

538
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:35,157
Okay, enough.

539
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:35,877
A bit more.

540
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:37,912
Okay. That's enough.

541
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:44,596
Qingtian.

542
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:46,997
After we finish,

543
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:49,116
let's go to Yan's dance hall.

544
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:50,157
What for?

545
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:51,957
You can't sing or dance.

546
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:53,637
Don't you know?

547
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:54,356
I don't know.

548
00:26:55,237 --> 00:26:56,796
Let me finish.

549
00:26:58,397 --> 00:26:59,036
Go on.

550
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:01,397
A big boss from Shanghai

551
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,997
has been visiting there for days
trying to woo Yan.

552
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:05,400
He books the whole place.

553
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,836
Drinks and singing fees are all on him.

554
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:10,076
Really?

555
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:11,356
I heard

556
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,997
he isn't just handsome, but also rich.

557
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:16,637
They say a few days ago,
he got on stage and sang a song.

558
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:18,456
That voice of his

559
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,796
is deep and magnetic.

560
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,704
Even more impressive
than Hong Kong singers.

561
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:25,036
The audience were captivated.

562
00:27:25,397 --> 00:27:26,917
You make it sound so weird.

563
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:28,637
I'm finding it hard to believe you.

564
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:30,136
It's true.

565
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:32,197
He's going to propose to Yan today.

566
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:33,756
No way.

567
00:27:34,516 --> 00:27:35,516
Why not?

568
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:38,477
He ordered 999 roses
at the flower market.

569
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,076
999 roses. What does that mean?

570
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:42,796
Definitely for a proposal.

571
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:44,036
Well...

572
00:27:44,717 --> 00:27:47,556
What could the two of us even do there?

573
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:49,316
We're going to site install.

574
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:50,957
Master.

575
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:52,236
Tonight,

576
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:55,197
let's double-check the details
on the construction drawing.

577
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:56,997
Okay.

578
00:27:59,157 --> 00:27:59,637
You!

579
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,076
- Did he hear it?
- Clean that up.

580
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:02,637
Master.

581
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:05,556
Master.

582
00:28:09,036 --> 00:28:09,556
Master.

583
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:14,997
Master, he's going to propose.

584
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:16,216
You're still not going?

585
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,556
Wait, it's not my business.

586
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:21,596
Master, you never give up on Ms. Sun.

587
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:23,197
Why do you have to deny it?

588
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:23,877
He...

589
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:29,877
If he really proposes today,

590
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:31,157
you'd only regret it.

591
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:32,717
What would I regret?

592
00:28:33,316 --> 00:28:34,917
She runs this kind of karaoke bar,

593
00:28:34,997 --> 00:28:36,877
probably just wanting
to meet some big shot.

594
00:28:37,397 --> 00:28:38,356
Now she made it.

595
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:41,116
I wish her all the best.

596
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:44,157
Wait, Master.

597
00:28:44,437 --> 00:28:47,397
Yuehai has over 20 karaoke bars
and a dozen dance halls now.

598
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,516
Hundreds of people
visit these places every day.

599
00:28:49,957 --> 00:28:51,276
Does it mean they're all indecent

600
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,596
and dubious?

601
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:57,556
Then I'm indecent.

602
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,677
(Yan Dance Hall)

603
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,437
Sir, want to sing?

604
00:29:07,237 --> 00:29:07,836
Come on in.

605
00:29:08,036 --> 00:29:09,116
Is singing free here?

606
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:10,437
Yes.

607
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:17,272
(Yan Dance Hall)

608
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:19,437
Take care.

609
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:25,036
(Yan Dance Hall)

610
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:26,717
Sir, someone paid the bills tonight.

611
00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:28,917
Singing and drinks for free.
Want to come and try?

612
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:32,397
Go on in.

613
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:33,197
No.

614
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:42,116
Yan.

615
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:44,397
Yan.

616
00:29:47,836 --> 00:29:49,596
What do I do to earn your forgiveness?

617
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:52,197
I stopped hating you long ago.

618
00:29:53,437 --> 00:29:54,957
But I've been here over half a month,

619
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,197
yet you won't even sing with me.

620
00:29:57,477 --> 00:29:59,877
I made myself very clear from day one.

621
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:03,116
I run a business
and I won't kick you out.

622
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:05,677
But I'm not part of the business deal.

623
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:07,637
I never thought that way.

624
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:09,556
I just want it like before,

625
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:11,437
the two of us singing together.

626
00:30:12,197 --> 00:30:15,076
You have everything now.
You can find someone else to sing with.

627
00:30:18,836 --> 00:30:19,596
All these years,

628
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:21,848
I found out I...

629
00:30:22,808 --> 00:30:24,796
I only love you.

630
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:27,957
Besides,

631
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:30,276
we have a child.

632
00:30:31,356 --> 00:30:33,917
Stop throwing a temper. Come back
to Shanghai with me, okay?

633
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:36,877
Right.

634
00:30:38,957 --> 00:30:40,157
You are Haohao's father.

635
00:30:40,957 --> 00:30:42,836
That's something I can never change.

636
00:30:43,316 --> 00:30:46,237
This time,
I absolutely won't let you down.

637
00:30:46,237 --> 00:30:49,944
(Yan Dance Hall)

638
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,316
I'm not worried.

639
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:54,556
You won't get a chance
to let me down anyway.

640
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:58,516
We broke up long ago.

641
00:30:59,397 --> 00:31:01,076
Breakup means ending.

642
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:03,064
I don't know how you feel,

643
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:05,752
but for me, people need to look forward

644
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,596
and never look back.

645
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:11,637
Even if you are my child's father,

646
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:13,477
you can't make me look back.

647
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:52,957
What's up?

648
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:56,146
Heard a big boss wants to propose to me

649
00:31:56,344 --> 00:31:57,304
and came to bless me?

650
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:01,437
Then you're here for the show.

651
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:07,836
Yan.

652
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:10,157
I'm sorry.

653
00:32:12,836 --> 00:32:13,516
In the past,

654
00:32:15,036 --> 00:32:16,637
I just didn't understand you.

655
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:20,477
It's over now.

656
00:32:22,116 --> 00:32:23,076
We need to look forward.

657
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:28,036
Since you're here, come in.

658
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:33,556
Maybe next time.

659
00:32:33,997 --> 00:32:35,576
This singing thing, I...

660
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,197
I need to practice more.

661
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:40,316
Right.

662
00:32:40,997 --> 00:32:41,997
When I'm not working,

663
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:44,836
I should learn something.

664
00:32:47,316 --> 00:32:47,796
Okay.

665
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:52,316

666
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:00,677

Ms. Gao.

683

Your machines and equipment here
are quite advanced.

684
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:51,596
Right.

685
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:54,357
They're much advanced than
those state-owned factories

686
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:55,356
in the county.

687
00:33:55,796 --> 00:33:57,677
Mr. Xia, not just them.

688
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,756
Even the big printeries in the city

689
00:33:59,796 --> 00:34:00,957
can't compare to ours.

690
00:34:01,276 --> 00:34:02,957
This year, we imported a brand-new

691
00:34:03,076 --> 00:34:05,197
Heidelberg four-color printing press.

692
00:34:05,717 --> 00:34:08,437
It's currently the most advanced press
on the market.

00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:09,196

About those imported machines
you mentioned,

701
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:21,076
do any of our workers
know how to operate them?

702
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:23,917
Mr. Guan, a few years back,
we started a night school.

703
00:34:24,116 --> 00:34:25,720
Besides teaching them
cultural knowledge,

704
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:28,477
we also trained them
into modern workers.

705
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:30,196
- Yes.
- Good.

706
00:34:30,516 --> 00:34:32,676
So how many such industrial parks
does Yuehai have?

707
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,384
We'd like to build a few more.

708
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,437
But...

709
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:39,757
Guan, you get that?

710
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:43,076
Sit. They didn't invite us
for a tour for nothing.

711
00:34:43,596 --> 00:34:45,556
But I'll be honest,

712
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:48,376
you can build anything,
but the county government lacks money.

713
00:34:52,397 --> 00:34:53,437
Mr. Xia,

714
00:34:54,196 --> 00:34:56,196
you've misunderstood.
We're not short on money,

715
00:34:56,757 --> 00:34:58,357
but short on land.

716
00:34:59,236 --> 00:35:00,997
We have no plot of land
to build anything.

717
00:35:01,357 --> 00:35:04,116
We have the funds and investment,

718
00:35:04,676 --> 00:35:06,957
but with no land.

719
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:08,556
Exactly.

720
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:12,596
Xia.

721
00:35:13,716 --> 00:35:15,636
Yuehai's development is so fast.

722
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,112
The county government should

723
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,156
try harder to support them.

724
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:21,676
Guan, I have considered it.

725
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,757
But the task is just too difficult.

726
00:35:24,236 --> 00:35:24,877
You know,

727
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:27,797
the county government
has been giving Yuehai

728
00:35:28,236 --> 00:35:29,757
policy advantages all these years.

729
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:32,036
If we ask other towns for land,

730
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:33,477
it'll be too difficult.

731
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:37,076
But I think you understand it, right?

732
00:35:38,797 --> 00:35:39,377
Yuehai

733
00:35:39,544 --> 00:35:41,917
is the leader of Pingchuan's economy

734
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:44,676
and has been racing ahead
all these years.

735
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:47,596
Of course, we have to support you.

736
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:49,752
Well,

737
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,596
we'll discuss this
at the meeting next Monday.

738
00:35:55,156 --> 00:35:56,156
That'd be fantastic!

739
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:58,596
Thank you, Mr. Xia. Thank you, Mr. Guan.

740
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,757

741
00:36:03,076 --> 00:36:04,837
a new movie theater opened in Yuehai.

742
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:05,816
Yes.

743
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,676
Ms. Gao and other partners opened it.

744
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:09,277
Right.

745
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,596
- There are...
- Ten shareholders total.

746
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:13,716
Self-employed individuals in Yuehai.

747
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:15,556
The movie theater is bustling.

748
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:18,556
They show not just new releases
but many classic movies too.

749
00:36:18,716 --> 00:36:19,288
Really?

750
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,837
Neither Mr. Zheng nor I
have been there yet.

751
00:36:21,997 --> 00:36:23,437
- Really?
- We haven't had the time.

752
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,516
I love classic movies,

753
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:25,944
especially black-and-white ones.

754
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:27,000
Perfect!

755
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,116
After dinner, let's all go watch one.

756
00:36:29,277 --> 00:36:29,837
Okay.

757
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:30,716
Wonderful!

758
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,076
Welcome.

759
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:38,477
(Don't move.)

760
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:40,556
(You're probably just overexcited.)

761
00:36:40,997 --> 00:36:42,116
Find any seat.

762
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:43,357
Here. Sit here.

763
00:36:43,397 --> 00:36:44,036
Sit here.

764
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:45,797
The middle seats are best.

765
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:47,556
Sit.

766
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:48,156
Here.

767
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:48,716
Alright.

768
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:49,397
Thanks.

769
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:50,757
(I told you not to move.)

770
00:36:51,156 --> 00:36:52,997
(You really are something.)

771
00:36:53,357 --> 00:36:56,036
(I've told you,
I get off at Xiaoqiao Station too.)

772
00:36:56,556 --> 00:36:57,317
Not bad.

773
00:36:57,397 --> 00:36:59,676
- (I won't lose you.)
- (That station is nice, right?)

774
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:00,676
Seen it before?

775
00:37:01,317 --> 00:37:01,957
No.

776
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:03,556
Me neither.

777
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,877
(Never had an accident.
Station is so tidy.)

778
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,196
(Miss, can you sit here?)

779
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,477
(His head keeps bobbing
like a wind-up toy.)

780
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:13,797
(I-I can't start sketching.)

781
00:37:16,196 --> 00:37:17,236
No, thanks.

782
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:22,477
I don't like this stuff, either.
You have it.

783
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:25,477
(Mr. Painter, I have a special request.)

784
00:37:25,957 --> 00:37:26,636
(Special?)

785
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:29,636
(Could you paint me
wearing peasant attire?)

786
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:30,837
(Why?)

787
00:37:31,236 --> 00:37:34,116
(To learn from the working people
and show my resolve to be tempered.)

788
00:37:34,676 --> 00:37:36,757
Cigarettes, pastries, sausage.

789
00:37:37,236 --> 00:37:39,636
Cigarettes, pastries, sausage.

790
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:42,477
Peanuts, sunflower seeds, candies.

791
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,716
Cigarettes, pastries, sausage.

792
00:37:44,837 --> 00:37:47,236
How could you sell
things and snacks in here?

793
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:48,196
It's a quiet place.

794
00:37:49,556 --> 00:37:50,957
Can't watch with no snacks.

795
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,837
Can't watch with no drinks.

796
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:54,236
Want some?

797
00:37:54,676 --> 00:37:55,556
Keep it down.

798
00:37:56,116 --> 00:37:57,397
Keep it down. Just push it away.

799
00:37:57,437 --> 00:37:58,076
Push it away.

800
00:37:58,196 --> 00:37:59,437
Don't disturb others watching.

801
00:37:59,516 --> 00:38:00,797
No more selling here.

802
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:01,797
Okay.

803
00:38:01,877 --> 00:38:02,917
I'll tell him later.

804
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:03,596
Right.

805
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:06,477
How can they sell stuff here?

806
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:07,516
(Take care.)

807
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:09,036
(See you later.)

808
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:14,744
(Mr. Painter, I'll be right back.
Continue then.)

809
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:15,277
(Okay.)

810
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:17,156
(That young man is really enthusiastic.)

811
00:38:19,556 --> 00:38:22,317
Li, Decheng,
do you two hear splashing water?

812
00:38:23,036 --> 00:38:23,716
Splashing water?

813
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:25,196
Didn't hear it.

814
00:38:25,716 --> 00:38:26,156
Ouch!

815
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:27,397
Feels good.

816
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:28,957
What's going on there?

817
00:38:31,196 --> 00:38:32,556
Mr. Xia, I'll go ask.

818
00:38:33,596 --> 00:38:34,437
What's going on?

819
00:38:34,837 --> 00:38:35,477
Take it.

820
00:38:39,437 --> 00:38:41,196
Well, what are you doing?

821
00:38:41,516 --> 00:38:42,196
Foot massage?

822
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:44,596
Two people ahead. Need to wait an hour.

823
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:47,676
Why are they getting foot massages here?

824
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,116
What are you doing here?

825
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,277
- This is the movie theater.
- Hush! Quiet!

826
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:54,036
Mr. Xia, please have a seat.

827
00:38:54,317 --> 00:38:55,917
Don't worry. I'll go ask.

828
00:38:57,036 --> 00:38:57,976
- Sit down.
- I'll go ask.

829
00:38:58,712 --> 00:38:59,556
Go ahead.

830
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:05,277
Xiaohai.

831
00:39:06,156 --> 00:39:06,757
Ms. Li.

832
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:08,556
What's going on inside?

833
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:10,716
Why are there foot massages?
What a mess!

834
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:14,156
Master said selling tickets
doesn't make money,

835
00:39:14,636 --> 00:39:16,397
so we offer unique services.

836
00:39:16,797 --> 00:39:17,837
This is outrageous!

837
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,036
Right, I argued with him too.

838
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,317
But I hold a small share.

839
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:23,156
He didn't listen to me.

840
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:25,437
What about Gao Xuemei?
Did she agree to this?

841
00:39:25,837 --> 00:39:28,837
Ms. Gao is busy with her business.
Can't come to intervene.

842
00:39:29,676 --> 00:39:30,636
Alright, I see.

843
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,277
I'll handle this.

844
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:34,596
What's that smell?

845
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:36,196
Do you smell that?

846
00:39:37,196 --> 00:39:37,877
What smell?

847
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:39,877
Hot pot?

848
00:39:40,437 --> 00:39:41,036
Hot pot!

849
00:39:43,997 --> 00:39:46,156
Zheng Decheng, explain this.

850
00:39:49,676 --> 00:39:51,516
Dining and entertainment
at the same time.

851
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,116
When we watch
the Spring Festival Gala or TV,

852
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,116
we all eat together too, right?

853
00:39:56,156 --> 00:39:57,196
Eating in here?

854
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:57,797
Well...

855
00:39:57,917 --> 00:39:58,757
Nonsense.

856
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:03,477
Why did it stop?

857
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:09,716
Hello?

858
00:40:10,437 --> 00:40:12,196
Now, the commercial break.

859
00:40:12,596 --> 00:40:13,477
- Commercial break.
- First one.

860
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:16,277
Hungry? Come to Super Dog Restaurant!

861
00:40:16,357 --> 00:40:17,317
Commercial break?

862
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:19,636
- Young folks are creative,
- Taste authentic Hong Kong cuisine.

863
00:40:19,636 --> 00:40:21,877
leading the trend.

864
00:40:22,596 --> 00:40:24,126
We need both spiritual civilization

865
00:40:24,126 --> 00:40:25,917
and material civilization.

866
00:40:25,997 --> 00:40:27,036
And of course, profits.

867
00:40:27,196 --> 00:40:30,196
Nourishing delicacies:
Bird's nest, shark fin.

868
00:40:30,516 --> 00:40:31,768
Super Dog Restaurant,

869
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,837
where you can taste
all kinds of delicious food!

870
00:40:34,477 --> 00:40:35,116
Second one.

871
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:38,676
Who comes to mind when you catch a cold?

872
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:41,516
999 Cold Remedy, your old friend.

873
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:44,397
Keeps you warm, keeps you well.

874
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:47,236
999 Cold Remedy: Warm and caring.

875
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:50,116
Needs commercial?

876
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:51,837
Come find me.

877
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,528
Alright, enough.

878
00:40:53,528 --> 00:40:54,200
Hurry up!

879
00:40:54,424 --> 00:40:55,196
We're waiting.

880
00:40:55,236 --> 00:40:55,957
Stop rushing.

881
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,357
I read the commercials.

882
00:40:58,036 --> 00:40:58,997
Come on.

883
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:00,596
Just waiting for it! Come on.

884
00:41:01,116 --> 00:41:02,877
Two Best Bros!

885
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,236
Five Highest Honors!

886
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:06,596
Five Highest Honors!

887
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:08,716
Zheng Decheng, come here!

888
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:10,317
Seven Wonders!

889
00:41:10,516 --> 00:41:11,877
- Eight Steeds!
- Explain this.

890
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:14,036
- Nine Dragons!
- They're drinking here?

891
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:15,317
Even got hot pot?

892
00:41:15,437 --> 00:41:17,624
How can folks watch movies
in an environment like this?

893
00:41:17,837 --> 00:41:18,957
This is going too far.

894
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:21,196
Why are you such a drag?

895
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:21,997
What's wrong?

896
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,076
Fire!

897
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:23,877
Fire!

898
00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:25,917
Fire!

899
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:27,596
Don't panic! Stay calm!

900
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:28,997
- Lights on!
- Fire!

901
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:30,877
Water! Hurry, get water!

902
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:31,676
Hurry!

903
00:41:42,437 --> 00:41:42,716
You...

904
00:41:42,997 --> 00:41:43,477
Right.

905
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:45,397
Thank you, Chunlai.

906
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:47,357
It's fine now.

907
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:48,317
Well...

908
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:49,516
What's up?

909
00:41:52,036 --> 00:41:52,556
What's wrong?

910
00:41:59,196 --> 00:42:01,757
Zheng Decheng, Li Qiuping,
what are you trying to do?

911
00:42:02,957 --> 00:42:04,397
So this is Yuehai's movie theater?

912
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:07,917
The movie theater is a place for people
to relax and have fun.

913
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:09,596
It's supposed to cultivate taste

914
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,156
and facilitate spiritual civilization.

915
00:42:12,516 --> 00:42:14,716
Look at this. Is this acceptable?

916
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,976
Selling snacks? Eating hot pot?

917
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:18,596
Getting foot bath and massages?

918
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:20,877
What movie theater
in the world is like this?

919
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:22,328
Luckily, I came today.

920
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,036
Otherwise, I got fooled.

921
00:42:24,636 --> 00:42:27,397
You've turned the movie theater
into a complete mess.

922
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:30,136
Want more plots of land?
Want development?

923
00:42:30,296 --> 00:42:31,877
Develop what? This?

924
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,236
You two really let me down.

925
00:42:35,477 --> 00:42:35,837
Xia.

926
00:42:36,236 --> 00:42:36,920
Let me tell you,

927
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:39,236
never mention the land request again.

928
00:42:40,837 --> 00:42:41,357
Outrageous!

929
00:42:41,357 --> 00:42:41,797
Mr. Xia.

930
00:42:42,156 --> 00:42:42,904
- Nowhere else does so.
- Mr. Xia.
