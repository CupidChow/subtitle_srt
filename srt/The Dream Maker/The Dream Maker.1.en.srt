16
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:45,311
(My hometown became prosperous
by refusing to accept poverty.)

17
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:47,512
(Seawater intruded year-round.)

18
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:48,471
(The soil was barren.)

19
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,352
(Poverty drove people)

20
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:51,911
(to travel far, seeking livelihoods.)

21
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:54,191
(By the early 1980s,)

22
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:55,911
(Pingchuan County People's Government)
(with the Reform and Opening-up,)

23
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:56,962
(the introduction of)

24
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:58,191
(Stay Committed to Development)
(household responsibility system)

25
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:59,911
(Build Pingchuan Together)
(and the rise of TVEs)

26
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,872
(significantly
increased the people's wealth.)

27
00:02:03,712 --> 00:02:07,031
(Self-employed individuals'
return boosted prosperity,)

28
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:08,551
(nourishing this land in return.)

29
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:13,632
(From then on, the people here
embraced the chance for a better life.)

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,088
(Firm Confidence, High Morale)

31
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:19,391
(On this day, the county
had a three-level cadre conference.)

32
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,952
(Secretary Zhao asked us to decorate
the County Committee Compound.)

33
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,040
(The County Committee Canteen's
food had never been better.)

34
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:29,632
(This would become a pivotal meeting
in Pingchuan County's history.)

35
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:33,591
(A major announcement
would be made today.)

36
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,232
Sir, it's so lively here.

37
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:41,512
Truly excellent.

38
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:43,151
The food today is especially good.

39
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,952
I just saw many delicious dishes.

40
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:45,991
Two portions left.

41
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:46,671
Really?

42
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:47,632
I heard the government

43
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:48,792
(Canteen)
puts a lot into city building.

44
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:50,512
It's over ten million yuan.

45
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:51,551
No small amount at all.

46
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:52,512
It's a grant

47
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,391
of over ten million.

48
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:54,711
Gaining both fame and profit.

49
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,151
That's ten million.

50
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:57,391
This is massive funding.

51
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:58,671
The county can't afford it.

52
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,391
I heard it's over ten million.

53
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:01,391
Over ten million?

54
00:03:02,752 --> 00:03:03,831
Where are the rumors from?

55
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:04,991
They've spread rapidly.

56
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:07,352
Have no idea.

57
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:08,792
How can they afford it?

58
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,431
Exactly. How could it be?

59
00:03:10,431 --> 00:03:11,391
Over ten million.

60
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:18,551
We must stop these inaccurate rumors
from spreading further.

61
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:20,632
Or it'll be hard for you to proceed.

62
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:22,391
So, Guan, please notify everyone.

63
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,952
Start the meeting earlier.

64
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,512
Let's make it noon then.

65
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,671
Get some food if you haven't eaten.

66
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:29,632
We can talk over food.

67
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,111
Sure.

68
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,080
(Pingchuan County
Three-Level Cadre Conference)

69
00:03:37,944 --> 00:03:41,080
(Zhao Dongsheng)

70
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:43,512
Do you know
why the food is so good today?

71
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:46,431
Because I want you all
to remember this day.

72
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:48,871
But it seems

73
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:52,151
some matters
are more captivating than good food.

74
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:54,271
I need to clarify.

75
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,232
Some rumors you've heard are true.

76
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,032
But others aren't.

77
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:02,232
(Xia Changyou, Guan Yiming)
The secretary is speaking.

78
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:02,912
Stop eating.

79
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:05,591
But he said we could.

80
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:10,551
I am here to announce the accurate news.

81
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,671
In 1984,

82
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,792
No. 1 Central Document
gave us significant inspiration.

83
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:19,992
We will indeed build Yuehai City.

84
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:22,151
See? They said so earlier.

85
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:28,992
It's from the top.

86
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:29,711
It'll happen.

87
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:30,992
I knew they'd build a city.

88
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,231
Everyone,

89
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:34,151
be quiet.

90
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:38,791
I'm going to say a few words

91
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:39,672
while you eat.

92
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:40,992
Everyone,

93
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:44,432
Yuehai is Pingchuan's crucial hub.

94
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:46,952
Developing it properly

95
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:51,312
will revitalize all of Pingchuan.

96
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:58,711
Our people have been
craving stable economic opportunities.

97
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,192
The Yuehai project is urgent.

98
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:06,231
We want to build Yuehai City.

99
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:07,391
It's good.

100
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:08,632
And hard too.

101
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:11,591
Our county's finances
are extremely tight.

102
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,632
We barely have funds to invest.

103
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:16,151
No money?

104
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:19,271
No?

105
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,552
But I heard it's over ten million?

106
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:25,752
Without funds...

107
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:27,192
how can we build a city?

108
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:28,512
A hot ticket?

109
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,151
Turns out it's a hot potato.

110
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:30,872
Exactly.

111
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,591
- It won't work.
- It's impossible.

112
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:33,992
Therefore,

113
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:37,312
I've been pondering:

114
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,791
Times make heroes.

115
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:43,791
Who can shoulder this responsibility?

116
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:46,192
The person I envision

117
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:49,831
must be a trailblazer
who never gives up.

118
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,632
They need courage and vision.

119
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,591
That's me.

120
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,512
They must be resourceful,

121
00:05:57,872 --> 00:05:58,831
shoulder responsibility,

122
00:05:59,952 --> 00:06:01,031
and withstand pressure.

123
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,031
That's Zheng Decheng.

124
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,192
Zheng Decheng fits.

125
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,512
Right, Zheng Decheng.

126
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,992
Guan, explain the details to everyone.

127
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:14,031
Everyone,

128
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,911
the County Standing Committee
has decided

129
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:21,271
that this time, we won't use
the traditional appointment method.

130
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,512
Instead, we encourage
voluntary applications.

131
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:26,312
Voluntary applications?

132
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,192
Voluntary?

133
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:30,791
Zhang has the application forms.

134
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,432
Zhang,

135
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:32,831
distribute them.

136
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:35,271
We'll see.

137
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:37,271
Xia, are you going?

138
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:43,911
Sorry.

139
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,632
It's fine.

140
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,031
M-Mr. Zhao.

141
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,351
It's urgent. I have to interrupt.

142
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:49,351
I need someone.

143
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:51,791
Which one is Zheng Decheng?

144
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:53,992
Zheng Decheng?

145
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:56,231
Me.

146
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:57,112
What is it?

147
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,992
Your son had an incident at school.

148
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,591
The call came through to us.

149
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:01,952
Hurry and go.

150
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,752
Sorry, could you clear the bowls for me?

151
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:07,312
Sir,

152
00:07:08,192 --> 00:07:09,791
he is Zheng Decheng.

153
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:11,992
The District Party Secretary
of Jiangku District.

154
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,312
Qiuping.

155
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,632
Qiuping.

156
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,072
Li Qiuping.

157
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:21,112
Li Qiuping.

158
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:23,432
Bravo! Bravo!

159
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:24,591
Li Qiuping.

160
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:26,231
Bravo!

161
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:29,672
Stop the drumming. Stop.

162
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:31,072
Li Qiuping.

163
00:07:31,672 --> 00:07:32,632
Qiuping.

164
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:47,151
Put it down quickly.

165
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,112
Put it down.

166
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:49,872
Your chance is here.

167
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,151
Look at you.

168
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:53,391
The meeting's almost over.

169
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,112
A lion dancer had diarrhea.

170
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:56,911
I just filled in for them.

171
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:58,831
Didn't expect the meeting
to start early.

172
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,432
As a secretary
of the County Committee Office,

173
00:08:01,512 --> 00:08:02,351
you know everything.

174
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:02,872
Liu,

175
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:04,192
what did they say?

176
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:06,552
About the Secretary of Yuehai.

177
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:07,831
They said

178
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,632
all section-chief-level and higher
cadres can volunteer.

179
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:12,911
Everyone, think about it.

180
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,432
Those interested
must submit the form on time.

181
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,591
No extensions.

182
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:18,992
That's all.

183
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,231
I've helped prepare this.

184
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:28,552
But no one told me I could volunteer.

185
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:30,351
They've given the application forms.

186
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,552
Why would I lie?

187
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:32,672
Voluntary?

188
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,552
Section-chief-level and higher cadres?

189
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:35,392
Of course.

190
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:36,591
Are you sure?

191
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:37,272
Yes.

192
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:38,111
Just go.

193
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:44,471
Zhang.

194
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:45,351
Qiuping?

195
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:45,871
Zhang.

196
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:46,711
Sorry.

197
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,231
I missed the meeting.

198
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:50,392
Do you still have any application forms?

199
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,231
Qiuping,

200
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:52,471
you came too late.

201
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,192
No application forms are left.

202
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:55,591
I have to go.

203
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,351
Bye.

204
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:03,262
(Pingchuan County
Three-Level Cadre Conference)

205
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:29,351
Speak.

206
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:30,956
Where are the books from?

207
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:32,152
Uncle's.

208
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:32,952
He didn't want them.

209
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:34,312
My classmates like them too.

210
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,192
So I...

211
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:36,871
So you rent them out, is that it?

212
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:38,312
Yes.

213
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:40,711
'Yes'?

214
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:43,152
You rent books
and think you're justified?

215
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:46,231
Well, the school never said
we can't rent them.

216
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,152
I did nothing wrong.

217
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,952
By making money off classmates?

218
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:53,231
I deal with you at home.

219
00:09:53,952 --> 00:09:54,471
Dad.

220
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:04,631
Liu.

221
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:06,672
You're back.

222
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:08,871
And the form?

223
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:10,192
Already submitted it.

224
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:11,912
Thanks for today.

225
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:13,111
Without you,

226
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:14,591
I would've missed the deadline.

227
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:17,711
You keep droning on about Yuehai
in my ear every day,

228
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:18,792
like a million times.

229
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,672
What kind of friend would I be

230
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:21,912
if I didn't tell you?

231
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:24,272
But I'm still nervous.

232
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:26,351
You're Class of 1977.

233
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,751
The only college graduate in our county.

234
00:10:29,032 --> 00:10:30,272
I'm not worried at all.

235
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,272
You know what?

236
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,231
What I'm actually worried about now...

237
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:37,272
is your family.

238
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:42,272
Will it work?

239
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:45,471
It'll work.

240
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,984
(Harmony in the family
brings prosperity)

241
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:40,800
(When's Qiuping off
to the provincial capital?)

242
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:41,871
(Do you know?)

243
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:04,751
(No idea.)

244
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:20,751
(Tao's already graduated.)

245
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:21,912
(She should go.)

246
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:24,751
(You don't get a say in this.)

247
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:12,871
I've got an announcement.

248
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:15,152
I'm running for Secretary of Yuehai.

249
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:17,711
I've filled out the application.

250
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,912
Any objections?

251
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:22,591
None?

252
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,631
Then I'm going to bed.

253
00:13:25,231 --> 00:13:25,711
Wait.

254
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:29,432
I disagree.

255
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:34,912
I disagree too.

256
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:39,511
Can't you talk properly to our daughter?

257
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,032
She went behind our backs.

258
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:43,991
Why are you blaming me?

259
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:45,471
I merely signed up.

260
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:47,432
I'm not even sure I'll get elected.

261
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:48,432
Exactly.

262
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,792
The outcome isn't certain yet.

263
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:52,871
So, Qiuping,

264
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,552
don't take this election too seriously.

265
00:13:56,312 --> 00:13:59,231
You really should consider
going to the provincial capital.

266
00:13:59,631 --> 00:13:59,991
Dad,

267
00:14:00,231 --> 00:14:01,672
I want to do this right now.

268
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:02,792
As for the rest,

269
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:04,312
I haven't planned that far.

270
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:15,672
Mr. Zheng.

271
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,111
Mr. Zheng.

272
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:22,072
Is your dad home?

273
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:22,792
He's inside.

274
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:24,272
Mr. Zheng.

275
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:25,591
Heavens.

276
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:27,072
I finally found you.

277
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:29,711
What's wrong? Why the rush?

278
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:31,351
Come with me quickly.

279
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:31,912
Big trouble.

280
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,511
Where to?

281
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,912
Just come. I'll tell you.

282
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:34,952
No, I'm busy here.

283
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:35,912
We'll talk on the road.

284
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:37,912
Alright.

285
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:41,912
(Zheng Family Ancestral Hall)

286
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:42,751
Ms. Zheng is here.

287
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:43,831
Ms. Zheng is here.

288
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,392
Ms. Zheng.

289
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,272
Ms. Zheng is here.

290
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:48,392
Ms. Zheng is here.

291
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:49,591
Ms. Zheng is here.

292
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:50,192
He's here.

293
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:50,991
Ms. Zheng is here.

294
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,032
Ms. Zheng is here.

295
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,432
Ms. Zheng is here.

296
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:54,471
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng knows.

297
00:14:55,072 --> 00:14:55,912
- Let's go.
- Go.

298
00:14:57,016 --> 00:15:03,325
(In One's Prime)

299
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:28,111
Alright.

300
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:29,511
Since she's applied,

301
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,432
let's wait for the results first.

302
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:32,871
Can't you have some principles?

303
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:35,991
My principle
is respecting Qiuping's choice.

304
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:37,912
She should be in the provincial capital.

305
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:39,351
She should marry Du Tao.

306
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:40,511
Do you understand?

307
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:41,751
Do you not want her to go?

308
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:42,792
I don't want her to go?

309
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,152
Hadn't you made that scene years ago,

310
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:47,792
she would've stayed there
right after graduation.

311
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:48,792
Li Dafu,

312
00:15:49,272 --> 00:15:50,231
have you no shame?

313
00:15:50,672 --> 00:15:51,591
Was I making a scene?

314
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,312
If you hadn't cheated on me,

315
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:54,432
would I have drunk poison?

316
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:55,392
Listen to me.

317
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:56,591
I will never allow

318
00:15:56,711 --> 00:15:58,072
Qiuping to set foot in that dump.

319
00:15:58,272 --> 00:15:59,152
Look at you.

320
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,792
Always too controlling.

321
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:02,552
Anyone would leave you.

322
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,072
Qiuping?

323
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:38,272
Why are you here so late?

324
00:16:38,471 --> 00:16:39,672
I'm back for some work.

325
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:41,392
I'd like to use the meeting room.

326
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:42,552
Okay.

327
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:43,871
Here.

328
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:45,032
I'll head off first.

329
00:16:48,511 --> 00:16:49,032
Zhang.

330
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:51,312
How many applied this time?

331
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,231
Nineteen.

332
00:16:55,152 --> 00:16:56,152
Got it. Thanks.

333
00:16:56,272 --> 00:16:56,751
No problem.

334
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:03,432
Miss,

335
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,031
I must submit my application.

336
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,112
This is...

337
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,071
This is your application form?

338
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:12,031
Yes.

339
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:14,511
Actually, I intended
to submit it this afternoon.

340
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:15,632
But I didn't make it.

341
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,271
I've been swamped.

342
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,311
And I couldn't find my original form.

343
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:20,991
So I had to make do with this.

344
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:21,952
Sorry about that.

345
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:23,672
Sorry.

346
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:25,791
The application deadline has passed.

347
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:28,192
Mr. Zhao said punctuality is a must.

348
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:30,952
Wait,

349
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:31,991
what do you mean?

350
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:33,791
I've already explained.

351
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:34,711
I didn't mean this.

352
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,352
I was just too busy.

353
00:17:36,352 --> 00:17:37,632
So I was delayed a bit.

354
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:39,551
Just take it.

355
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:40,432
- Okay?
- Sir.

356
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:41,991
You weren't just a little late.

357
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,991
You were hours late.

358
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:48,231
Why are you being
such a stickler for the rules?

359
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:51,551
Do you have any idea
what this application means?

360
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:52,551
Do you know

361
00:17:52,632 --> 00:17:55,832
the impact of refusing this form
could be enormous for the future?

362
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:57,271
Do you even know who I am?

363
00:17:58,352 --> 00:17:58,952
You are...

364
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,231
Whoever you are,

365
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:01,872
you still have to follow the rules.

366
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,872
Zheng Decheng, right?

367
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:04,751
Yes.

368
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:08,791
The election for the Secretary of Yuehai
is a major county event.

369
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:12,912
It's a key initiative for Pingchuan's
development in the coming decades.

370
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:15,672
All cadres volunteering
to work in Yuehai

371
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:17,672
submitted their applications on time.

372
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:18,872
But you?

373
00:18:19,592 --> 00:18:21,071
You missed the deadline.

374
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,192
And you presented this as a substitute.

375
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:25,551
Is this your attitude and sincerity?

376
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,872
Who says I'm not sincere?

377
00:18:27,952 --> 00:18:29,511
What's wrong with my attitude?

378
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:32,592
I planned to submit it much earlier.

379
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:33,912
But I had no choice.

380
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,192
I've been swamped.

381
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,152
Do you know what I was just handling?

382
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:38,991
I was dealing with a huge matter.

383
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:39,952
It's Yuehai's future...

384
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,112
I won't argue with you.

385
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,471
I'm leaving the form here.

386
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,551
I'd like to see if the leadership
will accept my application.

387
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:52,991
And you,

388
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:54,152
what's your name?

389
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:55,152
What's your role?

390
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:56,071
Your supervisor?

391
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:56,991
Who taught you?

392
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:59,392
I'm Li Qiuping,
a secretary of the county committee.

393
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:01,311
I don't need you telling me
how to do my job.

394
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:08,432
Fine.

395
00:19:09,031 --> 00:19:09,751
You win.

396
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:11,551
It's not worth arguing.

397
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,672
But mark my words today.

398
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:17,352
All the other applicants
are just here to make up the numbers.

399
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:20,311
Don't run away.

400
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:24,112
Zheng Decheng,

401
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:27,192
even if you are remarkable,

402
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,832
you still need
to submit a proper application form.

403
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:31,231
Amidst rules,

404
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:33,551
there's no room
for your individual heroics.

405
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:36,432
Take this cigarette pack back.

406
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:44,271
Miss Li,

407
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,551
listen carefully.

408
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:48,392
To build Yuehai City,

409
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:50,632
if the nation funds it,

410
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:54,112
any Party member could be its secretary.

411
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,271
If they don't fund it,

412
00:19:56,991 --> 00:20:00,271
then only I, Zheng Decheng,
can be that secretary.

413
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:09,551
Lunatic.

414
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:10,872
Exactly.

415
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,471
Leaders,

416
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,872
these are all the candidates who applied
to run for Secretary of Yuehai.

417
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:58,872
Today, we need to select
the final few candidates from them.

418
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,511
The situation is more optimistic
than I expected.

419
00:21:03,952 --> 00:21:04,751
I've checked.

420
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,672
Nineteen have applied.

421
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:08,031
It should be twenty.

422
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,592
Zheng Decheng
applied too late yesterday.

423
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:14,952
Guan,

424
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:16,632
how could we take a cigarette pack?

425
00:21:17,031 --> 00:21:17,872
It's inappropriate.

426
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:19,031
Zheng Decheng

427
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,071
is far too flippant.

428
00:21:20,392 --> 00:21:21,471
Li helped take it.

429
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:24,632
She said Zheng Decheng
lost the application form yesterday.

430
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:26,231
That still won't do.

431
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:27,311
Look, Guan,

432
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:30,152
you can't favor Zheng Decheng because

433
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:31,231
he worked for you.

434
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:33,872
It's fine. In a special time,

435
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,432
if it's not a matter of principle,

436
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:36,352
don't sweat it.

437
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:37,231
Come on.

438
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:39,511
Let's discuss the 20 applicants.

439
00:21:40,088 --> 00:21:42,432
(Pingchuan County People's Government
Pingchuan County Committee)

440
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:45,231
(That day, the meeting went on
from afternoon late into the night.)

441
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:50,672
(The leadership was especially cautious
about the candidates.)

442
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:54,471
(Yuehai's development
is vital to the county's progress.)

443
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:59,152
(Allowing cadres to volunteer
was an unprecedented initiative.)

444
00:22:00,672 --> 00:22:03,392
(Everyone was waiting for the outcome.)

445
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:18,392
Okay.

446
00:22:20,112 --> 00:22:20,791
Mr. Zhao.

447
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:22,296
Magistrate Xia.

448
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:30,551
Well,

449
00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:32,751
leaders,

450
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:34,952
I know this is highly irregular,

451
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:36,991
but I still have to ask,

452
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:42,031
is my name on the list of candidates
for the election or not?

453
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:44,192
Then why do you even ask?

454
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:46,071
I'm not telling you.

455
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,085
(Conference Room)

456
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,031
Director Cai.

457
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:34,071
Thanks.

458
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:40,511
Thanks.

459
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:41,991
You're welcome.

460
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:48,751
See?

461
00:23:49,352 --> 00:23:50,031
I got chosen.

462
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:52,311
A cigarette pack got me here.

463
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:10,471
You're here.

464
00:24:11,071 --> 00:24:12,432
- Minister Guan.
- Mr. Cai, come here.

465
00:24:12,632 --> 00:24:12,912
Okay.

466
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:13,952
- Mr. Guan.
- Sit.

467
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:15,231
Come on.

468
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:16,952
I'll keep it brief.

469
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:17,791
Just sit down.

470
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,031
I'll be brief.

471
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:24,392
After serious and careful deliberation,
the Standing Committee has decided

472
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,311
that you three will be the candidates
for Secretary of Yuehai.

473
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:30,231
However,

474
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:31,711
there will be a speech segment.

475
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:33,352
After the speeches,

476
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:35,392
we will make the final decision.

477
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:38,991
Miss Li,

478
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:40,912
you're truly formidable.

479
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:42,432
Thank you!

480
00:24:43,592 --> 00:24:44,192
Decheng,

481
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,551
your reputation precedes you.

482
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:48,192
What reputation?

483
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,071
A good one.

484
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:54,751
You all, take note.

485
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,352
The time is Monday at 2 PM.

486
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,256
At the county committee auditorium.

487
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:02,311
Each of you
must deliver a campaign speech.

488
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:04,511
Okay.

489
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:05,711
Mr. Guan,

490
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,632
may I ask if there's an outline?

491
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:08,912
No.

492
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,791
I don't know what they will ask.

493
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,271
But I think

494
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:15,751
you'll need to elaborate
on building Yuehai City.

495
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:17,672
And make it detailed.

496
00:25:18,192 --> 00:25:18,952
Go get prepared.

497
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:19,952
- Okay.
- Okay.

498
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:20,344
Alright.

499
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:21,632
I need to go. See you.

500
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,551
Do I even need to prepare?

501
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:25,551
This stuff is already in my head.

502
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:26,231
All of it.

503
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:29,991
Prepare well.

504
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:31,031
You.

505
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:33,311
Mr. Guan, take care.

506
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:33,912
Okay.

507
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:35,152
Decheng, you...

508
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:36,632
you're something.

509
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:41,672
Li.

510
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:45,152
So that's it.

511
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:47,071
What do you mean?

512
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:49,231
You refused to take my application form

513
00:25:49,432 --> 00:25:51,192
and gave all those righteous lectures.

514
00:25:52,152 --> 00:25:54,632
It's because you also applied, right?

515
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:00,672
It's okay.

516
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:02,471
No need to explain. I get it.

517
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:03,551
I can understand.

518
00:26:04,152 --> 00:26:05,511
No one dares compete with me.

519
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:06,872
After all, I

520
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:07,632
- do...
- Little man.

521
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:10,791
Wha... what 'men'?

522
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:12,592
Li... Litter men?

523
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:13,991
What's that mean?

524
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:16,432
Foreign language?

525
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:19,551
Think knowing it makes you special?

526
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,031
Will your parents be okay

527
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:26,511
with you being here tonight?

528
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:27,592
It's fine.

529
00:26:27,952 --> 00:26:28,711
Just one night.

530
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:30,311
Until the election is over.

531
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:32,912
Tomorrow's the big battle.

532
00:26:33,432 --> 00:26:34,791
Go prepare your speech

533
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:35,952
instead of drawing.

534
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:42,991
Listen to me.

535
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:46,392
Your two rivals
are not to be underestimated.

536
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,751
One has extensive political experience

537
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,751
and is as steady as a rock.

538
00:26:52,192 --> 00:26:54,551
The other is both cunning and capable.

539
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:57,192
You need to watch out
for that cunning one.

540
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,152
Do you hear me?

541
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:04,952
I've heard plenty about him
at the government office.

542
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:07,311
They say to help villagers get rich,

543
00:27:08,352 --> 00:27:10,231
he ran shops, grew fruit,

544
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:11,551
and raised turtles.

545
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,751
Now he's
the secretary of Jiangku District.

546
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:16,152
He's caused quite a stir.

547
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:19,751
I'm really worried for you.

548
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,551
What is your strength?

549
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:23,311
What have you ever raised?

550
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:24,231
Liu,

551
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:26,592
what do you think my strength is?

552
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:32,751
Decheng,

553
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:34,152
having confidence

554
00:27:34,231 --> 00:27:35,152
is surely good.

555
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,672
But don't underestimate your opponents.

556
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:38,192
Understand?

557
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:41,071
Your two competitors
are tough nuts to crack.

558
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:42,311
Be it Cai Gang

559
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:43,672
or Li Qiuping...

560
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:44,672
Wait, I remember.

561
00:27:44,672 --> 00:27:45,711
Aren't I making sense?

562
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,271
Dapeng,

563
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,192
there's this foreign phrase.

564
00:27:48,392 --> 00:27:50,112
Read forward, it's 'men litter.'

565
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:51,512
Read backward, it's 'litter men.'

566
00:27:51,632 --> 00:27:52,551
What does it mean?

567
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:55,071
Litter men?

568
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:57,991
Little man.

569
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:58,952
Or small man.

570
00:27:59,192 --> 00:28:00,112
Small man?

571
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:01,392
What does that mean?

572
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:03,432
You don't know

573
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,192
what that means?

574
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:05,912
It describes a man

575
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:07,832
who's narrow-minded and petty.

576
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:08,511
Who said that?

577
00:28:08,592 --> 00:28:09,471
Am I narrow-minded?

578
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:10,551
Not at all.

579
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:11,271
Not at all.

580
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:13,791
Then how do you say 'small woman'?

581
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:14,672
I know this one.

582
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:15,592
I know.

583
00:28:15,672 --> 00:28:16,711
Hold on, let me think.

584
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:20,271
Litter woman.

585
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:22,832
Litter woman?

586
00:28:24,352 --> 00:28:25,231
Wait, Decheng.

587
00:28:25,592 --> 00:28:27,471
Does it relate to the election
of tomorrow?

588
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:29,311
With your level,
maybe stop teaching Dad.

589
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:30,392
It's 'little woman.'

590
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:31,432
What's the difference?

591
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:32,791
Isn't that 'litter woman'?

592
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:33,031
Yeah.

593
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,112
What accent is that?

594
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:35,271
Mine is better than yours.

595
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:36,632
Stop bickering.

596
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:37,672
Litter woman.

597
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:39,791
Litter woman.

598
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,672
Litter woman.

599
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:46,112
As for Zheng Decheng,

600
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:47,791
I experienced him firsthand recently.

601
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:49,352
He's quite the rascal.

602
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:51,231
Right?

603
00:28:51,912 --> 00:28:52,432
What can you

604
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:53,672
do with a rascal?

605
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:56,071
What can I do?

606
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:58,751
I'll hit him hard with this.

607
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:02,592
You spent all night on this. Be careful.

608
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:03,271
Time for bed.

609
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:03,711
Right.

610
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:18,352
Great Bolshevik,

611
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:19,592
I am Lenin.

612
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:20,872
Lenin.

613
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:36,471
Nothing feels right.

614
00:29:37,832 --> 00:29:39,192
Lend me some of your clothes.

615
00:29:39,832 --> 00:29:40,952
My speech is tomorrow.

616
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:43,311
My clothes aren't as good as yours.

617
00:29:45,271 --> 00:29:45,832
Decheng,

618
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:46,751
you are

619
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:48,672
so eager to build a city there.

620
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:51,112
Is this about my sister's dying wish?

621
00:29:55,471 --> 00:29:55,991
Decheng,

622
00:29:56,511 --> 00:29:57,352
tomorrow's election

623
00:29:57,471 --> 00:29:59,392
has caused quite a stir
throughout the county.

624
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:00,471
Your two rivals

625
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,192
are the County Committee Office's star

626
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:04,592
and the most reliable cadre
recognized county-wide.

627
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:06,632
You need to take this seriously.

628
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:08,071
If you don't, you'll lose.

629
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:10,152
Lose?

630
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:12,672
What are you talking about?

631
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:13,711
Listen to me.

632
00:30:14,352 --> 00:30:17,471
The Standing Committee will make
an official decision tomorrow afternoon.

633
00:30:18,031 --> 00:30:21,952
appointing me, Zheng Decheng,
as Secretary of Yuehai.

634
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,271
Mr. Cai.

635
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:44,352
You're here early.

636
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:46,711
Nice suit.

637
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:53,511
Li.

638
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:55,432
Zheng Decheng.

639
00:30:55,872 --> 00:30:56,872
Your seat is over there.

640
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:58,952
Come here.

641
00:30:59,152 --> 00:30:59,592
Come on.

642
00:30:59,872 --> 00:31:01,071
(Drawing box)
Draw your order of appearance.

643
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,392
Lady first then.

644
00:31:02,432 --> 00:31:03,152
Yes, you go first.

645
00:31:03,352 --> 00:31:04,511
Alright, I'll go first.

646
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:07,352
Mr. Cai, you go.

647
00:31:07,352 --> 00:31:07,872
You go first.

648
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:08,432
You first.

649
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:08,872
It's fine.

650
00:31:08,991 --> 00:31:09,872
Don't be too polite.

651
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:11,471
Too much politeness wastes time.

652
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,096
(No. 1)

653
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:17,848
(No. 2)

654
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,231
You'll follow this order later.

655
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:21,231
(No. 3)
Okay, Mr. Guan.

656
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:21,711
Okay.

657
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:25,632
Sir, your jacket.

658
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,392
Thanks.

659
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:31,751
Guan,

660
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:33,832
that's a nice jacket you have.

661
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,192
Lend it to me. Lend it to me.

662
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,231
I've caught a cold.

663
00:31:37,231 --> 00:31:38,672
- I...
- I'll give you mine.

664
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,311
You...

665
00:31:40,672 --> 00:31:41,271
It's fine.

666
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:42,031
Wait.

667
00:31:42,031 --> 00:31:42,991
- I put it on this morning.
- Hurry.

668
00:31:43,112 --> 00:31:43,991
- It's clean.
- Hurry.

669
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:44,912
Smell it. It's clean.

670
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:45,872
(No. 1)
You have a cold.

671
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,311
Just smell it. Smell it.

672
00:31:48,311 --> 00:31:48,832
Prepare well.

673
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:49,912
Take it. Don't get sick.

674
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:50,672
Look at you.

675
00:31:50,872 --> 00:31:51,511
You...

676
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:54,711
Want to swap?

677
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:55,711
No.

678
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:56,432
Miss Li,

679
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:57,832
if you don't want to go first,

680
00:31:58,112 --> 00:31:58,432
we...

681
00:31:58,432 --> 00:31:59,471
Fine. I'll swap with you.

682
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:01,311
Okay.

683
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:02,071
Mr. Cai.

684
00:32:02,912 --> 00:32:04,152
Don't want to be next to me?

685
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:05,208
That's not it.

686
00:32:05,432 --> 00:32:06,192
Miss Li is young.

687
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:08,231
It might be too stressful
for her to go first.

688
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:18,603
(Cai Gang, Li Qiuping, Zheng Decheng)

689
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,952
(Yuehai Town, Pingchuan County)

690
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:20,344
Come on.

691
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:21,471
Mr. Zhao, here.

692
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:23,592
Ready?

693
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:40,912
We can begin.

694
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:43,031
Well, who's first?

695
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,271
Mr. Zhao, I'm first.

696
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:46,952
Okay.

697
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,616
(Secretary Election of
Yuehai Town, Pingchuan County)

698
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:11,632
Leaders,

699
00:33:13,152 --> 00:33:15,392
I am Cai Gang
from the County Land Bureau.

700
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:19,711
I've been working for 23 years.

701
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:22,511
In my work position,

702
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:25,511
I have always been diligent
and conscientious.

703
00:33:26,152 --> 00:33:28,192
I've received commendations 23 times.

704
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,751
Looking back,
under the leadership of Magistrate Xia,

705
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:35,192
I received verbal praise
over a hundred times.

706
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:37,551
Cai Gang,

707
00:33:37,832 --> 00:33:38,912
get straight to the point.

708
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:40,751
We're aware of the information

709
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,872
you just mentioned.

710
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:44,432
Okay.

711
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:46,832
The point.

712
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,231
So nervous?

713
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:56,672
It's fine. He's a veteran.

714
00:33:57,432 --> 00:33:57,991
Mr. Zhao,

715
00:33:58,751 --> 00:33:59,991
he is a bit nervous.

716
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:02,352
Don't be nervous.

717
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:12,792
I believe for Yuehai to establish itself
quickly in the early stages,

718
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:15,912
it must first secure support
from state-owned enterprises

719
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,151
to solve the early-stage
city-building funding issue.

720
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:21,551
Wrong thought.

721
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:23,591
Zheng Decheng,

722
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,952
you are a candidate,

723
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:26,432
not a judge.

724
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:29,392
If we estimate 500 workers per factory,

725
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:31,071
plus their family members,

726
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:36,312
then Yuehai's initial population
must reach at least 10,000.

727
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:38,752
Li,

728
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:41,232
you don't think the same way, do you?

729
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:43,111
That could be one approach.

730
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:45,031
Therefore, my goal is

731
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:48,872
to have Yuehai reach a population
of 20,000 within one year.

732
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:51,792
And the primary economic source
for city development

733
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:54,272
will come
from state-owned enterprises' revenue.

734
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:56,752
That will drive local economic growth.

735
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:00,392
That's my plan for building Yuehai.

736
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:02,232
Leaders,

737
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,511
I'm willing to step forward

738
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:11,031
and shoulder my due responsibility.

739
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:27,792
Mr. Zhao,

740
00:35:27,912 --> 00:35:29,912
I think Cai Gang's idea is quite solid

741
00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:31,432
and highly feasible.

742
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:37,872
Miss Li, it's your turn.

743
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:38,551
Okay.

744
00:35:42,872 --> 00:35:43,591
Li,

745
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:45,272
relax.

746
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:46,591
You've got this.

747
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:48,111
Thank you.

748
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:49,191
You're welcome.

749
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:50,352
Litter woman.

750
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:52,832
Naive.

751
00:36:00,832 --> 00:36:02,031
Respected leaders,

752
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:02,832
hello.

753
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:04,031
I'm Li Qiuping.

754
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:07,071
While co-authoring
the Pingchuan County Annals,

755
00:36:07,191 --> 00:36:08,712
I often heard locals say

756
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:09,631
Yuehai is a...

757
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:10,191
Mr. Cai,

758
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:12,591
don't be nervous. Just relax.

759
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,272
It's okay.

760
00:36:15,392 --> 00:36:16,111
I'm relaxed.

761
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:17,352
Right?

762
00:36:18,272 --> 00:36:18,792
Today,

763
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:20,792
I'm deeply honored to stand here

764
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:24,312
to present three visions
for building Yuehai.

765
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:26,008
Road construction through loans,

766
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,312
pillar industries,

767
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:29,191
and city character.

768
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,872
I've brought something to show you.

769
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:43,912
What is this?

770
00:36:44,191 --> 00:36:45,631
Why so many markings on it?

771
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:48,031
This is a city planning map I designed.

772
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,591
I participated in Yuehai's
preliminary planning and surveying,

773
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:54,352
gaining a deeper understanding
of this land.

774
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:57,111
I discovered its topography and location

775
00:36:57,392 --> 00:36:59,551
share similarities with some cities

776
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:02,312
I visited during my studies in France.

777
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:04,031
We can emulate them

778
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,591
by turning disadvantages into strengths.

779
00:37:06,872 --> 00:37:08,912
As the saying goes,
pave the way to prosperity.

780
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:12,071
Building roads can connect Yuehai
to the outside world quickly,

781
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:14,792
laying foundations
for population and capital inflow.

782
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,151
A city comes alive

783
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:18,272
when transportation thrives.

784
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:20,191
Is road construction so novel?

785
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:22,191
France? Well...

786
00:37:22,312 --> 00:37:23,232
Is this necessary?

787
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:26,232
Her roads differ from ordinary ones.

788
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:27,151
Now,

789
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:31,111
I'll detail my planning map.

790
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:33,392
Please look at this map.

791
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:35,551
Li Qiuping,

792
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:38,591
Songxiang is a six-century-old town

793
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:41,312
with its North Gate Street
just four meters wide.

794
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:45,272
Jiangku's east-west street,
a main artery, is only five meters.

795
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:48,471
Your barely-existent Yuehai Town

796
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:51,352
plans forty-to-fifty-meter-wide avenues?

797
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:54,071
This is sheer land wastage.

798
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:55,752
Exactly. How irresponsible.

799
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:56,151
Right?

800
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,872
I believe with Reform and Opening Up,

801
00:37:58,232 --> 00:37:59,272
in the near future,

802
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:01,631
private car ownership
will become universal in China.

803
00:38:02,232 --> 00:38:03,111
Wide roads

804
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:06,392
can address increasing vehicles
and traffic congestion.

805
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:07,991
Li Qiuping,

806
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:10,392
ignoring your truck example,

807
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:13,071
but predicting universal private cars
within 30 years

808
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,832
is overly idealistic, isn't it?

809
00:38:15,551 --> 00:38:16,671
Let her finish first.

810
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:17,031
Well,

811
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:18,312
this isn't just idealism.

812
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:19,071
Leaders,

813
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:22,432
I not only foresee
universal private cars in 30 years

814
00:38:23,272 --> 00:38:24,191
but also believe

815
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,312
Yuehai will become the next Nanzhou

816
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,991
or even the next Shanghai.

817
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,591
I dare say this

818
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:33,272
because I recognize
Yuehai's latent advantage:

819
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:35,352
building pillar industries.

820
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:37,991
Speaking of pillar industries,

821
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:40,511
what do you propose for Yuehai?

822
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:44,111
Pingchuan County
already has foundations in the printing

823
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,471
and textile industries.

824
00:38:45,752 --> 00:38:47,191
They just haven't reached scale yet.

825
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:50,272
As the saying goes,
great oaks from little acorns grow.

826
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:56,031
By integrating advantageous industries
into what we call pillar industries,

827
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:57,792
plus the transportation network,

828
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,511
we can deliver
our local products nationwide,

829
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,272
even worldwide.

830
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:03,272
Well.

831
00:39:03,392 --> 00:39:04,912
This is pure fantasy.

832
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:08,912
Pillar industries?

833
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:10,191
Worldwide?

834
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:11,712
And printing?

835
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:14,392
Why wouldn't people
go to Beijing or Shanghai?

836
00:39:14,872 --> 00:39:16,551
Why would they have to come here?

837
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:18,312
It's daydreaming.

838
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,191
This idea isn't bad.

839
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:23,312
Li Qiuping,

840
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:25,712
let me summarize what you just said.

841
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:27,551
You mentioned the city's character.

842
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,591
Can it be achieved solely
by improving residents' quality?

843
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:32,712
Yes.

844
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:35,872
In the building of Yuehai City,

845
00:39:36,151 --> 00:39:38,232
I will guide
and improve residents' quality.

846
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,591
We must build
and maintain simultaneously,

847
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,912
establishing
an orderly and progressive city

848
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:46,071
so that Yuehai
has its own distinct city character.

849
00:39:52,312 --> 00:39:54,191
What's the use of doing this now?

850
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:55,671
A city has character?

851
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,312
That's all.

852
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:58,792
Thank you, leaders.

853
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:09,071
This is the first time
I've heard such a notion.

854
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:12,671
All this talk is just fluff.

855
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:17,631
Li,

856
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:20,151
I'd only heard of 'armchair generals,'

857
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:22,912
but never thought
I'd see one in the flesh.

858
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:24,631
But for an armchair general,

859
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,631
you're quite good.

860
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:27,551
Your turn, little man.

861
00:40:57,392 --> 00:40:58,832
I won't bother introducing myself.

862
00:40:59,912 --> 00:41:02,872
Regarding building Yuehai City,
I have only one phrase.

863
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:03,591
Zheng Decheng,

864
00:41:03,952 --> 00:41:05,432
stop beating around the bush.

865
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:06,952
Speak plainly.

866
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:12,912
A people's city is built by the people.

867
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,591
Elaborate on that.

868
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:19,671
The county has no funds
to support Yuehai's construction.

869
00:41:20,232 --> 00:41:21,272
So I believe

870
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:25,071
we can only mobilize the 'monkeys'
from each township

871
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,000
to become Yuehai's first citizens.

872
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,071
I've calculated

873
00:41:28,191 --> 00:41:31,551
that each family
would need 6,000 to 10,000 yuan

874
00:41:31,752 --> 00:41:33,031
to settle in Yuehai.

875
00:41:33,392 --> 00:41:35,392
Only 'monkeys'
have this financial foundation.

876
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:37,952
Therefore, I believe

877
00:41:38,352 --> 00:41:41,471
Yuehai's first citizens
must primarily be 'monkeys.'

878
00:41:42,352 --> 00:41:43,151
'Monkeys'?

879
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,191
Mr. Zhao,

880
00:41:44,272 --> 00:41:45,392
we locals refer to...

881
00:41:45,392 --> 00:41:46,352
What 'monkeys'?

882
00:41:46,631 --> 00:41:47,991
They're 10,000-yuan households.

883
00:41:48,832 --> 00:41:49,551
Mr. Zhao,

884
00:41:49,832 --> 00:41:51,631
you might not be fully aware yet.

885
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,352
The traditional character
for 'ten thousand'...

886
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:57,232
It looks like a monkey
hanging from a tree with both hands.

887
00:41:57,912 --> 00:42:00,031
So the 'monkeys'
are the 10,000-yuan households.

888
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:01,111
Miss Li,

889
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:02,952
your time in the grassroots
wasn't wasted.

890
00:42:04,471 --> 00:42:05,191
Zheng Decheng.

891
00:42:05,912 --> 00:42:07,792
(Ten thousand)
If it's all 'monkeys,'

892
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:12,232
what would Yuehai Town's
total population even be?

893
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:14,671
Fifty thousand.

894
00:42:19,392 --> 00:42:20,151
Fifty thousand?

895
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:22,352
Wait, are you joking?

896
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:24,071
This isn't some fairy tale.

897
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:26,104
Zheng Decheng,

898
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:27,752
you can't talk nonsense.

899
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:29,151
Back that up.

900
00:42:29,432 --> 00:42:32,191
As of now, Pingchuan County

901
00:42:32,631 --> 00:42:35,071
has around 6,000 farming 'monkeys.'

902
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:38,232
Assuming five people per household,

903
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:40,991
that adds up to over 30,000 residents.

904
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,912
Plus the 7,000 or 8,000
original Yuehai villagers,

905
00:42:45,712 --> 00:42:47,071
it totals over 40,000 people.

906
00:42:47,952 --> 00:42:49,551
So within a year,

907
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:50,952
reaching a population of 50,000

908
00:42:51,352 --> 00:42:52,632
is absolutely not a fairy tale.
