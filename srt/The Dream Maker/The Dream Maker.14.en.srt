Ms. Li,

34
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,107
I'm really putting on weight.

35
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,987
Don't believe me?
Let me get on the scale, so you can see.

36
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:14,746
Alright. But remember,
the plan was to gain at least 2.5 kilos.

37
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:15,706
No problem.

38
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:30,026
It's 68 kilos.

39
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:32,267
- Meng.
- No way.

40
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:34,787
- What was Mr. Lin's prior weight?
- It was 70.5 kilos.

41
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,107
See? You've lost weight.

42
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:38,227
Stop looking.

43
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:39,347
This can't be right.

44
00:03:39,507 --> 00:03:41,947
I eat five meals a day. How could I...

45
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,426
Your face has even sunken in.

46
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:44,626
Exactly.

47
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,507
Right. Five full meals every day.

48
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,426
We even prepared his five meals
on schedule.

49
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:48,987
Right.

50
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:50,026
See? Right?

51
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:53,586
Yes.

52
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,706
You did lose weight.
Why did you become so thin?

53
00:03:57,107 --> 00:03:58,347
Tan, what do you think?

54
00:03:58,866 --> 00:03:59,366
Me?

55
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:01,507
My eyesight's bad. I can't see clearly.

56
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,706
- Xie.
- No weight gained.

57
00:04:03,107 --> 00:04:03,787
- Impossible.
- Target not met.

58
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,947
Impossible. Impossible.

59
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:07,667
I... I couldn't have lost weight.

60
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:08,866
I've been...

61
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,026
What's in your pockets?

62
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:12,547
Nothing there.

63
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:13,146
Get him.

64
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:13,787
Nothing.

65
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:14,626
Come on.

66
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:15,366
Search him.

67
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:16,866
What are you doing?

68
00:04:16,907 --> 00:04:17,688
Following orders.

69
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,426
Resist and we'll tickle you.

70
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,227
Stop it.

71
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:21,426
Stop it.

72
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:23,707
Let go.

73
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:24,547
Don't resist.

74
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:25,506
Just bear with it.

75
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:26,707
What are you trying to do?

76
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,107
The pockets.

77
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:29,667
I...

78
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:30,907
Why are you unbuttoning me?

79
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,587
Nothing to hide, so why panic?

80
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:33,266
Right.

81
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:34,186
You're guilty.

82
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:35,306
Something's inside.

83
00:04:35,426 --> 00:04:35,946
Look.

84
00:04:39,426 --> 00:04:39,987
Heavy stuff.

85
00:04:43,347 --> 00:04:43,866
What's this?

86
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:45,386
What's this?

87
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:46,386
So heavy?

88
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,186
You really...

89
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:50,027
You seem honest.

90
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:52,587
No need to get angry.

91
00:04:54,386 --> 00:04:56,066
Let's go. Stop looking.

92
00:04:59,066 --> 00:04:59,826
To be honest,

93
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,907
well, I think
he has put on a bit of weight.

94
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:05,667
Plus the weight of these nuts,

95
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:07,066
how could he still...

96
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,667
Just simple physics.

97
00:05:11,587 --> 00:05:12,587
Magnets?

98
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,826
Ms. Li, that's what Mr. Zheng would do.

99
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:18,386
When did you learn to be so sneaky?

100
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,306
Ms. Li is quite impressive.

101
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,886
- Did you see that?
- She has potential.

102
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:26,407
Knowledge is power. Understand?

103
00:05:26,987 --> 00:05:28,066
Don't ever offend Ms. Li.

104
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:31,126
Take these.

105
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,728
No one would dare offend her.

106
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:35,506
Qingtian, take it back.

107
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:36,266
Okay.

108
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:38,087
It's heavy. Let me check out the weight.

109
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:38,806
Alright.

110
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:40,426
Just let me go back.

111
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,306
Master, just listen to Mr. Zheng.

112
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:44,306
He is doing this for your health.

113
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,527
I'm fully recovered, Mr. Zheng.

114
00:05:46,707 --> 00:05:48,907
I haven't been to the site in ages.
I'm anxious.

115
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,866
Besides, with the hospital's
wiring unfinished, how can I rest easy?

116
00:05:51,946 --> 00:05:54,467
Yu, hear him?
Your master doesn't trust your work.

117
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:55,587
That's not what I meant.

118
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:56,426
You meant that.

119
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,547
Mr. Zheng,
that's not what my master meant.

120
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:00,347
- Your master meant exactly that.
- He's just worried about the wiring.

121
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,107
Who'll you help? Stand here.

122
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:03,227
Don't move.

123
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:06,826
I'll show you who's boss.

124
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:08,707
Mr. Zheng, be gentle.

125
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:11,766
Mr. Zheng.

126
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,667
Mr. Zheng! What are you doing?

127
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:38,907
Without my order,

128
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,027
no one opens that door for him.
Understood?

129
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:42,266
Rest assured.

130
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,266
You are very childish.

131
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:57,496
Who are you looking for?

132
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:01,907
I'd like to see

133
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:03,866
Li Qiuping, mayor of Yuehai Town.

134
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:08,506
She isn't in.
What did you need to see her about?

135
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:11,787
The thing is, my superior asked me
to deliver something to her.

136
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:14,746
Let me see.

137
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:27,266
This letter introduces Du Tao,
a reporter from our publication.

138
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:31,107
(Letter of Introduction)
Assigned to establish the Yuehai Column,

139
00:07:31,386 --> 00:07:36,066
he will conduct research and interviews
at your location. For one year?

140
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:48,907
Mr. Hailuo.

141
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:50,426
Xiaoli,

142
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:52,987
why are you dressed like that today?

143
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:54,227
Looks good?

144
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:11,686
Ms. Xiao, get me some food.

145
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,167
(Today's menu)
You...

146
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:16,446
Mr. Zheng.

147
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,866
Meng Xiaoli, are you okay?

148
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:27,386
Mr. Zheng.

149
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,227
Well? Does it look good?

150
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:33,304
I went to the Sunshine Barber Shop
to have Lili do it.

151
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,786
Why are you dressed like this?

152
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:39,187
Isn't Reporter Du coming soon?

153
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:41,587
Shouldn't I tidy up to look presentable?

154
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,707
What does his visit have to do with you?

155
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,467
Reporter Du has a camera with him.

156
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:47,866
He'll definitely take photos of us.

157
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:51,064
If my dusty face gets in the newspaper,
people in the province will see it.

158
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:53,187
But you don't need
to dress like a monster.

159
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:57,467
Look at that red lip of yours.
It looks like you just ate someone.

160
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,107
Wash that off immediately.

161
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:00,827
Mr. Zheng.

162
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:02,146
Mr. Zheng.

163
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,026
Mr. Zheng, look.

164
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:05,626
Mr. Xie dressed up as well.

165
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,227
You look nice.

166
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:08,227
Really?

167
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:10,587
Mr. Xie, you look nice too.

168
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:11,427
Thank you.

169
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:12,386
I always look like this.

170
00:09:12,906 --> 00:09:13,987
Xuemei dressed me well.

171
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:16,146
Right, Xie does care about appearances.

172
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,746
I care about the image
of our town government.

173
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:19,447
Right.

174
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:20,146
Mr. Tan.

175
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:22,347
- Yes, Mr. Tan.
- Your hairstyle today...

176
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:23,227
You are different.

177
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,107
Just a slight touch-up
for the cadre image.

178
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:27,786
So you two are

179
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:29,886
also dressed up
because Reporter Du is coming?

180
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,347
Mr. Tan is. And you need to get changed.

181
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,187
- Right. It's a major newspaper.
- Here, take mine.

182
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,386
How about you get changed?

183
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:36,906
Come on, try this on.

184
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:37,406
Go away.

185
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:38,266
Try mine on.

186
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:39,227
Stop being ridiculous.

187
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:40,087
Mr. Tan.

188
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,546
How do I look?

189
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,947
Though your intention was good,
the execution was a bit over the top.

190
00:09:45,146 --> 00:09:45,646
Alright?

191
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:46,666
It's fine.

192
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:47,827
It's alright.

193
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,274
(Work Hard, Build Yuehai Together.
Bold Exploration, Courageous Practice)

194
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:04,067
Where's Mr. Lin?

195
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,386
Well, Reporter Du

196
00:10:09,906 --> 00:10:12,666
is having a year-long in-depth interview

197
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:13,987
in Yuehai.

198
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,506
I assume everyone knows this.

199
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:20,427
I specifically invited him
to our work meeting today,

200
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:23,160
so he can conduct
in-depth investigations

201
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:25,666
and get a firsthand understanding
of our work.

202
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:26,427
- Okay?
- Welcome.

203
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:27,067
Welcome.

204
00:10:27,107 --> 00:10:27,607
Good.

205
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:31,026
Well arranged.

206
00:10:31,866 --> 00:10:32,366
Good.

207
00:10:32,386 --> 00:10:34,266
No need to be nervous, everyone.

208
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,707
Just act normally, okay?

209
00:10:35,987 --> 00:10:36,487
Relax.

210
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,107
Let's follow the usual procedure.

211
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:42,107
First, bring up any work-related issues
you each have

212
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:43,067
for discussion.

213
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:44,307
Who goes first?

214
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:52,707
Xie, you go first.

215
00:11:09,227 --> 00:11:09,987
Go ahead.

216
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,166
I have no issues. You go.

217
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:16,207
Me?

218
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,026
I'm doing fine. No issues.

219
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:27,906
Yu, you?

220
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:33,107
Mr. Zheng, I also have no issues.

221
00:11:40,587 --> 00:11:42,006
Wait...

222
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,067
With Reporter Du here,

223
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:46,427
now you've all turned mute, huh?

224
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,906
There are no issues, right?

225
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:49,506
Right.

226
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:50,386
It's a good thing.

227
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:51,006
- Right.
- Right.

228
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:52,146
Are you kidding me?

229
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:53,146
Speak up.

230
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,126
- Right.
- Speak.

231
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:55,906
Let me out!

232
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:00,807
Who's first?

233
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:01,912
That's the only issue.

234
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:02,847
Just...

235
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:03,746
What do you mean?

236
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:04,386
Wait, this...

237
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:05,746
Too talkative.

238
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:06,587
Come on. No way.

239
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,386
Is anyone there?

240
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:08,866
Mr. Zheng!

241
00:12:09,506 --> 00:12:10,827
I need to get out!

242
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:12,506
Nothing to say? You must...

243
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,786
Mr. Zheng, is that Mr. Lin's voice?

244
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:15,987
What's wrong?

245
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:16,707
It's nothing.

246
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:17,906
Ms. Li,

247
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:22,347
Mr. Zheng locked my master in the room.

248
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:23,827
Is anyone there?

249
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:26,187
You can't say that.

250
00:12:26,427 --> 00:12:27,227
- Right.
- Actually...

251
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:28,187
Well,

252
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:30,987
Lin is stubborn and won't listen to us.

253
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:32,184
He wanted to go to the site.

254
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:34,546
We had a hard time dragging him back.

255
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:37,427
And you locked him up?
That's violating personal freedom.

256
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:38,107
No.

257
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:40,026
You don't know him.
This is for his own good.

258
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,107
It's fine.
Let's continue the meeting, okay?

259
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:42,707
Let's go on.

260
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:43,827
Mr. Zheng, where's the key?

261
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:48,866
The key is with me.

262
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:50,827
Give me the key.

263
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:56,707
Give it to her.

264
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:58,666
Alright then.

265
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:00,307
Ms. Li, talk some sense into Lin.

266
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:01,227
Give it to her.

267
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:03,947
He can't ruin his health like this.

268
00:13:04,146 --> 00:13:04,866
Du. Du.

269
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:05,947
Where are you going?

270
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:07,947
You don't need to shoot this.

271
00:13:08,987 --> 00:13:09,487
Okay.

272
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:11,906
Yes, sit tight.

273
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:12,546
(Conference room)
You sit.

274
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:13,386
Sit down.

275
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:14,026
Please sit.

276
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:14,546
Drink water.

277
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:16,307
He's going to destroy his health.

278
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:16,807
It's fine.

279
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:19,546
Mr. Zheng, let me out!

280
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:21,347
Is...

281
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:21,866
I'm here.

282
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:29,707
Mr. Lin, come out.

283
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:32,987
You can go anywhere.
No one can restrict your freedom.

284
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:40,386
Thank you.

285
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:42,328
You can't go to the construction site.

286
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:54,227
Then I'd rather stay inside.

287
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:04,827
- Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li, I'll head off too.
- Alright, Liu.

288
00:14:04,987 --> 00:14:05,707
Just go.

289
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:07,567
Let's go.

290
00:14:09,947 --> 00:14:10,447
How was it?

291
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:15,666
After you opened the door,
did he tell you,

292
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:19,707
"If I can't go to the site,
I'm not coming out"?

293
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:22,467
Yes.

294
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:26,707
Ms. Li,

295
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:29,626
about Lin,

296
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:31,587
I've known him for so many years.

297
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,107
He truly throws himself
entirely into his work.

298
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:37,187
For work, he'd literally give his life.

299
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:39,746
So we have no choice.

300
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:45,786
Excuse me. Does Mr. Lin have a wife?

301
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:48,187
Come and sit over here.

302
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,026
Join us. Come on.

303
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:49,687
Come on.

304
00:14:49,786 --> 00:14:50,626
Bring your camera.

305
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:51,126
Come here.

306
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:51,947
Sit here.

307
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,746
So, does Mr. Lin have a wife?

308
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:57,146
Forget that. He's never even been
in a relationship

309
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,187
at his age.

310
00:14:59,506 --> 00:15:01,266
Then I think his situation...

311
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:02,947
Let me put it bluntly.

312
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:06,866
Isn't he kind of lacking love?

313
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:08,386
Lacking love?

314
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:10,906
Then let's

315
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,987
help him find some love.

316
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,026
Lacking love?

317
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:18,827
Why does it have to be love
that he lacks?

318
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:21,866
What about iodine or common sense?

319
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,906
I'm telling you,
your master lacks heart.

320
00:15:24,146 --> 00:15:27,727
His heart's full of work.
Nothing else gets in. Right?

321
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:28,987
It's tough.

322
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,227
Yes.

323
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:32,987
I think Reporter Du's point is right.

324
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,827
But if Lin's issue

325
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,107
is truly about romance,

326
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,786
there's nothing we can do.

327
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:39,666
We can only care.

328
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:42,187
We need a long-term plan on this.

329
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,347
That's nonsense.
You basically said nothing.

330
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,386
We have no time for a long-term plan.

331
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,506
We're swamped every day.

332
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,384
One day. Get it done by tomorrow.

333
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:52,587
Action and results.

334
00:15:53,026 --> 00:15:54,866
- How can it be solved in a day?
- Alright.

335
00:15:54,866 --> 00:15:56,026
- It must be fast.
- Enough chatter.

336
00:15:56,026 --> 00:15:59,327
If anyone has ideas,
let's discuss them properly.

337
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,506
What about Chen,
the amazing ping pong player?

338
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,427
Not nonsense again.

339
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,386
What if she becomes
an Olympic champion later?

340
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,786
Stop playing matchmaker.

341
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:11,427
She's way too young. Don't mess around.

342
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:13,546
Her main focus isn't on romance, right?

343
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:16,307
She's aiming for the provincial team.

344
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:20,427
Then Lin Tofu would've hit the jackpot
with an Olympic champion.

345
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,146
Lin Tofu. Lin Tofu.

346
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:25,467
- Ms. Li.
- Mr. Xie.

347
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,187
Look.

348
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:29,307
Our town has very few people, right?

349
00:16:30,587 --> 00:16:31,146
Well,

350
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:34,307
Meng and Yu lack dating experience.

351
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:37,266
Mr. Xie has been married over 20 years,

352
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,026
so his methods are outdated.

353
00:16:39,146 --> 00:16:40,146
We're still passionate.

354
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,626
My wife passed early.

355
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:44,386
Mr. Tan...

356
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,707
I'm not suitable.

357
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:47,266
I know you're not.

358
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:48,187
Not suitable.

359
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:49,947
That leaves you.

360
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:51,107
Me?

361
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:54,146
What? What about me?

362
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:55,506
You have experience.

363
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,467
I have no experience.

364
00:16:57,786 --> 00:16:58,286
Right.

365
00:16:58,307 --> 00:17:00,947
I can testify
that she really has no experience.

366
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:04,026
Because back then
when we got together, I pursued her.

367
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:05,667
Perfect!

368
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:07,147
So, Du,

369
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:09,746
since you're so experienced,
you handle this task.

370
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:10,707
Sit down. It's fine.

371
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:11,947
Reporter Du,

372
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:14,987
summarize your relationship experience
with Li.

373
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:16,627
That should do it.

374
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,987
So you and Li will take the task.
It's settled then.

375
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,387
How to solve Mr. Lin's problem?

376
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,826
Does Mr. Lin fall for someone?

377
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:32,667
How would I know?

378
00:17:33,187 --> 00:17:35,187
He's always
running around construction sites.

379
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:38,627
He probably has no chance
to meet single women.

380
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:40,306
Perhaps you introduce someone?

381
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,227
Who do I know?

382
00:17:43,467 --> 00:17:44,987
Mr. Zheng said to you directly

383
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:46,147
in person

384
00:17:46,467 --> 00:17:48,266
that this task is yours.

385
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,667
His exact words were

386
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:51,867
that we should both help on this.

387
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:54,227
Also, Lin is the deputy mayor,
and you're the mayor.

388
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,427
Can you really not help?

389
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:02,627
Ms. Li,

390
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:04,907
I'm totally new here.

391
00:18:04,947 --> 00:18:06,786
When will you show me around

392
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:07,987
the Yuehai Town you've built?

393
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:09,387
Tomorrow.

394
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:11,306
Besides matchmaking for Mr. Lin,

395
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:12,467
the most important thing

396
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,907
is to give you a tour of Yuehai.

397
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:16,046
Okay.

398
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:19,707
I'll wait at your dorm door
at 8 AM tomorrow.

399
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:20,786
8 AM?

400
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,627
Reporter Du, do you think
this is the provincial capital?

401
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:28,586
You packed quite thoroughly this time.

402
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,096
Yes, I'm staying a whole year.

403
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:33,266
Wonderful.

404
00:18:35,187 --> 00:18:36,504
We can see each other every day.

405
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:54,546
The two paths I'll show you today

406
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:56,066
are routes I walk every day.

407
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,026
This one is especially quiet.

408
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:03,306
In my heart, I call it Yue.

409
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:04,707
Yue?

410
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:20,227
Come and have a look!
Crisp and sweet big apples!

411
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:26,506
(Meat, Fruit)

412
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:27,907
You buy them first. Okay?

413
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:28,907
Thank you.

414
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:29,967
Sir.

415
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,627
(Vegetables, Poultry)

416
00:19:36,627 --> 00:19:38,306
This street is bustling with activity.

417
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:41,306
In my heart, I've named this street Hai.

418
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,586
Every time I walk
on these two streets in Yuehai,

419
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:46,467
my heart feels so full.

420
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:49,467
Even though Yuehai is just a small town,

421
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:52,266
I can already feel the vibe of a city.

422
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:53,667
Ms. Li, you're here.

423
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:56,266
Tried this before?

424
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:57,667
A bowl of sticky rice.

425
00:19:57,707 --> 00:19:58,467
Alright, a moment.

426
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,106
This is also very tasty.

427
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:01,506
Okay, I'll give it a try.

428
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:07,704
Qiuping, I understand
why you like this place.

429
00:20:08,152 --> 00:20:09,147
It's the people here.

430
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:13,306
People are the foundation of a city.

431
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,147
How did you
suddenly become so sentimental?

432
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:18,266
Really?

433
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,560
(Tongjiang Gate)

434
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:27,506
(Dramatic changes
happen here every day.)

435
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:31,826
(Everyone is curious and hopeful)

436
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,506
(about new things and future life.)

437
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:39,066
(The wind whispers past our ears,
bringing the sounds of every corner,)

438
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:43,907
(announcing that a new day
for this town called Yuehai)

439
00:20:44,546 --> 00:20:45,667
(has only just begun.)

440

(Ruisheng clothing store)

441
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,707
(Deputy Mayor Xie
is Yuehai's chief caretaker.)

442
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:56,346
(He's skilled with people
and versatile.)

443
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:58,707
(Everything Mr. Zheng doesn't handle,)

444
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:00,867
(Mr. Xie has to manage.)

445
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:01,707
Want them or not?

446
00:21:01,907 --> 00:21:02,947
It's a sitting area.

447
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:04,187
I know. You...

448
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:06,227
If you get on the boat, it'll capsize.

449
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,187
Whose kid is this?

450
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:08,667
Mine. Mine.

451
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,586

(It's called the Yuehai Town
City Management Inspection Brigade.)

455
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,106
(It's led by Deputy Mayor Tan.)

456
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:24,187
(They not only oversee
Yuehai's appearance and cleanliness,)

457
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:26,586
(but also serve
as defenders of the city.)

458
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,786
Thank you, sir.

459
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:29,586
Thank you.

467

No, Mr. Lin.

468
00:22:30,786 --> 00:22:33,026
You can't eat like this anymore.
Don't eat like this.

469
00:22:33,306 --> 00:22:34,627
Look, I've really put on weight.

470

I've really...

471
00:22:35,746 --> 00:22:36,266
Right.

472
00:22:36,546 --> 00:22:37,987
Look, even my belly is bulging.

473
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,786
- I understand how you feel.
- The belt is loosened by two holes.

474
00:22:40,786 --> 00:22:42,306
Mr. Lin, I understand how you feel.

475
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:43,387
You want to gain weight.

476
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:45,786
But your stomach
is still very delicate now.

477
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,227
Keep eating like that,
and you'll end up in the hospital.

478
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,656
You cannot go to the site then.

479
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,947
Did you just come back from there?

480
00:22:52,026 --> 00:22:53,066
How are things there now?

481
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:55,187
Did you take photos of the site?

482
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,387
- Wait.
- Mr. Zheng and others...

483
00:22:56,427 --> 00:22:58,227
Mr. Lin, don't rush. Sit down first.

484
00:22:58,506 --> 00:22:59,106
Look.

485
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:03,387
Here's the first article I wrote
about you when I arrived in Yuehai.

486
00:23:03,546 --> 00:23:04,187
Check it out.

487
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,627
This isn't important.

488
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,346
- Just check it out.
- The groundwater issue.

489
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:08,627
How was it resolved?

490
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:11,586
Did the road roller
have any more issues afterward?

491
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:12,586
It can't go too fast.

492
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:13,667
- Once it does...
- Mr. Lin,

493
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:16,266
don't worry. I went to Xingfu Road
yesterday and checked it out.

00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:17,586
Mr. Zheng and Yu

495
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:19,947

The construction is going smoothly.

496
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:22,106

497
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:23,992

00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:55,667
I-I am not that good.

501
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:57,306

Don't mind me. Just comb your hair.

511
00:24:22,147 --> 00:24:23,026
Don't take photos.

512
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:23,707

513
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:26,627

Hello, Ms. Gao.

You came to interview me.

522
00:25:56,667 --> 00:25:58,026
You should interview Mr. Zheng.

523
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:01,066
No, Mr. Zheng said you self-employed

the quality is truly excellent.

Right? Let me tell you.

550
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:31,106
Even with a good machine like this,
I still think it's not enough.

a few more top-of-the-line machines.

00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,667
To be honest,

553
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:38,667
back when we first started printing,

554
00:27:39,187 --> 00:27:41,066
we sold everything and borrowed money

555
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:44,187
only for one dot matrix printer.

556
00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:47,106
We didn't dare dream
about buying such good machines.

557
00:27:47,427 --> 00:27:48,187
And now?

558
00:27:48,826 --> 00:27:50,346
Just buy them without hesitation.

559
00:27:53,286 --> 00:27:53,786
Right.

560
00:27:53,786 --> 00:27:55,586
Ms. Gao, a batch of goods has arrived.

561
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:57,667
The goods are here?

562
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:02,187
Everyone, halt what you're doing.

563
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,147
Move the goods first.

564
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,147
Go move the goods.

565
00:28:04,187 --> 00:28:05,586
Hurry! Let's go!

566
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:08,026
Hurry!

567
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:08,707
Ms. Gao.

568
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,147
Your printery has so many workers.

569
00:28:11,427 --> 00:28:12,147
Exactly.

570
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:14,546
This even caused a little commotion.

571
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:18,907
Come, please come inside.
Right this way.

572
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:21,746
Come, let me show you around.

573
00:28:22,627 --> 00:28:24,467
On this district in Yuehai,

574
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:26,786
I'm the only one with a telephone.

575
00:28:27,427 --> 00:28:30,207
These "monkeys" all come here
to make free calls, right?

576
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:31,586
Right.

577
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,627
Some without companies
handle accounts through me.

578
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:36,346
Yesterday when they heard you will come,

579
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:39,266
they were so excited
to stay up all night, right?

580
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:40,106
- Yes.
- Yes.

581
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:42,106
Well-dressed. Good.

582
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:42,968
Take photos later.

583
00:28:43,467 --> 00:28:44,387
Come, over here.

584
00:28:44,707 --> 00:28:45,506
Take a look.

585
00:28:45,746 --> 00:28:48,026
This is my office.
Inside is the work area.

586
00:28:48,346 --> 00:28:49,187
Reporter Du, hello.

587
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:49,987
Hello.

588
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:50,987
Hello, Reporter Du.

589
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:52,427
I'm Wang Caixia.

590
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:53,707
Right, Wang Caixia.

591
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:54,987
You look lovely.

592
00:28:54,987 --> 00:28:55,707
I'm Xiaoyu.

593
00:28:55,707 --> 00:28:56,387
Here, please sit.

594
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,266
This is the reception area.

595
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:00,707
Come take a seat. Please sit.

596
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,306
- Your outfit is really strange.
- So are your outfit.

597
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:04,947
Why say so?

598
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:07,346
- You dug it out from your trunk?
- What did you say?

599
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:08,947
It reeks of mothballs.

600
00:29:09,427 --> 00:29:10,947
It's perfume, okay?

601
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:13,026
- Mothball-scented perfume?
- How much essential balm

602
00:29:13,106 --> 00:29:14,506
did you use? Afraid of passing out?

603
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:15,346
Reporter Du is here.

604
00:29:15,346 --> 00:29:16,187
Don't you feel hot?

605
00:29:16,227 --> 00:29:16,907
Reporter Du.

606
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:19,867
Ms. Gao, I've never understood

607
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:21,266
what "monkeys" mean.

608
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:22,947
10,000-yuan households.

609
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:23,907
They all are.

610
00:29:26,826 --> 00:29:28,506
Why do I feel like I've become a monkey?

611
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:30,147
No, not at all.

612
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:31,746
Then you are the reporter monkey.

613
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:34,026
Ms. Gao.

614
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:36,187
Your place is really like
a mini Wall Street.

615
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:37,826
What Street?

616
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,728
Wall Street is
the financial trading center in America.

617
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:44,266
Your factory
is like the Wall Street in Yuehai.

618
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:45,586
Exactly!

619
00:29:46,187 --> 00:29:48,187
Come on,
people of Wall Street in Yuehai.

620
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:50,106
Get ready. Let's take a photo.

621
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:51,227
Okay, I'll take that.

622
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:51,947
Great!

623
00:29:52,147 --> 00:29:52,987
Don't touch my coat.

624
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:54,227
Look at my camera.

625
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:56,187
Hurry up. Or Changyuan will pass out.

626
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:56,947
- Here.
- Looks good.

627
00:29:56,947 --> 00:29:57,586
Three.

628
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:58,427
Hold him steady.

629
00:29:58,506 --> 00:29:59,227
Okay, hold him.

630
00:29:59,266 --> 00:29:59,826
Two.

631
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:01,566
One.

632
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:10,506
(Yuehai Town People's Government)
The newspaper photo is too blurry.

633
00:30:11,066 --> 00:30:12,746
What does Mr. Lin look like?

634
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:14,546
(Yuehai Town Committee)
Didn't you read the report?

635
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:17,306
Mr. Lin is a true pillar of strength.

636
00:30:17,546 --> 00:30:19,826
He devoted himself to work
and sacrificed for Yuehai.

637
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:22,947
He completed Xingfu Road
in just three months,

638
00:30:24,187 --> 00:30:25,746
yet missed out his love.

639
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:29,387
Lin Dongfu. What a good name.

640
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,826
Yes, it sounds wonderful.

641
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:32,987
Coming.

642
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,147
Let's go.

643
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:37,826
Hello.

644
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:41,106
We're looking for Lin Dongfu,
Yuehai's deputy mayor.

645
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:42,627
D-Do you know him?

646
00:30:44,826 --> 00:30:46,907
W-What do you want?

647
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,867
We all adore him and want his autograph.

648
00:30:49,987 --> 00:30:50,627
- Right.
- Right.

649
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:51,846
Right.

650
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:54,106
It's you, right?

651
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,627
Can you sign for us?

652
00:30:57,387 --> 00:30:58,227
Mr. Lin.

653
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,187
Please sign for us.

654
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:02,586
- Sign one for me.
- Me too.

655
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:03,306
Sign one for me.

656
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,227
I was here first.

657
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:05,707
- I want one too.
- Mine.

658
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:07,106
I recognized him first.

659
00:31:07,147 --> 00:31:07,987
I was here first.

660
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:12,707
Sign mine first.

661
00:31:14,227 --> 00:31:16,467
Ladies, excuse me.

662
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:19,346
You made a mistake. The one you want
is on the motorcycle there.

663
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:20,786
Hurry, let's go.

664
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,286
- Deputy mayor.
- Move! It's dangerous.

665
00:31:28,147 --> 00:31:29,786
Deputy mayor, please.

666
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,987
Can you sign for me?

667
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,147
Please sign for us.

We all adore you.

669
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,266
We've been waiting here for long.

670
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:37,147
Yes, please sign.

671
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,187
What is it? Tell me.

672
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,586
We all adore you
and want your autograph.

673
00:31:41,786 --> 00:31:42,826
Please sign for us.

Please sign for us.

675
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:49,147
Your eyes are all shining.

676
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:50,187
Do you know who I am?

677
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:52,147
You're our great town mayor of Yuehai!

678
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:53,467
- Right.
- Right.

679
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,627
Please sign for us.

680
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:55,467
Yes, sign one.

Please sign one for us.

682
00:31:57,846 --> 00:31:58,346
Okay.

683
00:31:58,346 --> 00:31:59,864
Line up. Line up.

684
00:32:00,824 --> 00:32:01,546
Okay.

685
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:08,326
Okay.

686
00:32:08,546 --> 00:32:09,546
When did this happen?

687
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:12,346
What exactly made you adore me so much?

688
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:13,106
Tell me.

689
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,586
You devote yourself to Yuehai.

690
00:32:14,746 --> 00:32:15,786
You're our hero!

691
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:17,546
That wasn't just my doing.

692
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,106
Thanks to everyone.

693
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:19,727
Come on.

694
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:20,746
- Thank you.
- Okay.

695
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:21,467
It's my turn.

696
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,006
Okay.

697
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:24,066
All women?

698
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:26,187
The Seven Fairies.

699
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,266
Well,

700
00:32:29,826 --> 00:32:32,116
there's another guy
who's also outstanding.

701
00:32:32,248 --> 00:32:33,346
Pay attention to him.

702
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:34,627
Are you all single?

703
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:36,746
Good, communicate more.

704
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,187
- Okay.
- You care about our happiness.

705
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:40,506
What about your own happiness?

706
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:42,387
Working for everyone is my happiness.

707
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:44,907
For all our happiness,

708
00:32:46,026 --> 00:32:46,987
mine doesn't matter.

709
00:32:49,947 --> 00:32:52,046
Alright, that's settled.

710
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:53,546
You all can go now.

711
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:54,387
Tell me if...

712
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:56,667
All of you can go.

713
00:32:56,987 --> 00:32:57,667
I have to work.

714
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:00,187
Come find me anytime.

715
00:33:00,227 --> 00:33:00,727
Okay.

716
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,867
J-Jie Chunlai?

717
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:05,147
You pronounced it wrong.

718
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:06,526
It's alright. Xie.

719
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:07,707
Xie Chunlai.

720
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:09,746
You're not Lin Dongfu?

721
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:11,387
We're here to see Mr. Lin.

722
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:13,727
Who?

723
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:17,066
I'm Xie Chunlai.

724
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:19,306
Liar! Who are you really?

725
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:21,467
We're looking
for deputy mayor Lin Dongfu.

726
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,786
Exactly! How can you impersonate him?

727
00:33:23,987 --> 00:33:24,826
Ridiculous.

728
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:26,266
You're not him. Why sign for us?

729
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:27,867
- Let's go.
- Leave.

730
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:30,266
Let's go.

731
00:33:37,938 --> 00:33:39,384
(Yuehai Town People's Government,
Yuehai Town Committee)

732
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:43,746
Here's the thing.

733
00:33:44,227 --> 00:33:47,106
Today, when Xie was returning
to the town government office,

734
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:48,266
he was surrounded

735
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:50,467
by a group of women
at the main entrance.

736
00:33:50,947 --> 00:33:52,026
Then those women said,

737
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:53,786
"Sign for us!"

738
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:55,346
Xie was thrilled of course.

739
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:57,826
He thought he was respected
among the masses,

740
00:33:58,306 --> 00:34:00,066
so he started signing.

741
00:34:00,346 --> 00:34:02,467
As soon as he finished writing his name,

742
00:34:02,627 --> 00:34:04,506
they just tore up the paper and left.

743
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,786
They were actually
looking for Lin Dongfu.

744
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:10,267
Am I right?

745
00:34:10,347 --> 00:34:10,907
Accident!

746
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:11,867
Accident!

747
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,387
Accident!

748
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:16,546
It's great
that ladies are interested in Lin.

749
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:17,347
Right.

750
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:18,427
Wonderful!

751
00:34:18,506 --> 00:34:20,106
Reporter Du did an excellent thing.

752
00:34:20,787 --> 00:34:22,666
It's killing two birds with one stone.

753
00:34:22,747 --> 00:34:23,307
Right?

754
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:25,787
Lin, seize the opportunity.

755
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:28,387
Find someone you like and get married.

756
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:32,146
I know you all mean well for me.

757
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,987
But I...

758
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,467
To be honest,

759
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:40,787
I'm not afraid of any tough projects.

760
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:42,947
But

761
00:34:43,226 --> 00:34:46,827
dating is completely different.

762
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:49,146
It's to interact with women.

763
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:49,646
I...

764
00:34:50,307 --> 00:34:52,066
I don't know how to interact with women.

765
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:54,626
But you can't only interact with men.

766
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:56,066
T-This won't do!

767
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:57,467
Wake up, you!

768
00:34:57,706 --> 00:34:59,226
Don't tease Lin!

769
00:34:59,226 --> 00:34:59,787
Live wiser.

770
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:00,467
Live wiser.

771
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:01,226
Fix this.

772
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:01,867
I'm telling you.

773
00:35:02,106 --> 00:35:02,706
Wake up!

774
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:03,947
Mr. Xie.

775
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:06,546
Is Mr. Xie inside?

776
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:07,747
Yes.

777
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,586
Mr. Xie, will you have time
after your bath?

778
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:12,747
I'd like to chat with you.

779
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:18,827
Reporter Du, I knew it was you.

780
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:19,907
I always have time!

781
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:20,666
Don't.

782
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,427
Mr. Xie, y-you need to calm down

783
00:35:22,427 --> 00:35:24,267
and get dressed. Then we'll...

784
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:25,106
Don't mind it.

785
00:35:25,267 --> 00:35:25,867
Let's chat.

786
00:35:25,867 --> 00:35:26,907
- No!
- Don't mind it.

787
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:27,987
- We can chat here.
- No!

788
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:28,606
My hand!

789
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:29,267
My hand!

790
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:30,226
It's okay.

791
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:30,867
Get dressed.

792
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:31,947
Wait for me.

793
00:35:31,987 --> 00:35:33,146
- Get dressed.
- Wait for me.

794
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:38,546
(Canteen)
Let's talk about that printery.

795
00:35:38,747 --> 00:35:41,347
You started that printery, right?

796
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:43,626
Of course.

797
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,307
Xuemei's family was poor.

798
00:35:47,026 --> 00:35:49,427
Back then,
there were no ways to earn money.

799
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:52,146
Later, there was the policy
of Reform and Opening-up.

800
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:53,226
Right? The policy.

801
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:58,387
She knew some sewing skills
and had good taste.

802
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:00,506
That's why she fell for me.

803
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:02,226
Right.

804
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:04,267
Right?

805
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:04,907
Right.

806
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:06,947
I helped her pave the way,

807
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:09,267
and then Chunmei Printery
was established.

808
00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:12,747
Why didn't you keep working with her?

809
00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:14,387
What do you mean?

810
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,827
I've always been the director,
and she was just acting.

811
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:18,666
Is it meaningful?

812
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:20,827
Human life is limited.

813
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,226
I want to dedicate my limited life

814
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,867
to the boundless service of the people.

815
00:36:26,146 --> 00:36:26,827
Noble man.

816
00:36:27,066 --> 00:36:27,907
What?

817
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:29,747
This isn't about being a leader,

818
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:31,267
but building a cause.

819
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:33,907
It's about constructing
a spiritual home.

820
00:36:34,387 --> 00:36:36,066
You saw nothing in Yuehai before.

821
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:37,387
But in your mind now,

822
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:39,226
there is the residential area,

823
00:36:39,307 --> 00:36:41,026
the cinema over there,

824
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:42,307
the commercial district,

825
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:43,666
the airport,

826
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,827
and the train coming with smoke.

827
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:49,427
What is that? It's hope.
What's coming is hope.

828
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:51,467
Who bought these tables and benches?

829
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:53,467
Who got all these bottles

830
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:54,506
and jars?

831
00:36:54,787 --> 00:36:56,467
I bought every single one.

832
00:36:56,987 --> 00:36:57,506
Right?

833
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,206
Well, notebooks and pens

834
00:37:00,347 --> 00:37:01,947
might cost just a few cents each,

835
00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:03,066
but they make a mickle.

836
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:04,586
I had to find the best price.

837
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:07,867
For such a major thing,
I need to be meticulous like a woman

838
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,146
and decisive like a man.

839
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:12,506
When it's time to decide,
I make the call.

840
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:14,467
I'm like the chief steward.
My word is final.

841
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:16,226
Mr. Tan.

842
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:19,106
Is Reporter Du going to write
about Mr. Xie next?

843
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:23,867
Yan, busy?

844
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:24,387
Mr. Zheng,

845
00:37:25,106 --> 00:37:26,907
Ms. Li, Mr. Lin.

846
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:32,166
Have you eaten?

847
00:37:32,427 --> 00:37:32,987
Not yet.

848
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:34,387
Have you two eaten?

849
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,467
- No.
- Not yet.

850
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,827
No one's eaten?
Then let's grab a bite here.

851
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:38,447
- Okay.
- Okay.

852
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:39,747
Let's talk while we eat.

853
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:40,747
Okay, let's eat.

854
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:42,586
Sit here.

855
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:46,347
Yan, why are you setting up here today?

856
00:37:47,586 --> 00:37:49,747
I need to be close to the meat stall.

857
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:52,146
Wherever the meat stall is,
that's where I set up.

858
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:53,987
There's another meat stall in the west.

859
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:55,546
If that spot's taken, I'd come here.

860
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:57,066
If this spot's taken, I'd go there.

861
00:37:58,506 --> 00:38:00,146
Right, she's setting up between the two.

862
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:04,626
Mr. Lin.

863
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:06,347
You'll go to the construction site.

864
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:07,827
Then I'll keep it brief.

865
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:11,666
Well, Mr. Zheng told me

866
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:14,747
you're thinking about marriage, right?

867
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:25,566
Yes.

868
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,387
Mr. Lin, I have a list here.

869
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,427
It has names from various sources

870
00:38:30,586 --> 00:38:33,267
of many women who adore you.

871
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:35,787
You could try communicating
and dating them.

872
00:38:36,026 --> 00:38:37,947
Some have photos, while some don't.

873
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:39,747
I'll read them out.

874
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:43,026
If any interest you,
feel free to interrupt.

875
00:38:43,307 --> 00:38:45,506
Wang Guifang, aged 29,

876
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:48,568
state-owned wire factory worker,
with vocational school graduate.

877
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:51,666
Hu Yuwen, aged 33,

878
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:54,387
self-employed and divorced woman
without kids.

879
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:57,867
Lin Qing, aged 28,

880
00:38:58,347 --> 00:39:00,506
unmarried teacher, with college diploma.

881
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:01,907
Shen Qiandi.

882
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:02,867
No photo for her.

883
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:03,907
Here come the wontons!

884
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:04,907
Aged 26.

885
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:09,307
What are you doing? Why so flustered?

886
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:09,987
Thanks.

887
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:13,387
Let me.

888
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:14,226
Sorry.

889
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:15,666
Nothing. Are you hurt?

890
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:16,287
No.

891
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:17,867
It's alright, really.

892
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:18,506
Let me.

893
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:19,546
- It's fine.
- Sorry.

894
00:39:19,747 --> 00:39:20,307
It's fine.

895
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:25,706
Mr. Lin, your wontons.

896
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:26,566
So...

897
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,026
Mr. Lin, I've got the pepper

898
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:30,506
on your wontons.

899
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:31,267
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

900
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:31,787
It's fine.

901
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:32,447
Thanks.

902
00:39:33,106 --> 00:39:35,427
What are you doing? Why so flustered?

903
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:38,907
At your age, you should be more careful.

904
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,666
Mr. Lin, give the photos back to me.

905
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,706
Are you giving it up already?

906
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:55,506
Why don't you fight for this?

907
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:58,947
Well, let's simplify this.

908
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:00,387
Just tell me,

909
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:01,267
what do you like?

910
00:40:01,347 --> 00:40:02,827
Just list them out for me.

911
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,686
So I can search based on these criteria.

912
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:06,566
Do it now.

913
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:08,267
Yes, Mr. Lin.

914
00:40:08,546 --> 00:40:09,706
The entire town government

915
00:40:09,747 --> 00:40:12,347
has shown great concern
and care for your marriage.

916
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:14,106
Please cooperate with us.

917
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:16,307
Don't let down our good intentions.

918
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:18,947
Anyone is fine.

919
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:19,887
Well...

920
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:22,626
As long as she's a working-class person.

921
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:27,347
Anyone is fine?

922
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:28,907
What did you say?

923
00:40:28,947 --> 00:40:30,586
Plenty of working-class people!

924
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,146
What's the specific criteria?

925
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:36,626
As long as she can cook.

926
00:40:38,947 --> 00:40:39,626
And?

927
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,827
Not too old

928
00:40:45,427 --> 00:40:47,186
or too young.

929
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,106
And?

930
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:52,106
I know.

931
00:40:53,106 --> 00:40:54,307
So you're talking about her.

932
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:55,586
Tell me earlier.

933
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:57,427
I could've gone straight to her!

934
00:40:58,546 --> 00:40:59,146
Who is it?

935
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:00,146
Ms. Xiao.

936
00:41:04,307 --> 00:41:05,927
What's wrong? So happy?

937
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:07,427
I got it right, didn't I?

938
00:41:08,706 --> 00:41:10,546
If I'd known, I'd have told her.

939
00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:12,467
No, not Ms. Xiao.

940
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:14,347
- Not her?
- Not her.

941
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:15,787
Exactly. Nonsense.

942
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:18,267
Ms. Xiao's husband is still alive.

943
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,387
Ms. Xiao's husband is alive?

944
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,827
If it's not Ms. Xiao, then who is it?

945
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:26,666
Mr. Lin.

946
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:29,827
What do you think of Sun Xiaoyan?

947
00:41:39,106 --> 00:41:39,987
Say something.

948
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:44,787
Say something.

949
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:56,626
Ms. Li, Mr. Zheng,
I-I need to go to the construction site.

950
00:41:59,226 --> 00:41:59,726
Wait.

951
00:42:00,506 --> 00:42:02,467
Wait. You haven't answered.

952
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:04,566
Come back.

953
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:06,827
Right. You haven't answered me yet.

954
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:08,506
Mr. Lin, finished eating?

955
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:09,006
Yes.

956
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,106
Ms. Li wants your answer.

957
00:42:10,106 --> 00:42:11,387
Fine. Anything's fine.

958
00:42:11,747 --> 00:42:13,066
Nonsense! Anything's fine?

959
00:42:13,706 --> 00:42:14,947
Nonsense!

960
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:16,387
Lin Tofu.

961
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:18,506
Just leaving. What a waste.

962
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:20,307
He bit half of it.

963
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:23,267
I-I'll eat it. I don't mind it.

964
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:29,226
Ms. Li.

965
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:32,146
Who told you about Sun Xiaoyan?

966
00:42:32,546 --> 00:42:33,427
Xie told you?

967
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:35,106
She's not on the list.

968
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,186
If she's not on the list,
why did you mention her?

969
00:42:38,706 --> 00:42:40,347
Mr. Lin likes her.

970
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:44,586
Really? How do you know?

971
00:42:45,747 --> 00:42:46,347
Mr. Lin.

972
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:47,267
Hello.

973
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:48,226
Mr. Lin.

974
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:49,146
Hello, Mr. Lin.

975
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,226
- Hello.
- Mr. Lin.

976
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,186

977

00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:53,506
Hello.

979
00:42:54,626 --> 00:42:56,787
- He smiled!
