16
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:40,394
Hello, Mr. Xia.

17
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:43,153
Well,

18
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,593
Yuehai's accounts were
temporarily frozen by investigators.

19
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,048
They can't be unfrozen
until the investigation ends.

20
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:52,634
But Yuehai currently
has many ongoing projects.

21
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,653
- They can't stop.
- Right.

22
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:57,593
I was wondering if the county
could advance Yuehai

23
00:01:58,433 --> 00:01:59,313
some funds.

24
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:00,914
Designated funds.

25
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:03,093
Right.

26
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:06,953
Okay, okay.

27
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:09,994
I'll draft a report immediately
and send it to the county.

28
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:11,994
Thank you, Mr. Xia.

29
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,313
Goodbye, Mr. Xia.

30
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,153
Any other questions?

31
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,674
(Chats under 5 minutes)
Ms. Li, I'm heading to the site now.

32
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:29,794
I'll get them back

33
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:31,913
to resume work.

34
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:34,394
Good, and explain that to them.

35
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,674
Site payments will be settled
in three days.

36
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:39,433
But you also need to warn the foremen.

37
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,433
While Mr. Zheng is away,
anyone who dares to play tricks

38
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:43,873
or scheme deviously,

39
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:47,554
or messes with the project quality
will bear the consequences.

40
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:48,574
Understood.

41
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:49,834
Ms. Li, don't worry.

42
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,074
I'm keeping an eye on it.

43
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:52,454
Okay.

44
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:57,114
Ms. Li, our finances
are so tight right now.

45
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,193
I have a proposal.

46
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:01,114
All cadres, including us,

47
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:03,834
could temporarily suspend our salaries
starting this month.

48
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:05,794
That could save us some funds

49
00:03:05,913 --> 00:03:07,753
to use where it's most needed, right?

50
00:03:10,114 --> 00:03:10,614
Alright.

51
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,954
But you must
thoroughly explain it to them.

52
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:15,394
Don't force anyone.

53
00:03:16,274 --> 00:03:17,674
I think everyone will understand.

54
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:18,593
I'll go do that now.

55
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:21,593
Mr. Xie.

56
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:24,074
I'm off to the Power Supply Bureau
for Wang Defa.

57
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,913
If he dares cut Yuehai's power,
I'll camp out there.

58
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:28,653
Wait.

59
00:03:34,074 --> 00:03:35,994
A friend gave me an herbal prescription.

60
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,354
It's good for kidney health.

61
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,994
Wang Defa's kidneys aren't great.
Take this to him.

62
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:46,574
He supplies power to Yuehai,
and you supply vitality to him, huh?

63
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:48,033
Carrot and stick.

64
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:48,774
Got it.

65
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:49,433
Xie.

66
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:53,193
You should also check on Xuemei.

67
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:56,174
I know.

68
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:58,713
You look exhausted.

69
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:01,873
Don't stress about Mr. Zheng or us.

70
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,074
Get more rest.

71
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:23,513
With too fast a drip,

72
00:04:23,794 --> 00:04:25,753
it speeds up blood flow
throughout the body,

73
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:27,873
putting immense pressure on the heart.

74
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:30,953
It could also damage liver
and kidney function

75
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:32,273
and cause GI irritation.

76
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:39,833
You can take off your mask.

77
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,674
No other patients will come in here.

78
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,474
You can lie down
and get the IV properly.

79
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:45,914
No one will disturb you.

80
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,114
Thank you, Director Jiang.

81
00:04:51,313 --> 00:04:53,034
Upper respiratory infection.

82
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:56,273
Your white blood cell
and neutrophil counts are both too high.

83
00:04:58,313 --> 00:04:59,674
The medicine is prescribed.

84
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,313
Be sure to take it properly.

85
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:03,554
Bring those counts down.

86
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:06,854
Come in.

87
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:08,953
Director Jiang,
the granules you asked for.

88
00:05:09,273 --> 00:05:09,773
Thank you.

89
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:14,154
Ma'am,

90
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:17,873
Du Tao and I broke up.

91
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,393
I don't want to hide it from you.

92
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,513
And you've probably heard,

93
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:32,594
Mr. Zheng is under investigation.

94
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:36,794
There have indeed been
some rumors lately.

95
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,513
For someone with tonsillitis,

96
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,554
drink more water and talk less.

97
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:51,474
I'm telling you this

98
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,714
mainly because I hope these two matters

99
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:56,554
won't affect your decision
to stay in Yuehai.

100
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:00,193
Then tell me,

101
00:06:01,234 --> 00:06:03,873
what reason
could you give for me to stay?

102
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:10,114
Actually, I know

103
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:13,273
that from the start, you chose to stay
as Director here in Yuehai

104
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,193
not because of my relationship
with Du Tao.

105
00:06:16,073 --> 00:06:17,393
Moreover, you promised me

106
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:18,833
that over two years,

107
00:06:18,994 --> 00:06:21,144
you'd train an independent,
excellent surgical team.

108
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,953
And also because I submitted a report
to the province

109
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:26,513
to apply for

110
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,554
neonatal surgery R&D funding for Yuehai

111
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,753
and reserve
the latest medical equipment.

112
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,873
These are our promises
and agreements to each other.

113
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,594
They haven't been fulfilled yet.

114
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,433
So, Director Jiang,

115
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:39,433
you can't leave yet.

116
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:44,234
Are you done?

117
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:45,013
Not yet.

118
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:46,313
What else?

119
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:48,753
Also because...

120
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:50,914
you can't resist good food.

121
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,554
Yuehai has the best seafood.

122
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:56,873
Who says only the seafood is good?

123
00:06:57,914 --> 00:07:00,354
Yuehai's stir-fried noodles
are my favorite.

124
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:03,714
Chief Sun of ER requests you,
Director Jiang.

125
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:04,914
Got it.

126
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,914
Don't worry, I'm not leaving.

127
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,633
After all, my son wrote that article.

128
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:17,594
And those grand plans
you just mentioned.

129
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:20,873
I want to see you fulfill your promises.

130
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:22,914
I will.

131
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:27,633
Just call the head nurse
when you finish the IV.

132
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:29,994
The inflammation levels
in your body are too high.

133
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:32,253
You must rest properly, understand?

134
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:33,474
I will.

135
00:07:35,313 --> 00:07:37,273
Will you?

136
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:43,154
Ms. Li,

137
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:47,833
as a woman, I truly admire you.

138
00:07:49,354 --> 00:07:51,154
But as Du Tao's mother,

139
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,313
I feel pity for you both.

140
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,393
On my son's behalf, I just want to say

141
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:58,674
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:01,674
Actually, I've also noticed

143
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:03,674
Du Tao's recent changes.

144
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,554
Now I feel more and more

145
00:08:06,234 --> 00:08:08,674
that you two might not be a good match.

146
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,914
When you just told me you've broken up,

147
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,753
I was relieved for you
from the bottom of my heart.

148
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:37,673
Ping, you're here.

149
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:39,393
Granny, I came to see you.

150
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:42,954
You brought me so much food again.

151
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:44,913
I can't finish it all by myself.

152
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:47,033
It's okay.
Just take your time eating it.

153
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,153
This month's living expenses.

154
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:50,673
I'll put it away for you here.

155
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:51,753
No need.

156
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:53,873
I didn't even finish last month's.

157
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:56,153
Xiaohai called me.

158
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,434
He's doing well in there.

159
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,474
He'll be out soon.

160
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,074
So, don't worry anymore.

161
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:06,194
You always think about me,

162
00:09:06,553 --> 00:09:09,594
giving this old lady something
to look forward to from time to time...

163
00:09:11,234 --> 00:09:12,033
Have some water.

164
00:09:12,474 --> 00:09:13,194
I'll help myself.

165
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,393
There's no show on this TV.

166
00:09:58,834 --> 00:09:59,793
What are you watching?

167
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:03,633
In this room,

168
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:07,194
it's nice to have some noise.

169
00:10:10,714 --> 00:10:11,214
Yes.

170
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:19,153
Ping,

171
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:23,074
did something happen?

172
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:30,673
I ran into some trouble.

173
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:36,994
Don't worry. It'll all pass.

174
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:38,533
Look.

175
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:42,834
I've been through the old society.
I have seen everything.

176
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:45,633
But I'm still living well now.

177
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:01,633
Granny, I have to go now.

178
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:06,553
Take care.

179
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,033
Xuemei.

180
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:26,834
I'm back.

181
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:28,913
Where on earth did you go?

182
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:30,994
I didn't sleep all night.

183
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:33,273
I was swamped
with customer cancellations all day.

184
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:35,913
Also, all self-employed individuals
on Binhai Road

185
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:37,513
were questioned by the Municipal DIC.

186
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,194
But they couldn't find you.

187
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,033
Well, say something.

188
00:11:41,153 --> 00:11:42,553
Where did you go? I was frantic.

189
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:43,594
I know, I know.

190
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:44,653
By the way,

191
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:47,673
go tell everyone to come here
for a meeting in two hours.

192
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:50,033
What do you mean?
Did you find a solution?

193
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:52,114
We'll talk when they get here. Just go.

194
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:53,434
In two hours?

195
00:11:53,873 --> 00:11:54,393
Okay.

196
00:11:56,954 --> 00:11:57,553
My neck...

197
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,354
Morning, sir.

198
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,513
Xuemei, let me introduce him.

199
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,273
This is...

200
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,354
No need. I'll introduce myself.

201
00:12:14,994 --> 00:12:15,494
Ms. Gao,

202
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:18,954
I'm Liu Weimin, head of
the Municipal DIC investigation team.

203
00:12:19,393 --> 00:12:22,234
We have a few questions for you.
It will take about half an hour.

204
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:24,293
Okay.

205
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:30,033
May we begin?

206
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:31,314
Yes.

207
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:35,594
Well...

208
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:39,114
Sorry, there's not much to offer you.

209
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,314
No need.

210
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:41,194
Sunflower seeds?

211
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,033
No need.

212
00:12:42,393 --> 00:12:42,994
You go ahead.

213
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:44,194
No.

214
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:44,694
You can eat.

215
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:45,793
I can?

216
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:47,253
Yes.

217
00:12:47,753 --> 00:12:50,033
I've been busy outside since yesterday.

218
00:12:50,913 --> 00:12:52,513
I missed my meals. I am indeed hungry.

219
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:53,314
I understand.

220
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:54,074
Sorry.

221
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:54,694
It's fine.

222
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:55,544
You're not eating?

223
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,673
Mr. Zheng

224
00:12:59,273 --> 00:13:01,873
owns multiple properties in town.
Do you know that?

225
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:03,913
I don't know.

226
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:06,793
I truly... Sorry. I truly don't know.

227
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:08,954
I think that's probably a rumor.

228
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,913
Just tell us whether you know or not.

229
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:14,633
As for whether it's a rumor or not,
we will investigate.

230
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:15,393
Okay.

231
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:21,114
We've heard that this place
is called 'Little Wall Street.'

232
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:24,234
All the town's business money
flows through you.

233
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:25,293
Right?

234
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,194
That's a bit exaggerated, sir.

235
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:29,834
My factory was the first place
in town to get a telephone.

236
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,354
So folks came here
to make calls and do business.

237
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,994
Now people have their own phones.

238
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:36,153
So they come less often.

239
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,033
Also,

240
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:40,714
it's true many 'monkeys' trust me.

241
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:43,114
Their money goes through me.
But not all of them.

242
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:46,714
And Zheng Decheng?

243
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:51,033
Did his money ever pass through here?

244
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:52,153
No.

245
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,354
Mr. Zheng never did before.

246
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:56,334
Really.

247
00:13:58,194 --> 00:14:01,633
The industrial park
was spearheaded by you, right?

248
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:02,893
Yes.

249
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:06,594
The town government even built a road
for your industrial park

250
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:09,513
and took out an eight million yuan
bank loan for it, right?

251
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:11,293
Right.

252
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:14,234
It was one of the conditions
we negotiated with the town.

253
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:20,114
Mr. Zheng

254
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:23,393
agreed to so many conditions
for your industrial park

255
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:26,673
and even personally took out the loan
to build the road for it.

256
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:28,474
You two seem close.

257
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:33,994
Sir, we do have a good relationship.

258
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:36,513
But that's because
the town government leaders

259
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:38,194
always think of the people.

260
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:40,633
They handle matters fairly and strictly,

261
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:41,553
never biased.

262
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:45,393
Let's take the industrial park project
for example.

263
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:47,834
We actually argued
during the negotiations.

264
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:49,954
We slammed tables.

265
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,074
Sorry, I'm just trying to make a point.

266
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:53,194
It's fine.

267
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:56,913
Then, in your daily work with Mr. Zheng,

268
00:14:57,594 --> 00:14:59,153
have you noticed any problems with him?

269
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:00,234
(Factory Director's Office)
No problems.

270
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,354
He's just too meticulous

271
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:03,793
and too responsible

272
00:15:04,513 --> 00:15:05,873
and cares too much for the people.

273
00:15:16,314 --> 00:15:17,873
Alright, Ms. Gao, that's all for today.

274
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,714
About the accounts I mentioned earlier,

275
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,033
please have them organized.

276
00:15:22,314 --> 00:15:23,832
They'll be picked up early tomorrow.

277
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:25,673
Okay, sir.

278
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:26,994
I will prepare them carefully.

279
00:15:27,913 --> 00:15:29,194
By the way, sir.

280
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,074
May I ask how Mr. Zheng is doing?

281
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:32,434
When can he come back?

282
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:34,753
I can't say.

283
00:15:35,553 --> 00:15:36,053
Let's go.

284
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:38,913
Well, take care.

285
00:15:59,913 --> 00:16:00,434
Ms. Li.

286
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:03,614
- You're finally back.
- What's wrong?

287
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:06,153
Many are calling the mayor's hotline.
Please listen.

288
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:14,714
Mayor, why has our project stopped?

289
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:20,074
Ms. Li, the project's stopped.
When will our workers get paid?

290
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,714
Ms. Li, will the industrial park
still be built?

291
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:30,234
Ms. Li, why has the industrial park
construction stopped?

292
00:16:31,753 --> 00:16:33,234
Ms. Li, I've heard some bosses fled.

293
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:33,734
Mr. Xie.

294
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,513
Is this true or not?

295
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:37,434
I heard on the way

296
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:40,056
the investigators questioned Xuemei too.

297
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:42,074
Now the 'monkeys' are all panicking.

298
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:42,974
Ms. Li.

299
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:46,434
Ms. Li.

300
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:48,354
Mr. Liu.

301
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:49,893
What is it?

302
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:53,153
You and the three deputy mayors
need to go with me for questioning.

303
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:55,273
Right now?

304
00:16:57,153 --> 00:16:59,553
Ten minutes.
We'll give you ten minutes to get ready.

305
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:00,753
We'll be outside.

306
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:01,494
Okay.

307
00:17:07,753 --> 00:17:10,273
Meng, go notify
the other two deputy mayors

308
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:12,113
to gather in the courtyard
in ten minutes.

309
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:13,454
Okay.

310
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:20,553
Mr. Xie, we need to leave for a while.

311
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:24,454
Stop. Stop.

312
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,874
- Where are you going?
- We'll be right back.

313
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,753
To the hospital.

314
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,833
Ms. Li is sick
and needs an IV drip immediately.

315
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:32,874
Hold on a second.

316
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,073
She was fine.
How did she suddenly get sick?

317
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,073
She's been sick.

318
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:38,914
With Mr. Zheng away,
Ms. Li has been handling things sick.

319
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,152
Enough, Mr. Xie.

320
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:40,994
Mr. Liu,

321
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:42,474
here's my IV prescription.

322
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:45,113
The hospital wants me back
for an IV this afternoon.

323
00:17:45,353 --> 00:17:48,113
I'll go to the investigation team
to cooperate as soon as I'm done.

324
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:50,353
Li.

325
00:17:53,994 --> 00:17:54,494
Okay.

326
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:57,033
Ms. Li, sorry about this.

327
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,073
Sir, she's burning up.

328
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:07,714
Alright then, make it quick.
I'll wait here for you.

329
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:08,853
Go ahead.

330
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:24,513
Ms. Chang.

331
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,033
Ms. Chang.

332
00:18:28,513 --> 00:18:29,013
Ms. Chang.

333
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:30,634
Ms. Chang.

334
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:32,073
Ms. Gao.

335
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:33,394
Everyone,

336
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,113
long time no see.

337
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,154
Long time no see.

338
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:37,273
Have another drink.

339
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:39,113
Come on, let's have another drink.

340
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:40,313
Let's go.

341
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:41,434
We have a new friend.

342
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:42,394
Have some liquor.

343
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:43,553
- Have some liquor.
- Come on.

344
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:44,714
- Don't you recognize Ms. Chang?
- Sit.

345
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,333
Ms. Chang.

346
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:47,154
You looked familiar. Long time no see.

347
00:18:47,154 --> 00:18:48,113
Long time no see.

348
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:49,914
Move aside. Move.

349
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:51,033
Come on, everyone.

350
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:52,033
Have a seat.

351
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:57,793
We all know some things
have happened these past few days.

352
00:18:59,113 --> 00:18:59,833
To be honest,

353
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:02,434
if I were the only one
involved in the industrial park,

354
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:05,914
then even with the biggest risks,
I'd shoulder them myself.

355
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:08,553
But the thing is,
I dragged all of you into this.

356
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:11,434
And you've all taken out loans
and invested money.

357
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,654
So I have to take responsibility
for you.

358
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:14,253
Yes.

359
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:15,253
Yes.

360
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:18,353
Back when we built the printing street
on Binhai Road,

361
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:19,833
Ms. Chang helped us a lot.

362
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:23,033
When I went to see her again,
I wanted to give it a shot.

363
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:26,394
But I didn't expect her
to agree so readily.

364
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:28,234
What does this show?

365
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:30,714
Our connection isn't over yet.

366
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,914
Yes, absolutely.

367
00:19:33,474 --> 00:19:35,113
Many of you here probably already know

368
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,394
I've also set up an industrial park
over in Nanzhou.

369
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:40,024
With ready-to-use land.

370
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:41,994
Today, I came here personally

371
00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:44,634
to welcome all of you

372
00:19:45,674 --> 00:19:48,273
to move your factories
to my place in Nanzhou.

373
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,753
Move to Nanzhou?

374
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:52,194
Then what about our loans?

375
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:54,714
Yeah. What about the contracts
we signed with Yuehai?

376
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:55,714
Hold on, Xuemei.

377
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:57,434
We still have so many unpaid loans.

378
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:58,593
Yeah, all that money.

379
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,634
Alright, alright.

380
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:04,874
Xuemei has had it really tough.
Let's cut our losses in time.

381
00:20:05,634 --> 00:20:07,714
Right, cut losses in time.

382
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,434
I understand your concerns.

383
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:12,553
So before I came here,

384
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,273
I met with the leaders in Nanzhou.

385
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:16,474
They said

386
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,593
for all the terms
you've agreed upon with Yuehai,

387
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:22,553
they will honor and match them.

388
00:20:23,313 --> 00:20:24,434
- They will?
- As a good gesture,

389
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:28,833
they will subsidize those
who open factories in Nanzhou

390
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:33,474
by waiving the factory rent
for the first three years.

391
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,073
Three years of factory rent.

392
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,833
- Three years?
- The first three years.

393
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:38,954
That's a huge perk.

394
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,234
Is that even possible?

395
00:20:40,553 --> 00:20:42,513
We can even negotiate terms later.

396
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:43,954
The perk is huge.

397
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:45,394
Let's do the math.

398
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:46,313
Do the math first.

399
00:20:49,553 --> 00:20:50,994
There's a saying. What is it?

400
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:55,194
A wise man knows when to yield.

401
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:56,674
Wait, Ms. Chang.

402
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,593
You just said three years free.

403
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,793
Why is it 450,000 yuan now? What's this?
[*Sounds similar in Chinese]

404
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:03,874
A wise man knows when to yield.

405
00:21:04,113 --> 00:21:04,714
Right.

406
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:07,474
A wise man knows when to yield.

407
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,474
I see that everyone present is wise.

408
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:12,154
- That's for sure.
- Absolutely.

409
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:14,234
Words alone aren't proof.

410
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:16,792
This is the contract

411
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:19,593
(Industrial Park Entry Agreement)
from Nanzhou Development Zone.

412
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:21,634
The specific preferential policies

413
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,634
are all detailed in this contract.

414
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:25,234
Everyone, take one.

415
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:26,374
Here.

416
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:27,174
Come on.

417
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:28,273
Pass it along.

418
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:28,874
Come on.

419
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:29,833
Keep passing it down.

420
00:21:30,073 --> 00:21:30,634
Get me one.

421
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:31,154
Get me one.

422
00:21:31,154 --> 00:21:31,654
Here you go.

423
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:32,874
- Give me one.
- Here.

424
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:34,313
Let me take a look.

425
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:34,994
Here.

426
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:49,313
About this contract,

427
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:50,833
should we sign it or not?

428
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:54,113
Signing would feel
like betraying Mr. Zheng and Ms. Li.

429
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:56,824
But think about it.

430
00:21:57,048 --> 00:21:59,313
I've got elderly parents
and young kids relying on me.

431
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,033
Plus all those workers at my factory,

432
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:03,593
whose mouths I have to feed
every single day.

433
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:04,974
Right?

434
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:06,914
My heart isn't strong.

435
00:22:07,634 --> 00:22:10,273
Since yesterday, I've been swamped
with cancellation calls.

436
00:22:10,714 --> 00:22:11,914
I can't take it anymore.

437
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:15,154
Regardless, thank you, Ms. Gao.

438
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,394
You're the only one
who can pull this off right now.

439
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:20,280
It's nothing.

440
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,073
Ms. Chang, well...

441
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,793
I've reviewed the entry agreement
you mentioned.

442
00:22:24,793 --> 00:22:26,793
I'd like to say a few words.

443
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:27,714
Keep it down.

444
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:28,874
Okay, got it.

445
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:30,634
Aren't we all worried

446
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,954
about how this will affect Mr. Zheng?

447
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:35,234
Ms. Chang said it.

448
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:37,994
We're all wise people
who recognize reality.

449
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:39,194
In three years,

450
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:42,833
whether we're chubby wise people
or skinny wise people,

451
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,394
when we've made it big,

452
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:47,053
we can come back and repay Mr. Zheng.

453
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:48,113
Right?

454
00:22:48,273 --> 00:22:48,773
Right?

455
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:50,033
It actually makes sense.

456
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:53,513
Mr. Zheng has been so good to us.

457
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:55,234
Wouldn't this seem...

458
00:22:55,553 --> 00:22:56,394
Oh, you old fossil.

459
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,874
We'll never accept ourselves.

460
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,073
Enough already.

461
00:22:59,914 --> 00:23:01,674
Hearing this about Mr. Zheng

462
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:03,553
also hurts Xuemei.

463
00:23:03,994 --> 00:23:05,474
It hurts me more than any of you.

464
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:07,874
What do we do now? It's about survival.

465
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:10,593
Xuemei's doing this for everyone's sake.

466
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:12,513
Thank you, Xuemei.

467
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:13,496
Thanks, Xuemei.

468
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:14,584
Thanks, Xuemei.

469
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:15,874
Thank you.

470
00:23:16,113 --> 00:23:16,994
Thank you, Xuemei.

471
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:18,113
Thank you, Xuemei.

472
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:25,194
(Xuemei, I'll wait for you)

473
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:28,833
(to bring me
all the signed and stamped contracts.)

474
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,456
(See you in Nanzhou.)

475
00:24:02,354 --> 00:24:06,904
(Guo Fugui)

476
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:14,793
Whose idea was this?

477
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:19,674
Who was it that vowed

478
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:23,434
to lead everyone
to build Yuehai together

479
00:24:24,073 --> 00:24:24,994
with no turning back?

480
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,513
Where's that bold confidence now?

481
00:24:29,753 --> 00:24:31,033
Where's your responsibility?

482
00:24:32,273 --> 00:24:33,874
Weren't you talking about taking charge?

483
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:35,793
You're absolutely brilliant.

484
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:38,793
I 'admire' you deeply.

485
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:40,353
You face a few setbacks.

486
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:42,154
And you're retreating?

487
00:24:43,073 --> 00:24:44,154
- Shameless.
- Are you done?

488
00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:45,752
Where could you flee to?

489
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:47,394
I'll ask again: are you done?

490
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:50,793
Yes, I'm done.

491
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:51,694
Good.

492
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:53,113
Then I need your cooperation.

493
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:54,954
I must report to Ms. Li.

494
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:56,273
May I?

495
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:56,888
(Entry Agreement of Nanzhou
Changjia Printing Industrial Park)

496
00:25:02,674 --> 00:25:03,313
Ms. Li,

497
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:05,033
emotionally,

498
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:07,234
leaving feels wrong.

499
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:09,513
You and Mr. Zheng,

500
00:25:10,753 --> 00:25:12,194
along with cadres like him,

501
00:25:12,914 --> 00:25:13,833
are great leaders.

502
00:25:14,154 --> 00:25:15,474
You've supported us tremendously.

503
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:17,833
We're not ungrateful people.

504
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:19,273
- Exactly.
- Right.

505
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:20,833
But business

506
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,073
isn't just about sentiment.

507
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:26,994
One misstep could ruin us completely.

508
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:30,234
So we must keep an escape route open.

509
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:32,474
Please try to understand.

510
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:33,513
I don't understand.

511
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:39,033
I don't get the escape route.

512
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,714
Have we ever given ourselves
an escape route?

513
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,634
Yuehai has faced so many hardships.

514
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,194
If we'd shown a hint of doubt

515
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,680
or if we hadn't stood firm,
would Yuehai exist as it does?

516
00:25:53,474 --> 00:25:56,353
We're idealists of this era.

517
00:25:57,634 --> 00:25:59,033
Have we defeated ourselves?

518
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:01,853
You want to talk about feelings now?

519
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:04,553
You can say you have no feelings for me.

520
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:07,593
What I don't get is
how you feel nothing for Yuehai.

521
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,593
What are feelings?

522
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:11,553
Ms. Li is running a fever.

523
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:15,608
Yet she risked her health
to come see you all

524
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:16,954
to ease your mind.

525
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:18,744
That's a genuine feeling.

526
00:26:19,874 --> 00:26:21,593
Ms. Li believes you, Gao Xuemei,

527
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:23,914
can steady the troops' morale here.

528
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:25,353
She trusts you.

529
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:27,353
Yet you urged abandoning ship.

530
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:28,753
I don't understand.

531
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:30,553
Guys,

532
00:26:31,113 --> 00:26:32,994
tell me, how should I understand this?

533
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:34,914
Who could understand?

534
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:37,793
I understand.

535
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:40,194
In business,

536
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:43,113
one day you're flying high,
the next you're down low.

537
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:46,313
I know you've all poured everything
into building

538
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:47,634
the industrial park.

539
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:49,593
Especially you, Ms. Gao.

540
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,073
If I were in your position,

541
00:26:52,513 --> 00:26:53,874
facing the same situation,

542
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:56,714
I'd be worried and scared too.

543
00:26:58,194 --> 00:27:01,073
Nanzhou does look like a lifeline.

544
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:05,313
But I came to say one thing.

545
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:07,353
Trust.

546
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:16,434
Having worked with Mr. Zheng
for so long,

547
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:19,113
I know him, and I trust him.

548
00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:21,434
I swear on my Party loyalty

549
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:23,714
that he has absolutely never done

550
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:26,434
any of the things mentioned
in that news story.

551
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:31,313
You've known him
even longer than I have.

552
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:32,833
I believe you know better

553
00:27:33,553 --> 00:27:35,434
what kind of man he is than I do.

554
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:38,113
And I believe

555
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:41,954
the Party will investigate thoroughly
and clear his name.

556
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,994
Times have provided chances
to both Yuehai and you.

557
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,833
You arrived in Yuehai,

558
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:52,994
and then your business started to grow.

559
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,874
Now you are the masters of this city.

560
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,634
Yuehai is a place to come and go freely.

561
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:00,154
If you wish to leave,

562
00:28:00,593 --> 00:28:02,634
I have no right to keep you here.

563
00:28:03,634 --> 00:28:04,353
But,

564
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:07,513
since Yuehai once gave you
the chance to earn money,

565
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:10,194
I now beg you

566
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:14,434
to give Yuehai a chance.

567
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:21,513
- Ms. Li!
- Ms. Li!

568
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:22,093
- Please don't!
- Please!

569
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:22,994
Please don't.

570
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:23,714
Ms. Li,

571
00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:25,234
please don't do this.

572
00:28:32,234 --> 00:28:33,553
Wait. Ms. Li.

573
00:28:36,513 --> 00:28:37,033
Please.

574
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:38,313
Please don't.

575
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,674
No affection. It's better to leave.

576
00:28:44,434 --> 00:28:45,113
Stay.

577
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,194
Stay for a meal.

578
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:47,154
Don't think
I'm just swaying with the wind.

579
00:29:49,513 --> 00:29:50,313
In business,

580
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,474
it's all hard-earned money.
We have to consider everything.

581
00:29:56,313 --> 00:29:59,033
At first, I just wanted
to minimize everyone's losses quickly.

582
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,474
Because I knew
we couldn't afford to lose.

583
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:04,634
But right now, I realize

584
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:06,553
we were wrong.

585
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:08,793
At least I was wrong.

586
00:30:14,113 --> 00:30:15,234
Thinking about it carefully,

587
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:18,914
there's no such thing
as a completely safe venture.

588
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:20,033
Right?

589
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:26,113
This time,

590
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:29,874
I'm willing to bet on Yuehai.

591
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:35,714
Well? Time to show where you stand.

592
00:30:37,714 --> 00:30:38,313
Alright.

593
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:40,073
Since Xuemei put it that way,

594
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:41,674
we should follow her lead.

595
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:42,414
No.

596
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:44,313
- Don't follow me.
- Right.

597
00:30:44,994 --> 00:30:46,394
You should decide for yourselves.

598
00:30:47,154 --> 00:30:50,194
I never had much schooling.
Just a farm woman before.

599
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,994
My success
isn't due to any special talent.

600
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:56,753
I just happened to catch the right wave.

601
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:01,073
Ms. Li was right earlier.

602
00:31:02,674 --> 00:31:04,273
We're the masters of this city.

603
00:31:05,394 --> 00:31:07,833
We built Yuehai from nothing together.

604
00:31:08,714 --> 00:31:09,994
Now it's facing tough times.

605
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:12,714
We can't abandon it.

606
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:16,833
I won't sign that contract.

607
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:18,674
Anyone planning to sign?

608
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,714
I already said I'm with you.

609
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:24,113
We're the masters here, right?

610
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:26,154
Good thing I didn't sign earlier.

611
00:31:31,194 --> 00:31:31,874
Okay.

612
00:31:32,714 --> 00:31:34,833
The contract I just signed
is invalid too.

613
00:31:35,874 --> 00:31:38,434
The one I signed is also invalid.

614
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:40,434
We aren't signing, either.

615
00:31:41,753 --> 00:31:42,513
I'm not signing.

616
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:43,753
I won't sign, either.

617
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:44,833
I'm not signing.

618
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:46,353
I never planned to sign.

619
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:49,113
None of us will sign.

620
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:50,414
Right.

621
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:51,434
No one's signing.

622
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,634
Thank you all.

623
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:23,793
I swear on my character
that Mr. Zheng is clean.

624
00:32:24,394 --> 00:32:26,313
We've worked together since long ago.

625
00:32:27,714 --> 00:32:30,793
By the logic,
Mr. Zheng must have issues.

626
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:33,134
Yes.

627
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:34,914
There's one thing.

628
00:32:37,553 --> 00:32:38,234
Which one?

629
00:32:38,994 --> 00:32:39,714
People...

630
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:44,414
To err is human, right?

631
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:45,914
Elaborate.

632
00:32:49,353 --> 00:32:50,273
Who's badmouthing me?

633
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,313
He raised turtles,
leading everyone into getting scammed.

634
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:57,714
- He forced me to eat.
- Ten thousand yuan.

635
00:32:58,113 --> 00:32:59,613
He took on that loss alone

636
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:00,914
and is still paying it off.

637
00:33:01,154 --> 00:33:02,793
Mr. Zheng's problem is...

638
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:04,874
Said I had to gain five kilograms.

639
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:07,194
I loaned him 2,000.
You say he has money?

640
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:09,313
But he refuses to pay me.
Investigate him.

641
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:10,513
And have him repay me quickly.

642
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:13,234
He colluded with Ms. Li
to rig the scales.

643
00:33:13,593 --> 00:33:14,914
Later, he even locked me up.

644
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,408
After I finished the accounts,

645
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:19,154
he'd double-check them every week.

646
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:21,353
I'm an extremely meticulous person.

647
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:22,154
Right.

648
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,593
Later, he ran to the site
to be the foreman.

649
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,914
He did all my job.

650
00:33:26,474 --> 00:33:28,593
He works diligently

651
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:29,954
and is self-sacrificing.

652
00:33:30,273 --> 00:33:31,513
He'd never seek personal gain.

653
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,414
All other people have gotten rich.

654
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,113
But look at him. Does he change clothes?

655
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:38,313
Of course he does.

656
00:33:38,954 --> 00:33:40,920
But he wears the same clothes
for over a decade.

657
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:43,553
What a secretary!

658
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,313
You find no one like him.

659
00:33:45,434 --> 00:33:48,033
Am I foolish to work with him?
He's a true proletarian soldier.

660
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:50,634
Even after my repeated checks,
he would run his own.

661
00:33:50,634 --> 00:33:52,593
And it wasn't enough.
He'd drag Ms. Li in

662
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:54,154
for a third check.

663
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,994
Mr. Xie, why are you so worked up?

664
00:33:58,353 --> 00:33:59,553
We haven't asked anything yet.

665
00:34:00,033 --> 00:34:02,234
Am I worked up? I'm just stating facts.

666
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,194
Do you know what we'll ask?

667
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:06,174
No.

668
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:07,194
This has gone cold.

669
00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:10,673
Would you mind taking off your T-shirt?

670
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,113
Take...

671
00:34:16,474 --> 00:34:17,673
Take it off?

672
00:34:24,754 --> 00:34:25,553
We are aware

673
00:34:25,954 --> 00:34:28,914
that highway bandit Zheng Zhiqiang
stabbed you.

674
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:30,593
We'd like to see the wound.

675
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:31,994
No need to take it off.

676
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:32,653
Right?

677
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:34,153
There is a female here.

678
00:34:34,354 --> 00:34:35,113
Sorry.

679
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:38,354
Gao Xuemei is your wife, right?

680
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:40,713
That's right.

681
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:42,914
Why?

682
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,274
Are you involved in
Chunmei Printery's daily operations?

683
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:47,874
Am I involved?

684
00:34:48,193 --> 00:34:48,994
Here's the thing.

685
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,173
What's there to hide about this, right?

686
00:34:51,274 --> 00:34:52,354
I was indeed injured.

687
00:34:56,113 --> 00:34:56,874
From what we know,

688
00:34:57,394 --> 00:34:58,794
during your tenure as Yuehai's

689
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:00,834
deputy mayor,

690
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:02,153
Chunmei Printery

691
00:35:02,354 --> 00:35:04,354
underwent a meteoric rise,
from a tiny factory

692
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:07,233
worth tens of thousands annually
to Yuehai's

693
00:35:07,914 --> 00:35:09,193
million-yuan flagship.

694
00:35:09,593 --> 00:35:10,754
Is this correct?

695
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:12,794
Yes.

696
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:16,274
That's all Xuemei's doing.

697
00:35:16,754 --> 00:35:19,193
She built its success single-handedly.

698
00:35:19,553 --> 00:35:21,314
It has nothing to do with Mr. Zheng.

699
00:35:21,593 --> 00:35:23,640
What's Zheng Zhiqiang's relation
to Zheng Decheng?

700
00:35:23,713 --> 00:35:24,434
They're relatives.

701
00:35:25,073 --> 00:35:27,994
Mr. Zheng has an older brother.
Just the two of them.

702
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:30,354
His older brother is Zheng Desheng.

703
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:32,553
Zheng Desheng has three sons.

704
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:34,834
The eldest, the second,
and the youngest.

705
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:36,874
The third son is Zheng Zhiqiang.

706
00:35:37,073 --> 00:35:38,994
Don't explain. Just answer.

707
00:35:39,954 --> 00:35:40,834
As we understand it,

708
00:35:41,153 --> 00:35:43,994
the industrial park
was initiated by your wife.

709
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,434
The town government even took out

710
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:48,952
an eight-million bank loan
for its road construction.

711
00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:50,354
Is this correct?

712
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:53,874
Absolutely impossible.
How could he shield anyone?

713
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:55,633
You know what? Mr. Zheng

714
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:58,073
despises it when relatives
or friends pull this stuff.

715
00:35:58,593 --> 00:35:59,673
He has a fierce temper.

716
00:35:59,713 --> 00:36:02,354
A road less than two kilometers long

717
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:04,113
needed an eight-million loan?

718
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:05,553
Is it an ordinary road?

719
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,434
There was a mountain there originally.

720
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,073
It looks flat now
because we blew up that mountain.

721
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:12,914
How much do you think

722
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:14,113
that would cost?

723
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:16,954
We only spent just over four million
blowing it up.

724
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:17,754
That's correct.

725
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:19,394
After blowing it up,

726
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:22,434
we had 3,926,300 yuan left.

727
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,113
My biggest concern is

728
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:26,994
Mr. Zheng himself
knowingly breaking the law.

729
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:29,354
He can't stand such a thing.

730
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,233
If he finds out immediately,
he might resort to violence.

731
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,553
When we were short on funds,
no one asked.

732
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:36,033
Why ask now?

733
00:36:36,354 --> 00:36:37,434
It wasn't enough.

734
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:39,384
Then I came up with an idea.

735
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:42,593
We used the blasted rocks
to pave the road right there.

736
00:36:43,073 --> 00:36:46,073
That saved on material costs

737
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:49,794
and reduced the expense

738
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,794
of transporting and disposing
of the rubble.

739
00:36:57,354 --> 00:36:58,033
Sir,

740
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:01,474
how much longer
will this investigation take?

741
00:37:02,073 --> 00:37:03,434
Where is Mr. Zheng now?

742
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:07,794
When will Yuehai's accounts be unfrozen?

743
00:37:08,754 --> 00:37:09,474
Why?

744
00:37:10,553 --> 00:37:12,394
The road construction sites are stopped.

745
00:37:12,754 --> 00:37:15,033
But you know what?
This is critical right now.

746
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:17,513
We are at the most crucial stage
of construction.

747
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:18,834
With all the accounts frozen,

748
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:19,513
all our sites...

749
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:20,394
Mr. Tan. Mr. Tan.

750
00:37:20,593 --> 00:37:22,033
We understand the situation.

751
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,593
You may leave now.

752
00:37:23,754 --> 00:37:26,553
We will notify you
when we require further assistance.

753
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:27,914
Sorry.

754
00:37:28,394 --> 00:37:30,754
But sir, please try to expedite this.

755
00:37:30,774 --> 00:37:31,274
Okay.

756
00:37:31,274 --> 00:37:31,914
Take care.

757
00:38:08,994 --> 00:38:10,073
This is Mr. Zheng.

758
00:38:20,874 --> 00:38:21,553
You...

759
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:23,113
are Zheng Shuji?

760
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:23,854
Yes.

761
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:25,354
My name is Zheng Shuji.
[*Shuji sounds like Secretary in Chinese]

762
00:38:27,354 --> 00:38:28,553
Come on. Sit.

763
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:34,153
Your full name is
actually 'Zheng Shuji'?

764
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,474
Correct, my name is Zheng Shuji.

765
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:41,713
(Household Register)
This is my household register.

766
00:38:42,424 --> 00:38:44,113
(Zheng Shuji)

767
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,193
Here are the land use certificates.
Take a look.

768
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,160
(Land Use Certificate)
(Zheng Shuji)

769
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:01,474
It's fine.

770
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:02,994
Alright,

771
00:39:03,914 --> 00:39:05,374
you may go. Take your things.

772
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:07,113
Thank you for cooperating.

773
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:08,434
You may go now.

774
00:39:08,874 --> 00:39:09,673
Escort him out.

775
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:10,314
Okay.

776
00:39:10,593 --> 00:39:11,274
Follow me.

777
00:39:11,394 --> 00:39:12,113
Alright.

778
00:39:13,113 --> 00:39:13,754
Take care.

779
00:39:19,354 --> 00:39:21,994
How could someone
actually be named 'Zheng Shuji'?

780
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:22,914
Exactly.

781
00:39:23,673 --> 00:39:25,513
Sir, I think we should question

782
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:26,834
those deputy mayors some more.

783
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:28,954
Feels like
they're all putting on an act.

784
00:39:29,394 --> 00:39:30,914
Maybe there's more they're hiding.

785
00:39:31,394 --> 00:39:33,314
Yes, they are definitely acting.

786
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,713
After all, they're doing it
for Zheng Decheng.

787
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:38,193
But what they said is true.

788
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:41,673
That industrial park
and the eight million...

789
00:39:43,474 --> 00:39:44,553
These cadres

790
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:47,033
are something.

791
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,193
But it's okay.

792
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,553
When we investigate,
we have to trust the evidence.

793
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:54,593
New evidence will surely surface.

794
00:39:56,073 --> 00:39:58,513
How's the investigation on your end?

795
00:39:59,593 --> 00:40:01,354
Besides the property thing of Mr. Zheng,

796
00:40:01,794 --> 00:40:03,834
we've cross-checked
Yuehai's accounts at least

797
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:05,434
three times.

798
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:07,434
We found no issues.

799
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:09,673
Mr. Zheng...

800
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:11,834
What about you?

801
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,713
The visits
to the self-employed individuals?

802
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,714
We visited 187 self-employed businesses
along Binhai Road.

803
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,593
No useful leads have been found for now.

804
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:21,633
It's normal.

805
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:23,794
If they

806
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:26,633
had any under-the-table money dealings
with Zheng Decheng,

807
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:28,153
them keeping quiet is normal.

808
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:32,794
Alright, let's think

809
00:40:33,754 --> 00:40:34,713
from a different angle.

810
00:40:35,274 --> 00:40:35,994
A new approach.

811
00:40:36,754 --> 00:40:40,033
Go interview
some ordinary workers in Yuehai.

812
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:41,513
Okay.

813
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:42,193
- Okay.
- Okay.

814
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:43,713
I almost forgot.

815
00:40:43,914 --> 00:40:44,513
Mr. Liu,

816
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:48,193
here's the receipt for a TV set.

817
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:49,553
(Payment Receipt)
Found by Qian Changyuan.

818
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:53,113
See?

819
00:40:54,394 --> 00:40:56,713
I told you there'd be more evidence.

820
00:40:57,673 --> 00:40:58,834
Does Zheng Decheng

821
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:00,874
have any other social connections?

822
00:41:01,474 --> 00:41:02,593
He has a son named

823
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,274
Zheng Dapeng.
A high school senior, ready for Gaokao.

824
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,474
He also has a brother-in-law
named Ma Weidong.

825
00:41:07,754 --> 00:41:08,794
We've brought him here.

826
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:10,994
Bring him in.

827
00:41:11,113 --> 00:41:11,794
Right away.

828
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:13,974
Mr. Liu,

829
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:16,233
what about Li Qiuping?

830
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:18,894
Well...

831
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:20,193
It's too late now.

832
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:21,834
Arrange for her to stay the night.

833
00:41:21,994 --> 00:41:23,274
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

834
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:23,914
Okay.

835
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:27,633
Mr. Liu.

836
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:29,994
This is Ma Weidong.

837
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:31,474
Hello, sir.

838
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:33,653
Hello.

839
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:34,693
Please sit.

840
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:35,494
Please sit.

841
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:52,633
Ms. Li, are you feeling better now?

842
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:56,153
Thank you for your concern, sir.
I'm much better.

843
00:42:03,633 --> 00:42:05,434
(New City Life)
Have you read this article?

844
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:07,093
I have.

845
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:09,336
Written by your boyfriend?

846
00:42:11,713 --> 00:42:12,474
Ex-boyfriend.

847
00:42:14,314 --> 00:42:17,673
Then what's your opinion
on the content of this story?

848
00:42:19,394 --> 00:42:20,434
Regarding this story,

849
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:22,754
I do not agree
with its attitude or viewpoint.

850
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:23,914
Why?

851
00:42:25,314 --> 00:42:27,754
First, I don't think he covered

852
00:42:27,954 --> 00:42:29,834
the events that truly happened in Yuehai

853
00:42:29,954 --> 00:42:31,553
from a fair and objective perspective.

854
00:42:31,954 --> 00:42:34,434
Second, I believe my personal attitude

855
00:42:34,673 --> 00:42:35,633
is not important.

856
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:38,113
Determining whether the story is factual

857
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:39,954
or contains exaggerations
or fabrications

858
00:42:40,153 --> 00:42:42,593
is the job of your investigation team.
Don't you agree?

859
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:46,133
Okay.

860
00:42:46,553 --> 00:42:48,754
Then let's talk about your work, Ms. Li.

861
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:52,233
A while ago, you secured
an eight-million bank loan in the name

862
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:55,193
of the town for the industrial park
of self-employed individuals.

863
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:56,513
Is that correct?

864
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:59,713
Correct. Road construction
is city infrastructure.

865
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:01,553
