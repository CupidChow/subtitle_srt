Mr. Xie.

18
00:01:58,984 --> 00:01:59,824
(Shop for Lease)
Why are you here?

19
00:02:00,664 --> 00:02:01,824
I'm looking for a place.

20
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,664
For the karaoke bar, right?

21
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:06,544
Right here?

22
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,223
Yes.

23
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:11,303
No wonder

24
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,664
it's been so long with no news.

25
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:15,743
Haven't even rented a place?

26
00:02:16,664 --> 00:02:17,623
I'm looking for it.

27
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:28,224
This place is good.

28
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:31,183
This is nice.

29
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:33,863
Good location.

30
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:35,224
Not cheap, is it?

31
00:02:35,664 --> 00:02:36,583
No, it's not cheap.

32
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:39,863
So, did you get it?

33
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:42,463
Not yet.

34
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:46,903
Tell me if you have trouble.

35
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:48,944
It's up to you.

36
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:51,463
Is it about money?

37
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:55,504
The landlord insists

38
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:58,183
I pay a full year's rent upfront,

39
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,583
or he'll rent it to others.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,064
I've asked for a loan.

41
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:04,224
However, I'm currently
unable to obtain the loan.

42
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:05,903
I'm trying to find a way.

43
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:08,224
This place is good.

44
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:10,296
How much do you need?

45
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:11,423
30,000.

46
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:12,224
30,000.

47
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:14,463
Not too much.

48
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:15,903
I'll lend it to you.

49
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,903
Pay me back with the same interest rate
as the credit union, okay?

50
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:22,183
Mr. Xie, well...

51
00:03:22,264 --> 00:03:23,064
This is no big deal.

52
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:24,344
You wait here.

53
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:26,064
I'll get the money.

54
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:28,863
I-I'll pay you back
as soon as I get the loan.

55
00:03:29,224 --> 00:03:29,784
No problem.

56
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,703
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

57
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:33,544
I'm glad to help people of Yuehai.

58
00:03:33,863 --> 00:03:34,824
Go keep an eye on it.

59
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:41,544
Here.

60
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:43,224
What's this?

61
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:45,984
I originally wanted to show a movie
for Grandma in the square.

62
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:48,504
Ms. Li said I should let everyone know.

63
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:50,463
Anyone interested is welcome to watch.

64
00:03:50,903 --> 00:03:51,664
What movie?

65
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:54,384
It says on it. Crossroads.

66
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:57,504
What kind of movie is it?

67
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,064
The newest kung fu movie?

68
00:03:59,303 --> 00:03:59,824
No.

69
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:01,664
It's just an old black-and-white movie.

70
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,463
An old movie?

71
00:04:03,463 --> 00:04:06,474
(Broadcast Room)

72
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,064
Xiaohai.

73
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:09,743
You've watched the world.

74
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:11,264
Why are you getting old-fashioned?

75
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:14,944
Now, everyone has a color TV set.

76
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:16,584
The TV shows are all good.

77
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,680
Who will watch black-and-white films?

78
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,024
Yes, I know.

79
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:22,784
But this old copy is all I could get.

80
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,224
Besides,

81
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,183
how small a TV screen is.

82
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:27,623
Movies are awesome.

83
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,823
That giant screen, right?

84
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:30,784
True.

85
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:31,664
Go play it.

86
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:33,263
Okay, I'll do it.

87
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:35,544
Don't blame me if nobody comes.

88
00:04:35,704 --> 00:04:36,303
No, I won't.

89
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:37,623
Thanks a lot.

90
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:38,544
No problem.

91
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:41,664
Attention. I'm broadcasting a notice.

92
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:57,904
Qingtian.

93
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:02,024
Why are you so late?

94
00:05:02,183 --> 00:05:02,863
Come on.

95
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:03,704
You scared me!

96
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:04,423
What's wrong?

97
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,943
Didn't you hear the broadcast?

98
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:07,464
No.

99
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:09,303
Tonight,

100
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,704
Yang Xiaohai is showing a movie
in the square.

101
00:05:12,464 --> 00:05:13,383
Let's go watch.

102
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:14,383
You scared me.

103
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:15,584
Can't you be a bit steadier?

104
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:16,943
Let's go.

105
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:21,183
Let's go.

106
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:22,383
Wait.

107
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:23,503
Why did you get on?

108
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:24,503
Your own bike?

109
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:26,623
M-My bike's broken.

110
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:28,784
Can't you just give me a ride?

111
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:32,584
Fine. Give me that.

112
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:39,823
Hold on tight.

113
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:45,623
Hold on tight.

114
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:49,904
What are you doing?

115
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:51,344
My dad's sleeping.

116
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:16,383
She didn't come?

117
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,144
Stuff was delivered,

118
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:23,704
yet she didn't come.

119
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:24,503
Granny,

120
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:25,743
be quiet.

121
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:27,664
Focus.

122
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:37,104
What's wrong?

123
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:38,784
Hai, what's wrong?

124
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:40,823
Why's there no sound?

125
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:46,383
Sorry about that.

126
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,063
I think this copy is too old.

127
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:52,024
Let me swap it for a new movie.

128
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:54,503
No! We want to watch this one.

129
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:56,183
Yes, we insist on this.

130
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:57,823
But this movie suddenly has no sound.

131
00:06:58,144 --> 00:06:58,704
Xiaohai.

132
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:00,183
What is it?

133
00:07:02,904 --> 00:07:06,328
The copy's too old. No sound.

134
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:07,096
I'm changing it.

135
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,063
If they want it, let them watch.

136
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:10,743
Everyone, stay calm.

137
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,664
We'll watch this movie tonight.

138
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:16,224
He and I
will dub it live together, okay?

139
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:17,743
Can you do it?

140
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:18,984
No problem. I got this.

141
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:21,984
Be careful!

142
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:23,784
I'm fine.

143
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:29,024
Let's do it.

144
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,344
Granny.

145
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,263
Sit.

146
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:43,464
Eyes forward, everyone.

147
00:07:46,104 --> 00:07:47,144
Really beautiful.

148
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:47,784
Really?

149
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:55,104
Now, this lady, Wang Lili,
and I will dub the movie together.

150
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:56,664
We'll do the voices.

151
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:57,503
- Great!
- Great!

152
00:08:03,743 --> 00:08:05,104
Oh, it's her!

153
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:05,784
Good...

154
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,024
Good eye.

155
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:08,943
Granny.

156
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,263
We're starting the dub.

157
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:11,383
Be quiet.

158
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:12,623
Look at me.

159
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:16,024
Lili.

160
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:18,183
Want me to explain this scene?

161
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:19,704
I'll follow your lead.

162
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:21,144
I can catch up.

163
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:24,344
Let's begin.

164
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:30,503
Why isn't she here yet?

165
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,023
What's wrong?

166
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:38,143
I...

167
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:43,263
I saw a beautiful fish in the river.

168
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:45,383
Beautiful fish?

169
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:47,143
Where?

170
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:52,023
You should say, "I'm late."

171
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:54,263
I'm late.

172
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:57,143
You're soaked!

173
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:01,304
He was scared you wouldn't come.

174
00:09:01,304 --> 00:09:01,984
Granny.

175
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,663
Eat this.

176
00:09:04,984 --> 00:09:05,783
Quiet now.

177
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:07,783
Not at all.

178
00:09:08,143 --> 00:09:09,503
I arrived too early.

179
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:13,623
This is the gift you gave me.

180
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:16,503
Do I look pretty in it?

181
00:09:17,783 --> 00:09:19,064
Y-Yes.

182
00:09:19,783 --> 00:09:21,584
I sent you so many postcards.

183
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:23,143
You never replied.

184
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:25,503
How could I?

185
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,824
You were always on the move.

186
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:31,023
Never staying in one spot.

187
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:33,663
This liquor smells great.

188
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:35,023
- Sure.
- Sure.

189
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:36,263
Good drinker.

190
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:37,543
Crabs are ready!

191
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,263
Sit.

192
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:39,743
Ms. Gao, all dishes served.

193
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:41,304
Enjoy yourselves!

194
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:42,543
- Great.
- Great.

195
00:09:43,543 --> 00:09:45,224
Ms. Gao, your assistant is impressive.

196
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:46,224
Good work ability.

197
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:47,304
Good drinker.

198
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:48,743
Of course.

199
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:49,663
My new assistant.

200
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:50,704
Her name's Jessica.

201
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:52,543
She studied abroad.

202
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:54,143
Sir, two seafood noodles.

203
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:54,903
Okay!

204
00:09:56,383 --> 00:09:58,663
Come on! Let's try the food.

205
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,263
For seafood,

206
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:02,623
skip fancy restaurants in Yuehai.

207
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:04,543
Come to street stalls like this.

208
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:05,663
Amazing flavor.

209
00:10:05,783 --> 00:10:07,143
Try it! Go on.

210
00:10:07,304 --> 00:10:10,263
I passed Yan's wonton stall earlier

211
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:11,304
and wanted a bowl.

212
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:12,944
But I found her stall was closed.

213
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:15,143
Didn't you know?

214
00:10:15,584 --> 00:10:17,184
Sun Xiaoyan has landed on her feet.

215
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:18,944
She doesn't care about a stall.

216
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:21,023
Why?

217
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:21,704
Listen,

218
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,503
she and Mr. Xie are an item.

219
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:27,023
Is that true?

220
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,184
I saw it with my own eyes the other day.

221
00:10:29,543 --> 00:10:31,543
They came out of a shop together,

222
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:33,663
laughing and chatting. Quite close.

223
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:35,623
No, sit.

224
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:36,984
Don't worry about it.

225
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,184
I know exactly
what kind of person Xie is.

226
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,304
Take care of our guests.

227
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:44,704
No wonder
Mr. Xie's been staying in the dorm.

228
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:45,984
Come on. Keep eating!

229
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:46,383
Well...

230
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:47,304
Try it.

231
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:49,224
Has he divorced Gao Xuemei yet?

232
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:50,623
No idea.

233
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:51,903
But having said that,

234
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:55,743
no man could handle a woman
like Gao Xuemei.

235
00:10:56,584 --> 00:10:59,143
Of course,
men prefer young and pretty women

236
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:01,584
like Sun Xiaoyan.

237
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:02,344
Oh, please.

238
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:04,304
I'm serious.

239
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:08,704
Did you know
Sun Xiaoyan is opening a karaoke bar?

240
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:09,663
Sure.

241
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:12,903
Right by the traffic light
on Xincheng Road.

242
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,984
Mr. Xie put up the money for her bar.

243
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:17,663
I saw it myself.

244
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,543
In a kraft paper bag,

245
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:20,663
this big!

246
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:24,543
- Ms. Gao!
- Ms. Gao!

247
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:25,184
Ms. Gao?

248
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,064
It's fine.

249
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:32,344
Is she going to catch them cheating?

250
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:33,143
This should be good.

251
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:34,143
Let's go see.

252
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:36,383
Keep the change!

253
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:37,263
Told you to be quiet.

254
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,064
You started it.

255
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:39,903
Mr. Xie.

256
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:44,863
Sun Xiaoyan moved her stall here?

257
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:46,143
Yes, Mr. Xie.

258
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:48,663
Yan is opening her karaoke bar here,

259
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,584
so she moved the stall right here.

260
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,743
That's a smart idea!

261
00:11:53,224 --> 00:11:54,263
She has it both ways.

262
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:55,903
(Yan Dance Hall)
Yes, that's right.

263
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,143
After singing,

264
00:11:58,304 --> 00:11:59,304
customers can eat here.

265
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:00,464
Mr. Xie,

266
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,663
let me get you wontons.

267
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:04,064
Not now. I'll definitely come later.

268
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:06,424
I already paid.

269
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,543
(Construction Site. Keep Out)

270
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:10,704
Yan Dance Hall.

271
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:13,663
Working fast.

272
00:12:14,143 --> 00:12:15,543
The entrance is already decorated.

273
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,863
Yes, still working on the inside.

274
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:19,064
Where's Sun Xiaoyan?

275
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:20,263
She is away.

276
00:12:20,263 --> 00:12:21,224
She'll be back soon.

277
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:24,824
Too many things to do.

278
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:49,944
Electrician?

279
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:51,184
That's me.

280
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:52,344
What's up?

281
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,368
You started painting
before the wiring was done?

282
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:00,184
The owner is away,
so you're slacking off?

283
00:13:00,944 --> 00:13:02,143
The wiring's all laid out.

284
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:04,464
Why are you working alone?

285
00:13:05,424 --> 00:13:06,944
She can't afford many people.

286
00:13:07,623 --> 00:13:08,503
I can do it all.

287
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:09,912
I'm a good man,

288
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:11,464
so I undertake it all.

289
00:13:12,023 --> 00:13:12,623
Impressive.

290
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:14,344
Yuehai has skilled people.

291
00:13:15,224 --> 00:13:16,984
Your paint job doesn't look great.

292
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,263
Mr. Xie,

293
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:23,184
you left your jacket at my stall.

294
00:13:23,184 --> 00:13:23,832
Here it is...

295
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:25,503
Can't you see the problem?

296
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:27,143
Mr. Xie.

297
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:28,543
You think you can do it all?

298
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:29,143
Mr. Xie,

299
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:30,704
I really can't afford more workers.

300
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:31,903
He said he could handle it,

301
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:33,023
so I let him work.

302
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:33,863
I told you.

303
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:36,663
I'm not a layman.

304
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,296
W-Who are you? Mind your business.

305
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:39,704
- Get out if you can't do it!
- Mr. Ren, pipe down.

306
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:40,503
Put up or shut up!

307
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:41,064
Mr. Xie.

308
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:41,783
Get out of here.

309
00:13:41,783 --> 00:13:42,616
Who are you with?

310
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,416
Mr. Xie.

311
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,600
- Why should I tell you?
- No matter what,

312
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,623
- Lin Dongfu oversees him, right?
- Yes.

313
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,984
He's away, so I'm in charge.

314
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:48,743
I-I know.

315
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:51,480
Listen, when Yuehai was being built,
if you were like this...

316
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:51,984
Mr. Xie.

317
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:52,424
Get down!

318
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:53,543
Enough. Don't be angry.

319
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:53,944
Come on.

320
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:54,863
Mr. Xie, calm down.

321
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:55,743
- Let's be clear.
- Mr. Xie.

322
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:56,663
Calm down.

323
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,663
Mr. Xie, I need him to work for me.

324
00:13:58,663 --> 00:13:59,944
No, I need to make it clear.

325
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:02,383
Mr. Xie, just let it go.

326
00:14:02,944 --> 00:14:04,584
Don't try to fool her!

327
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:05,783
I'm involved in this too.

328
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,704
I got you! I knew you were involved.

329
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:16,023
How dare you!

330
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:17,903
- Gao Xuemei!
- How could you?

331
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:19,903
Speak up. Come on.

332
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:21,048
What is this about?

333
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,808
Speak up.

334
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:24,464
What's going on here?

335
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:27,344
Speak! What are you doing here?

336
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:29,224
There are many eyes.

337
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:29,863
Go.

338
00:14:30,064 --> 00:14:30,944
What is this for?

339
00:14:31,224 --> 00:14:31,944
I'm asking you!

340
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:33,304
Xuemei.

341
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:34,543
Get lost!

342
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,304
Gao Xuemei, what's gotten into you?

343
00:14:37,263 --> 00:14:37,944
What's wrong?

344
00:14:38,663 --> 00:14:39,584
What do you think?

345
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:41,023
What are you doing here?

346
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:42,623
What is this for?

347
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,023
Can't you

348
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:44,863
see it?

349
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,383
It's a renovation.

350
00:14:46,464 --> 00:14:47,224
A renovation.

351
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:48,743
Stop trying to fool me.

352
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:49,783
Listen, Xuemei.

353
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:50,663
Get out of here!

354
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:51,543
See?

355
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:53,304
I bought it at the Canton Fair.

356
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,464
Undressing just now?

357
00:14:55,783 --> 00:14:57,224
How could you?

358
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:58,143
Xuemei.

359
00:14:58,344 --> 00:14:59,143
You misunderstood.

360
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:00,304
- Get out!
- Don't talk.

361
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,464
Pick that up for me.

362
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:03,640
It isn't done yet.

363
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,304
Once it's done,
you'll be ready to sleep here, right?

364
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:07,424
What nonsense!

365
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,623
Why are you being so nasty?

366
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:10,824
Look where you are!

367
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:11,704
Are you crazy?

368
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:12,984
Are you trying to start a fight?

369
00:15:12,984 --> 00:15:13,944
Get out!

370
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:15,263
Get out!

371
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:16,704
Are you embarrassed?

372
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:17,863
Don't throw a fit here.

373
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:18,584
Explain it to me!

374
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:19,663
Don't go crazy

375
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,263
in front of all these people.

376
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:22,064
Explain it to me!

377
00:15:22,263 --> 00:15:23,064
What should I say?

378
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:24,863
What do you want me to explain?

379
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:26,464
Xuemei, you've misunderstood.

380
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:27,743
- Don't talk.
- Shut up.

381
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:29,383
You speak.

382
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:30,464
I'm telling you to speak.

383
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,143
Fine, will you listen to me?

384
00:15:32,503 --> 00:15:33,064
Go ahead.

385
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:37,944
I have nothing to explain.

386
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:39,143
What should I explain?

387
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:40,064
What should I explain?

388
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:42,023
Too ashamed to explain, huh?

389
00:15:42,143 --> 00:15:43,263
It's not like that.

390
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:44,088
Your business...

391
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:45,704
Shut... Do you want to speak?

392
00:15:46,304 --> 00:15:47,263
I'll let you speak.

393
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:50,584
Did he give you the money for this?

394
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:55,304
Yes, I did get money from him, but...

395
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:55,704
Enough!

396
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,064
My money, Gao Xuemei.

397
00:15:57,143 --> 00:15:57,704
Enough!

398
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:58,344
Stop it!

399
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,304
I gave her my money.

400
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,143
Did you hear him?

401
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:02,143
Listen to me.

402
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:02,903
How could he?

403
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:03,663
Listen to me!

404
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:04,704
You have no shame.

405
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:05,263
Listen to me.

406
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:06,143
What did I do?

407
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:06,824
Listen,

408
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:08,143
I lent her money.

409
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,543
Can you look in the face

410
00:16:09,623 --> 00:16:10,824
of your buddy?

411
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:12,584
I'm off.

412
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:13,704
Stop!

413
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:14,383
You're crazy.

414
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:15,143
You stay here.

415
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:16,143
'You're crazy'?

416
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:18,263
This is Lin Dongfu's girlfriend.

417
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:19,903
Have you no shame?

418
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,824
Enough, Gao Xuemei!
What do you want to hear?

419
00:16:22,903 --> 00:16:23,384
What?

420
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:24,704
I'll say what you want to hear.

421
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:25,984
Give me the facts.

422
00:16:27,224 --> 00:16:28,824
I can make you succeed.

423
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,824
I can make her too.

424
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:30,783
Are you happy now?

425
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:32,184
Mr. Xie!

426
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:32,944
Happy?

427
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:35,984
I didn't lend money to her!

428
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:36,743
I gave it to her!

429
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:38,064
Listen, this place

430
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,824
will be called Chun Yan Dance Hall.

431
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:40,704
It's settled!

432
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:41,743
- Mr. Xie!
- What?

433
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:43,224
Satisfied?

434
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,184
I've invested.

435
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,064
It's my business.

436
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:51,576
(Yan Dance Hall)

437
00:17:03,503 --> 00:17:07,184
Let's divorce tomorrow.
Whoever backs off will be a coward!

438
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:11,303
Shameless!

439
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:13,184
Move!

440
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:42,263
Sorry about that.

441
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:55,303
Mr. Zheng,

442
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:57,704
this is the purchase list for this week.

443
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:58,743
Take a look.

444
00:17:59,303 --> 00:18:00,944
If it looks okay, could you sign it?

445
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:02,664
Shouldn't Xie sign this?

446
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:05,063
Yes, but I couldn't find him.

447
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:06,464
We need it urgently.

448
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:10,624
Okay, thank you.

449
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:18,424
Mr. Zheng.

450
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:19,704
Stamp it.

451
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:23,384
Isn't procurement Xie's duty?

452
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,384
Mr. Xie took a few days off.

453
00:18:28,864 --> 00:18:29,823
Because of yesterday?

454
00:18:31,384 --> 00:18:33,543
It has caused quite a stir in town.

455
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,984
Will they actually get divorced?

456
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:39,063
Impossible.

457
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:41,904
I know Xie and his wife too well.

458
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,984
They've argued fiercely before.

459
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,743
Xie moved out ages ago.

460
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:47,096
They didn't divorce.

461
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:50,184
But this time is different.

462
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:51,783
You mean the thing with Sun Xiaoyan?

463
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:53,543
That must be a mistake.

464
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:55,783
I know Xie

465
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,384
very well.

466
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,144
He is a smooth talker,

467
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:02,224
but he's proper
when it comes to relationships.

468
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:07,743
Besides, this fight they're having

469
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:11,543
might just clear the air,
and they'll make up.

470
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:13,144
Really?

471
00:19:13,464 --> 00:19:14,224
So he took a leave

472
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:15,624
and went home.

473
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:17,624
You keep an eye on Mr. Lin

474
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,144
these next few days.

475
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:21,743
He tends to fixate on things.

476
00:19:22,023 --> 00:19:24,743
Hearing all this gossip
will probably drive him crazy.

477
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:27,424
True.

478
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,572
(Respect Knowledge, Respect Talent)

479
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:31,032
(Chunmei Printery)

480
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:02,823
Go.

481
00:20:28,664 --> 00:20:29,303
Mad at me?

482
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:30,103
So what?

483
00:20:31,424 --> 00:20:32,063
Don't stop me!

484
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:33,904
Stop!

485
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:35,823
Is that all you've got?

486
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:37,384
Is that all?

487
00:20:37,543 --> 00:20:38,823
What are you trying to do?

488
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:40,103
What?

489
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:42,704
What did you take?

490
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:46,743
Want to search me?

491
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:48,904
What did I take?

492
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:51,583
Alright, take a look.

493
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:53,823
I barely have anything here.

494
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:55,904
I've looked everywhere. I just found...

495
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:58,783
I just found old clothes.

496
00:21:04,704 --> 00:21:05,184
A flower!

497
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:07,783
Don't touch.

498
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:08,224
Open it!

499
00:21:09,303 --> 00:21:10,503
It's a photo. Okay?

500
00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:11,224
Drop the act!

501
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:12,543
Come on.

502
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:13,823
Alright, I admit it.

503
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:15,624
Xie Chunlai!

504
00:21:17,063 --> 00:21:17,984
Move aside!

505
00:21:18,664 --> 00:21:19,263
No!

506
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:20,543
Move!

507
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:26,023
What is this?

508
00:21:27,343 --> 00:21:28,063
Whose is this?

509
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:30,384
Explain this!

510
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:32,063
What a flashy dress!

511
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:34,023
Going for a new life?

512
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:35,464
Xie Chunlai.

513
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:37,063
Your new life is coming.

514
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:39,063
It never ends, right?

515
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,944
Can't you let it go?

516
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:42,023
Stop it!

517
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:43,023
I won't

518
00:21:43,023 --> 00:21:43,904
gift something old,

519
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:45,224
but something new!

520
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,864
Nobody wants your flashy clothes.

521
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,303
Flashy clothes?

522
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:50,783
How dare you!

523
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,904
I'm just fancier
and grander than that woman.

524
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:55,543
I-I wanted

525
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,224
to keep it as a memento.

526
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:58,743
Now, I don't want it, okay?

527
00:21:59,103 --> 00:21:59,944
I don't want it!

528
00:22:00,103 --> 00:22:01,543
Satisfied now?

529
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,063
A memento?

530
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,984
Your love for this home is

531
00:22:06,144 --> 00:22:07,384
as empty as this suitcase.

532
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:08,263
Drop the act!

533
00:22:08,424 --> 00:22:09,184
Shame on you!

534
00:22:09,184 --> 00:22:11,343
- You are owner of here? Are you?
- You took my stuff.

535
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:13,343
You live here
because the business is here.

536
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:13,984
My stuff...

537
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,263
Move! You're in the way! Move!

538
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,343
Move aside!

539
00:22:20,343 --> 00:22:21,103
What do you want?

540
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:21,944
What do you want?

541
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,063
What do you want?

542
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:23,783
You took my stuff.

543
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:24,343
Come on!

544
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,224
I caught you.

545
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:26,144
You're in my way!

546
00:22:26,224 --> 00:22:27,023
What do you want?

547
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:29,184
Please. How are you going to torture me?

548
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:30,303
How?

549
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,543
I'm...

550
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:33,664
Wait a moment. Sorry.

551
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:36,424
Almost forgot.

552
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:37,424
Your stuff.

553
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:39,583
Come on. This is what you just gave me.

554
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,783
Check it out. It's good.

555
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:43,032
Take a look.

556
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:43,916
It's good.

557
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:06,743
Well...

558
00:23:09,184 --> 00:23:11,464
Give me back
the phoenix-and-dragon pillowcases.

559
00:23:11,743 --> 00:23:13,704
I lost the dragon ones.

560
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:15,384
I embroidered them myself.

561
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,063
That's a premarital asset.

562
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,120
What do you mean?

563
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,743
You gave it to me before marriage.

564
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:22,823
I paid for what you eat,

565
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,823
wear, drink, and use.

566
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:24,824
I never got them back.

567
00:23:24,824 --> 00:23:25,823
Yes, you bought them.

568
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,664
With my money!

569
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:27,424
Are you kidding?

570
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,263

I'd have gone into business.

Listen,

640
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:38,743
there's a kind of relationship

00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:44,344
Never change it. Lock it.

761
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:46,344
Don't worry.

762
00:36:46,543 --> 00:36:48,984
I won't fail your guidance.

763
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:37,560
(Tianli Beauty Salon)

764
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,633
(Despite criticism,
I'm determined to serve the people.)

765
00:37:39,633 --> 00:37:41,703
(If we don't burst out in silence,
we will perish in silence)

766
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,063
(I can't do without Mei)

767
00:37:49,063 --> 00:37:49,703
Mr. Zheng!

768
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:50,583
You got divorced?

769
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:50,904
Calm.

770
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:52,503
Good for you,

771
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:53,223
Xie Chunlai!

772
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:54,944
Did you report it to the above?

773
00:37:55,384 --> 00:37:56,904
Did you apply for it? Did I agree?

774
00:37:56,904 --> 00:37:57,503
He's upset.

775
00:37:57,503 --> 00:37:59,063
I never agreed to this!

776
00:37:59,063 --> 00:37:59,623
You have

777
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:00,384
broken the rule.

778
00:38:00,703 --> 00:38:02,103
Do you know that?

779
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:03,384
- Take it off.
- Stop.

780
00:38:03,384 --> 00:38:03,784
Back off.

781
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:04,264
Calm down.

782
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:05,703
Let him take it off!

783
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:08,503
Go on!

784
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:10,384
If you dare, take it off.

785
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:11,023
Go ahead.

786
00:38:11,344 --> 00:38:11,984
I dare you.

787
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:13,944
Stop acting!

788
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:15,503
See?

789
00:38:15,864 --> 00:38:17,063
Xie, stop acting like this.

790
00:38:17,183 --> 00:38:17,623
Come on!

791
00:38:18,143 --> 00:38:19,784
We're here to comfort you.

792
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:21,424
Leave him alone!

793
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:24,663
I can't take it off.

794
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:25,624
Let me get it off.

795
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:26,344
It won't come off.

796
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:27,264
I'll take it off.

797
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,344
It won't come off.

798
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:29,984
What if I do take it off?

799
00:38:29,984 --> 00:38:31,143
It won't come off!

800
00:38:31,223 --> 00:38:32,143
I got it off.

801
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:39,623
No.

802
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:42,503
I-I...

803
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:43,663
It didn't come off.

804
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:44,824
I didn't take it off. See?

805
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:47,503
I thought she would admit she was wrong.

806
00:38:48,143 --> 00:38:49,784
She gave me a new motorcycle.

807
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:51,344
She just stood there.

808
00:38:51,744 --> 00:38:52,424
I thought,

809
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:55,543
"If you admit your mistake,
I'd forgive you."

810
00:38:55,984 --> 00:38:58,543
And she said that she wanted a divorce.

811
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:02,584
I never want a divorce.

812
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,583
We're an old couple. Is that necessary?

813
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:05,984
No, you didn't have to.

814
00:39:06,424 --> 00:39:07,503
She forced me.

815
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:08,503
She forced me.

816
00:39:08,503 --> 00:39:09,503
It's fine.

817
00:39:09,503 --> 00:39:10,183
It's fine, Xie.

818
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:11,223
It's not your fault.

819
00:39:11,503 --> 00:39:12,264
I don't care.

820
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:14,063
I can live without her.

821
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:14,583
Right.

822
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:15,824
Calm down.

823
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:16,503
Alright.

824
00:39:16,703 --> 00:39:17,183
Calm down.

825
00:39:17,183 --> 00:39:18,183
At that point,

826
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:18,864
what could I do?

827
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:20,784
She forced me to divorce.

828
00:39:21,703 --> 00:39:23,384
You're a grown man. Stop crying!

829
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:24,703
You're all forcing me too.

830
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:26,344
You're bad people.

831
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:27,663
We're bad people.

832
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:28,944
Come on. Sit and rest.

833
00:39:29,143 --> 00:39:30,023
Calm down.

834
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:31,703
You're forcing me.

835
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:32,223
Stop crying.

836
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:32,904
There, there.

837
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:34,543
Stop crying.

838
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:35,744
You can't take it off.

839
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:37,063
We all need to calm down.

840
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:38,223
Mr. Zheng, sit.

841
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:41,023
Is admitting a mistake really that hard?

842
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:42,103
Yes.

843
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:44,663
It hasn't been easy for anyone.

844
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:47,183
My new motorbike is really fast.

845
00:39:47,824 --> 00:39:49,583
We got there in no time.

846
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,703
It's okay. It'll all pass.

847
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:53,503
You'll be fine.

848
00:40:00,304 --> 00:40:01,264
It's about feng shui.

849
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:07,063
The f-feng shui here is bad.

850
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:10,864
It is not a good place for couples.

851
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:13,103
I don't like hearing that.

852
00:40:13,103 --> 00:40:14,143
Superstitious nonsense.

853
00:40:14,143 --> 00:40:15,352
Don't tell me you believe it?

854
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:16,583
You can't be superstitious.

855
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:17,623
- I...
- It's personal.

856
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,183
- Mr. Zheng...
- How can you blame the place?

857
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,384
Ms. Li, right?

858
00:40:20,864 --> 00:40:21,623
Mr. Tan,

859
00:40:22,063 --> 00:40:22,744
and Lin Tofu.

860
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,904
They are all single.

861
00:40:24,824 --> 00:40:25,623
Superstitious.

862
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:26,424
Right?

863
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:29,304
Yu and Qingtian are both single, right?

864
00:40:30,063 --> 00:40:32,623
T-There were couples,

865
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:34,623
but they broke up.

866
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:36,904
So many have gone.

867
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:37,503
I'm staying!

868
00:40:37,503 --> 00:40:38,503
I don't agree with that.

869
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,063
Stop complaining and blaming others.

870
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:40,744
Exactly.

871
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,264
- Don't be superstitious.
- I'll have a new life.

872
00:40:42,784 --> 00:40:43,864
I want to be with you.

873
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:44,944
Have a good cry.

874
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,344
But we can't be superstitious.

875
00:40:46,424 --> 00:40:47,384
I can't take it off.

876
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:48,503
Okay, you can't.

877
00:40:48,503 --> 00:40:48,984
Stop trying.

878
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:50,264
- It's in my flesh.
- Not taking it off.

879
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,984
- It's in my flesh.
- It's grown into your flesh, okay?

880
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,128
- Connected to my bone.
- Sure.

881
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:57,400
Y-You can't take it off,
even if you break the bone.

882
00:40:57,744 --> 00:40:59,023
Let him sleep. He'll be fine.

883
00:40:59,384 --> 00:41:00,063
We work tomorrow.

884
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:02,264
Once we start working,
we'll forget everything.

885
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:03,543
I order you to sleep.

886
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:04,703
Yes, listen to Mr. Zheng.

887
00:41:04,703 --> 00:41:05,848
Go to sleep, okay?

888
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:07,223
Go to sleep.

889
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:10,904
I'm alone in the world.

890
00:41:10,984 --> 00:41:11,904
You're leaving.

891
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:13,784
Listen to him! Stop crying.

892
00:41:14,703 --> 00:41:15,304
- Go.
- Sleep.

893
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:16,583
You're leaving.

894
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:18,904
I can't take it off.

895
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:19,824
I can't take it off.

896
00:41:20,824 --> 00:41:22,583
I'm alone in the world.

897
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,864
I'm alone in the world.

898
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:29,824
Everyone has worked hard these days.

899
00:41:30,744 --> 00:41:32,063
We open for business tomorrow.

900
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,944
Make sure you follow the duties
I assigned earlier.

901
00:41:35,304 --> 00:41:36,583
Manage your respective areas.

902
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:39,344
We expect quite a few guests tomorrow.

903
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:42,864
Get drinks and fruit ready carefully.
Keep it tight.

904
00:41:43,023 --> 00:41:44,023
Don't worry, Yan.

905
00:41:44,304 --> 00:41:44,663
Hong.

906
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:47,023
(Yan Dance Hall)
The wonton stall remains open.

907
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,543
Customers will probably be hungry
after singing tomorrow.

908
00:41:51,223 --> 00:41:53,344
Let's prepare the meat filling
a day in advance.

909
00:41:53,864 --> 00:41:54,744
Alright, that's all.

910
00:41:55,103 --> 00:41:55,503
Got it.

911
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:56,424
No problem, Yan.

912
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:17,904
Lin Tofu,

913
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:20,663
maybe you should resign.

914
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:26,503
Why should I resign?

915
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:28,264
You might feel uncomfortable.

916
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:29,623
That's my advice for you.

917
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,703
If you resign,
you won't have to see me anymore.

918
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:51,264
Sun Xiaoyan mortgaged her house
for a loan.

919
00:42:51,583 --> 00:42:52,543
She's paid me back.

920
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:01,904
