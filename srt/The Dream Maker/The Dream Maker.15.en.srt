Xie.

(Yuehai's Little Wall Street)
Have you read the Yuehai Column

18
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:47,434
in "New City Life"?

19
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:48,354
It mentions you.

20
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:49,315
No time

21
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:51,115
for tea, newspapers, or idle chat.

22
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:53,835
It's important to read newspapers.

23
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:56,595
I think the choice of words
and phrasing is really good,

24
00:01:56,794 --> 00:01:58,154
especially the last sentence.

25
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:00,675
"Ms. Gao said

26
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:05,315
her achievements wouldn't be possible
without her husband's understanding."

27
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,554
Angry now?

28
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:16,875
Men should be more magnanimous.

29
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:20,074
Men can also be behind the scenes.
Don't you think so?

00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:52,354
One, two.

33
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:53,834
Here!

34
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:55,074
The road roller.

35
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:56,315
Everyone,

36
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:57,074
thank you all.

37
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:57,834
Take a look!

38
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:00,234
Come on, sir.

39
00:03:00,834 --> 00:03:01,475
Mr. Lin.

40
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:03,915
I've brought people
to fix the road roller.

41
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:04,954
It'll be fixed soon.

42
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:05,954
Ms. Li.

43
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:11,954
Ms. Li, thank you.

44
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:14,435
You're welcome. It'll be fixed soon.

45
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:16,995
Let me do it.

46
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:18,915
It's fine. Give it to me.

47
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:20,435
Don't worry.

48
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:22,255
Ms. Li.

49
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:22,995
It's fine.

50
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:24,234
Wait.

51
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:25,755
It's not your job.

52
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:27,155
I need to talk to you.

53
00:03:27,554 --> 00:03:28,755
I met Sun Xiaoyan.

54
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,514
Come on.

55
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,315
Why are you all standing? Get to work!

56
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,435
Ms. Li, I didn't...

57
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,514
Towards her, I...

58
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:52,155
She's a woman with a hard life,

59
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,035
supporting a four-year-old child

60
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:55,875
and a 50-something-year-old mother.

61
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:57,595
The whole family depends on her alone.

62
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:58,995
It's very hard.

63
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:01,674
I also asked her what she thinks of you.

64
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,435
She said...

65
00:04:07,354 --> 00:04:08,875
Mr. Lin, pull harder!

66
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:13,554
Mr. Lin.

67
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:16,035
She said you have good character.

68
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:19,314
You're capable and loyal.

69
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:20,915
But you're not talkative.

70
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:24,554
Of course,
not all women like sweet talk.

71
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:28,075
Sometimes,
actions speak louder than words.

72
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:30,715
In matters like this,

73
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:33,475
shouldn't the man be more proactive?

74
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:34,775
Right?

75
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:38,234
Yes, you're right.

76
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:47,955
Since you came to me about this,

77
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,114
I'll definitely find you a spot.

78
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:53,035
Don't dry grain
in the sports field again, okay?

79
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:57,475
But near my home,
that is the only flat place.

80
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:00,194
No drying, no food.

81
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,194
The grain will get moldy.

82
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:04,515
That's not what I meant.

83
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,794
I'm not telling you to go without food.

84
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:08,754
I bear you no grudge.

85
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:10,354
Why would I make you go hungry?

86
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:11,915
- I'm not stopping you.
- Mr. Xie.

87
00:05:11,915 --> 00:05:12,415
- Right?
- Mr. Xie.

88
00:05:12,874 --> 00:05:14,035
- Mr. Xie.
- Okay?

89
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:14,635
It's fine.

90
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:15,554
- Stop!
- Calm down!

91
00:05:15,554 --> 00:05:16,595
Your heart isn't good.

92
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,434
Zhao from the Power Supply Bureau
is here.

93
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:19,554
Tell him to wait.

94
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:20,174
Just wait.

95
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,194
He is leaving. I can't stop him.

96
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:23,595
Alright.

97
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:25,674
I'll be right back.

98
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:32,994
What's wrong, Mr. Xie?

99
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:34,354
Stay longer.

100
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,794
But I've finished my work here.

101
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:39,395
Is everything fine?

102
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,314
Sure, everything seems good.

103
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,075
No problems?

104
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:42,874
None.

105
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:43,955
I posed a problem

106
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,794
about installing new power poles,
remember?

107
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,354
It's been a month for the process.

108
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,035
Not finished yet?

109
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:55,275
Give me a rough date,
so I can explain to the people.

110
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,354
Mr. Xie, it's not just the process.

111
00:05:57,994 --> 00:05:59,694
Give me more time
to think about it, okay?

112
00:06:07,095 --> 00:06:08,515
Wait, the lock isn't broken.

113
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,955
I know what you meant.
You won't do what should be done.

114
00:06:14,314 --> 00:06:16,075
It's evasion, shirking responsibility.

115
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:17,835
Think about it right here.

116
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:18,655
Come on.

117
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:19,234
No.

118
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:20,035
Call Mr. Wang.

119
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:25,155
The Power Supply Bureau
is severely understaffed right now.

120
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,075
There are many power poles
to be installed.

121
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:28,554
We're super busy.

122
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,194
I don't buy it.

123
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:30,872
I'm short-staffed too.

124
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:33,434
We need sufficient manpower
to build a big city.

125
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:35,155
Yes, listen to me.

126
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:37,515
You saw those temporary power poles.

127
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:38,874
The wires up there are tangled.

128
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,434
Don't you know they're overloaded?

129
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:41,874
I won't take the risk.

130
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:44,455
Either Wang Defa or you take it.

131
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:47,554
How could I possibly take it?

132
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:48,715
There you go.

133
00:06:49,395 --> 00:06:50,975
Call Wang Defa right now.

134
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:53,525
If it isn't solved today,
you're not going anywhere.

135
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:55,194
Give me a concrete installation date.

136
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:56,754
It must be done by standards.

137
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:59,114
Each power pole must
be spaced 50 meters apart.

138
00:06:59,434 --> 00:07:01,554
Don't let those wires
resemble a fishing net.

139
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:07,674
Call him now,
and then meet me at the clinic.

140
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,475
(Conference Room)
Wait, don't leave.

141
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:11,794
The problem isn't solved yet.

142
00:07:11,794 --> 00:07:12,915
Problem solved.

143
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:14,595
Problem solved.

144
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:15,754
Good news.

145
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:20,395
West of Fuyu Road,
there's an abandoned basketball court,

146
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:23,234
currently used for drying fishing nets
and sundries.

147
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:25,515
Deng, coordinate this immediately.

148
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:28,314
Tell them that I ordered it cleared.

149
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,835
You can dry your grain there.

150
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:31,874
Okay.

151
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:33,475
It's solved.

152
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,674
- Thank you.
- Happy now?

153
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,254
Sure.

154
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:36,075
Thank you.

155
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:36,835
Go ahead.

156
00:07:37,035 --> 00:07:38,715
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

157
00:07:38,715 --> 00:07:39,234
Thanks.

158
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:39,934
You may go.

159
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:41,114
Go and dry your grain.

160
00:07:41,314 --> 00:07:41,874
Thank you.

161
00:07:41,874 --> 00:07:42,434
Go now.

162
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:43,275
- Thanks.
- Come on.

163
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:46,035
Mr. Xie.

164
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:48,075
Task completed.

165
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:50,835
Mr. Wang will resolve
your power pole issue next week.

166
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:53,835
High efficiency, huh?

167
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:54,494
Yes.

168
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,635
I have to go, Mr. Xie.

169
00:07:56,354 --> 00:07:56,854
See you.

170
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:01,955
Implement it promptly.

171
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:02,635
Okay.

172
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:05,015
- I'll see you again if it gets nowhere.
- Alright.

173
00:08:09,294 --> 00:08:09,794
Mr. Du.

174
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:10,434
Hello, Mr. Xie.

175
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,035
Are you not here for me?

176
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:13,994
I'm here for Mr. Tan.

177
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:14,874
Have you seen him?

178
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:15,595
No, I haven't.

179
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:16,475
He's away?

180
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:17,354
So, you...

181
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:17,854
Mr. Du.

182
00:08:18,354 --> 00:08:18,874
Hello.

183
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,155
I previously interviewed
about the city inspectors.

184
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:24,035
- I have follow-up questions.
- Hi, Mr. Du.

185
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:24,595
Hello.

186
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:25,275
- Mr. Du.
- Hello.

187
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:28,075
Regarding the previous interview,

188
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:30,314
I'd like to explore a few more aspects
thoroughly.

189
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:31,475
Thanks for attention.

190
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:35,074
I read your article on Lin Dongfu.

191
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:35,615
Excellent.

192
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:36,174
Mr. Du.

193
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,015
Hello.

194
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:39,074
Is he just wandering around?

195
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:45,434
- Your report on Gao Xuemei was good.
- Thank you.

196
00:08:45,434 --> 00:08:47,535
So next,
you'll write about Tan Guangming, right?

197
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,074
And then me.

198
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,755
Great.

199
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,035
Mr. Xie,

200
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:55,074
about interviewing you,

201
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:56,735
I've carefully considered it.

202
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:58,674
But I haven't yet

203
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,474
found the right angle.

204
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,235
I probably need more time

205
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,355
to analyze your qualities.

206
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:06,814
- I have no qualities?
- Mr. Tan.

207
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:07,434
Seriously?

208
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:08,035
You're here.

209
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,155
I've been here.

210
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:10,314
I have no qualities?

211
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:11,554
You said you would take me

212
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:12,314
somewhere.

213
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:13,594
Shall we go now?

214
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:14,794
Sure, let's go.

215
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:15,714
Xie.

216
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:17,834
I'm heading out with Mr. Du.
See you later.

217
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:18,995
Goodbye, Mr. Xie.

218
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:23,474
We are...

219
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:24,714
This way.

220
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:32,635
Don't I have any qualities?

221
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:36,434
Get this entire tree in frame.

222
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:37,714
Mr. Tan, step forward a bit.

223
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:39,355
- Yes.
- Two steps forward.

224
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:40,434
So, if I get closer to you,

225
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:42,074
- this tree will be in frame?
- Yes.

226
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:42,915
Got it.

227
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:44,434
Get ready.

228
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:45,115
Sorry.

229
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:45,794
Wait a moment.

230
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:48,594
Take off my glasses.

231
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:49,714
Are you ready?

232
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:50,635
Sure, I'm ready.

233
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:51,314
I'll take it now.

234
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:52,054
Okay.

235
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:54,915
Three, two, one.

236
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:56,775
Done.

237
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:58,434
Perfect! Thank you.

238
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,355
This tree was

239
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,635
in the frame, right?

240
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:02,474
Sure. Don't worry.

241
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:03,275
Thank you.

242
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:04,174
Mr. Tan.

243
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:05,915
You brought me all the way here

244
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,474
just to photograph this tree?

245
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:10,635
Anyway, this tree means a lot to me.

246
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:12,635
Mr. Du,

247
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:14,194
could you do me one favor?

248
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,434
When the article gets published,

249
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:17,594
could you

250
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,035
use the photo with this tree?

251
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:21,314
Sure, I could, but why?

252
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,995
Do you have a history with this tree?

253
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:26,755
Well, it's just

254
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,954
that I've been in Yuehai for decades.

255
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,355
This tree wasn't nearly this big.

256
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,074
So what?

257
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:38,714
Well...

258
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:40,635
Can we

259
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:41,314
take another one?

260
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:42,194
Could you also

261
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,344
include the Yuejiang Bridge
in the background?

262
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:46,794
That bridge hasn't changed
in over a thousand years.

263
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:48,594
Okay, no problem.

264
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:49,554
I'll just snap one more.

265
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:50,214
Thanks.

266
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:51,474
So sorry about this.

267
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:52,155
It's okay.

268
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:53,934
Good.

269
00:10:54,674 --> 00:10:56,474
Mr. Tan, shift slightly left.

270
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,515
Okay, like this?

271
00:10:58,674 --> 00:10:59,515
(Yuejiang Bridge)
Good. Perfect.

272
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:01,995
Three, two, one.

273
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:04,355
Qiuping.

274
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:06,655
Mr. Zheng.

275
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:09,235
Qiuping, I have to
go back to work after lunch.

276
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,424
I'll try to return tonight.

277
00:11:11,074 --> 00:11:12,474
Don't forget what you need to take.

278
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:15,375
Don't worry. I remember. Leaving now.

279
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:23,875
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li, we're back.

280
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:28,314
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li,

281
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:30,954
I'm here to report something.

282
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:32,355
What happened?

283
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:37,074
Tell us now. Did Mr. Lin succeed?

284
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:43,755
He's coming.

285
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,376
(Delicious and affordable. Try it now!)

286
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,474
Mr. Lin, you're here.

287
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:54,115
Same as usual?
Please sit. I'll be quick.

288
00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:55,735
I...

289
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:01,875
- I...
- Sit.

290
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:11,674
I'm scared.

291
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:25,474
Why is it so quiet?

292
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:26,834
I have no idea.

293
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:27,995
Check again.

294
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:28,655
Okay.

295
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:52,194
Coming!

296
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:53,674
You sit. It's hot.

297
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:54,454
Okay.

298
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:56,275
Eat slowly.

299
00:12:58,314 --> 00:13:00,714
Didn't he come
to help Yan close her stall?

300
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:02,434
How come he is eating?

301
00:13:04,155 --> 00:13:05,635
Qingtian, be patient.

302
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:09,035
C-Confessing takes courage.

303
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:10,515
What courage?

304
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,194
Just step forward,
open your mouth, and speak.

305
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,155
What's so hard
about helping her close her stall?

306
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:23,155
It's actually hard.

307
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,515
Finished already? Thanks.

308
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:42,474
Let me help you close.

309
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:45,314
No need.

310
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:46,954
No need, Mr. Lin.

311
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:01,115
Well...

312
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:04,794
Put it there.

313
00:14:07,794 --> 00:14:08,915
See you, Mr. Lin.

314
00:14:09,635 --> 00:14:10,434
He's leaving?

315
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:11,174
He's going.

316
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,794
Mr. Lin, the chain is off!

317
00:14:16,074 --> 00:14:17,314
Stop shouting!

318
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:18,794
Are you alright?

319
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,074
I'm fine.

320
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:20,834
Let me help.

321
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,474
No! You'll get your hands dirty.

322
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:24,035
I can handle this.

323
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:26,714
Well,

324
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:28,915
it's fine. No worries. I can manage.

325
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:37,635
He just ran off like that.

326
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,235
That's quite in character for him.

327
00:14:40,954 --> 00:14:42,594
Why did Lin run like that?

328
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:44,554
Ms. Li.

329
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:48,515
Lin's happiness
in his later years will depend on you.

330
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:51,074
Out of my way!

331
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,056
Xie.

332
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:41,074
What are you doing?

333
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:42,594
Mr. Xie, are you putting out a fire?

334
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:43,875
Put me down!

335
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,395
I've put out the fire.

336
00:15:49,235 --> 00:15:50,674
What? Mr. Xie!

337
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:53,074
I finally learned how to cook this dish.

338
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,995
You smothered my stove!
Look what you've done.

339
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,395
Mr. Xie was putting out a fire?

340
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:00,515
Mr. Xie!

341
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:03,995
This is my quilt. You used it for this?

342
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:05,714
How could you...

343
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:07,834
Look,

344
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,995
my quilt

345
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:10,355
is now covered in oil.

346
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:11,355
That's your quilt?

347
00:16:11,434 --> 00:16:12,875
How do I wash this?

348
00:16:14,794 --> 00:16:15,294
Well...

349
00:16:16,954 --> 00:16:17,454
I...

350
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,155
Enough.

351
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:26,594
Stop gawking here!

352
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:27,714
Get back to work!

353
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,155
Go have your meals!

354
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,194
- Let's go.
- Get out of here.

355
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:34,554
What a waste of my dish!

356
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:36,275
I heard

357
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:37,515
you're developing new dishes.

358
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:38,314
Are you hurt?

359
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:39,794
Is this to help the town government

360
00:16:39,794 --> 00:16:41,235
and improve everyone's meals?

361
00:16:41,995 --> 00:16:43,035
Yes, Mr. Du.

362
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:46,155
Yuehai develops every single day.

363
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,355
I should keep up too, right?

364
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,875
Tell me about your new dishes.

365
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,074
I'll take some photos of you first.

366
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,035
Taking my photos?

367
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:54,714
Is this okay?

368
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:55,875
(Saving Food Starts With You and Me)
Yes, very good!

369
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,155
Just relax.

370
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:59,000
Do what you'd normally do.

371
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:00,635
Okay.

372
00:17:27,075 --> 00:17:28,115
What are you doing?

373
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:30,674
Mr. Zheng, I'm bathing!

374
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:33,034
Is this a bath or a foot soak?

375
00:17:33,474 --> 00:17:34,712
You're not even in the water.

376
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:36,714
I was just joking.

377
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:38,194
You went in with clothes?

378
00:17:38,754 --> 00:17:39,555
Get out right now.

379
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:40,635
What's on your mind?

380
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:43,674
I've been looking for you.
What are you thinking?

381
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:45,234
Out. Get out.

382
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:46,434
Come on.

383
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,115
What's wrong with you?

384
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:56,595
Mr. Zheng.

385
00:17:58,075 --> 00:17:59,115
They're right.

386
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:01,875
I'm a man without qualities.

387
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:05,434
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

388
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:07,714
They're all correct.

389
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:10,155
Everything I say is nonsense, huh?

390
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,754
Sit down and talk.

391
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:17,335
Sit.

392
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:20,155
Sit down.

393
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:23,714
Xie.

394
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,714
Remember what I told you?

395
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:30,474
I called you Yuehai's quartermaster.

396
00:18:31,714 --> 00:18:32,795
That came from my heart.

397
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:35,595
You truly are Yuehai's quartermaster.

398
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:38,434
We can't function without you.

399
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:41,514
I know you're nice to me.

400
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:45,034
You've always said this

401
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:46,954
to spare my feelings.

402
00:18:49,115 --> 00:18:52,155
I know everyone treats me kindly too,
but none of you told me.

403
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,234
Now, I know

404
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:58,954
I'm a man without qualities.

405
00:19:00,795 --> 00:19:02,795
A man without qualities is useless.

406
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,434
Yuehai doesn't need me.

407
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:08,355
Right now,

408
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:11,795
I'm just very sad.

409
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,514
I can't accept it.

410
00:19:19,754 --> 00:19:20,635
Right now,

411
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:23,915
I'm less motivated.

412
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:26,595
Are you?

413
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:33,434
No fever.

414
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:36,954
So why the nonsense?

415
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:39,635
Who said you were useless?

416
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:43,034
You're Yuehai's most vital asset.
Understand?

417
00:19:43,994 --> 00:19:44,795
Listen,

418
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:47,835
you're the most vital asset. Got it?

419
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:49,075
What I say goes.

420
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:51,474
You're the most vital asset.

421
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:55,194
Really?

422
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:58,115
When have I ever lied to you?

423
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:01,635
You're a good man.

424
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,155
Xie Chunlai, let me ask you.

425
00:20:04,754 --> 00:20:06,514
Did you schedule
today's safety inspection?

426
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:07,514
Yes.

427
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:09,835
Did you read the central documents?

428
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:11,434
Yes.

429
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,464
Did you attend
the Women's Federation meeting?

430
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,434
Yes.

431
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:15,835
That's good.

432
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,155
So, you've done your jobs perfectly.

433
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:19,014
Look,

434
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:20,835
I'll reward you with something.

435
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:22,674
What's this?

436
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:25,315
(Apple Jam)
Octopus.

437
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,194
That's you!

438
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:30,355
Aren't you the octopus
of our town government?

439
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:31,875
(Apple Jam)

440
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,835
You're everywhere, right?

441
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:35,595
You're incredibly capable.

442
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:37,474
Nothing can get done without you, right?

443
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:38,875
We absolutely need you.

444
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,234
Look, you two actually look a bit alike.

445
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:44,635
Both have big, sparkling eyes.

446
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:45,835
It's really cute.

447
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,635
- See?
- Mr. Zheng.

448
00:20:48,674 --> 00:20:50,355
Can you leave it and me alone?

449
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:52,954
Okay.

450
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:55,674
No problem.

451
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:59,434
Thank you.

452
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,474
Just don't eat it, okay?

453
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:07,075
I'm leaving.

454
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,034
Take your time.

455
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:34,434
I'm an octopus?

456
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:36,234
Octopus.

457
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,315
Mr. Lin, Qiuping asked me
to bring this to you.

458
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,194
It's a token of our appreciation.

459
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:10,875
Thank you for the interview.

460
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:13,115
No, I can't accept this.

461
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:14,635
Th-Thank you, Ms. Li.

462
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:16,875
But cooperating
with your work is my duty.

463
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:17,795
I...

464
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:18,835
Please, take it.

465
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:21,194
Open it and take a look.

466
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:25,415
Well...

467
00:22:32,994 --> 00:22:34,514
I definitely can't take it.

468
00:22:34,915 --> 00:22:37,674
Mr. Du gave you this, right, Ms. Li?

469
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:39,635
I'm just a rough man. I...

470
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:41,355
I don't use it, really.

471
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:43,635
Mr. Lin, you don't use it.

472
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:46,635
But you could gift it to someone.

473
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:48,994
Gift it to someone?

474
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:50,994
I use this brand of soap myself.

475
00:22:51,754 --> 00:22:52,954
The scent is wonderful.

476
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:56,795
It can wash away
the meat smell from your hands.

477
00:22:57,434 --> 00:22:58,954
Yes, the meat smell.

478
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:01,034
Meat smell?

479
00:23:08,274 --> 00:23:09,674
Well, no.

480
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:11,075
I...

481
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:11,974
Just...

482
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:14,234
She...

483
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:15,415
I...

484
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:17,595
Mr. Lin, are you trying to say

485
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:21,075
I really like her,
but I don't dare give her a gift?

486
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,155
What if she rejects it?

487
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,274
Then I could never go eat
at her wonton stall again?

488
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:30,875
Yes, I...

489
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:35,434
Sit down.

490
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:36,674
Sit down.

491
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:39,274
Well,

492
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:41,674
let me tell you a story about myself.

493
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:45,194
When I first saw Qiuping,

494
00:23:45,714 --> 00:23:46,994
I fell for her at first sight.

495
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:49,795
Qiuping was the campus beauty.

496
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:52,635
The guys who liked her...
How should I put it?

497
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:55,704
They could line up from your dorm

498
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,595
to the gate of the town government.

499
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:58,915
Don't be exaggerated!

500
00:23:59,434 --> 00:24:00,434
I said the truth.

501
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:02,595
Many guys liked you back then,
but you didn't know.

502
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:06,274
And I had a really strong rival.

503
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:08,155
He was tall and handsome,

504
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:10,555
with grades better than mine.
He's a genius.

505
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:11,875
He went to study abroad.

506
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:14,315
He liked Qiuping too,

507
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,635
but after Qiuping rejected him once,

508
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:17,635
he just gave up.

509
00:24:17,994 --> 00:24:19,234
Then, whenever he saw Qiuping,

510
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:21,274
he'd freeze like a stone,
couldn't say a word.

511
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:22,754
We even gave him a nickname,

512
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,555
called Qi the Stone, remember?

513
00:24:25,994 --> 00:24:26,915
But do you know

514
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:29,034
how many times Qiuping rejected me?

515
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:30,754
How many times?

516
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:32,194
Five.

517
00:24:33,795 --> 00:24:34,635
Only five?

518
00:24:34,954 --> 00:24:36,835
Even it's five hundred,
I'd never give up.

519
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:39,835
Mr. Lin.

520
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:42,835
I want to say,
you need to learn from me.

521
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:44,954
Don't be afraid of rejection.

522
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:45,655
Right.

523
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:48,474
Mr. Du, I...

524
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,194
I-I just...

525
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:52,994
I really can't learn this.

526
00:24:53,434 --> 00:24:55,674
I-I don't know how to talk to women.

527
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:56,714
Especially

528
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,835
Sun Xiaoyan.

529
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:00,315
When I see her, I...

530
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,234
I can't say a single word.

531
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:06,075
Mr. Lin, actually,

532
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:07,674
you can talk to women.

533
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:09,954
But when facing Sun Xiaoyan,

534
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:12,075
you get too nervous to speak.

535
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:14,194
It's okay. We can help you.

536
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,315
We give you the courage to confess.

537
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:19,795
First,

538
00:25:21,075 --> 00:25:22,714
you need to change your look.

539
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:27,355
Mr. Lin, look.

540
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:00,434
No way.

541
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:01,514
Take it off.

542
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:02,674
Off! Try this one.

543
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:03,774
Take it off.

544
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,434
It looks better

545
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:09,994
on me.

546
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:15,315
What a difference.

547
00:26:33,835 --> 00:26:34,555
A bit

548
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:35,875
handsome?

549
00:26:52,714 --> 00:26:53,875
Oh my, Lin!

550
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:56,474
You look so handsome!

551
00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:59,395
I didn't notice you were this handsome.

552
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:01,395
You...

553
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:04,194
Go for it. Not to mention Sun Xiaoyan,

554
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:06,754
even I'd be smitten if I were a woman.

555
00:27:08,434 --> 00:27:09,395
Mr. Zheng is right.

556
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:12,274
Everything's ready now.
You just need to make the move.

557
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,274
It's almost nine.
Mr. Lin, time to head out.

558
00:27:16,754 --> 00:27:17,635
Are you ready?

559
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:19,474
I'm ready.

560
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:20,795
Action!

561
00:27:20,954 --> 00:27:21,454

Lin Tofu!

572
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:09,155
Xie, I'm ready.

573
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:11,674
You can't go!

574
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:16,514
Why not?

575
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:26,875
Sun Xiaoyan has a man!

576
00:28:42,635 --> 00:28:45,115
Xie Chunlai, what took you so long?
Get back here!

577
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:47,714
Stop being mysterious.

578
00:28:54,674 --> 00:28:56,395
Mr. Xie, you must be mistaken.

579
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:58,835
How could Sun Xiaoyan have a man?

580
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:00,075
Everyone,

581
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:02,274
today,

582
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:06,234
I visited Yan's wonton stall.

583
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:10,635
When I got there,
I sensed something off.

584
00:29:11,434 --> 00:29:14,075
A guy was there, dressed really sharp,

585
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:18,395
carrying a whole basket of this.

586
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:19,915
Sandalwood soaps.

587
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,315
Smell it. Come on, smell it.

588
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:27,635
I've told you so many times,

589
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:29,194
don't come to me anymore.

590
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:33,355
Look, I already have one.

591
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:34,234
Yan,

592
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:36,555
this has sandalwood smell.

593
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,234
It's different from what you have.

594
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:40,075
Yan,

595
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:42,355
I really love you. Yan.

596
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:43,434
Let me be honest with you.

597
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:44,835
I have a man.

598
00:29:45,674 --> 00:29:48,234
Impossible! I never heard you had a man.

599
00:29:48,915 --> 00:29:50,075
You must be lying.

600
00:29:51,395 --> 00:29:52,115
Smell it.

601
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:54,635
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself.

602
00:29:58,795 --> 00:29:59,754
Let me see.

603
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:01,835
It's a soldier.

604
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:02,915
- Go away!
- A soldier?

605
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:03,514
Go away.

606
00:30:04,714 --> 00:30:05,315
Mr. Xie.

607
00:30:07,714 --> 00:30:08,395
A soldier?

608
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:11,034
Sun Xiaoyan's husband is a soldier?

609
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:12,714
I saw it with my own eyes

610
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:14,234
and heard it loud and clear.

611
00:30:14,474 --> 00:30:15,714
Oh my! Seriously!

612
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:18,434
That's terrifying.
Luckily you didn't go.

613
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:21,115
Or, it would've led to disaster.

614
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:21,674
Right?

615
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:22,174
Luckily I...

616
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:24,514
Undermining a military
marriage is illegal!

617
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,434
Why didn't we know this before?

618
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:28,954
We...

619
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:29,915
That day,

620
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:32,155
I went and helped her pack up

621
00:30:32,234 --> 00:30:33,274
when she was closing up.

622
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:35,115
Her mother and son were there too.

623
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:36,835
Her son said,

624
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:39,474
he'd never even met his father.

625
00:30:43,194 --> 00:30:43,694
Never...

626
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:44,555
That makes sense.

627
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:47,635
His father is a soldier,
must be defending the country.

628
00:30:47,795 --> 00:30:48,600
So they never met.

629
00:30:48,835 --> 00:30:50,795
I think Ms. Li meant well.

630
00:30:51,155 --> 00:30:52,754
She didn't expect this, right?

631
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,795
But we should be more careful.

632
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:55,835
Otherwise, well...

633
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:56,434
Now...

634
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:58,795
I'll go ask her to clear things up.

635
00:30:58,795 --> 00:30:59,295
No.

636
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:01,034
It's too late for that now.

637
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,635
She's already shown the photo.

638
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:03,274
Right.

639
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:04,875
A marriage certificate next time.

640
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:07,295
True. A woman
cares about her reputation.

641
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:08,835
Won't lie on such things.

642
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:10,754
True.

643
00:31:12,315 --> 00:31:13,155
Sun Xiaoyan

644
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:15,514
is such a fine woman.

645
00:31:15,514 --> 00:31:16,014
How could

646
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,155
she still be single?

647
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:22,915
Ms. Li,

648
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,115
you should've asked her directly.

649
00:31:25,274 --> 00:31:25,954
My master...

650
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:29,115
Romance is fatal.

651
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:30,994
It's my fault.

652
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:32,994
Lin,

653
00:31:33,514 --> 00:31:35,474
don't lose faith in women now.

654
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:36,792
Nice women are around.

655
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:40,315
Li, what did you just say?
I didn't catch it.

656
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:43,075
I said it's my fault.

657
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,194
Mr. Lin, it's my mistake.

658
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:47,555
I wasn't careful enough.

659
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:49,274
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

660
00:31:49,555 --> 00:31:50,575
Wait, well...

661
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:53,474
Ms. Li, it's okay.

662
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:56,474
Don't blame yourself. I'm fine, really.

663
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:02,474
It's nothing serious.

664
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:03,915
Being single...

665
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:07,194
Being single is great.

666
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:08,194
Carefree and easy.

667
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:09,795
I've long gotten used to it.

668
00:32:10,474 --> 00:32:11,355
Doesn't matter.

669
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:16,994
I... Thank you all.

670
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:19,288
Sorry for bothering you.

671
00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:24,434
Lin, don't overthink it.

672
00:32:24,434 --> 00:32:26,274
That outfit looks good on you. Keep it.

673
00:32:26,635 --> 00:32:27,714
Get rest early.

674
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:30,075
Be strong, Lin. No tears!

675
00:32:55,075 --> 00:32:55,835
(My money!)

676
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:58,034
Here, take this.

677
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:03,135
Thank you.

678
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:12,115
Don't try anything sneaky.

679
00:33:12,395 --> 00:33:13,754
I've got my camera right here.

680
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:04,395
Mr. Du,

681
00:34:05,075 --> 00:34:07,194
your article was truly excellent.

682
00:34:07,555 --> 00:34:08,275
Thanks, Mr. Zheng.

683
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:10,634
No, I should thank you.

684
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:12,654
Here.

685
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:15,175
Mr. Zheng.

686
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,434
It's your turn to have an interview.

687
00:34:17,835 --> 00:34:19,074
Not today.

688
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:21,395
I have to go report
to the county secretary.

689
00:34:22,074 --> 00:34:23,114
Well, Ms. Li.

690
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:25,795
Get me that fiscal report now.

691
00:34:26,074 --> 00:34:27,034
- I'll go to the county office.
- Okay.

692
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:27,755
M-Mr. Zheng.

693
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:29,395
Just set a date.

694
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:29,954
Mr. Zheng.

695
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:31,994
Mr. Zheng.

696
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:33,395
What's up?

697
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:34,715
We're at our wits' end.

698
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:38,634
Ms. Li, please help us.

699
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:39,875
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

700
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:42,114
It's still about
that cable factory quota.

701
00:34:42,755 --> 00:34:44,114
We've been there several times,

702
00:34:44,434 --> 00:34:46,915
but Mr. Zhang just won't resolve it.

703
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:48,715
Now the villagers are fed up

704
00:34:49,074 --> 00:34:50,755
and blocking the factory entrance.

705
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:51,875
That Zhang Yongwang!

706
00:34:52,434 --> 00:34:54,634
He dares to go back on his word now?

707
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:56,755
The approval documents were issued.

708
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:57,315
Yes!

709
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:00,355
The root of the problem

710
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,315
is that the state-owned factory
isn't subordinate to the town government.

711
00:35:03,315 --> 00:35:05,074
Zhang Yongwang
thinks we can't do anything.

712
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:07,434
Mr. Zheng.

713
00:35:07,715 --> 00:35:10,074
You need to speak to him.

714
00:35:10,634 --> 00:35:12,275
Please come with me.

715
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,474
But I need to report

716
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:15,915
at the county office.

717
00:35:16,034 --> 00:35:17,355
Mr. Zheng, maybe I'll go.

718
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:20,395
You? Can you handle it?

719
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:23,315
Zhang Yongwang
is utterly shameless and cunning.

720
00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:26,434
When I worked at the county office,
I heard about him.

721
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:27,915
Let me give it a try.

722
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:32,074
Alright, it's on you now. Careful.

723
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:34,195
I'm leaving.

724
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:35,275
Go for it.

725
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,275
Mr. Zheng, shall we set a date?

726
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:37,974
No, wait.

727
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:38,755
Listen to me.

728
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:40,474
You've interviewed
the three deputy mayors.

729
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:41,634
It's Ms. Li's turn now.

730
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:44,034
Treat everyone equally.
Interview her now, okay?

731
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:45,034
Talk later.

732
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:49,275
(Pingchuan County People's Government)
We've been here for many times.

733
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:50,915
You keep claiming Mr. Zhang isn't in.

734
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,755
You're slandering me.

735
00:35:52,915 --> 00:35:53,835
Why gather people here?

736
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:54,514
Slandering you?

737
00:35:54,514 --> 00:35:56,195
Don't make a scene here.

738
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,634
You promised us.

739
00:35:58,154 --> 00:35:59,235
Alright. Done talking.

740
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:00,074
- Go back.
- Go back.

741
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:03,074
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

742
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:04,568
Don't touch me!

743
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,034
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

744
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:13,915
Ms. Lin is here. Stop it! Move!

745
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:14,795
Ms. Lin is here.

746
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:15,375
Ms. Li.

747
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:20,954
You can't blame us for this.

748
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:21,474
Mr. Zhang.

749
00:36:21,795 --> 00:36:23,195
I've been drinking for three days.

750
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,395
- My stomach...
- Listen...

751
00:36:24,594 --> 00:36:25,094
Mr. Zhang.

752
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:25,614
I...

753
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:26,895
Enough!

754
00:36:27,634 --> 00:36:28,434
Stop complaining!

755
00:36:28,915 --> 00:36:30,154
Are you the salesmen?

756
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:31,474
Sold nothing. My fault?

757
00:36:32,074 --> 00:36:33,715
Mr. Zhang, Ms. Li is here.

758
00:36:34,514 --> 00:36:35,154
Ms. Li?

759
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:36,634
Just her?

760
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:37,915
And villagers.

761
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:41,074
Zheng Decheng?

762
00:36:41,434 --> 00:36:42,034
No.

763
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:44,934
Go ahead.

764
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:45,815
Ms. Li.

765
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,434
I'm just a Security Chief.

766
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:49,875
I had to do as Mr. Zhang instructed.

767
00:36:50,235 --> 00:36:52,074
Mr. Zhou,
I hate making things difficult.

768
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:55,074
But Mr. Zhang himself promised this
to Mr. Zheng.

769
00:36:55,395 --> 00:36:57,395
We can't just stand by.

770
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:03,795
You all need
to seriously reflect on yourselves!

771
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:06,915
Submit a sales proposal to me
before leaving work!

772
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:08,195
Leave now.

773
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:08,994
Get going.

774
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:20,554
Mr. Wu.

775
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:23,395
Doing this makes it hard for me
to explain to the villagers.

776
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,795
Our factory is built on their land.

777
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:28,915
And we promised them
skilled worker quotas.

778
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:30,594
I have to keep my word.

779
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:32,275
I understand.

780
00:37:33,634 --> 00:37:34,195
Mr. Zhang.

781
00:37:36,634 --> 00:37:38,875
I know it's tough for the Labor Bureau.

782
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:41,034
But it's even tougher for the villagers.

783
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:43,915
They need jobs. They need income.

784
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,315
They need to feed themselves.

785
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:47,875
I have to get this done.

786
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:50,755
Mr. Wu from the Labor Bureau?

787
00:37:51,154 --> 00:37:52,954
Mr. Zhang, could you pass me the phone?

788
00:37:53,034 --> 00:37:53,875
I'll talk to him.

789
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,395
Mr. Wu, Yuehai Town...

790
00:37:57,994 --> 00:37:59,275
Mr. Wu from the Labor Bureau?

791
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:00,375
This...

792
00:38:01,034 --> 00:38:01,954
The line is busy.

793
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:04,915
Cut off again.

794
00:38:05,634 --> 00:38:07,875
Lines keep cutting off.
Who's in charge of this?

795
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:09,514
Sorry.

796
00:38:12,195 --> 00:38:14,675
Ms. Li, what brings you here today?

797
00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:16,395
Mr. Zhang, what do you mean?

798
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,954
Your state-owned cable factory
moved to Yuehai Town.

799
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:20,434
I should've visited long ago.

800
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:23,715
Wang, make tea for Ms. Li and others.

801
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:24,795
Come on, have a seat.

802
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:25,755
Have a seat.

803
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:26,994
Come on, have a seat.

804
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:27,755
Come on. Sit.

805
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:29,554
Have a seat.

806
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:32,114
We can talk things over.

807
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,755
Wait, who is he?

808
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:39,114
A reporter coming with us.

809
00:38:39,554 --> 00:38:40,634
Just ignore him.

810
00:38:41,614 --> 00:38:42,114
I...

811
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,954
Mr. Zhang, I'll get to the point.

812
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:46,235
Regarding Yang Village's quota issue,

813
00:38:46,395 --> 00:38:47,715
when will you resolve it?

814
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:51,755
Wait, Ms. Li.

815
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:54,074
Didn't you hear when you came in?

816
00:38:54,554 --> 00:38:55,514
I'm so worried about it.

817
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:57,915
To solve the quota issue
for Yang and others,

818
00:38:58,355 --> 00:39:00,514
I've been trying my best.

819
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:02,915
I went to the county office for times,

820
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:05,114
but the Labor Bureau just refused.

821
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,434
They said to take back
all these job quotas.

822
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:09,915
I was almost pleading and crying.

823
00:39:11,074 --> 00:39:12,474
Mr. Zhang, that's manageable.

824
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:15,034
When I was a secretary
at the county office,

825
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:16,355
I dealt with Mr. Wu.

826
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:17,755
We have a bit of a rapport.

827
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:19,795
I'll go to Mr. Wu now.

828
00:39:20,355 --> 00:39:23,074
Today is Wednesday, study day
for Party and government affairs.

829
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,355
He is definitely there.

830
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:26,195
Wait, Ms. Li.

831
00:39:26,235 --> 00:39:27,875
Come on, sit down please.

832
00:39:28,395 --> 00:39:29,195
Sit down.

833
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:32,875
Don't bother Mr. Wu
for such a trivial thing.

834
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,474
Sit down first.

835
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:36,355
Sit down.

836
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:41,954
Well,

837
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:44,994
I'll provide 20 unskilled worker quotas
for the village.

838
00:39:46,554 --> 00:39:49,114
Swapping skilled worker quotas
for unskilled ones? No way.

839
00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:51,554
Unskilled workers are for manual work.

840
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,355
Skilled workers learn a trade.

841
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:53,974
Exactly!

842
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:56,074
How can you make it sound so simple?

843
00:39:57,994 --> 00:40:00,634
Ms. Li, to be honest.

844
00:40:01,154 --> 00:40:02,554
I regret coming here.

845
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,755
The county issued a directive,

846
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,434
telling us state-owned factories
to support Yuehai's construction.

847
00:40:07,434 --> 00:40:09,074
That's why we moved to this place.

848
00:40:09,355 --> 00:40:10,795
And the result?

849
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,275
The output doesn't increase.

850
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:14,994
But our shipping costs have doubled.

851
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:19,474
We state-owned factories are responsible
for our own profits and losses now.

852
00:40:20,235 --> 00:40:22,675
Ms. Li, forget about
adding more staff positions.

853
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,554
I wish to cut a few staff positions.

854
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:27,315
Mr. Zhang, you can't say that.

855
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:30,034
Ten state-owned factories
moved to Yuehai.

856
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:33,195
Nine of them saw
varying levels of profit increase.

857
00:40:33,554 --> 00:40:35,514
Only your cable factory's profits
are falling.

858
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:36,915
I wonder

859
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:39,074
if it's the problem with Yuehai,

860
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:40,395
or your cable factory's

861
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:42,474
management and operations?

862
00:40:42,795 --> 00:40:43,474
Ms. Li,

863
00:40:44,954 --> 00:40:46,315
don't try to trick me.

864
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:48,554
I'm telling you, I won't buy that.

865
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,875
How about this?
You'd talk to the leadership

866
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:52,875
to let us move the cable factory back

867
00:40:53,275 --> 00:40:55,875
and give this Yuehai land
back to the villagers, okay?

868
00:40:56,594 --> 00:40:57,154
Okay.

869
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:00,114
Wait, what do you mean?

870
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:01,074
Mr. Zhang.

871
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:05,154
These quotas were approved
by the County Committee and Government.

872
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:07,554
Want to return the land? Fine.

873
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,355
We'll go to see
Mr. Zhao and Mr. Xia together.

874
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:13,554
If they agree, I'll let you return it.

875
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:16,875
Ms. Li, don't try to pressure me
with the leadership.

876
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:18,715
Our factory isn't doing well.

877
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:21,074
Many workers are unhappy.

878
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,195
If I give away more quotas now

879
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,074
and the workers complain,

880
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:26,474
no one could handle it.

881
00:41:27,474 --> 00:41:30,074
Mr. Zhang, don't try to pressure me
with the workers.

882
00:41:30,514 --> 00:41:33,034
I won't leave
until this issue is resolved.

883
00:41:37,315 --> 00:41:38,755
- I...
- Your old problem's acting up.

884
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:39,315
Hurry.

885
00:41:39,514 --> 00:41:40,395
Get my medicine.

886
00:41:44,114 --> 00:41:45,434
Stop pressuring Mr. Zhang.

887
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:46,994
Because of this issue,

888
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:49,624
his heart disease and high blood pressure
are acting up.

889
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,795
Let me see what medicine it is.

890
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:53,915
Let me see.

891
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:57,594
Wang, did you grab the wrong one?
These are vitamins!

892
00:41:58,994 --> 00:41:59,594
My mistake.

893
00:41:59,755 --> 00:42:01,275
Let me see what medicine might work.

894
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:02,034
No, wait.

895
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:03,994
Wait.

896
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:07,474
Feeling better.

897
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:08,954
Better now.

898
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:11,715
Better now?

899
00:42:13,715 --> 00:42:15,795
Mr. Zhang, let's get back
to the matter at hand.

900
00:42:16,355 --> 00:42:18,355
I'm not here to argue with you,

901
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:20,954
but to solve the problem with you.

902
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:23,994
Since your cable factory
moved to Yuehai,

903
00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:26,755
we town government have to intervene.

904
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:29,720
You have no right to manage
the state-owned factories.

905
00:42:29,954 --> 00:42:30,994
You got me wrong.

906
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:33,954
I mean, we have to provide assistance.

907
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:35,715
What?

908
00:42:36,235 --> 00:42:38,154
I know that since your factory
moved to Yuehai,

909
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,154
profits are thin
because of transport costs.

910
00:42:40,634 --> 00:42:43,114
But thin profits don't matter much.
With sound operations,

911
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:45,235
smooth production,
and sufficient customers,

912
00:42:45,514 --> 00:42:46,795
the performance would improve.

913
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:48,440
Easier said than done.

914
00:42:49,656 --> 00:42:52,474
Have you heard of Qian Changyuan,
Yuehai's sales king?

915
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:54,235
Yes.

916
00:42:54,994 --> 00:42:57,875
That super-salesman
who can sell anything?

917
00:42:58,554 --> 00:43:01,195
I'll act as the intermediary
and introduce you to each other.
