Who is this?

18
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:46,761
Am I seeing things?

19
00:01:47,802 --> 00:01:48,602
County Magistrate,

20
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:51,002
are you here to visit the grassroots?

21
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,921
Any problem?

22
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,481
Even eating noodles here.

23
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:55,681
To be honest,

24
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:57,602
I have been to several villages today

25
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:58,602
and finally got here.

26
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:01,082
I haven't eaten a thing.

27
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,802
(Chats under 5 minutes)
Mr. Xie saw it right away

28
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,041
and made me noodles.

29
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:06,561
Learn from him.

30
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:09,441
You are not as discerning as him
in this aspect.

31
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:10,561
Indeed.

32
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,522
Xie is much better
than I am in flattery.

33
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:18,681
I was just about
to go to the industrial park.

34
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,082
Our industrial park
is built really well.

35
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:23,161
All are modern factories.
Want to visit with me?

36
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:24,881
Too late today.

37
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:27,281
Look at the time.

38
00:02:27,322 --> 00:02:28,802
Two more villages to visit tomorrow.

39
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:30,922
Decheng.

40
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:34,161
I brought you some good news today.

41
00:02:34,482 --> 00:02:35,242
What is it?

42
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:38,281
Read it.

43
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:39,928
The county government

44
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,242
has given Yuehai
another new favorable policy?

45
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:43,281
Enough!

46
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:45,802
You got many favorable policies.

47
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,762
Party School? Who's going?

48
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,881
It says Zheng Decheng.

49
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,482
Me?

50
00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:57,082
I can't go.

51
00:02:58,681 --> 00:02:59,242
What?

52
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:01,042
Why?

53
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:04,482
Guan, you know.

54
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:07,482
I've just returned
from cooperating with an investigation.

55
00:03:08,001 --> 00:03:09,561
I have a pile of things to handle.

56
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,242
And Ms. Li is ill,

57
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:13,601
on sick leave in the hospital.

58
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,121
If I leave,

59
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,408
Yuehai will be in chaos.

60
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:17,721
I can't go.

61
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,762
Zheng Decheng,
how many times have I told you?

62
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:23,281
No one is indispensable.

63
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:25,762
Just a month.

64
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:28,681
Let Xie Chunlai
act as mayor temporarily.

65
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:30,681
It's not like that.

66
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:32,762
Guan, listen to me.

67
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:34,561
No way. Don't make trouble.

68
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:38,322
Take a good look.
This is an official document.

69
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,681
(Notice of Party School Training)
This is a notice, not a suggestion.

70
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:45,401
The Provincial Committee has
only one spot, and it's given to you.

71
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:47,362
This is a recognition of your work.

72
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,121
And the county committee
wants to use this

73
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:51,482
to help restore your reputation.

74
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:54,841
After the training,

75
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:56,762
don't you know what comes next?

76
00:03:58,082 --> 00:03:58,582
Right.

77
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,681
Do you understand or not?

78
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,322
Don't be shameless.

79
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,642
I understand.
How could I not understand?

80
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,281
Guan, but I truly can't leave.

81
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,762
Alright. I won't argue with you.

82
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:10,802
Go if you want.

83
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,042
If you don't,

84
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:13,522
report to Secretary Xia.

85
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:15,082
Wait, I'll go.

86
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:16,322
I'll go, okay?

87
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,442
Finish your noodles before you leave.

88
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:21,002
No. I'm so fed up with you.

89
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,161
What a fool.

90
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:25,562
What a temper. Why be furious?

(Chats under 5 minutes)

93
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:39,122
Xie, I have something to tell you.

94
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:43,361
Among all Yuehai's cadres...

95
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:46,522
Wait, I should
include all the county's cadres.

96
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:49,241
You are the one

97
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:52,122
who's meticulous in thinking, diplomatic

98
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:53,921
and eloquent in speaking.

99
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:57,882
Stop.

100
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,361
Mr. Zheng, just get to the point.

101
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm really flattered.

102
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:04,882
It scared me.

103
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:07,122
I'll go to the Party School.

104
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:15,322
(Document from Dongjiang Provincial Department)
Provincial Committee Party School?

105
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,002

109
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,202
during this one month,

110
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,002
you'll act as mayor of Yuehai.

111
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,062
Take it.

112
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:33,682
Do you have the confidence

113
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:36,762
to handle Yuehai's affairs
and take over this job?

114
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:39,322
Thank you for not giving up on me.

115
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:43,281
I will dedicate myself
until my last breath.

116
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:44,882
Toast to you.

117
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:46,382
Come on.

118
00:05:46,642 --> 00:05:47,142
Come on.

119
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,601
It's hot. Right, that's the feeling.

120
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,481
Okay, enough.

121
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:56,762
Don't be dramatic.

122
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:01,382

Is the town government work
going smoothly?

126
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:20,962
Quite smoothly.

127
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:24,481
Just you in this ward now?

128
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:25,841
That's perfect.

129
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:27,442
Li.

130
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:29,082
Still remember

131
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,361
what I entrusted to you?

132
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:32,801
Still there?

133
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:33,741
Yes.

134
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,562
It's in this drawer.
My dad just brought it yesterday.

135
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,361
Rest assured, no one has seen it.

136
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:41,361
Including me. I haven't seen it.

137
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:45,082
Mr. Zheng, I'm really curious

138
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:47,281
what exactly you have in there.

139
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:49,762
The investigators came to me.

140
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:52,762
I had to handle affairs
while being sick,

141
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,921
and hid this for you.
It's making me so nervous.

142
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,161
Right. Li, thank you so much.

143
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,322
This thing

144
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:07,401
is quite complicated.

145
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:09,762
Well,

146
00:07:10,002 --> 00:07:12,762
it starts from
when my spouse just passed away.

147
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,682
I was in so much pain back then.

148
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:17,801
Luckily, I had this

149
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:20,202
and I could endure till today.

150
00:07:20,522 --> 00:07:21,481
Is it that powerful?

151
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,322
What exactly is in there?

152
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:26,202
Well,

153
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:30,161
you've really put in a lot of effort
for Yuehai.

154
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,322
And you just broke up.

155
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:34,442
I'll let you take a look. Just one look.

156
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:37,801
Forget it. I won't look.

157
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:40,202
Aren't you curious?

158
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,082
I am.

159
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:42,882
But,

160
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:45,442
what if there's something
disgraceful in there?

161
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:46,962
I'd regret that I saw it.

162
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:50,041
How could there be
anything disgraceful in here?

163
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:53,401
These are all my reflections on life,
thoughts on work,

164
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,401
and quotes by famous people.

165
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,041
Look.

166
00:07:58,241 --> 00:07:59,642
Mr. Zheng, are you telling me

167
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:01,642
what you entrusted to me

168
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,721
(Diary)
is this diary?

169
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:04,841
What do you mean?

170
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:08,002
This is my only diary.

171
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,161
All was written thoughtfully

172
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,481
and carefully by me.

173
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,721
This is your diary?

174
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:14,601
Yes.

175
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:17,082
Look. All was written thoughtfully.

176
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:17,962
All excerpts...

177
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:19,322
Wait.

178
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:21,202
"That little brat."

179
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:22,962
(Li Qiuping)
"How dare she call me a little man!"

180
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,624
"With a county chronicle,
she thinks she's impressive now."

181
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,442
- Wait...
- "She abuses her tiny bit of authority."

182
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,341
(Diary)
I...

183
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:29,202
Mr. Zheng, tell me.

184
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:32,802
Why is there a cat here?

185
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:35,721
A cat? This is a tigress.

186
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,841
It's clearly a cat.

187
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:43,162
That's not what I mean.
This was all written before.

188
00:08:43,361 --> 00:08:44,721
There are many compliments later.

189
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:45,841
They are all in the back.

190
00:08:46,202 --> 00:08:48,962
"Li Qiuping,
you don't know what's best for you."

191
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,282
"Want to become Yuehai's mayor?"

192
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:51,922
No, wait.

193
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:54,761
- Listen to me.
- "Wait and see, you'll pay."

194
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:56,402
Li, please listen to me.

195
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:57,402
I've considered it.

196
00:08:57,562 --> 00:09:00,082
It's all outdated and meaningless

197
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:00,962
stuff in here..

198
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,422
I think I should take it away.

199
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:03,962
Put it down.

200
00:09:07,322 --> 00:09:10,641
"Heard the tigress humming a song today.
Actually sounds pretty nice."

201
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,322
This is a compliment about your singing.

202
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:14,721
Mr. Zheng.

203
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:17,322
Your diary has quite a lot of secrets.

204
00:09:19,922 --> 00:09:21,241
The handwriting is beautiful.

205
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,001
Mr. Zheng, give me your luggage.

206
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:35,322
Mr. Zheng, you're going away
for over a month.

207
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:36,682
Is this luggage enough?

208
00:09:37,841 --> 00:09:38,341
Mr. Zheng.

209
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:39,881
Before you leave,

210
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,521
aren't you going to visit Ms. Li?

211
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:42,221
No.

212
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,881
Not just me.

213
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,962
You all should keep your mouths shut.

214
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,042
Don't let Ms. Li know

215
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:49,481
that I went to the Party School.

216
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:50,341
Exactly.

217
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:52,521
With her temper,
if she finds out Mr. Zheng is away,

218
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:54,162
she'll come back to work.

219
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:54,981
Exactly.

220
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:56,721
Don't visit her too often.

221
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:58,881
Must not spill the beans.

222
00:09:58,922 --> 00:09:59,422
Be careful.

223
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:00,601
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

224
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,322
A month is not short.

225
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:04,162
Ms. Li is quite smart.

226
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,881
She would know it sooner or later.

227
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:09,322
True.

228
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:13,021
Well,

229
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:14,841
Xie, you.

230
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,841
Go report to Ms. Li every now and then.

231
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,082
Others should not go.

232
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:19,641
Okay.

233
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:20,141
Got it.

234
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:20,962
Don't worry.

235
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:21,542
Mr. Zheng.

236
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,802
Xie, he can't keep a secret.

237
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:24,721
Why him?

238
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:25,621
Right.

239
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:27,282
He can't keep a secret.

240
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:28,641
But you and Lin

241
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:29,881
stutter when you lie.

242
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,922
Can I let you go?

243
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:32,881
Oh my.

244
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:34,881
- Mr. Zheng, well...
- What?

245
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,282
You need to announce it.

246
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:37,442
What is it?

247
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:39,121
It would make things easier for me.

248
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:41,802
Well...

249
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:43,641
Let me announce it.

250
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:45,752
The County Standing Committee approved,

251
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:47,922
during the time
when Ms. Li and I are absent,

252
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:50,922
Xie Chunlai will serve
as the acting mayor

253
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:52,682
to handle Yuehai's affairs.

254
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:54,202
Please follow his instructions.

255
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:54,761
- Okay.
- Okay.

256
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:56,202
Don't worry.

257
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:57,761
What are two key points?

258
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:00,721
Go to the county office
to report on work in morning.

259
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:02,402
Xie as acting mayor?

260
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:03,241
For one month?

261
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:04,381
No idea.

262
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:06,282
Third, wish you a smooth journey.

263
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:08,682
Alright, I'm off now.

264
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,241
Work hard, okay?

265
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:11,001
Rest assured.

266
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:11,962
Safe travels.

267
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:12,761
Take care.

268
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:13,501
Alright.

269
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:14,302
Mr. Zheng.

270
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:18,422
Okay.

271
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:20,442
Take care.

272
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:22,601
Goodbye, Mr. Zheng.

273
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,202
Mr. Zheng

274
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:29,042
left again after returning a few days.

275
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,282
And just like last time.

276
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,521
He left with a backpack in a car.

277
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,361
Last time he's in danger,
yet this time he gets a chance.

278
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,841
But don't be influenced by this.

279
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,282
We have a lot of work to do.

280
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:42,361
Okay, let's go to my office

281
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:42,942
and discuss.

282
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:43,641
Not this...

283
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:45,881
Your office is my office.

284
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:46,402
Right.

285
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:47,442
- Here.
- Meeting.

286
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,641
Go to the site.

287
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:50,601
- Go.
- Yes.

288
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:54,258
(Outpatient Department)

289
00:11:57,922 --> 00:11:58,442
Ms. Li.

290
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:00,641
(Diary)
"Xie Chunlai is like Pigsy."

291
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:05,802
Does Xie know you call him like this?

292
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:07,682
But it does make some sense.

293
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:16,062
Ms. Li.

294
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:17,481
Calling me?

295
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:20,881
Xie.

296
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:22,922
When did you get here?

297
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:23,721
For a while.

298
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:25,442
I called you, yet you didn't respond.

299
00:12:25,442 --> 00:12:26,322
You were giggling.

300
00:12:26,562 --> 00:12:28,021
Should I leave? I'll leave.

301
00:12:28,202 --> 00:12:29,001
No need.

302
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:30,922
Come in.

303
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,521
What is it? That funny?

304
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:35,042
Nothing. What brings you here?

305
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:35,802
Nothing.

306
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:38,442
Can't I come to visit you?

307
00:12:38,962 --> 00:12:40,162
Here to report on work?

308
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,042
Both of us are mayors.

309
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,922
Let's exchange ideas.

310
00:12:46,402 --> 00:12:49,761
If any businessmen
come over in these days,

311
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:52,361
take them to visit

312
00:12:52,442 --> 00:12:55,042
the industrial park
that is under construction.

313
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:56,582
And

314
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,562
make sure to visit

315
00:12:59,282 --> 00:13:00,402
Chunmei Printery.

316
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,402
Chunmei Printery Ltd.

317
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:04,542
Okay.

318
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:07,721
Mr. Xie.

319
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:10,322
How long have you been
living in the dorm?

320
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:11,881
For quite some time now.

321
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:15,042
We're talking about work,
why involve personal life?

322
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:16,442
Xie.

323
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:20,202
You're the most magnanimous man
in Yuehai.

324
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:20,822
I am.

325
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,042
Look at Ms. Gao.

326
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:24,521
She has apologized for her own mistakes.

327
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:27,761
Just forgive her and go home.

328
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:29,082
Share a secret to you.

329
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:30,562
Keep it.

330
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,001
I promise.

331
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:34,402
Between me and Chunmei, there's no need

332
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,582
for forgiveness. You know?

333
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:37,601
I...

334
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:40,641
I'm overwhelmed
with the work at the town government

335
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:41,962
and I really can't go home.

336
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:44,721
I can truly feel
how exhausting your work is.

337
00:13:44,922 --> 00:13:45,922
You're even sick now.

338
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:47,902
Just rest and recuperate, okay?

339
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,881
Rest well.

340
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:50,902
Okay?

341
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:52,641
Don't worry. I'm here.

342
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:54,322
I used to have a home,

343
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:55,761
yet I couldn't go back.

344
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,682
Now, I just don't want to go home.

345
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,442
The town government is my home.

346
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:00,802
Let me tell you, I enjoy my work.

347
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:01,881
I've experienced

348
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,761
the joy of working at home.

349
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:05,241
Not going home?

350
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:05,741
No.

351
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:06,962
I'm going back.

352
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:09,841
I have to go back, right?

353
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:10,761
When I get discharged,

354
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,962
I'll have my first meal at your place.

355
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:14,922
Sure, I'll note what you want to eat.

356
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,088
- Don't.
- What do you want to eat?

357
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,042
Please tell Mr. Zheng for me.

358
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:21,162
What is it?

359
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,562
Start a night school.

360
00:14:26,162 --> 00:14:26,802
(Work Notes)
Start a night school?

361
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:29,241
Why so sudden?

362
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,601
Actually, it's not a sudden thought.

363
00:14:31,962 --> 00:14:33,562
I've been thinking about it for long.

364
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:35,282
To be exact,

365
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,241
it was after Zheng Zhiqiang
and Yang Xiaohai were arrested.

366
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:39,562
I've been thinking about it.

367
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:42,481
The self-employed individuals
are getting better

368
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,761
and wealthier.

369
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:44,302
Right.

370
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:47,282
Then folks also hope to live better

371
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:48,881
and make more money.

372
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:49,562
Of course.

373
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:52,521
If there are no proper ways
or opportunities,

374
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:54,881
they'll be like
the bandits and highwaymen.

375
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,881
What happened before will still happen.

376
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,481
(Taking businessmen to visit our factory,
Dinner, Start a night school)

377
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,361
Teach a man to fish
rather than give him a fish.

378
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:03,282
We have this capability.

379
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,282
Start a night school,

380
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:07,322
teach them knowledge
and broaden their minds, right?

381
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:10,402
Help them find ways
to earn money and acquire skills.

382
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,962
It's a type of assistance
from government,

383
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:14,542
right?

384
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:15,462
- Yes.
- Right?

385
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:16,402
Assistance, right?

386
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:17,241
Right?

387
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,162
Yes, exactly.

388
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,082
This night school

389
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:23,521
can improve the education
of Yuehai people.

390
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,881
While building a high level
of material civilization,

391
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:28,562
we must also raise their cultural level.

392
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:29,322
Exactly.

393
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:33,641
Maybe it'll also help us
discover talents who can assist us.

394
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:36,442
Of course,
this matter isn't urgent, Mr. Xie.

395
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:37,521
Just keep it in mind.

396
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:38,422
Right.

397
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:40,601
Give it some thought,

398
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:43,121
then discuss it with Mr. Zheng.

399
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,682
Report it.

400
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:47,841
If there are new ideas,
we'll communicate then.

401
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:55,000
(People Build Their City,
and the City Serves Its People)

402
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:57,266

and Work together to build a civilized Yuehai)

(Yuehai Town People's Government)

404
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:21,922
Mr. Xie.

405
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:24,922
You're back.

406
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:29,761
Take a seat.

407
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:30,682
You take a seat.

408
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:31,582
Alright.

409
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:32,121
You first.

410
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:35,922
Alright.

411
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,101
That's nice.

412
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:39,841
Yang, you...

413
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:40,381
Yes.

414
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,182
Don't.

415
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:44,121
You...

416
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:45,881
It's fine. You sit.

417
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,001
I'll stand then.

418
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:48,322
I'm used to it.

419
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,761
I-I'm not used to this.

420
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:53,241
Wait, Yang, did you

421
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:54,881
report to Mr. Tian?

422
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:55,782
Report.

423
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:57,322
I've already reported.

424
00:16:58,641 --> 00:16:59,442
All right.

425
00:16:59,922 --> 00:17:00,601
Mr. Xie.

426
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:03,992
Where are Ms. Li and Mr. Zheng?

427
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:06,721
They're busy with official duties
and aren't around lately.

428
00:17:08,122 --> 00:17:09,402
So, you're

429
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:11,801
in charge of the town government now?

430
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,642
I've been in charge all along.

431
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:14,721
Okay then.

432
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:19,721
I came over here
for Ms. Li, Mr. Zheng and you.

433
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,241
Then I want to express my gratitude

434
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,882
to all the cadres.

435
00:17:24,202 --> 00:17:26,402
Thanks for taking care of my grandma
while I was away.

436
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:29,281
Well, this is what we should do.

437
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:30,801
Good you're back.

438
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:31,761
Let me see.

439
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:32,862
Look,

440
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:35,561
you seem better.

441
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:36,382
Right.

442
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:38,321
Broken bones well set become stronger.

443
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:39,061
Right.

444
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,241
What are we going to discuss today?

445
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:42,862
Today...

446
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:44,081
We've been waiting for long.

447
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,321
Why hasn't Mr. Xie come yet?

448
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,376
Something came up?

449
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,001
It was urgent.

450
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:54,682
What time is it?

451
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:56,081
What's wrong with him?

452
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,061
He's here.

453
00:17:59,321 --> 00:17:59,821
Xie.

454
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,281
Hurry. We've been waiting.

455
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:07,281
Just sit down and start the meeting.

456
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:11,842
It's Mr. Zheng's seat.

457
00:18:12,761 --> 00:18:13,402
Mr. Tan.

458
00:18:13,721 --> 00:18:15,241
It's a formal meeting.

459
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:16,801
Right now,

460
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,682
I am the acting mayor of Yuehai Town.

461
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:21,602
And I'm still learning.

462
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:25,001
You can call me Acting Mayor Xie.

463
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,521
But if you think it's too long,
call me Mayor Xie.

464
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,442
Okay, Acting Mayor Xie.

465
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:33,001
So, can we start now?

466
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:39,241
Mr. Tan, I have something
to discuss with you.

467
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:39,801
Okay.

468
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:41,202
Today, I just...

469
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:43,041
Is it you two?

470
00:18:45,642 --> 00:18:46,481
It's you two.

471
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:48,962
Look, how much do they weigh?

472
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:50,122
Take a look.

473
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:52,241
How much do they weigh?

474
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:54,842
It's about 90 kg.

475
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,721
Right? Am I right?

476
00:18:57,882 --> 00:18:58,382
Are you?

477
00:18:58,602 --> 00:19:01,281
Today, when I was thinking,

478
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:04,561
I came in from outside
to have this meeting with you.

479
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:08,221
Then I suddenly got bounced
back by a wall.

480
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:08,922
Well, the...

481
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:11,682
The gate of the town government office
is so wide.

482
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,642
Are they a bit chubby?

483
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:14,561
What do you mean?

484
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:15,682
Just say it.

485
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:18,721
The image of city inspectors

486
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,122
matters to Yuehai Town.

487
00:19:21,122 --> 00:19:21,682
Indeed.

488
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:22,462
Right?

489
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:23,561
Just discuss how

490
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:24,301
to solve it.

491
00:19:24,321 --> 00:19:25,561
Don't dwell on them anymore.

492
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:26,221
Well said.

493
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:28,041
I have a solution.

494
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:30,962
Starting tomorrow,
you should run for an hour each morning.

495
00:19:32,241 --> 00:19:35,081
- What?
- Listen to me.

496
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,561
I thought it over.
Five kilometers in an hour,

497
00:19:38,442 --> 00:19:39,642
patrol around Yuehai Town.

498
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,202
This is what you must do.

499
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:42,462
You take the lead, Mr. Tan.

500
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:44,041
You take the lead.

501
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:45,962
Go ahead.

502
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:46,541
Wait.

503
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:47,281
Xie.

504
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:48,721
There's a problem with that.

505
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,122
I'm old now.

506
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:52,662
I'm so busy with work.
I have no time for that.

507
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:54,362
Do I need to lose weight? I'm thin.

508
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:56,362
You don't need to lose weight,
but take the lead.

509
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,481
Xie, how about this?

510
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:00,202
I think you're right.

511
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:02,041
They really are overweight.

512
00:20:02,122 --> 00:20:04,202
It's my fault
for not noticing this problem before.

513
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:05,442
Here's the thing.

514
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:08,081
Let's set a rule, okay?

515
00:20:08,202 --> 00:20:09,561
If they can't lose weight,

516
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:10,081
then...

517
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:10,682
Deduct wages.

518
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:11,842
Okay.

519
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:12,342
- Right?
- See?

520
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:13,882
You're quite efficient.

521
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,801
We can make a chart

522
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,922
to show changes in their weight.

523
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:18,682
Good now?

524
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,342
Mr. Tan, you're so efficient.

525
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:22,842
Mr. Lin, what do you think?

526
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:25,521
I must say.

527
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:27,602
Look how efficient Mr. Tan is.

528
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:29,561
He knows the methods.

529
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,162
So it actually comes down

530
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,402
to your expertise in woodworking,

531
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:37,528
you surely have methods
we can't comprehend.

532
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:39,321
But in terms of overall work management,

533
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:42,202
as a deputy mayor,
you're lacking methods.

534
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,281
Did I say that correctly?

535
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:47,241
Put people to good use.

536
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:48,682
You need talents under you.

537
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,601
Just like Mr. Zheng
has me under him, right?

538
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:51,362
Look, he's absent.

539
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:52,642
And I can be here,

540
00:20:52,922 --> 00:20:54,801
holding this up, I think.

541
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:55,521
You, sit here.

542
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,541
You two, sit here.

543
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:58,342
Come on.

544
00:20:58,521 --> 00:20:59,682
It's easier to record this.

545
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,721
Thanks, Mr. Xie.

546
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:01,561
Work comes first.

547
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:02,602
Let's continue.

548
00:21:02,882 --> 00:21:04,761
I'm saying, you need to know

549
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:07,281
how to manage the people under you.

550
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:08,162
Among your people,

551
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:10,721
only Qingtian stands out.

552
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,021
Not bad.

553
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:12,922
Really not bad.

554
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:14,162
I am being honest.

555
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,321
I praise the good and call out the bad.

556
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:18,061
That's my style, right?

557
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:20,801
But don't be arrogant. An arrogant army
will surely fail, right?

558
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:21,981
Think it over yourself.

559
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:22,981
Sort it out yourself,

560
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:23,481
okay?

561
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:23,981
Okay.

562
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:25,281
As for you...

563
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:27,561
Let me think about it.

564
00:21:27,962 --> 00:21:29,081
It was Mr. Zheng before.

565
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:32,162
You report to Mr. Zheng
once a week, right?

566
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:32,922
A-Am I right?

567
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:34,281
You

568
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:37,001
write a work log

569
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:38,281
every day.

570
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:41,842
And I want to see
the whole work process,

571
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,581
alright?

572
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:46,922
I think this is very important.

573
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:47,390
I think.

574
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:50,842
- Xie... Mr. Xie.
- Mr.

575
00:21:51,081 --> 00:21:51,581
Okay.

576
00:21:51,882 --> 00:21:52,561
All these years,

577
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:55,642
Mr. Zheng has never asked me
to write a written report.

578
00:21:55,902 --> 00:21:57,521
Yes, I also noticed this problem.

579
00:21:57,821 --> 00:22:00,642
Mr. Zheng is not perfect, right?

580
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:01,842
He has his own issues.

581
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:03,402
We'll talk about it separately, right?

582
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:05,362
Why is this important?

583
00:22:05,402 --> 00:22:07,962
I'm saying, why am I
asking you to write this?

584
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,561
It's not that I'm here to fulfill
my duties as Acting Mayor.

585
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:11,721
You do this. You do that.

586
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:12,842
You should...

587
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:13,682
Is that so?

588
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:15,761
I can't accept such leadership in place.

589
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:17,682
Can Yuehai comes this far
with such leaders?

590
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:20,702
What I'm saying is,
I've thought it through, right?

591
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:21,962
I need to know what you think.

592
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,842
What's the problem?

593
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,122
Which part went wrong?

594
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,761
So I can find the solution.

595
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:27,761
Because in this area,

596
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:30,402
I can confidently say I'm capable.

597
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:31,261
Okay?

598
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:32,761
Okay.

599
00:22:34,882 --> 00:22:36,442
Write reports if you need to.

600
00:22:37,602 --> 00:22:39,642
Work out if you need to.

601
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,442
But today,

602
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:44,081
our meeting's focus is not on this.

603
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:44,741
Okay.

604
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:47,041
Just tell us your important matter now.

605
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:47,761
What's important?

606
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:50,168
(Night School Planning Committee)

607
00:22:50,642 --> 00:22:51,962
- Night school?
- Night school?

608
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:56,721
Night school what committee?

609
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:58,402
- Planning.
- Planning.

610
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:00,001
- Planning.
- Planning.

611
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:02,922
After Zheng Zhiqiang
and Yang Xiaohai were arrested,

612
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:04,481
I started to think.

613
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:08,162
For a long time,
I couldn't find a way out.

614
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:10,442
It's just the whole Yuehai

615
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:13,162
seems to be moving step by step upwards.

616
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:16,001
But I found there are many hidden

617
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,561
undercurrents there,

618
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:19,281
which can be dangerous.

619
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:21,442
What happens is in the people's hearts,

620
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:22,702
right?

621
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:24,362
See? Self-employed individuals

622
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:26,122
are getting better and richer.

623
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:29,081
How do you think ordinary citizens
might feel about it?

624
00:23:29,922 --> 00:23:31,001
Right? You get a motorbike.

625
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,561
He lives in a villa. What about me?

626
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:33,962
We must...

627
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,001
Sometimes we can't look down, right?

628
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:37,602
Sometimes we have to look upwards.

629
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,962
We, as the "parent officials" of Yuehai,

630
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:41,842
must stand out.

631
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:43,402
Mr. Tan, Mr. Lin,

632
00:23:43,442 --> 00:23:45,081
and all of us who are capable

633
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:47,864
need to stand out and help them,

634
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:48,981
right?

635
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:52,682
Set up the night school,
hire talented people, and find experts.

636
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,241
We can't do it, so we find them.

637
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:57,362
As long as you have an idea,
you can reach your goal.

638
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:00,102
Bravo!

639
00:24:00,642 --> 00:24:01,142
Bravo!

640
00:24:01,362 --> 00:24:02,602
Knowledge!

641
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,122
The waves of knowledge!

642
00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:06,362
We need to enter
the torrent of knowledge!

643
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:08,882
We must arm ourselves with knowledge!

644
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:11,241
We need to give
those who crave knowledge

645
00:24:11,442 --> 00:24:13,761
ideas, profit-making ideas!

646
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:15,321
Give them help!

647
00:24:24,521 --> 00:24:25,481
I feel a bit excited.

648
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:26,842
I am really excited.

649
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:30,442
Because it feels like a window
suddenly opened for me.

650
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:32,162
I saw all those...

651
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:32,942
Those

652
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:35,842
faces shining brightly in the sunlight.

653
00:24:38,281 --> 00:24:38,781
That's

654
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:41,001
quite a coincidence.

655
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:42,481
Ms. Li

656
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:46,041
is just the same
as what I just said and thought.

657
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:47,442
You know?

658
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,561
So everyone must take this seriously.

659
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,202
I must say it again now.

660
00:24:53,521 --> 00:24:55,761
Setting up the night school
is our town government's

661
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:58,321
top priority at this time.

662
00:24:58,602 --> 00:24:59,241
Anything

663
00:25:00,362 --> 00:25:01,362
must give way.

664
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:03,342
That's all.

665
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:07,241
(Night School Setup Plan)

666
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:07,801
Give it to me.

667
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:10,801
Mr. Xie,

668
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,122
I didn't expect you to move so fast.

669
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:17,122
You prepared such
a comprehensive plan so quickly.

670
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,241
Ms. Li, I'm flattered.

671
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:19,882
It wasn't just me.

672
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,682
You know Mr. Zheng.

673
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:24,842
Everything needs to be done
at the Yuehai pace.

674
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:28,801
The only problem now
is the lack of venue.

675
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:29,721
So I decided

676
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:32,642
to hold the first night school session
at the Government Office.

677
00:25:32,761 --> 00:25:34,922
We hold it while looking
for a suitable venue.

678
00:25:35,922 --> 00:25:36,602
No problem.

679
00:25:37,642 --> 00:25:39,962
I need to confirm
a few details with you.

680
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:40,922
Go ahead.

681
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:41,761
Very important.

682
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:43,922
Shall we set a registration?

683
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:46,922
Should there be any threshold?

684
00:25:47,321 --> 00:25:48,682
I just want to know,

685
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:52,041
since we're both mayors,
are we on the same page?

686
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:58,241
First, no registration, and do not
set thresholds. Education for all.

687
00:25:58,561 --> 00:26:00,001
Our main goal

688
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:02,682
is still to help more people in need.

689
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:05,321
Great minds think alike.

690
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,281
Well...

691
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:10,602
Ms. Li and I are in agreement.

692
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:13,962
The more people, the better.

693
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:17,922
No threshold.

694
00:26:18,761 --> 00:26:19,608
Education for all.

695
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:21,682
What does it mean?

696
00:26:21,682 --> 00:26:22,642
It means our goal

697
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:24,321
is to assist

698
00:26:24,602 --> 00:26:27,001
the largest group of people in need.

699
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:28,882
Night school is a new thing.

700
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,761
People of Yuehai are unfamiliar
with night school.

701
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:35,081
So, don't overlook the promotion
of night school in the initial stage.

702
00:26:35,882 --> 00:26:36,962
For the teaching staff,

703
00:26:37,001 --> 00:26:39,521
we must select them
carefully and rigorously.

704
00:26:40,402 --> 00:26:41,081
Too ordinary.

705
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:42,402
You find this?

706
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:43,602
What is this?

707
00:26:43,922 --> 00:26:44,442
What's this?

708
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:45,642
(Night School Teacher Resume)
What is this?

709
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:47,481
Didn't I say we can't have
ordinary teachers?

710
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:48,442
Ms. Li said so.

711
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:49,882
Do they fit our Yuehai?

712
00:26:49,922 --> 00:26:52,442
I'll say it again.
Pay attention to the promotion.

713
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:54,962
Yeah, we need to find professional

714
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,521
and influential experts and masters.

715
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:58,962
Understand?

716
00:26:59,561 --> 00:27:01,001
Yes, listen to the acting mayor.

717
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:03,642
At least someone of Mr. Tan's level.

718
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,521
Think of solutions with Tan
regarding expenses.

719
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:10,122
Our town government will bear
as much as possible.

720
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,642
We can't increase people's burden

721
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,602
just for attending night school.

722
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:15,801
Hello?

723
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,202
Professor Lv, right?

I'm Xie Chunlai, the mayor of Yuehai.

725
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:24,842
We would like to invite you
to teach in Yuehai.

726
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:26,040
Is this Mr. Zhao?

727
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:28,122
I'm from Yuehai town.

728
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:29,842
I meant our Yuehai's

729
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:30,682
condition...

730
00:27:30,801 --> 00:27:32,801
The timing is definitely up to you.

731
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:35,402
You're here to vacation, to enjoy.

732
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:37,442

It's time to work, Xie.

You didn't go back?

741
00:28:34,001 --> 00:28:34,962

742
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:37,402
No, well...

743

Time to work.

00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,481
Go wash your face to wake up.

747
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:45,001
Time to work.

748
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:45,942
I...

749
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:47,321
I...

750
00:28:48,842 --> 00:28:51,001
No, it doesn't matter where I sleep.

751
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:55,581
Hello?

752
00:28:57,842 --> 00:29:00,442
Professor He, I'm waiting for your call.

753
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:01,342
Well...

754
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:03,202
That's great.

755
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:06,442
This is really great.

756
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:08,162
Okay.

757
00:29:08,362 --> 00:29:10,842
On behalf of all the people
of Yuehai Town,

758
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:12,922
I'd like to extend
an early welcome to you.

759
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:14,241
I'll greet you then.

760
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:16,281
Okay, then it's settled.

761
00:29:16,682 --> 00:29:18,162
Okay, that's wonderful.

762
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:19,001
Okay.

763
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:23,081
It was worth waiting all morning.

764
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:26,362
You seem so happy. Did you invite
some amazing expert?

765
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:28,001
Not an amazing expert,

766
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,481
a top-notch expert.

767
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:32,081
I've carefully selected

768
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:33,442
and spared no effort.

769
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:36,561
My hard work paid off.

770
00:29:37,202 --> 00:29:38,922
I finally managed to invite

771
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:43,922
the most top-notch expert, Professor He.

772
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:45,402
Shouldn't I be happy?

773
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:46,462
Yes, right.

774
00:29:46,561 --> 00:29:48,842
I just want the people of Yuehai

775
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:51,801
to be able to broaden their horizons

776
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:54,321
through my efforts.

777
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:56,281
Okay.

778
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,001
Look how happy you are.

779
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:07,281
We're really happy that a top-level
expert nationwide comes here.

780
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:10,481
May I ask,

781
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:12,281
for such an amazing expert,

782
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:14,162
is the cost quite high?

783
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:15,561
Not at all.

784
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:16,281
That's good.

785
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:16,962
It's only 15,000.

786
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,281
15,000.

787
00:30:26,402 --> 00:30:28,521
Really 15,000?

788
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:30,072
Wait, 15,000...

789
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:32,081
What is our monthly salary?

790
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,202
It's several years' salary.

791
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:34,962
And with 15,000 yuan,

792
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,362
we could even buy the most fashionable

793
00:30:38,442 --> 00:30:40,241
125 motorcycle.

794
00:30:40,402 --> 00:30:41,922
You're smart. Do the math right away.

795
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:42,761
Not the problem.

796
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,001
If it's that much money,

797
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:46,001
I really can't agree.

798
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:46,882
I can't approve.

799
00:30:46,922 --> 00:30:47,481
You disagree?

800
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:49,528
I disagree with your disagreement.

801
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:51,581
Ms. Li agrees with my disagreement.

802
00:30:51,882 --> 00:30:52,962
Can you figure that out?

803
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:53,842
Wait, you...

804
00:30:53,842 --> 00:30:55,202
Ms. Li said we need professionals.

805
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:56,362
Don't beat around the bush.

806
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:58,442
Listen. Getting Professor He
for this little money,

807
00:30:58,602 --> 00:31:00,602
people nationwide are fighting over him.

808
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:01,402
Not about money.

809
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:02,882
Listen. For him to come here,

810
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:04,241
look what the newspaper says.

811
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:05,061
Take a look.

812
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:06,241
I don't need to look.

813
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,362
It's just too much money.

814
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:09,162
Okay. Please don't...

815
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:11,081
It's fine. Take it easy.

816
00:31:11,281 --> 00:31:12,761
Just don't worry about whether 15,000

817
00:31:12,882 --> 00:31:14,402
is expensive or not.

818
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:15,922
I'll pay.

819
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,682
I won't let Yuehai pay. Got it?

820
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:19,481
Agreed, right?

821
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:20,581
Okay.

822
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,018
(Integrity Wins the World)

823
00:32:41,074 --> 00:32:44,178
(I took 12,000 yuan. From Xie Chunlai)

824
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,475
This place always has mixed colors.

825
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,007
How do we solve this?

826
00:32:58,697 --> 00:33:01,560
I'll split this into two templates
and it'll be better.

827
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:03,586
Look here.

828
00:33:31,602 --> 00:33:32,442
What are you doing?

829
00:33:32,962 --> 00:33:33,752
What are you doing?

830
00:33:36,202 --> 00:33:36,702
Take this.

831
00:33:37,241 --> 00:33:38,081
What's this about?

832
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:49,081
Is it okay?

833
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:50,241
So beautiful.

834
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:51,081
So beautiful.

835
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:01,842
Ms. Gao.

836
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,362
Is Ms. Gao here?

837
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:06,801
Ms. Gao.

838
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:09,962
Ms. Gao.

839
00:34:12,442 --> 00:34:13,762
What a rare guest!

840
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:17,842
What is it?

841
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:29,922
Not bad.

842
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:32,521
Pretty good.

843
00:34:35,402 --> 00:34:36,722
It's good.

844
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:41,521
There's a safety hazard here.

845
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:42,722
Take care of it.

846
00:34:43,402 --> 00:34:45,701
Okay. Good.

847
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:48,641
You look like a hazard, Xie Yu.

848
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:55,501
Who?

849
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:57,922
You have a bit of Yu's style
in managing water.

850
00:34:58,282 --> 00:34:59,442
You didn't even stop by home?

851
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:00,888
Any serious business?

852
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:03,501
Educated.

853
00:35:03,722 --> 00:35:04,222
Of course.

854
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:06,121
You should study.

855
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:07,141
What?

856
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:08,762
You go study.

857
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,201
What's wrong with me? What's up?

858
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:12,922
Go to Yuehai's night school to study.

859
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:14,201
Yuehai has a night school?

860
00:35:14,802 --> 00:35:16,242
The kind where we study together?

861
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:17,081
No threshold.

862
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:19,081
Look, someone like me can study there.

863
00:35:19,722 --> 00:35:20,521
Someone like you

864
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:23,402
can surely study there.

865
00:35:23,882 --> 00:35:26,282
What do you mean by "surely"?
What am I like?

866
00:35:26,882 --> 00:35:27,382
Take a seat.

867
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:28,081
Sit here.

868
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:29,081
Sit.

869
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:29,681
Let's talk.

870
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:38,963
(Quality First, Reputation First)

871
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:45,481
Looking at your complexion,

872
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:48,282
it's just lacking a bit of wisdom.

873
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:49,722
You really need to study.

874
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,481
Everyone, come here.

875
00:35:51,681 --> 00:35:52,442
Let me speak. Come.

876
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:53,842
Come on, everyone.

877
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:55,021
Hold up.

878
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,201
Gather around. Let's talk.

879
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,962
Put down what you're doing.

880
00:35:58,882 --> 00:36:00,242
There are a lot of new faces.

881
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:03,481
Work is one thing.

882
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,201
You just need
to keep progressing and learning.

883
00:36:06,802 --> 00:36:08,521
As the acting mayor...

884
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:15,362
Acting Mayor Xie.

885
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:16,382
Well, well.

886
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,762
It's great. Let's applaud.

887
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,161
Congrats to Acting Mayor Xie.

888
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:20,842
No, that's not what I mean.

889
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:21,742
- Impressive.
- That's not it.

890
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,561
No, that's not it.

891
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,282
Thank you.

892
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,121
You don't need to.

893
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:26,001
Everyone,

894
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,902
learning will accompany us
for a lifetime, right?

895
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:33,601
I've really been pondering
a lot of questions lately.

896
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:35,672
Chunmei Printery has reached today.

897
00:36:35,922 --> 00:36:37,242
From nothing to something, right?

898
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:38,601
It is me.

899
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:41,081
Look at Yuehai's current state.

900
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:44,681
That is also me, right?

901
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:45,962
It's me. It's always me.

902
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:46,722
Yes, all you.

903
00:36:46,722 --> 00:36:47,222
It's just...

904
00:36:48,322 --> 00:36:48,952
Stop it.

905
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:51,021
Well, of course.

906
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:54,481
I truly deserve it.

907
00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:55,962
I really need to get things done.

908
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:57,382
Lately,

909
00:36:57,561 --> 00:37:00,362
I've just set up a night school
in Yuehai for everyone.

910
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:04,601
I hope the future Yuehai
will become an ocean of knowledge.

911
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:06,681
Time to applaud?

912
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:08,601
- Right?
- Okay.

913
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:09,842
You all should go register.

914
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:11,242
All go, right?

915
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:12,201
See? Ms. Gao can

916
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,481
register to attend.

917
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:14,282
You all can join,

918
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:15,641
right? You all can.

919
00:37:15,962 --> 00:37:16,922
Alright, thank you.

920
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:17,722
It's a good thing.

921
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:18,561
You came from afar

922
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,762
to notify us. Thank you.

923
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:22,402
I'm mainly here

924
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,322
to inform Acting Director Gao.

925
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:27,442
Alright, Acting Mayor Xie, don't worry.
We won't slack off.

926
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:30,121
Alright, everyone get back to work.

927
00:37:30,802 --> 00:37:31,641
Work hard.

928
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:32,962
Remember his words.

929
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:33,802
Not bad.

930
00:37:33,842 --> 00:37:34,802
Don't slack off at work.

931
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:35,681
Not bad.

932
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:44,481
Anything else?

933
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:46,802
Are you out of money?

934
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:49,541
Enough.

935
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,641
You've had enough? You can go now.

936
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:01,521
I have a meeting.

937
00:38:06,362 --> 00:38:06,862
Dad.

938
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:07,882
What "Dad"?

939
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:08,842
Not drinking the tea?

940
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:14,661
Go.

941
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:18,641
Why is he showing off here?

942
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:19,601
Ridiculous.

943
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:27,462
Okay.

944
00:38:28,302 --> 00:38:28,802
(Yuehai Night School)
Let's go.

945
00:38:28,802 --> 00:38:29,661
- Okay.
- Let's go.

(Open Science and Culture Lecture to All
Bring your notebook, cup, and stool)

947
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:33,041
What's this?

948
00:38:33,882 --> 00:38:34,922
Yuehai Night School?

949
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:40,521
Open science and culture lecture to all.

950
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:44,201
Bring your notebook, cup, and stool.

951
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:47,201
- The government starts a night school?
- It is a good thing.

952
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:48,922
Anyone could attend, right?

953
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:50,802
So that means we can also attend?

954
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:51,842
I think so.

955
00:38:56,018 --> 00:38:59,282
(Yuehai Town People's Government,
Yuehai Town Committee)

956
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:53,882
Professor He.

957
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,362
I wish we'd met sooner.

958
00:39:58,762 --> 00:39:59,922
Finally, you are here.

959
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:04,641
Yan, a bowl of wonton, please.

960
00:40:05,442 --> 00:40:06,842
I'm getting ready to close up.

961
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:08,282
Why close so early today?

962
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:10,842
Yeah. I'm going to the government later
to attend a class.

963
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,762
Yes. I'll attend the class, too.

964
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:13,681
I almost forgot.

965
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:14,601
Wang, stop eating.

966
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:15,882
The night school's almost full.

967
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:16,481
I'm coming.

968
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:18,681
Yan, the money.

969
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:19,382
Hurry.

970
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:20,201
I'm heading off.

971
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:21,922
Slow down.

972
00:40:22,242 --> 00:40:23,081
- Hurry up.
- Quick.

973
00:40:23,262 --> 00:40:23,762
Hurry up.

974
00:40:23,762 --> 00:40:24,282
Wait for me!

975
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,322
- Quick.
- Hurry up.

976

Okay.

978
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:31,842
Lili, be careful.

979
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:33,561
Just a stiff neck, it's fine.

980
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:36,882
You, keep your hand steady.

981
00:40:37,481 --> 00:40:38,601
Be decisive when you cut.

982
00:40:38,842 --> 00:40:40,402
Find a higher spot for him.

983
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:41,041
Lili,

984
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:42,481
you've got a stiff neck.

985
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,481
You let an apprentice practice on me?

986
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,922
Didn't you to come looking
for Yang every day?

987
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,282
Lv, hurry up. Don't waste time.

988
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,512
Hurry. Time for the lecture.

989
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:51,882
Lecture?

990
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:52,382
Lecture?

991
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:52,882
I forgot.

992
00:40:52,882 --> 00:40:53,561
What lecture?

993
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:54,762
Wait, it's not finished.

994
00:40:54,762 --> 00:40:55,481
I'll go too.

995
00:40:55,722 --> 00:40:56,641
You haven't paid yet.

996
00:40:56,762 --> 00:40:58,328
Haircut unfinished. Go on tomorrow.

997
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,442
Where exactly is the lecture?

998
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:04,121
I'm coming.

999
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,001
Why do you carry a mirror with you?

1000
00:41:07,922 --> 00:41:09,161
My tooth...

1001
00:41:20,242 --> 00:41:21,521
What do you want, Mr. Xie?

1002
00:41:22,161 --> 00:41:22,882
Let's start.

1003
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:24,242
Starting soon.

1004
00:41:24,402 --> 00:41:25,041
Starting soon.

1005
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:30,962
Alright, please quiet down, everyone.

1006
00:41:31,962 --> 00:41:35,762
Before Professor He
officially starts class,

1007
00:41:36,322 --> 00:41:39,362
- we need to do some preparations.
- A toothache is really unbearable.

1008
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:42,882
Please all stand up now.

1009
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:47,802
Put your hands on your hips.

1010
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:56,681
Join me every day for two minutes.

1011
00:41:57,322 --> 00:42:01,242
Do it with me, and your body
will feel more relaxed.

1012
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,481
Very good.

1013
00:42:04,242 --> 00:42:08,561
Now, please raise your hands.

1014
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,081
Turn to the left.

1015
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:17,322
Wave your hands.

1016
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:21,081
Wealth will follow.

1017
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:23,322
Yang Xiaohai.

1018
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:24,061
Here.

1019
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:25,601
When did you get out?

1020
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:28,521
Why didn't you bring your friends along?

1021
00:42:29,762 --> 00:42:32,561
Turn to the right.

1022
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:34,641
Let me tell you. Now the night school

1023
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:36,442
has no threshold at all.

1024
00:42:36,601 --> 00:42:37,442
Anyone can come.

1025
00:42:37,481 --> 00:42:38,601
Why are you provoking him?

1026
00:42:38,762 --> 00:42:39,322
Provoking him?

1027
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:40,201
Don't provoke him.

1028
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:40,882
Xiaohai,

1029
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:43,282
are you going to report to Mr. Tian?

1030
00:42:43,882 --> 00:42:45,144
You need to report, you know?

1031
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:46,041
What?

1032
00:42:46,161 --> 00:42:48,001
Do you still want to get rich with us?

1033
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,601
Wave.

1034
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:51,362
Can't you speak properly?

1035
00:42:51,521 --> 00:42:52,242
Speak properly.

1036
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:53,362
Why do you talk so much?

1037
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:56,161
Leave if you don't want to listen.
Don't disturb others.

1038
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,442
Why does it matter to you
whether I talk? Who are you?

1039
00:42:58,681 --> 00:42:59,722
