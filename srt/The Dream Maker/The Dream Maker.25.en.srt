00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,472
You know the reason best, don't you?

185
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:07,553
We did it for the sake
of Yuehai's residents.

186
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:08,433
And this.

187
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,232
Building a modern hospital

188
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,793
is inherently a good thing
that benefits the local people.

189
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:17,232
However, in Yuehai,
this matter has sparked controversy.

190
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:19,112
The wife of Yuehai Town's top leader

191
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:21,592
once passed away due
to delayed medical treatment.

192
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:25,073
Afterward, he resolved
to build a modern hospital.

193
00:12:25,472 --> 00:12:27,913
He coined the phrase "no budget cap".

194
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,512
During the construction,

195
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:34,393
they purchased large quantities
of expensive medical equipment.

196
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:37,752
D-Does this Reporter Du
even write like a human?

197
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:40,352
Anyway, I think this report

198
00:12:40,632 --> 00:12:42,393
is utter nonsense from start to finish.

199
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:43,752
It's slander and defamation.

200
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:46,352
He's not basing his report on the truth.

201
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:48,033
Du Tao, I have a message for you too.

202
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:51,232
You have overwhelmingly become
the enemy of Yuehai Town.

203
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:52,793
I truly never expected

204
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,313
Du Tao to be such a person.

205
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:55,632
Alright.

206
00:12:56,153 --> 00:12:57,832
Calm down, okay?

207
00:12:58,232 --> 00:13:00,313
This article wasn't written by Ms. Li.

208
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:01,512
Why take it out on her?

209
00:13:02,553 --> 00:13:05,033
Are you still into collective punishment
after all these years?

210
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:06,112
Moreover,

211
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:08,433
Ms. Li is just his girlfriend,

212
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:09,472
not his mom.

213
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,673
Even if she were,

214
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,092
she couldn't control
an adult's actions, right?

215
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,393
As deputy mayors,

216
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:15,673
this is all you can take?

217
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:16,832
You said it's not true.

218
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,328
So what are you afraid of?

219

(City Construction Archives)

220
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:44,313

221
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:51,992
Can't you all just talk a bit less?

222
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,433
(New City Life)
I've already seen this report.

223
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,372
Yes.

224
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,472
Mr. Zhao is away on an inspection tour.

225
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:04,372
Yes.

226
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:06,472
Don't worry.

227
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:09,153
We will fully cooperate on this matter.

228
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:11,913
Okay. Goodbye.

229
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,273
You received whistleblower letters too?

230
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:21,752
They all are.

231
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:23,433
Take a look.

232
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,832
I think it's all because of this report.

233
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,433
Yuehai collected
the city construction fee ages ago.

234
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:31,712
They bring it up again.

235
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:34,553
Don't you understand yet?

236
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:36,073
(Conference Room)
The key to this report

237
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,033
is not about the city construction fee.

238
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:40,953
That's just a cover.

239
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:42,472
I understand.

240
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:43,553
Isn't this article

241
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:46,153
just insinuating that Zheng Decheng
has financial issues?

242
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:47,592
This is total slander!

243
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,953
I've known Zheng Decheng for decades.
I know him well.

244
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:52,632
If he were greedy,

245
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:55,712
he could've left his post
and gone into business long ago.

246
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,752
With his talent,

247
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:01,313
I wouldn't be surprised if he turned
into a lion, let alone some 'monkeys.'

248
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:04,693
Yes.

249
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:08,313
Yuehai has developed
remarkably these years.

250
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:10,313
His achievements

251
00:15:10,512 --> 00:15:12,313
are also evident to everyone.

252
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:14,393
But when it comes to work,

253
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:16,992
to put it nicely,
he doesn't sweat the small stuff.

254
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:18,488
To put it bluntly,

255
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,273
he has no regard for others.

256
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:23,393
Yuehai is unique.

257
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,792
Since its establishment,

258
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:27,352
apart from handing over tax revenue
proportionally every year,

259
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:30,553
the remaining funds are all
self-collected and self-disbursed.

260
00:15:31,193 --> 00:15:31,693
Look.

261
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:35,232

263
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,193
absolute power

264
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:41,153
likely leads to absolute corruption.

265
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:43,273
Can you guarantee

266
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:45,313
that over all these years in Yuehai,

267
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,793
Zheng Decheng hasn't made fatal mistakes

268
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:50,112
out of negligence or carelessness?

269
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:54,112
What's more troublesome now is

270
00:15:54,393 --> 00:15:55,232
these letters

271
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:57,793
weren't just sent to us.

272
00:15:58,153 --> 00:15:59,673
They were also sent to the city level.

273
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:01,673
This

274
00:16:02,313 --> 00:16:05,592
has already gone beyond our control.

277
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:16,433
In that room.

278

Okay, thanks.

279
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:22,352
Tell me.

to go to Shanghai?

283

285
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,832
how can you be so impatient for success?

286
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:43,592
Did you write articles like that

287
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:45,033
to get into that magazine?

288
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:49,832

297
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:44,752
Just kidding. I'm doing homework.

298
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:47,833
That's more like it.

299
00:17:48,913 --> 00:17:49,833
I've got something.

300
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,913
It's just

301
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,953
that I might not be able to go back
to the county for a while.

302
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,833
But no matter what happens,
you have to believe me.

Wait. Are you saying
you're going to get arrested?

You really don't wish me well, do you?

306
00:18:08,113 --> 00:18:09,472
No, I told you before,

I'll buy some eggs and walnuts later

314

and send them to you.

Okay.

326
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:15,413
Have a seat.

327
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:23,232
I called you over

328
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:26,113
to discuss a few things with you.

329
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,593
Mr. Zheng, I'm sorry.

330
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:32,833
I called Du Tao many times,
but he didn't answer.

331
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:35,913
But regarding this matter,

332
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:38,433
I will surely
give everyone an explanation.

333
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:40,353
That's not what I to discuss.

334
00:19:43,992 --> 00:19:44,593

335
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,113
I know you're upset.

336
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,193
But this situation

337
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:54,752
might be even more serious
than we thought.

338
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:57,873
I'm worried

339
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:00,232
that very soon

340
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:03,512
they will investigate me.

341
00:20:04,312 --> 00:20:05,072
Investigate?

342
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:07,353
But this is just a hunch of mine.

343
00:20:08,113 --> 00:20:09,113
However, we still

344
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:12,212
need to prepare for the worst, right?

345
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,433
Mr. Zheng,

346
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:15,913
everything about Yuehai

347
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:18,153
was decided by all our colleagues

348
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:20,312
in the town government.

349
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,593
They can't just
investigate you alone, right?

350
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,032
Of course, it's too early
to discuss this now.

351
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:27,232
What if...

352
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:29,913
I mean, what if...

353
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,472
If I'm taken away for investigation,

354
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,032
Yuehai's work must not stop.

355
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:36,193
Yuehai's goals must not deviate.

356
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,232
That's why I called you here.

357
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:39,572
Mr. Zheng.

358
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:41,953
I won't go into minor details.

359
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:45,032
I trust you
and the three deputy mayors of Yuehai.

360
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:46,433
Even if I'm not here,

361
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,593
you can still carry on the work.

362
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:51,833
But there are several
important matters I must mention.

363
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:53,653
First,

364
00:20:54,232 --> 00:20:58,272
our overall goal
for Yuehai must not waver.

365
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:01,873
Yuehai must reach a population
of 100,000 by year-end.

366
00:21:02,113 --> 00:21:05,593
With more people come,
housing, job demands,

367
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:08,232
and school facilities
must be upgraded accordingly.

368
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,312
Second, Yang Xiaohai and those kids.

369
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:12,512
I calculated the timing.

370
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:14,433
They should be getting out soon.

371
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:16,113
I've thought it over.

372
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:18,552
Just finding them jobs isn't enough.

373
00:21:19,272 --> 00:21:21,113
We must help them change fundamentally.

374
00:21:21,472 --> 00:21:23,992
Help them find
the right purpose in life.

375
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:26,732
That's your specialty, right?

376
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:27,272
Okay.

377
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:28,752
Third, and most critical

378
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:29,833
is...

379
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,312
Build the industrial park.

380
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:37,673
Seems my worries are unnecessary.

381
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:39,552
Then I am at ease.

382
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:45,113
One more thing.

383
00:22:00,272 --> 00:22:01,032
Keep this

384
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:02,953
for me.

385
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:05,673
What is it?

386
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:06,953
How do I put this?

387
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:09,512
It's my life's work.

388
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:09,833
You asked to meet me here.

389
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:11,792
What? Afraid to face me?

390
00:23:12,153 --> 00:23:12,653
I'm sorry.

391
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:17,113
You must've been treated unfairly
in Yuehai lately.

392
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:18,953
Why did you write that article?

393
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:21,873
Qiuping, I came

394
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:24,193
to ask you not to let this article

395
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:26,633
affect our relationship.

396
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,353
Then why didn't you answer my calls?

397
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,913
Tell me, what does journalism
mean to you?

398
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:35,448
What do you mean?

399
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:36,272
Answer me.

400
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:39,272
Journalism means reporting the latest

401
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,072
valuable information as quickly

402
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:43,272
as possible from a unique perspective.

403
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:43,873
No!

404
00:23:44,472 --> 00:23:48,032
Journalism's essence is pursuing truth,
fairness, and objectivity.

405
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,913
That's what you told me.

406
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:53,232
Your article insinuates

407
00:23:53,272 --> 00:23:54,712
that Zheng Decheng took bribes.

408
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,752
Are you objective? Are you fair?

409
00:23:57,992 --> 00:23:59,353
Did you seek truth from facts?

410
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:01,373
Now you want to talk
about seeking truth?

411
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,953
When I wrote columns in Yuehai,

412
00:24:04,232 --> 00:24:05,472
I was factual, wasn't I?

413
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:07,032
But you never admitted it.

414
00:24:07,272 --> 00:24:09,433
Don't give me
that "for Yuehai's development" excuse.

415
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:10,752
I think

416
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:14,853
sacrificing Yuehai to make the nation
think Reform and Opening-up is worthy.

417
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,593
Make the whole nation think?

418
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,113
It's your ticket to Shanghai, isn't it?

419
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:29,552
Du Tao, you wrote that sensational piece

420
00:24:29,953 --> 00:24:31,833
chasing success and fame,

421
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:35,312
ignoring truth
and betraying your ideals.

422
00:24:36,153 --> 00:24:37,633
Is this still the you I knew?

423
00:24:37,953 --> 00:24:38,453
Yes!

424
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,193
I chase success and fame.

425
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:43,113
I want to go to Shanghai. What's wrong?

426
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:44,193
Times are changing.

427
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:47,032
Who isn't chasing success and fame now?

428
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:49,423
When you and Zheng Decheng
blocked my article,

429
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:51,072
weren't you after fame and fortune?

430
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:52,433
You see me that way?

431
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:54,552
You think I acted for personal gain?

432
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:57,032
What else? For Yuehai's people?

433
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:58,472
To serve the people?

434
00:24:58,593 --> 00:25:00,552
Exactly! I serve the people.

435
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:02,272
The people's interests come first.

436
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:03,792
Can't you drop the hypocrisy?

437
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:04,712
Can you be real?

438
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:06,512
Have you considered that you changed?

439
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:08,612
I remember back in university,

440
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:11,160
you used to read People's Daily
on the campus lawn.

441
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:12,568
You said,

442
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:15,833
"This is an era
of wild growth and vitality."

443
00:25:16,312 --> 00:25:18,113
"This is an era
requiring great navigators."

444
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:19,992
"An age needing great surfers."

445
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,032
That's exactly when I fell for you.

446
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:32,032
All these years,

447
00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:35,992
I've kept every article you ever wrote.

448
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,378
(Scrapbook)

449
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:52,673
Du Tao,

450
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:55,393
when I gave you
the marriage application,

451
00:25:56,232 --> 00:25:57,673
did you think I was ridiculous?

452
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:15,992
I know nothing I say to you now matters.

453
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:21,113
Let's break up.

454
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:46,200
(Scrapbook)

455
00:27:20,593 --> 00:27:22,472
(I chase success and fame.)

456
00:27:22,512 --> 00:27:24,312
(I want to go to Shanghai.
What's wrong?)

457
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,272
(When you and Zheng Decheng
blocked my article,)

458
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:29,032
(weren't you after fame and fortune?)

459
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:30,673
(I think)

460
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:34,584
(sacrificing Yuehai to make the nation
think Reform and Opening-up is worthy.)

461
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:35,864
(Can't you drop the hypocrisy?)

462
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:36,873
(Can you be real?)

463
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,752
(Yuehai Town People's Government)

464
00:27:55,113 --> 00:27:55,752
Mr. Zheng!

465
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:58,992
Ms. Li, they are taking Mr. Zheng away.

466
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:00,888
What's wrong?

467
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:02,193
You are Ms. Li?

468
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:02,893
Yes.

469
00:28:03,312 --> 00:28:04,312
Let me introduce myself.

470
00:28:04,472 --> 00:28:06,072
I'm Liu Weimin from the Municipal DIC,

471
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:07,873
the head of this investigation team.

472
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:09,552
We are now asking Zheng Decheng

473
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:10,913
to accept our investigation.

474
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:13,072
Please also notify all Yuehai cadres

475
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:14,193
to remain

476
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:16,472
in Yuehai Town at all times
during the investigation.

477
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:19,072
And we will temporarily freeze
all of Yuehai Town's accounts.

478
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:19,752
Take a look.

479
00:28:23,272 --> 00:28:24,393
Any other questions?

480
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:26,032
You can't freeze these accounts.

481
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:27,512
They must be frozen.

482
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:29,232
This protects the people's property.

483
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:31,393
I'd like to ask

484
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,393
what specific issues are being
investigated regarding Mr. Zheng?

485
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:37,393
No comment.

486
00:28:38,232 --> 00:28:38,732
Ms. Li,

487
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:39,873
with accounts frozen,

488
00:28:39,953 --> 00:28:41,240
how can I continue the project?

489
00:28:41,673 --> 00:28:42,472
Enough!

490
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,873
All of you, calm down.

491
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:46,593
We must cooperate fully
with the investigation.

492
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,272
While I'm away,

493
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:49,272
all Yuehai matters

494
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:51,413
will be directed by Ms. Li, alright?

495
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:52,292
That's it.

496
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,953
(Due to Du Tao's report
and the public's whistleblower letters,)

497
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:12,792
(to avoid wrongly accusing any cadre,)

498
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:15,833
(the city and county
formed a joint investigation team.)

499
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:17,593
(They took Zheng Decheng.)

500
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:19,312
(Yuehai)

501
00:29:19,873 --> 00:29:22,072
(was plunged
into an unprecedented crisis.)

502
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:23,312
It's over.

503
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:24,153
Bad news!

504
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:25,752
Listen, something's happened!

505
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,113
Taken by people from the city!

506
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:28,953
Be clear! Who took him away?

507
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:29,633
Mr. Zheng

508
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:31,472
was taken away by the Municipal DIC.

509
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:33,512
What?

510
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:35,393
The Municipal DIC?

511
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:36,873
Yes! People from the Municipal DIC.

512
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:37,992
No.

513
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,512
Was Mr. Zheng taken alone?

514
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:40,633
Or were there others?

515
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:41,913
Here's the thing.

516
00:29:42,232 --> 00:29:43,353
The others aren't important.

517
00:29:43,353 --> 00:29:44,633
What's important now?

518
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:46,712
The government's accounts are frozen!

519
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:47,453
What?

520
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,152
What did you say?

521
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:48,792
Accounts frozen?

522
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:49,712
Yes! They are frozen.

523
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:51,312
So is the industrial park happening?

524
00:29:51,512 --> 00:29:52,673
Happening what?

525
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:53,752
Accounts frozen means

526
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,113
Yuehai's government can't move
a single cent in or out now.

527
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:58,424
Can the industrial park function?

528
00:29:58,673 --> 00:29:59,992
I've ordered the machinery.

529
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:02,953
If the industrial park can't function,

530
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:04,312
what happens to my loan?

531
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:05,633
Maybe pay me back first?

532
00:30:05,712 --> 00:30:08,193
How... How can I pay you back?

533
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:09,393
You ask me? Who do I ask?

534
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:10,072
- Enough.
- You can't...

535
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:11,032
Stop talking.

536
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,312
Yours is loans? What about mine?

537
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:15,072
Mine was real silver and gold,
put up bit by bit!

538
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,232
Mr. Qian, you have a call.

539
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:19,193
For me?

540
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:20,012
Yes.

541
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:22,032
Are you sure it's for me?

542
00:30:23,992 --> 00:30:25,472
Why would a call for me come here?

543
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,133
Hello?

544
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:33,816
I'm Qian Changyuan.

545
00:30:33,993 --> 00:30:34,648
Who is this?

546
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:40,633
Hello, sir.

547
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:41,633
What's the name?

548
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:42,873
Anyway, two cars.

549
00:30:42,873 --> 00:30:43,673
Two cars in total.

550
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:44,433
How many people?

551
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:45,153
Let me think.

552
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:46,393
1, 2... And the drivers.

553
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,992
Well, I need to go out.

554
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:49,613
Where to?

555
00:30:50,393 --> 00:30:52,833
The investigators want to talk to me.

556
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,488
What? Why do they talk to you?

557
00:30:56,673 --> 00:30:57,272
What did I say?

558
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:59,032
- It's starting.
- Wait.

559
00:30:59,032 --> 00:31:00,312
- Listen.
- Why are they

560
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:01,433
investigating him?

561
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:02,992
What do you know?

562
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:04,792
The investigators come here now

563
00:31:05,153 --> 00:31:07,373
just to sound things out, right?

564
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:10,593
I think,

565
00:31:11,232 --> 00:31:13,873
this time, Mr. Zheng
is really in trouble.

566
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:15,552
Nonsense!

567
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:17,552
You didn't read the papers?

568
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:20,193
The whole nation
is cracking down on corruption.

569
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,953
Several have already been caught
in other provinces.

570
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:28,992
I'm telling you.

571
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:30,873
Mr. Zheng is not here.

572
00:31:31,032 --> 00:31:32,312
I just want to check things out.

573
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:33,673
All of you, go back.

574
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:36,833
Mr. Xie, handle this.

575
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:37,653
Okay.

576
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:39,032
Okay, I'll handle it.

577
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:41,032
You can interview him
when he gets back, right?

578
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:41,712
A leader is here.

579
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:42,673
Mr. Zheng, are you in?

580
00:31:42,673 --> 00:31:44,272
- Quiet!
- I saw you inside.

581
00:31:51,393 --> 00:31:52,032
(What is this?)

582
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:53,720
How do I put this?

583
00:31:54,424 --> 00:31:55,312
It's my life's work.

584
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:58,752
Entrusting something
this important to me?

585
00:32:00,032 --> 00:32:00,833
Is it appropriate?

586
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:02,512
Yes.

587
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:05,106
(Town Mayor's Office)

588
00:32:16,072 --> 00:32:16,593
(If)

589
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:19,512
I really don't come back,

590
00:32:21,593 --> 00:32:22,232
burn it.

591
00:32:24,953 --> 00:32:26,153
What is this, Mr. Zheng?

592
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,472
Don't betray my trust.

593
00:32:34,226 --> 00:32:37,108
(People Build Their City,
and the City Serves Its People)

594
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:40,752
No cooperation? Fine!
What's the big deal?

595
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:42,312
Seriously!

596
00:32:46,593 --> 00:32:47,992
The news spread way too fast.

597
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:50,272
From six until now, how long is that?

598
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:52,673
I've already gotten calls
from three partners.

599
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:54,673
They heard Yuehai had problems

600
00:32:55,128 --> 00:32:56,472
and want out of the contract.

601
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,353
Three? That's nothing.

602
00:33:00,193 --> 00:33:02,472
I've taken seven calls canceling orders.

603
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:06,512
When elephants fight,
the grass gets trampled.

604
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,673
Xuemei, say something.

605
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:14,833
We all took out loans
to start these factories.

606
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:17,433
We have to pay interest every day.

607
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:21,833
Where's Dog? Dog!

608
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:24,792
I drank you out of booze.
I'll drink your most expensive stuff.

609
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:26,552
But I don't have money to pay you now!

610
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:28,113
I owe you, okay?

611
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:29,512
Skip the math. Come.

612
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:31,272
Let's go! Drink!

613
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:32,933
Drink! Let's go! Stop calling!

614
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:34,833
Go! Drink! Come on!

615
00:33:35,032 --> 00:33:36,873
Xuemei, forget the math, okay?

616
00:33:36,992 --> 00:33:37,833
Forget it! Come on!

617
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:39,833
Let's drink! Come on!

618
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:41,312
I bought it.

619
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,893
This round is on me, okay?

620
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:44,873
Come on. Get glasses. Come on.

621
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:46,433
Come on. Let's drink.

622
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:50,673
You're drinking at this moment?

623
00:33:55,393 --> 00:33:55,893
I...

624
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:57,552
What's wrong with drinking?

625
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:00,193
We all invested together.
Can't we drink together?

626
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:04,353
I put every penny I had into this.

627
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:06,393
I didn't save a single cent.

628
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,072
It wasn't easy for me.

629
00:34:08,353 --> 00:34:09,433
Like you're the only one?

630
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:12,152
Who here hasn't
put everything on the line

631
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:13,672
for this industrial park?

632
00:34:13,913 --> 00:34:14,672
Who had it easy?

633
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:24,032
I think

634
00:34:24,913 --> 00:34:28,472
we must stop construction
on this industrial park right now.

635
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:31,992
Why looking at me?

636
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:33,152
You fool.

637
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:36,273
Let me tell you.

638
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:41,472
Why did we start building
this industrial park

639
00:34:43,793 --> 00:34:45,032
and the new factories?

640
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:46,953
Wasn't it to make money?

641
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:50,192
Now, look!

642
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:52,753
Mr. Zheng has been arrested.

643
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:54,873
How to make money?

644
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:56,433
How?

645
00:34:56,793 --> 00:34:58,512
Yuehai is about to change.

646
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:02,152
I think our first step

647
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:03,992
is to take whatever money we have now

648
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:06,273
and return it to the bank.

649
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,072
Second,

650
00:35:08,913 --> 00:35:11,092
go and return the land
for the industrial park.

651
00:35:11,753 --> 00:35:12,953
Just swallow the loss.

652
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:16,600
In these special times, we must cut
our losses to save the bigger picture.

653
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:18,192
Okay.

654
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:21,393
I agree to stop it for now.

655
00:35:21,793 --> 00:35:24,088
We should wait for confirmation
from Mr. Zheng

656
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,048
before constructing.

657
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:27,273
Otherwise, we're really finished.

658
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:41,152
Disperse for now.

659
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:44,512
Give me some time.
I'll figure something out.

660
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:07,092
Mr. Liu.

661
00:36:09,873 --> 00:36:10,383
Mr. Liu!

662
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:11,512
You're finally here.

663
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,512
Great! Come on. Have a seat.

664
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,072
Let's hurry up and investigate.

665
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:22,393
I'm sorry. Come on. Please sit here.

666
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:27,032
I don't have many other strengths.

667
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,672
But I'm highly cooperative.

668
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:32,433
I guess you want to ask
about the city construction fee?

669
00:36:32,753 --> 00:36:33,512
I'll confess.

670
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:37,313
At that time, there was less
than a week left before Yuehai's launch.

671
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:39,112
Honestly, it was quite

672
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:40,713
a dark and windy night.

673
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,793
Zheng Decheng.

674
00:36:42,072 --> 00:36:44,433
Please put away
this liberal attitude of yours.

675
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:45,713
If you are cooperative

676
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,233
as you claim to be,

677
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,672
please follow the rules here.

678
00:36:49,953 --> 00:36:51,953
That means I ask, and you answer.

679
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:53,433
Understood?

680
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:54,992
No problem at all.

681
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,953
Mr. Liu Weimin
from the Municipal DIC, ask away.

682
00:37:01,192 --> 00:37:02,512
What is your monthly salary?

683
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:03,313
118.

684
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:06,512
How about that?
It's a lucky number, right?

685
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:11,433
So you want to investigate
my financial matters?

686
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:13,072
That won't be a problem.

687
00:37:13,353 --> 00:37:13,992
As for money,

688
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:16,793
I absolutely can't have any issues.

689
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:18,753
Ask and investigate whatever you want.

690
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:19,953
I'm totally clean.

691
00:37:20,592 --> 00:37:21,112
Is that so?

692
00:37:26,353 --> 00:37:26,992
Mr. Liu,

693
00:37:28,472 --> 00:37:29,233
I think

694
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:32,273
you could spend more time reading books.

695
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:34,592
Study Das Kapital.

696
00:37:34,992 --> 00:37:37,953
Get clear on what productive forces
and relations of production are.

697
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:41,472
Since Yuehai's city construction,
I've been begging others for help.

698
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:43,972
Why would anyone give me money, right?

699
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:45,072
That makes no sense.

700
00:37:45,433 --> 00:37:47,953
So, financially, I absolutely
can't have any issues.

701
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:49,552
Then why did we receive reports

702
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:51,273
that you own multiple properties there?

703
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:53,992
And these properties aren't registered
under Zheng Decheng,

704
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,112
but Secretary Zheng.

705
00:37:56,433 --> 00:37:57,192
What's going on?

706
00:37:57,873 --> 00:37:58,873
That's impossible.

707
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:00,793
I'm up to my neck in debt.

708
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,873
How could I have money to own houses?

709
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:06,913
Zheng Decheng.

710
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,192
Since 1981,

711
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:10,592
I have

712
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,032
investigated nine cases.

713
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:14,992
These nine cases
were completely unrelated.

714
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,873
But one thing was the same
for all of them.

715
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:20,612
What was it?

716
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:22,393
All of them, at the very beginning,

717
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,273
when undergoing my review, told me

718
00:38:24,873 --> 00:38:27,480
that they had no problems
and could definitely withstand scrutiny.

719
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:30,552
Yet in the end,
I still uncovered problems.

720
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,353
So, Zheng Decheng,

721
00:38:32,672 --> 00:38:35,873
I hope you will be
the first exception in my work.

722
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:42,512
Hey, what's going on here?

723
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:44,632
Why is there no one on the site?

724
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,953
I just got back. I know it clearly.

725
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:52,273
The workers heard the government's
accounts are frozen. There's no money.

726
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:53,313
They all ran off.

727
00:38:53,672 --> 00:38:54,833
So what are you doing?

728
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:56,313
Aren't they under your watch?

729
00:38:57,672 --> 00:38:58,713
Isn't this on you?

730
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:00,433
How can I handle it without money?

731
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,753
Workers need to eat too!
No money, no management!

732
00:39:02,753 --> 00:39:03,704
What's that attitude?

733
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:04,333
You...

734
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:06,713
What awful manners!

735
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,012
Don't touch it. It's for me.

736
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:25,213
Hello?

737
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,024
Mr. Wang, I was just about to call you.

738
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:29,933
Go on.

739
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:30,532
Yes.

740
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:31,753
Yes. Listen.

741
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:33,112
Mr. Zheng will be fine.

742
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:35,472
This temporary situation
will pass quickly.

743
00:39:37,688 --> 00:39:38,712
The accounts are frozen.

744
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:39,933
But...

745
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:41,953
How about this? Let's meet and talk.

746
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:43,333
Hard to explain here, right?

747
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:44,552
Super Dog Restaurant, right?

748
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:45,992
Let's set a time. Meet...

749
00:39:47,233 --> 00:39:48,273
Who are you?

750
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:50,472
Are you even human?

751
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:52,992
What were you like
when Mr. Zheng was fine?

752
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:55,472
He isn't in trouble even now.

753
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,032
What kind of fool are you?

754
00:39:57,913 --> 00:39:59,472
Who are you? I'm asking you.

755
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:04,953
I was just letting off steam.
He hung up ages ago.

756
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,313
Well... Xie. Lin.

757
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:12,833
I think we should calm down first.

758
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:13,713
Don't panic.

759
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:16,353
I think that very soon,

760
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:18,672
the investigators
will talk to us individually.

761
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:19,833
I mean,

762
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:21,992
when we answer their questions,

763
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:23,552
we should just stick to the facts.

764
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,793
Don't add our own opinions.

765
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:26,773
Don't cause unnecessary trouble, right?

766
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:27,793
You think I don't know?

767
00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:29,393
Tan, do you have any money?

768
00:40:29,632 --> 00:40:31,393
With accounts frozen,
how could I have money?

769
00:40:31,393 --> 00:40:34,083
Mr. Wang said the money has to be paid
the day after tomorrow.

770
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:37,632
If we don't pay the Power Supply Bureau,
they'll cut Yuehai's power.

771
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:40,873
The workers also said they won't work
until they get their wages.

772
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:41,992
The site is empty now.

773
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,833
Yelling at Tan is useless.
It's not his fault, right?

774
00:40:44,873 --> 00:40:45,793
Should I yell at you?

775
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:46,512
Go ahead.

776
00:40:46,753 --> 00:40:47,953
You'll have the money if I do?

777
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:49,592
L-Let's control our emotions, okay?

778
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:50,552
Control it.

779
00:40:50,793 --> 00:40:53,072
Mr. Zheng isn't here right now.
We should be more united.

780
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:55,953
We need to figure out a solution
to this problem as soon as possible.

781
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,833
For example, could we approach
some self-employed individuals?

782
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,833
W-We could discuss it.

783
00:40:59,953 --> 00:41:01,552
See if they can lend us some money.

784
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:04,172
Help us get
through the current difficulty, right?

785
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:08,992
For example, Xie,
could you talk to Ms. Gao?

786
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:13,393
I'm sorry.

787
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:16,552
What do you mean?

788
00:41:17,512 --> 00:41:18,592
What do you want, Tan?

789
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:20,393
No, Xie, I really didn't mean it.

790
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:21,528
- I...
- If I had money,

791
00:41:21,528 --> 00:41:23,192
would I even ask you for it? Am I crazy?

792
00:41:23,353 --> 00:41:24,992
I'm sorry. I panicked just now.

793
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,192
I was thinking of a solution.

794
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:27,472
It just slipped out. I...

795
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:28,273
Sit down.

796
00:41:28,273 --> 00:41:29,233
Just sit down.

797
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:30,953
No matter what,

798
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:32,953
this road must be built.

799
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:34,793
When Mr. Zheng left,

800
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:36,873
he didn't say
to stop construction, did he?

801
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:38,072
Go find him then.

802
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:39,072
Talk to him properly.

803
00:41:39,672 --> 00:41:41,273
He said "as usual" when he left, right?

804
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,132
Yes.

805
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,032
What is "as usual"?

806
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:43,692
Yes.

807
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:45,112
Lin, "as usual".

808
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:46,032
I don't know you,

809
00:41:46,032 --> 00:41:46,672
but I think

810
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:48,753
we should try our best
to keep the daily work.

811
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:49,512
Make it...

812
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:50,833
What does "as usual" mean?

813
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:52,112
It means we can't stop!

814
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:53,552
Will I be blamed when he's back?

815
00:41:53,753 --> 00:41:54,913
Enough! Stop arguing!

816
00:41:55,592 --> 00:41:56,353
If I had money,

817
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:57,472
I could access it, right?

818
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,873
Mr. Zheng, when are you coming back?

819
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:01,192
Look at your people.

820
00:42:01,512 --> 00:42:02,953
Look at this mess! All chaos!

821
00:42:03,393 --> 00:42:04,032
Come back now.

822
00:42:04,532 --> 00:42:06,360
Xie, stop being sarcastic, okay?

823
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,512
I don't want it this way.

824
00:42:14,273 --> 00:42:18,273
Small families are like that,
and big families like this.

825
00:42:20,594 --> 00:42:23,170
(Town Mayor's Office)

826
00:42:38,913 --> 00:42:40,632
Hello? Mr. Xia?

827
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,448
Here's the thing.

828
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,833
Yuehai's accounts have been frozen
by the investigators now,

829
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:49,233
and won't be unfrozen
until the investigation is over.

830
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,873
But many projects in Yuehai
are still ongoing.

831
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:53,873
Can't stop.

832
00:42:54,393 --> 00:42:54,893
Yes.

833
00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:57,753
I'm wondering if the county
could advance Yuehai

834
00:42:58,713 --> 00:42:59,592
some funds.

835
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:01,632
