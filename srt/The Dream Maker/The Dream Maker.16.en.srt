Just a moment.

00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:54,267
Ms. Lin, today I finally get to see

24
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:55,706
what Yuehai speed is like.

25
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:56,627
Mr. Zhang,

26
00:01:56,946 --> 00:01:58,946
as long as you're in Yuehai,
we're family.

27
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:01,066
We'll develop and accelerate together.

28
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,107
Right.

29
00:02:02,907 --> 00:02:05,027
Everything's settled. Let everyone in.

30
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:08,306

00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,146

00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:10,827
Greet him.

33
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,706
- Hello, Mr. Zhang.
- Hello, Mr. Zhang.

34
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:14,507
Good.

35
00:02:15,146 --> 00:02:16,906
These lads all look full of spirit.

36
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:18,706
All start at the factory tomorrow.

37
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:19,667
- Okay.
- Okay.

38
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,227
Then, Ms. Lin,
I won't trouble you further.

39
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:22,987
I'm leaving.

40
00:02:22,987 --> 00:02:24,067
- Bye.
- Bye.

41
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:24,667
Have a smoke.

42
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,466
Let's go for a drink.

00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,227

44
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:28,267
Look at my camera.

45
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,026
Have a smoke.

46
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:29,586
Come on.

47
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,507
Xiaohai, come here.

49
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:35,306
Take these fruits back to your grandma.

50
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,466
No need.

51
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:37,426
Take them.

52
00:02:37,626 --> 00:02:38,426
Really no need.

53
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:39,866
Take them to your grandma.

54
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:40,366
Really, no.

55
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:41,267
Just take them.

56
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:42,787
What's going on here?

57
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:49,306
Xiaohai's grandma loves apples.

58
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,267
Is his family facing difficulties?

59
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,387
No. His family is well-off.

60
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:56,906
No difficulties at all.

61
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:29,667
Ma'am, excuse me.

62
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,547
Is Yang Xiaohai's home in here?

63
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:35,987
Up the steps.

64
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:40,827
Thank you.

65
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:07,987
Sir,

66
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,586
do you know
where Yang Xiaohai's home is?

67
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:18,266
Thank you.

68
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:25,626
Excuse me, is this Yang Xiaohai's home?

69
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:28,027
Yes, come in.

70
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:40,347
I'm Xiaohai's grandma. Who are you?

71
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:44,987
I'm Li Qiuping, mayor of Yuehai.

72
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:49,227
Ms. Lin, my legs aren't so good.

73
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:50,987
Hope you don't mind.

74
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:53,107
It's fine.

75
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:55,826
I bought these things for you.

76
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:57,787
I'll put them here.

77
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,147
Thank you.

78
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:01,926
Have a seat.

79
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:02,787
Okay.

80
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:04,907
(Academician Gu presented
prepared salt prescription.)

81
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,147
(The emperor approved it.)

82
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:08,907
(The Ministry of Rites
demands we prepare the medicine.)

83
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:13,186
(By taking this medicine,)

84
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:16,186
(even an eighty-year-old
will turn into a young man.)

85
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:24,506
Are you the official mayor?

86
00:05:25,186 --> 00:05:26,946
Yes, I'm the official mayor.

87
00:05:27,587 --> 00:05:28,626
Just call me Qiuping.

88
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,306
(We must act immediately.)

89
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:32,547
You're impressive.

90
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:34,987
(Nothing else?)

91
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:36,746
(Let's adjourn.)

92
00:05:38,787 --> 00:05:41,147
Grandma, how long have you lived here?

93
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,587
Can't remember.

94
00:05:48,386 --> 00:05:50,147
(I have another petition.)

95
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:57,866
The TV has no signal.

96
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,467
A few taps will help.

97
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:02,587
Let me help.

98
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:08,746
It's working.

99
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:11,218
(It's not like it's something urgent.)

100
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:15,018
(Well, it is in this Imperial Academy
of Medicine.)

101
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:18,712
(The Materia Medica
hasn't been revised in centuries.)

102
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,547
I love Zhao Dan's movies.

103
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,170
(You make it sound like)

104
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,170
(the old Materia Medica is now useless.)

105
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,987
I despise this underreporting
and concealment.

106
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:33,746
Yesterday, I asked if the villagers
were facing any difficulties.

107
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,266
You said no.
You both claimed there were none.

108
00:06:36,547 --> 00:06:38,266
If I hadn't come to see
for myself today,

109
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:40,826
I'd never know
Yuehai had such impoverished families.

110
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,826
How can you village cadres
sleep at night?

111
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:45,347
M-Ms. Lin,

112
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:48,107
Yang Village does have its difficulties.

113
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:51,266
There are more families like Xiaohai's.

114
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,107
We can't help them all.

115
00:06:53,306 --> 00:06:53,946
Yes.

116
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:56,386
If you can't help them,
you should've told us.

117
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,186
Is it that you can't,
or that you don't want to?

118
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:00,787
- We want to.
- We want to.

119
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:02,186
First in line for credit,

120
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:04,066
but last in line when people need help.

121
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,467
Is this how village cadres should act?

122
00:07:12,787 --> 00:07:13,746
How many households?

123
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:17,587
W-What households?

124
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:18,506
Stop playing dumb?

125
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,467
How many households are there
in total like Yang Xiaohai's family?

126
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:26,347
T-Ten households.

127
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:28,266
There are ten.

128
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,107
There are ten.

129
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,426
Yes, ten households.

130
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:35,446
Okay.

131
00:07:35,626 --> 00:07:38,626
Write down the specific details
of these households for me.

132
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:40,066
Okay, right away.

135
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,107
Mr. Zheng,

136
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,506
they're the ten poorest families
in Yang Village.

137
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:42,827
I've decided

138
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:45,626
to allocate a fixed portion

139
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:49,026
from the town's monthly budget
as special hardship relief funds

140
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:50,746
and distribute it to these households.

141
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,506
Okay.

142
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,107
I've already sent Meng and Yu
to Yang Village.

143
00:08:54,386 --> 00:08:55,307
Du Tao will go too.

144
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:58,666
Excellent. That's very thorough.

145
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:01,506
Later, discuss a specific amount
with Mr. Tan.

146
00:09:01,786 --> 00:09:02,587
I'll sign off on it.

147
00:09:02,947 --> 00:09:03,447
Alright?

148
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:03,967
Okay.

149
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:08,707
Also, Granny Yang's place needs repairs.

150
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:10,947
I'll handle that.

151
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:13,067
Okay, it's in your hands.

152
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:16,987
Mr. Zheng. Ms. Li.

153
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:18,947
We've helped clean

154
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,666
the ten impoverished households' places.

155
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,107
We also got them

156
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,386
some new daily necessities
and furniture. Rest assured.

157
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:26,146
After Du took the photos,

158
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:28,067
we followed your instructions, Ms. Li,

159
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:29,666
and met every cadre...

160
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:30,607
Mr. Zheng.

161
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:33,746
Mr. Zheng, am I that scary?

162
00:09:33,827 --> 00:09:34,506
Mr. Zheng.

163
00:09:36,246 --> 00:09:36,746
Well...

164
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:38,266
You must let me interview you today.

165
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:39,906
I checked with Qiuping.

166
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,386
You have no meetings
or work scheduled this afternoon.

167
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:45,146
Mr. Du,

168
00:09:45,587 --> 00:09:48,187
it's not that I don't want
to be interviewed.

169
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:49,746
Talking is fine.

170
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:51,866
I'm just a bit camera-shy.

171
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,227
That's minor.
As long as you're not shy of me.

172
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:56,746
Besides, you're Yuehai's top leader.

173
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:57,947
If I don't interview you,

174
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:00,227
I'll fail my assignment
for the newspaper.

175
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,746
Well, I can't let you
fail your assignment.

176
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:04,526
Alright.

177
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,847
I'll speak freely
and hold nothing back, okay?

178
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:08,366
Great.

179
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:09,947
Is that enough?

180
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:11,187
Plenty. Don't waste it.

181
00:10:12,107 --> 00:10:14,107
Later, I set a deadline for them.

182
00:10:14,386 --> 00:10:16,707
Then everyone showed up.

183
00:10:18,506 --> 00:10:20,107
Mr. Du, you must be hungry?

184
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:21,266
Go ahead and eat.

185
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:21,967
Okay.

186
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:23,107
I have much to do later.

187
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:24,727
Eat.

188
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:25,347
Okay.

189
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,587
Mr. Zheng, you eat first.

190
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:44,866
Well, Mr. Zheng,
could you just relax a bit?

191
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:47,666
I am quite relaxed.

192
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:49,707
Just eat normally.

193
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,827
This is me eating normally.

194
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,386
Mr. Zheng, aren't you stiff?

195
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,947
You haven't turned the page
in ten minutes.

196
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:01,707
Really?

197
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:08,546
Just relax a little.

198
00:11:22,146 --> 00:11:23,827
Mr. Lin, could you stop for a moment?

199
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:27,386
Mr. Lin, I'd like to ask a favor.

200
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,227
Go ahead.

201
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:29,746
These past few days,

202
00:11:29,947 --> 00:11:31,786
I've been interviewing Mr. Zheng.

203
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:33,587
Mr. Zheng is very eloquent,

204
00:11:33,707 --> 00:11:34,947
but he really is camera-shy.

205
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:36,866
I took many photos of him.

206
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:38,067
I was wondering if I could

207
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:40,146
borrow your darkroom
to sort through these photos?

208
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:44,506
Sure.

209
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:45,386
No problem.

210
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,166
Great.

211
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:46,866
Thank you.

212
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:48,406
I'll let you get back to work.

213
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,144
(Please use it freely)

214
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,707
Mr. Lin.

215
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,307
Where is he?

216
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:47,906
Did he go to the construction site?

217
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:50,987
Possibly.

218
00:13:53,987 --> 00:13:55,026
Please use it freely.

219
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:59,026
But why isn't there a single photo
in Mr. Lin's darkroom?

220
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,506
Probably too busy with the site lately.
No time for photos.

221
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,347
Okay, let's develop the photos first.

222
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,707
Qiuping, close the door for me.

223
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,587
When was this taken?

224
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:31,707
Your skills are pretty good.

225
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,626
The day we visited the morning market.

226
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:36,746
My photography skills are average,
second best globally.

227
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:38,866
If Mr. Lin had half your thick skin,

228
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:40,307
his love life would be settled.

229
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:41,947
I think he's fine as he is.

230
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:42,746
Many girls

231
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,067
might actually like his style.

232
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,546
Qiuping, I want to show you something.

233
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,347
What is it?

234
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,427
What is it? Why all the mystery?

235
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,546
Just look at it.

236
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:21,944
Land use certificate?

237
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:25,026
(Land Use Certificate)

238
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:26,146
When did this happen?

239
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:27,386
Just a few days ago.

240
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:30,187
Interviewing Mr. Zheng,
I saw cadres returning land allocations.

241
00:15:30,427 --> 00:15:32,187
So I seized the opportunity
to get a bargain.

242
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:37,626
Where did you get the money?

243
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:40,347
I saved some myself
and asked my family for the rest.

244
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:41,866
They fully supported me.

245
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:46,866
Qiuping,

246
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,386
during my time working in Yuehai,

247
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:53,026
I've genuinely come to love this place.

248
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:54,746
I thought

249
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:57,067
my Yuehai column might only last a year,

250
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:59,026
but as long as you work here,

251
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:01,107
my connection with Yuehai will last.

252
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:02,506
So I felt

253
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:04,866
that building our own home here

254
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,107
would be wonderful.

255
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:41,266
I... I didn't finish my work.

256
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,947
You two carry on.

257
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,386
Welcome home.

258
00:16:56,386 --> 00:16:58,506
Cross this line, and it's our home.

259
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:01,947
Later, we'll put a shoe cabinet here
for you.

260
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:03,347
This area is spacious.

261
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,346
How about we make it a living room?

262
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:07,086
Okay.

263
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,867
This area will be our bedroom.

264
00:17:10,147 --> 00:17:12,627
Outside, we'll have a small yard.
I'll grow tomatoes for you.

265
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:13,786
Don't you like tomatoes?

Not dry yet?

272
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:37,227
Right.

274
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:45,467
Qiuping, let me see your hand.

275
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:48,506
What for?

276
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:51,526
Open your hand wider. Wider.

277
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:52,467
- What?
- Wider.

278
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:53,786
There seems to be a spot...

279
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:55,066
What?

280
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,066
What's that?

281
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,627
To make a print here.

282
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:02,506
See? I'll make one too.

283
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:06,707
There. This will be our home.

284
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:07,546
With the marks.

285
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:09,667
Then you should've pressed deeper.

286
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,407
Press deeper? Okay.

287
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:12,427
Alright.

288
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:18,066
You two are so romantic.

289
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:24,147
Meng, do you need something?

290
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,427
No, nothing.

291
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:27,786
Wait, yes, there is something.

292
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:28,606
Well,

293
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:30,987
Mr. Du, your newspaper office needs you.

294
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:32,227
They want you back now.

295
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:35,766
Okay.

296
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,106
Xiao,

297
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:39,867
we've done all we can.
There's nothing else I can do.

298
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:42,947
But you can't dump
all the pressure on us.

299
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:44,346
Then what do you suggest?

300
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:45,447
I...

301
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:46,286
Just...

302
00:18:46,506 --> 00:18:47,786
You're asking me?

303
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:49,667
Come in.

304
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:52,826
Editor Xiao.

305
00:18:54,506 --> 00:18:55,106
Chief Wang,

306
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:58,147
it was you who requested
extra newspaper copies, right?

307
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,707
Now that sales aren't rising,
you come to blame us?

308
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:03,987
Yes, we did ask for extra copies.

309
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:05,707
Because initially,

310
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,467
your Yuehai column
was extremely well-received.

311
00:19:09,187 --> 00:19:11,586
But the last two issues
haven't sold at all.

312
00:19:12,227 --> 00:19:13,106
Hear that, Du?

313
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:14,667
Chief Wang made it clear.

314
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,707
At first, the articles were excellent,
so sales soared.

315
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,106
What's with these last two?

316
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:20,467
Chief Wang,

317
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:21,627
if the sales are bad...

318
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:23,707
Enough. Don't explain. See for yourself.

319
00:19:26,187 --> 00:19:28,427
A few hardworking deputy mayors.

320
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:30,707
A constantly improving Binhai Road.

321
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:31,826
Du,

322
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:34,746
did I set my expectations
for you too high?

323
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:37,707
Liu,

324
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,786
look at your layout. What's going on?

325
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:42,467
Conducting symmetry experiments?

326
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:44,667
And you, Zhao.

327
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,346
Can't you screen Du Tao's articles
for issues?

328
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:49,867
One newspaper has so many articles.

329
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:51,667
Couldn't you curate them better?

330
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:54,467
Editor Xiao, I think maybe we should...

331
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,026
Enough. Let's call it a day.

332
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,387
Listen up.

333
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,586
If the next issue's sales don't improve,

334
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,306
then we'll have to shut down
the Yuehai Column.

335
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:10,707
Let's go.

336
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,306
Du, wait a moment.

337
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:21,947
Editor Xiao.

338
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:27,187
I was a bit harsh earlier.

339
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,227
But you know I had to show
some resolve to Distribution.

340
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:33,546
Yes, I understand.

341
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:37,227
Du,

342
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:41,506
back then you said
Yuehai was a journalistic goldmine.

343
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:44,106
That's why I approved your column.

344
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:48,187
You need to realize,

345
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:50,947
at your age and experience level,

346
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:53,546
this is an incredibly rare opportunity.

347
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,306
So many eyes
are watching you from behind.

348
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:59,707
If you don't deliver results,
how will you earn their respect?

349
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:01,727
Understood.

350
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:03,586
Step up your game.

351
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:08,867
Editor Xiao, I'm already working
on the topical piece with news value.

352
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:10,467
I'll rush out

353
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,707
a couple of drafts for you to review.

354
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:14,506
One week.

355
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,467
You have one week.

356
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:18,967
Okay.

357
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,427
I guarantee I'll finish within a week.

361
00:23:06,266 --> 00:23:06,766
Mr. Zheng.

362
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:07,447
Mr. Du.

363
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:10,506
If you're not too busy, could you please
review these two articles

364
00:23:10,506 --> 00:23:11,826
and then stamp them for me?

365
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,026
Of course.

366
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:15,627
You are...

367
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,586
I came here in such a hurry.
Sorry about that.

368
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:20,546
If it's convenient,
could you please take a quick look?

369
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:22,387
I need to send the articles
to the newspaper.

370
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:23,867
No problem.

371
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:28,066
Mr. Du, am I really that hard
to write about?

372
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:31,667
Look at you. Your hair's all messy
from staying up late.

373
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:35,187
No, it has nothing to do with you.

374
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:36,907
I was struggling to write them.

375
00:23:38,066 --> 00:23:38,667
I mean,

376
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:39,864
articles about me...

377
00:23:40,147 --> 00:23:41,947
I feel a bit awkward
looking at them myself.

378
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,824
Honestly, it might be improper
for me to review them.

379
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,746
Ms. Li, perfect timing.

380
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:49,627
They're articles about me.

381
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:50,887
Me reviewing them is improper.

382
00:23:51,467 --> 00:23:52,586
Could you review them?

383
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:55,227
You pulled an all-nighter?

384
00:23:55,987 --> 00:23:57,066
It's fine. I'm okay.

385
00:23:57,387 --> 00:24:00,026
Qiuping, could you please
take a quick look?

386
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,427
I need to get back to the paper.

387
00:24:01,586 --> 00:24:02,086
Okay.

388
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:03,867
I made the tea for you.

389
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:06,286
Look.

390
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:07,346
Sit and have some.

391
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:08,407
Okay.

392
00:24:24,387 --> 00:24:26,867
Ms. Lin, you don't need
to review them so closely.

393
00:24:27,786 --> 00:24:28,947
A quick review is enough.

394
00:24:29,266 --> 00:24:30,427
It's fine, even if not great.

395
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,147
If it's acceptable,
I'll just stamp them for Mr. Du.

396
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:43,227
What's wrong? Is it that bad?

397
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:44,467
Let me see.

398
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:14,826
Show me that one.

399
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:30,867
W-What's the matter? Is there a problem?

400
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:45,246
Well,

401
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,826
Mr. Zheng, I'm really pressed
for time right now.

402
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:49,387
Could you just stamp them first?

403
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:54,987
Mr. Zheng?

404
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:23,707
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

405
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:28,707
I can't stamp
these two articles for you.

406
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:31,667
You can't stamp them?

407
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:33,266
Why? What...

408
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:34,707
Is there an issue with them?

409
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:36,187
Qiuping?

410
00:26:36,467 --> 00:26:37,867
Are my articles poorly written?

411
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:39,546
If there are problems, you can tell me.

412
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:40,867
And I can fix it right now.

413
00:26:44,427 --> 00:26:44,987
Mr. Du,

414
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:47,467
the things you've written about

415
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:50,467
have never happened here in Yuehai.

416
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,407
Wait.

417
00:26:58,467 --> 00:26:59,187
They haven't?

418
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:01,867
Mr. Zheng, what do you mean
they 'haven't happened'?

419
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:02,786
Mr. Zheng,

420
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:05,147
I've been here for months now.

421
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:06,746
I've interviewed so many people.

422
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:09,746
What I wrote
matches what people here told me.

423
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:11,387
Without the city construction fee,

424
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:12,667
Yuehai couldn't have been built.

425
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:13,907
And those factories too.

426
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:16,667
Those factories have
way more than seven employees.

427
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:18,707
Which part of what I wrote
isn't factual?

428
00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:20,427
Mr. Zheng,

429
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,387
if you think my articles
are poorly written,

430
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:23,387
I can revise them, but...

431
00:27:23,387 --> 00:27:24,947
- Fine, I'll explain...
- Mr. Zheng,

432
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:26,627
won't you meet
merchants from out of town?

433
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:29,586
You go ahead.

434
00:27:33,106 --> 00:27:35,606
Yes, that's right.

435
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:39,786
Take it easy with him.

436
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,627
Mr. Zheng! Mr. Zheng!

437
00:27:45,106 --> 00:27:45,667
Du Tao,

438
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:47,627
for the current Yuehai,

439
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,786
some things can only be done,
not spoken about.

440
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:54,346
'Seven-up, eight-down'
and the construction fee are among them.

441
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:58,147
They're absolutely unfit for publication
in a newspaper like your New City Life.

442
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:00,707
Once these two articles are published,

443
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:01,947
it would be disastrous.

444
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:02,826
Disastrous?

445
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:04,546
Why is that dangerous?

446
00:28:04,546 --> 00:28:06,187
Aren't both things already in the past?

447
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:07,867
Both county and province have spoken.

448
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,187
Many policies and rules
will change over time.

449
00:28:10,227 --> 00:28:11,187
You've said it yourself.

450
00:28:11,187 --> 00:28:12,947
Many current rules
will vanish in the future.

451
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,947
But policy shifts
and the disappearance of rules

452
00:28:14,947 --> 00:28:16,227
require time.

453
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:17,907
Right now, many places

454
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:20,147
still enforce policies
like 'seven-up, eight-down.'

455
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:21,907
The city construction fee is debatable.

456
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,187
The county and province

457
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:25,867
want time to be the judge.

458
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,907
It's a form of support
and protection for us.

459
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,867
But if your articles go to print,

460
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:32,667
they will inevitably spark
widespread public attention and debate.

461
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:36,066
If someone twists the narrative
or takes things out of context,

462
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:38,586
then every single word you gathered

463
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:40,627
will turn into a heavy stone

464
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:42,947
crushing the people you interviewed.

465
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,947
Gao Xuemei's factory would be shut down.

466
00:28:45,147 --> 00:28:46,746
The workers would lose their livelihood.

467
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:49,176
Granny Yang's hope
for a better life would vanish.

468
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:52,506
For them, it'd be a devastating blow.

469
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:01,947
Du Tao,

470
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:04,467
deep down, you understand

471
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:07,346
that at this stage,

472
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:11,826
some things can only be done,
never spoken.

473
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:13,066
Right?

474
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:14,026
Qiuping,

475
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:17,106
nothing in this world is perfect.

476
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:18,707
If Yuehai wants to progress,

477
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:20,786
it must bear these costs and risks.

478
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:21,786
Yes,

479
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:25,266
but Yuehai isn't strong enough yet.

480
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:26,867
Qiuping, I understand.

481
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:27,987
I know your concerns.

482
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:30,546
I know you're worried
about Yuehai's people, right?

483
00:29:30,546 --> 00:29:32,746
But the scenarios you mentioned
are extremely unlikely.

484
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:33,592
They're 'what ifs.'

485
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:34,586
But I'm different.

486
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:37,306
I can't submit my articles
if they aren't stamped.

487
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:38,506
If I can't submit them,

488
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:40,266
the entire Yuehai column will be gone.

489
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:41,346
The whole column, gone.

490
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,066
Du Tao, as your girlfriend,

491
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:45,907
I really want to stamp them for you.

492
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,786
But as Yuehai's mayor,

493
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:51,227
I can't stamp them.

494
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:06,326
Du Tao.

495
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:07,947
Du Tao.

496
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:50,786
Darn it!

497
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,546
I finished my basket.

498
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:30,987
You scared me.

499
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:37,546
Ms. Li,

500
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:40,667
this matter has indeed put you
in a difficult spot.

501
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:41,907
I thought about it.

502
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:44,387
I'll call Mr. Du later

503
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:45,627
and explain it to him clearly.

504
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:46,467
If it fails,

505
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:48,106
I'll visit their office myself.

506
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:50,346
Mr. Zheng,

507
00:31:51,106 --> 00:31:53,387
have you considered,
even without the articles,

508
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,506
what you'll do?

509
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,627
What if there is some other reporter?

510
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:13,566
Mr. Zheng, how did it go?

511
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,066
Mr. Du went too far.

512
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:24,586
Why write about those
with so many other things to cover?

513
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:26,147
Yuehai clearly

514
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:28,467
has so many people and stories
worth reporting.

515
00:32:29,306 --> 00:32:29,987
Well,

516
00:32:30,427 --> 00:32:32,586
he is a reporter.
He sticks to the facts.

517
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:34,066
Those things did happen.

518
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:36,786
Speaking of which, I...

519
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:38,266
Mr. Zheng, I have an opinion.

520
00:32:38,907 --> 00:32:41,387
Mr. Zheng, I want to voice an opinion.

521
00:32:41,947 --> 00:32:44,627
You haven't
handled the whole thing properly.

522
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:47,427
How could you let Ms. Li face

523
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:48,427
such a problem alone?

524
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:50,867
Yes, Mr. Zheng, it's not appropriate.

525
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:52,506
Not appropriate.

526
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,667
Neither of you was there.

527
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,947
Ms. Li herself asked me to leave.

528
00:32:58,147 --> 00:32:59,384
And you just left when asked?

529
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,658
(Sanitation, Poultry)

530
00:33:12,026 --> 00:33:13,227
Yan, another bowl.

531
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:23,026
Ms. Li, that's your third bowl.

532
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:25,586
I'm such an idiot.

533
00:33:28,026 --> 00:33:28,707
What?

534
00:33:31,266 --> 00:33:32,187
I'm an idiot.

535
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:17,186
They're written so well.

536
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:21,907
They're exactly the kind of articles
Yuehai Column should have.

537
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:26,307
I believe

538
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,586
once the two articles are published,

539
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:31,626
Yuehai Column's reputation
will be firmly established.

540
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:38,287
What?

541
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:41,586
Why are you still so reserved
after receiving praise?

542
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:43,267
Let me tell you.

543
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:46,467
Excessive modesty
is also a form of pride.

544
00:34:47,347 --> 00:34:49,307
No, Editor Xiao,
you've misunderstood me.

545
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:50,626
Well,

546
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:53,666
the Yuehai Town Government
hasn't stamped my two articles.

547
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:55,787
Why?

548
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:57,787
Any problem with the facts?

549
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,467
Editor Xiao, I swear by my profession

550
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:02,626
that in my two articles,

551
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:04,066
every word written is true.

552
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:07,307
Since there's no problem with the facts,

553
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:08,747
why haven't they stamped it?

554
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:10,787
They don't deny the details.

555
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:13,867
They deny the entire fact itself.

556
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:16,867
This is simply absurd.

557
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:20,387
How can they deny something
that actually happened?

558
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:27,307
Wait.

559
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,947
Isn't your girlfriend
the mayor of Yuehai Town?

560
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:33,267
Even she denies it?

561
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:45,487
Mr. Du,

562
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:47,467
do you have proof?

563
00:35:49,186 --> 00:35:49,706
Proof?

564
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:53,226
Yes, I do.

565
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:57,747
Editor Xiao,
here's my interview summary.

566
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:00,787
Every piece of material in my article

567
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:02,626
can be corroborated
by at least three people.

568
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:04,126
Also,

569
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:06,827
this is the receipt

570
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:09,546
for the city construction fee
I paid in Yuehai.

571
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,226
And this is my land use certificate.

572
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:14,427
City construction fee?

573
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:17,467
Editor Xiao,

574
00:36:17,907 --> 00:36:20,186
I can guarantee
that in these two articles,

575
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:21,506
everything written is solid fact.

576
00:36:21,787 --> 00:36:23,546
They're common knowledge
throughout Yuehai

577
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:25,427
against any investigation
and verification.

578
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:27,347
I understand.

579
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:29,987
If the content is accurate,

580
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:33,066
we don't necessarily need
their approval to print the articles.

581
00:36:35,347 --> 00:36:36,706
I'll handle this matter.

582
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:41,006
Mr. Qian, look.

583
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:44,347
With one command,
it prints ten thousand copies per hour.

584
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,106
The speed is incredibly fast.

585
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,747
Not only is it fast,

586
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,827
but it also uses half the electricity
of other printers.

587
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,066
Not bad.

588
00:36:58,427 --> 00:36:59,226
(Printing Pioneer)
Not bad at all.

589
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,347
Here, sir, have a smoke.

590
00:37:04,226 --> 00:37:05,146
Forgot where we are.

591
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:06,747
Let's smoke outside.

592
00:37:07,427 --> 00:37:07,927
Thank you.

593
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:08,826
How about this?

594
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:11,827
Give me a set

595
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,747
of the pictures and information
of this printer.

596
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:15,287
I'll take it

597
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,787
to show the printery owners.

598
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:18,626
No problem.

599
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:27,307
Good.

600
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,467
It's truly...

601
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:33,490
(New City Life)

602
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:40,498
(Yuehai Column: Seven-Up or Eight-Down?
No Land Sales. What's Next for Yuehai?)

603
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:45,947
Du,

604
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:47,827
congratulations.

605
00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:50,106
The two articles you wrote
are excellent.

606
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:52,226
When the newspaper is out,

607
00:37:52,467 --> 00:37:54,186
they'll be
among the year's best articles.

608
00:37:54,626 --> 00:37:56,947
Alright, stop joking around
and get back to work.

609
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:58,747
It's late. I'm leaving now.

610
00:37:58,747 --> 00:37:59,247
Okay.

611
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:03,566
Hello?

612
00:39:03,907 --> 00:39:06,066
Hello, may I speak to Mr. Zheng?

613
00:39:08,066 --> 00:39:08,907
Hold on a moment.

614
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,706
Mr. Zheng, your phone call.

615
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:15,987
Okay, coming.

616
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:24,120
Hello, who is this?

617
00:39:24,467 --> 00:39:25,026
Mr. Zheng.

618
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:27,026
Mr. Zheng, it's Changyuan.

619
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:28,827
Changyuan, what's up?

620
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:31,026
Listen, I'm at the newspaper office now.

621
00:39:31,026 --> 00:39:32,506
I saw the articles about Yuehai.

622
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:34,307
Articles?

623
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:35,907
What articles?

624
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:38,787
Mr. Zheng, I'm not flattering you.

625
00:39:38,907 --> 00:39:40,026
You're really amazing.

626
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:41,387
Mr. Du

627
00:39:41,387 --> 00:39:43,546
gave two full pages to Yuehai.

628
00:39:43,706 --> 00:39:44,546
Let me read it.

629
00:39:45,626 --> 00:39:50,467
The title is "No Land Sales.
What's Next for Yuehai?"

630
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:54,787
Okay, I see.

631
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:05,626
Mr. Du is going to
publish those two articles.

632
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:06,546
What?

633
00:40:07,546 --> 00:40:09,787
I haven't stamped them yet.
How can he publish them?

634
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,024
Qian Changyuan
is in the provincial capital.

635
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:15,267
He saw the press proof at the printery
for the New City Life newspaper.

636
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:16,920
It hits the stands tonight.

637
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:23,867
I need to go find Mr. Du in person.

638
00:40:24,307 --> 00:40:25,506
It's on the press.

639
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:28,347
Even if you go to Du Tao now,
the articles can't be pulled back.

640
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,506
We have to pull them back.

641
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:31,747
I'll see Mr. Zhao.

642
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:34,907
Provincial newspapers
are beyond his reach.

643
00:40:35,706 --> 00:40:36,987
I'll go to provincial leaders.

644
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:38,947
Like Mr. Zhang. He helped us before.

645
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:41,226
The two articles can't be published.

646
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:42,947
Leave it to me.

647
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:44,626
Mr. Zheng,

648
00:40:45,267 --> 00:40:47,586
we should report it
to Mr. Zhao at the county first.

649
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:49,467
Good point.

650
00:40:50,226 --> 00:40:50,747
But...

651
00:40:51,066 --> 00:40:53,387
Then we'll split up.
I'll go to the county to see Mr. Zhao.

652
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:55,226
You, the provincial capital.
We meet there.

653
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,827
Alright. Thank you.

654
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:01,467
(Archives Room, Statistics Dept.)

655
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:02,146
Mr. Zhao.

656
00:41:05,267 --> 00:41:05,767
Li.

657
00:41:05,907 --> 00:41:06,427
Mr. Zhao.

658
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:07,307
Why are you back?

659
00:41:07,947 --> 00:41:08,987
Mr. Zhao, I'm sorry.

660
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,387
I have a very important matter
to report to you.

661
00:41:13,747 --> 00:41:14,247
Wang.

662
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:15,166
- Come.
- Coming.

663
00:41:16,546 --> 00:41:18,106
Mr. Zhao, everyone's here.

664
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:19,226
Take this inside.

665
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:19,847
Okay.

666
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:22,046
Then I'll give you five minutes.
Go ahead.

667
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:49,427
Didn't Yuehai Column previously publish
some articles that got a great response?

668
00:41:49,867 --> 00:41:50,367
Yes.

669
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:53,106
The situation
is truly different this time.

670
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:55,467
Yuehai hasn't fully developed yet.

671
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:58,347
All our measures
are exploratory and experimental.

672
00:41:58,506 --> 00:41:59,907
If this kind of controversial issue

673
00:42:00,146 --> 00:42:01,546
spreads far and wide,

674
00:42:01,747 --> 00:42:03,307
it will be bad for Yuehai.

675
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:06,787
Then what do you need me to do?

676
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:08,347
Mr. Zhao,

677
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:10,066
here's our thinking.

678
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:12,947
First, it was you
who bore all the problems

679
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:14,226
that happened in Yuehai.

680
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:16,226
This time, we want to bear it ourselves.

681
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:18,586
Second, we only have half a day.

682
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,827
If you report it up
through the chain of command,

683
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:22,347
I'm afraid time will run out.

684
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,666
And it's a provincial capital newspaper.

685
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:26,387
We don't want to cause you trouble.

686
00:42:26,787 --> 00:42:29,186
So we want to report directly
to the provincial level.

687
00:42:30,706 --> 00:42:32,407
I... I understand.

688
00:42:32,706 --> 00:42:34,867
You're not here
to ask for my permission.

689
00:42:34,947 --> 00:42:35,907
You came to inform me.

690
00:42:36,146 --> 00:42:37,307
Worried about overstepping?

691
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:39,787
Li, you've really improved now.

692
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,907
You consider problems very thoroughly.

693
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:43,947
The plan you mentioned

694
00:42:43,947 --> 00:42:46,186
is indeed the most effective solution
right now.

695
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:47,226
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

696
00:42:47,787 --> 00:42:48,586
We also don't know

697
00:42:48,586 --> 00:42:51,146
what the outcome will be
after reporting upwards.

698
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:52,747
I understand.

699
00:42:53,706 --> 00:42:55,586
Since you've made up
your minds to do this,

700
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:56,467
then I agree.

701
00:42:57,827 --> 00:42:59,307
It's fine. But rest assured.

702
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:01,787
No matter the outcome,
I will take responsibility.

703
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:03,226
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.
