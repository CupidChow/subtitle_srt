Mr. Du,

we need to get back before dark.
Time to leave.

18
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:51,929
Then...

19
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,689
I have to go.

20
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,769
I guess you have a lot to handle later.

21
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,129
Post-disaster reconstruction
is the real challenge.

22
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:08,009
It might be tough for you then.

23
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:10,409
I'll be fine.

24
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:13,409
I...

25
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:17,089
You...

26
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:19,888
I've been writing a feature
about the people's livelihood,

27
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,289
focusing on the ER.

28
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:23,768
The feature gets a lot of attention.

29
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,328
A while back,
I interviewed a health expert,

30
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:27,289
talking about

31
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:30,369
whether it's better to drink milk
in the morning or at night.

32
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,529
Just two reports.

33
00:02:31,648 --> 00:02:33,089
Our newspaper's inbox was flooded.

34
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:43,809
Well...

35
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:46,448
Well...

36
00:02:46,809 --> 00:02:47,448
What's wrong?

37
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:53,289
I'm going to miss you.

- True!

It's Xingfu Road.

66
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:18,528

There is deep water ahead.
The bus can't get through.

00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:24,760

If you're going, be careful.

76
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:33,369
Slow down.

77
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:34,088
Be careful!

78
00:05:34,088 --> 00:05:35,208

- This way?
- Yes.

00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:53,848
Go!

91
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:54,408
Go ahead.

92
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,528
Mr. Ma.

93
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:02,369
Are they county cadres?

94
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:04,208
Mostly their family members.

95
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:08,768
Hurry up!

96
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,648
Get those pumps fixed quickly.

97
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:12,009

Let's find him. Where's Zheng Decheng?

100
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:21,528
Is he in the tent?

101
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:22,768
Noise from the tent.

102
00:06:28,648 --> 00:06:29,448
What's wrong?

103
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:30,888
What's wrong?

104
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:31,569
What happened?

105
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:33,009
Mr. Zheng.

106
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:34,648
- Mr. Zheng!
- Decheng.

107
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:36,049
Decheng, you...

108
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,328
Decheng, what's wrong?

109
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:42,009
Make way.

110
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:42,648
Excuse me.

00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:43,489
Step aside.

112
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:44,569
- What's wrong?
- Make way.

113
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:47,648
What's going on?

114
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:49,408
Your gallstones are acting up again?

115
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:52,169
Take your medicine.

116
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:52,929
Come on.

117
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:54,888
Water!

118
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:00,009
Easy.

119
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:03,888
Help me up.

120
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:05,968
Let me jump.

121
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,489
Make way.

122
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:11,049
Make way!

123
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:11,768
Step aside.

124
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,489
Make way!

125
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:13,369
Everyone, step aside.

126
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,049
- Make way!
- Wait.

127
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,768
Ms. Li, we have a problem!

128
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,369
The families of the cadres are all here.

129
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,448
They saw Xingfu Road flooded
and got furious.

130
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:27,968
Right now, they've surrounded Mr. Zheng.

131
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:28,609
What do we do?

132
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:29,929
What should we do?

133
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:31,208
The flooding is too severe!

134
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:40,968
It's completely worthless!

135
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,569
- Refund!
- Refund!

136
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,169
- It's too flooded.
- Refund us!

137
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,489
Refunds? We can do that.

138
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:49,888
I'm Li Qiuping, Town Mayor of Yuehai.

139
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,968
Those who want refunds,
please come to the town government.

140
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:55,192
I'll be waiting for you.

141
00:07:56,376 --> 00:08:00,249
Those who want refunds,
please come to the town government.

142
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:01,768
I'll be waiting for you.

143
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:05,809
Get a refund?

144
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:07,088
Sure.

145
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:07,689
Really?

146
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:10,929
Get a refund?

147
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:18,609
Everyone, don't push.

148
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:19,489
Line up, please.

149
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,009
Since Ms. Li is here,

150
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,288
she will solve our problem, right?

151
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:26,129
What's the use of saying all that?

152
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,689
We have only one demand.

153
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,249
Just refund us, right?

154
00:08:29,448 --> 00:08:30,249
- True!
- True!

155
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,089
- Return the land!
- Return the land!

156
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:33,768
We will definitely refund you.

157
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,089
Those who want a refund,
please fill out the forms.

158
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,089
We'll return the principal
plus interest.

159
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:41,129
But there's something
I need to explain upfront.

160
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,209
Our town government has a regulation.

161
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:44,808
Once land is returned,

162
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:46,609
you can't repurchase it for one year.

163
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:48,329
If you want to acquire land again,

164
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:52,129
you'll have to
pay the new city construction fee.

165
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:54,729
- What does it mean?
- What does it mean?

166
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:55,568
What does it mean?

167
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,329
What else could it mean?

168
00:08:57,528 --> 00:08:58,489
It means no.

169
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,729
That's not what I meant.

170
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:02,609
Since the founding of Yuehai,

171
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:04,969
the city construction fee
has been collected

172
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:07,249
based on the principle of voluntariness.

173
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:08,609
Since it's voluntary,

174
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:11,009
payment and refunds are both allowed.

175
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:14,688
The main point is that Binhai Road
is getting better and better.

176
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,808
The hospital is already completed.

177
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,089
In fact,

178
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,568
land prices on Xingfu Road have risen.

179
00:09:25,609 --> 00:09:26,329
Price increase?

180
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:29,369
Make way, please.

181
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:30,928
Food's ready!

182
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:32,209
Lunch time!

183
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:34,089
You all must be hungry, right?

184
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:36,288
Come and eat together.

185
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:37,928
It's nothing special,

186
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,009
just something to tide you over.
Come on.

187
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,528
Everyone, come and eat.

188
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:48,089
No, we're not eating.

189
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,249
We're not here to eat!

190
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:51,609
- Exactly!
- Right!

191
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:52,369
Alright then,

192
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:54,489
let's put the land issue aside for now.

193
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,688
But I've started building my house!
At least...

194
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:02,209
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

195
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:07,009
We can't just let it go.

196
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,329
I skipped breakfast. Starving.

197
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:25,048
Actually, typhoons
aren't unique to this year.

198
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:27,168
When there's a typhoon,

199
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,568
the county government
assesses the damage in each area

200
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,729
and makes a plan
for relief and compensation.

201
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,329
All of you here are family members.

202
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:39,369
You might not be familiar
with this practice.

203
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:41,249
Mr. Wang,

204
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,009
you're a leader.

205
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,408
You should know this.

206
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:45,849
Explain it to everyone.

207
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:13,489
I understand

208
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:15,808
that seeing Xingfu Road flooded

209
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:16,648
makes you anxious.

210
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:19,888
As Mayor of Yuehai Town, I assure you

211
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:24,888
that Xingfu Road was built
the same way as Binhai Road.

212
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:26,369
The flooding

213
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:29,849
was mainly caused by building materials
clogging the drains

214
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:30,969
during transport.

215
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,808
But as you've all seen,

216
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:33,768
Mr. Zheng

217
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:35,928
is tackling this right away.

218
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:54,048
Even so,

219
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:58,408
the fact remains
that Xingfu Road is flooded, right?

220
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:01,969
Look, one family's foundation
is already washed out!

221
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,009
Has the family arrived? Have they?

222
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,729
I'm telling you, if they show up,

223
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,168
they'll blow up at you right here.

224
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:10,408
Are you talking
about the land next to mine?

225
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,648
Yes, exactly.

226
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:15,648
The land belongs to Ms. Li's boyfriend.

227
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,288
Binhai Road didn't flood.

228
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,288
But Xingfu Road got hit.

229
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:23,768
I'm furious too.

230
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,528
But a natural disaster is inevitable.

231
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:28,329
What can we do?

232
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:31,849
Leaders of Yuehai Town are human too.

233
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:35,808
They've been doing their utmost
to fix things since it happened.

234
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,449
As we all saw today,

235
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:39,609
they have been

236
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:41,688
working hard to solve problems for us.

237
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:46,369
This year's typhoon
was stronger than usual.

238
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:48,249
Yeah.

239
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:49,928
It was not heavy in the county,

240
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:51,888
but many places were still flooded.

241
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:55,489
I don't want a refund.

242
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:56,648
Me either.

243
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,048
- Me either.
- Me either.

244
00:12:58,288 --> 00:12:59,449

- Me either.

246
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,168
Mr. Wang,

247
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:04,209
want a refund?

248
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:33,048
Eat.

we've finally overcome the typhoon.

After the typhoon,

Hai, once the price goes up,
it can't just come down.

00:20:55,568 --> 00:20:56,608
It is a bit excessive.

375
00:20:58,328 --> 00:20:58,848
Hai,

376
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:00,649
don't let them fool you.

377
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:02,808
We set the price at a cost.

378
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:06,209
We risked our lives
during the typhoons to earn it.

379
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:08,249
Think how much loss we saved them from!

380
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:09,808
Now, they want to pay less?

381
00:21:10,088 --> 00:21:10,689
No way!

382
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:21,009
In this world,

383
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,889
you've got to play by the rules.

384
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:24,848
Once rules are set,

385
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,048
they can't be changed easily.

386
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,889
What movie did you watch behind my back?

387
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:36,048
No, I didn't.

388
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:39,088
Rules.

389
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,504
That makes sense.

390
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:42,009
Okay.

391
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:43,409
We'll do it your way.

392
00:21:43,848 --> 00:21:44,889
Rules are rules.

393
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:48,009
From now on,
on this street, we play by the rules.

394
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:48,889
- Yes.
- Yes.

395
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,048
We'll play by the rules.

396
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:06,889
Yan.

397
00:22:07,568 --> 00:22:08,088
Mr. Lin.

398
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:11,848
This is for you.

399
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:14,649
Thank you.

400
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:17,088
This is...

401
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,368
What is it?

402
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:34,768
Here.

403
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:38,768
It's a...

404
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,368
I-I made it in my spare time.

405
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:42,768
It's lovely.

406
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:48,729
It's singing.

407
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:50,929
I've heard you often hum this tune.

408
00:22:51,808 --> 00:22:53,368
Such skillful hands.

409
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:56,969
Is this a swallow?

410
00:22:58,489 --> 00:22:59,808
It's a wonton.

411
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:03,889
If you don't like it,

412
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:05,169
I can make you a swallow one.

413
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:06,489
Sure, I like it.

414
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,009
It looks nice.

415
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:09,288
It's beautiful.

416
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:10,689
Thank you.

417
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:31,649
I was never married.

418
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:36,889
Haohao's dad was an educated youth.

419
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,009
At the time, I...

420
00:23:40,689 --> 00:23:42,608
Right after I found out I was pregnant,

421
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:45,368
he got a chance to return to the city.

422
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:50,768
He was overjoyed
the day he got the news.

423
00:23:51,328 --> 00:23:52,249
He drank a lot.

424
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:55,368
He talked to me a lot.

425
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:56,969
He wanted me to wait for him

426
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,528
until he got settled back home.

427
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,048
He would take me to Shanghai

428
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:01,969
and marry me.

429
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:12,768
However, I never heard from him again.

430
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:16,209
I wrote him many letters.

431
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,568
I sent over a dozen letters.

432
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,768
Then, I finally got a letter back,

433
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:24,848
saying only a few words.

434
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:32,249
I... I also got
a money order for 500 yuan.

435
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:35,848
He said it was all his savings.

436
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:39,368
Yan.

437
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:40,768
I...

438
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,368
It took me a while.

439
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,088
But I've decided to have this baby.

440
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:47,896
But

441
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:51,108
after what happened,

442
00:24:52,184 --> 00:24:53,368
I made up my mind

443
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,568
that I wouldn't rely on men

444
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,128
or believe in love again.

445
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:11,848
Yan,

446
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:18,209
you trusted me enough to tell me this,

447
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:22,409
and I'll prove over time

448
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:26,848
that I'm someone
who won't betray that trust.

449
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:47,508
(Yan's Wontons)

450
00:25:47,508 --> 00:25:49,080
(Yuehai's Rise Is Now)

451
00:25:58,689 --> 00:25:59,249
Hai,

452
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:01,768
I'm tired of eating plain steamed buns.

453
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,449
We've earned some money now.

454
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:05,249
When can we try Super Dog Restaurant?

455
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:09,649
Sure, we have,

456
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:12,209
but don't get ahead of yourselves then.

457
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:15,568
I heard the food
at Super Dog Restaurant is amazing!

458
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,608
(Super Dog Restaurant)
Isn't it just for tea?

459
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:19,568
What's so good about it?

460
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:20,808
You bumpkin!

461
00:26:21,088 --> 00:26:22,368
You think it only serves tea?

462
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,288
What else?

463
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:30,889
I'll go check it out.

464
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:52,929
Take it easy.

465
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:54,649
What's in there?

466
00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:00,328
There's a huge goose roasted over fire.

467
00:27:01,048 --> 00:27:01,608
A goose.

468
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:05,568
The sign said it's fork-style.

469
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:10,409
Let's pretend this bun is the goose.

470
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:16,449
What else?

471
00:27:17,209 --> 00:27:20,368
A whole duck hanging right there,

472
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:21,929
sizzling with oil.

473
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:22,889
It's also fork-style.

474
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:25,409
Sizzling with oil.

475
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:27,729
Sizzling with oil.

476
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:33,128
Anything else?

477
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:42,520
(Blessings)

478
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:48,328
I saw a dumpling on the table,

479
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:51,489
with a translucent wrapper,

480
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:53,409
full of shrimp meat.

481
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:54,848
Shrimp!

482
00:27:58,489 --> 00:27:59,128
Delicious.

483
00:27:59,768 --> 00:28:00,368
What else?

484
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:01,729
Too much to list, Hai.

485
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:02,929
My eyes couldn't see it all.

486
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:17,249
Hai,

487
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:18,729
after all that talk,

488
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:22,249
this bun in my hand still tastes bland.

489
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:47,729
You guys really want to go?

490
00:28:47,969 --> 00:28:49,048
- Yes!
- Yes!

491
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:52,889
Listen, Mr. Kang,

492
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:55,729
those guys are real pieces of work.

493
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:56,729
Now, look,

494
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,368
they've taken over the whole street!

495
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:00,489
You know what?

496
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:01,848
They're like looters.

497
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:03,489
Keep it down.

498
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:05,088
You wait and see.

499
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,528
Next time I run into them,

500
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:07,689
I'll deal with them.

501
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,489
Stop your empty bluster.

502
00:29:10,489 --> 00:29:11,288
How will you do?

503
00:29:11,528 --> 00:29:12,568
I can handle them, anyway.

504
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:13,929
You can't.

505
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:15,409
As you all know,

506
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:16,929
just in two days,

507
00:29:17,768 --> 00:29:20,409
their asking price doubled
because of the typhoon.

508
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,449
How can we do business like this?

509
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:23,088
Exactly.

510
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:25,209
Anyway, we need a plan.

511
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:26,608
This can't go on.

512
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:27,768
I have an idea.

513
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:30,009
We just stop hiring them, right?

514
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:30,608
Right.

515
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:31,489
That's a way.

516
00:29:31,489 --> 00:29:31,848
Yeah.

517
00:29:31,969 --> 00:29:32,848
Yes, stop hiring them.

518
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:34,009
Yes.

519
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:39,808
Sir.

520
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:45,689
Good evening, everyone.

521
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:47,048
How many of you?

522
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:48,048
We are...

523
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:53,808
16 people.

524
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,169
16 people.

525
00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:00,889
Lucky number!

526
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:02,768
Hai, you didn't count yourself.

527
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:04,328
17 of us.

528
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:07,209
Lucky number too!

529
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:08,969
Prepare a big table for them!

530
00:30:09,128 --> 00:30:10,048
Right away, sir!

531
00:30:10,048 --> 00:30:10,689
Well,

532
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:11,528
let me help you

533
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:12,328
put it away.

534
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:13,368
Give me a hand.

535
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:14,328
Put the stuff here.

536
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:16,729
- Quick.
- Put it here.

537
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,169
Thanks.

538
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:20,689
Sir, this way, please.

539
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:30,608
Feels like I'm eating
in an open-air food stall.

540
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:33,848
Can't you just be quiet?

541
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:38,568
What would you like to order?

542
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:41,489
Here is the menu.

543
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:56,528
Good fish.

544
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,009
Let's get a fish, Hai.

545
00:30:59,449 --> 00:31:00,969
Okay, get a fish.

546
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:02,929
This one.

547
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,689
T-This fish is too expensive.

548
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:06,929
Not worth it.

549
00:31:08,649 --> 00:31:09,808
It's fine.

550
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:11,489
We've got money.

551
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:14,128
It doesn't taste good.

552
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:16,209
If it's not good, why display it?

553
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:17,288
Exactly!

554
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:19,608
Country bumpkin.

555
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:25,729
Xu, you can flaunt your money.

556
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:27,288
They're bad at flaunting.

557
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:29,009
Stop pretending.

558
00:31:29,368 --> 00:31:29,848
Exactly.

559
00:31:30,528 --> 00:31:31,449
Just eat quietly

560
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:32,368
and talk less.

561
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:33,528
What?

562
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,048
You can flaunt your money too.

563
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:37,128
Easy for you to say.

564
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:38,449
I can flaunt mine too!

565
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:39,768
Right.

566
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:43,729
Hey, you!

567
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:46,009
If you have complaints,
speak to my face.

568
00:31:46,288 --> 00:31:47,489
Stop gossiping behind my back.

569
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:50,209
Guess what?

570
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:55,088
I'm dissatisfied with you all.
What about it?

571
00:31:55,608 --> 00:31:58,768
You rip us off
and won't even let us complain?

572
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:01,409
You are all business people.

573
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:02,649
Can you be a bit reasonable?

574
00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:05,889
We risked our lives moving your goods
during the typhoon.

575
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:07,449
We deserve to set the price.

576
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:08,969
If you can, don't hire us.

577
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:10,689
But once you hire us,

578
00:32:10,808 --> 00:32:12,048
the price is set by us.

579
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:13,649
- Look at him!
- Why?

580
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:17,009
Qiang,

581
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:18,048
listen up.

582
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:21,449
From now on, I won't hire you anymore.

583
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:26,889
Want to use your own people?

584
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:27,568
Yeah!

585
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:28,808
Nice try.

586
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:35,568
A threat?

587
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:40,969
Yeah, what can you do?

588
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:44,449
Gentlemen,

589
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:47,808
calm down!

590
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:49,568
Do me a favor.

591
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:51,608
Don't fight.

592
00:32:52,209 --> 00:32:53,368
Don't fight.

593
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:56,009
Serve some iced tea

594
00:32:56,169 --> 00:32:57,048
- for them.
- Okay.

595
00:32:57,449 --> 00:32:58,328
Calm down.

596
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:02,729
Let's go!

597
00:33:11,768 --> 00:33:12,169
I...

598
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:13,729
You...

599
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,969
Sir, we're ready to order.

600
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:20,169
Okay.

601
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:24,409
(If I can buy two taels of gold
with the deposit money,)

602
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:27,249
(I'll sell tomorrow,
and then buy more the day after.)

603
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:28,009
Granny.

604
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:29,969
Guess what good food I bought you?

605
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:32,288
Look!

606
00:33:35,328 --> 00:33:35,729
See?

607
00:33:43,608 --> 00:33:44,368
Haven't seen these.

608
00:33:46,088 --> 00:33:47,848
Where did these dishes come from?

609
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:49,009
I ordered them.

610
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:51,048
We've been working hard

611
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:51,969
to make money.

612
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,249
We just wanted to celebrate a bit.
I didn't...

613
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:00,689
Granny, what's wrong?

614
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:03,048
You think I've never seen anything?

615
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:05,568
I recognize these dishes.

616
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:07,768
This is Fo Tiao Qiang,

617
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:09,289
Abalone Sauce Noodles,

618
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:11,128
and Chicken with Bird's Nest.

619
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:13,889
The rich landlords in the old society

620
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:16,128
feasted on delicacies every day.

621
00:34:16,528 --> 00:34:17,168
And then?

622
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:19,489
They squandered it all before long.

623
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:21,528
Xiaohai,

624
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,929
you've just made a bit of money

625
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,248
to make ends meet.

626
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:28,009
And you're already flaunting?

627
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,809
Let me tell you,

628
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:34,009
a good life depends on how you live it.

629
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:36,889
(I'm rich!)

630
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:38,208
(I'm rich!)

631
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:41,969
(I'm rich!)

632
00:34:44,528 --> 00:34:45,608
(I'm rich!)

633
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:05,728
(You've just made a bit of money)

634
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:08,009
(to make ends meet.)

635
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:09,769
(And you're already flaunting?)

636
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:14,329
(A good life
depends on how you live it.)

637
00:35:50,224 --> 00:35:53,112
(Canteen)

638
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,329
The floodwater has been fully drained.

639
00:35:58,528 --> 00:35:59,728
The pipeline is repaired too.

640
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:01,608
I roughly estimated

641
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,688
that the losses are less than expected.

642
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,208
Later, I'll take people
to do a thorough inspection.

643
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:07,168
Good.

644
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,489
Half the damaged roofs
in the slums have been repaired.

645
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,289
It'll definitely be done next week.

646
00:36:13,168 --> 00:36:13,528
Okay.

647
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:14,929
High efficiency.

648
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,329
All the damaged boats
have been pulled ashore.

649
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:20,369
We're not responsible
for the repair costs.

650
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,688
But a few heavily damaged ones
need repairs here.

651
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:24,769
I've told them

652
00:36:25,048 --> 00:36:25,969
we have to charge them.

653
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:27,088
This is our place.

654
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:28,849
They have to pay for our manpower.

655
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:30,728
Good point.

656
00:36:31,248 --> 00:36:31,929
Very smart.

657
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:35,168
Mr. Zheng, Ms. Li,

658
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:37,329
I have one thing to report.

659
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,329
Go ahead.

660
00:36:38,449 --> 00:36:40,849
It's about the self-employed individual
on Binhai Road.

661
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:43,528
Lately, they've been complaining.

662
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:45,329
What's going on?

663
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:46,568
Here's the thing.

664
00:36:46,568 --> 00:36:47,449
On Binhai Road,

665
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:49,128
some young guys are making a living

666
00:36:49,128 --> 00:36:51,449
by helping the self-employed individual
carry goods.

667
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,929
But their asking price
is a little too high.

668
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:56,449
There's been friction
between them quite often.

669
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:58,688
It started mainly during the typhoon.

670
00:36:58,889 --> 00:37:01,168
They helped self-employed individuals
rescue their goods.

671
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:02,168
They charged more

672
00:37:02,168 --> 00:37:03,048
than they used to.

673
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:04,369
But after the typhoon,

674
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,409
their asking price
hasn't come back down.

675
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:07,769
Mr. Tan.

676
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:09,648
Someone just called the office again,

677
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,688
reporting high-priced hauling
on Binhai Road.

678
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:14,929
Go handle that right away.

679
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:18,809
Lin, tidy things up for me.

680
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:19,568
Okay.

681
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:22,329
Get the city inspectors assembled.

682
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:24,048
Fine.

683
00:37:24,248 --> 00:37:25,568
Pay half if you don't need us.

684
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:33,088
Why?

685
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:35,769
Why should I pay you?

686
00:37:36,168 --> 00:37:37,088
Why should I?

687
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:39,449
We're not standing here for nothing.

688
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:41,769
Your workers can't handle everything.

689
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:43,409
What if goods get stolen?

690
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,409
We're helping you watch.

691
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:47,248
You standing here is your business.

692
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:49,168
Managing my goods is my business.

693
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:50,289
One more time,

694
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:52,648
don't cause trouble here.

695
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:54,289
We have enough people now.

696
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:55,608
We don't need you.

697
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:56,648
Get to work!

698
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:58,728
- Get to work!
- Get to work!

699
00:37:58,728 --> 00:37:59,168
Stop!

700
00:38:00,048 --> 00:38:00,608
Stop!

701
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:02,128
(Boost Market Prosperity)
Back off!

702
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:03,329
Don't fight!

703
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:04,889
Hands off!

704
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:06,128
Mr. Tan, come quick!

705
00:38:06,128 --> 00:38:06,929
Mr. Tan!

706
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,688
Mr. Tan, do something!

707
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:09,568
Deal with them!

708
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:10,688
Please, control them!

709
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:13,809
These punks are ripping me off!

710
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,769
I didn't hire them,
but they still charged me.

711
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:18,208
Zhiqiang, stop this.

712
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:19,369
You can't do this.

713
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:21,568
This isn't an honest way
to make a living.

714
00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:22,889
You misunderstood me.

715
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:23,329
Mr. Tan.

716
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,648
Don't listen to his nonsense!

717
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:26,449
Did you pay me?

718
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:28,929
But he just...

719
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:31,929
No.

720
00:38:32,248 --> 00:38:34,528
Mr. Tan, I saw his workers were swamped,

721
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:35,648
so I came to help.

722
00:38:36,168 --> 00:38:37,688
Alright, listen up.

723
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:40,528
From now on, we don't need your help.

724
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:42,409
Mr. Tan, get them out of here!

725
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:43,208
Right now!

726
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,929
Fine, take me away!

727
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:46,769
I'll have a word with Mr. Tan.

728
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,208
Your goods are piled on the road.
Quite messy.

729
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:50,289
It's blocking traffic.

730
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,809
It badly affects city planning.

731
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:56,208
Fine! Unload the goods! Move!

732
00:38:56,289 --> 00:38:58,128
Okay. Break it up!

733
00:38:59,088 --> 00:38:59,849
- Leaving.
- Going.

734
00:38:59,929 --> 00:39:01,048
Zhiqiang, wait a minute.

735
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:02,449
Come help me with my bike.

736
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:03,208
Thanks.

737
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:04,168
Come with me.

738
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:15,769
Zhiqiang, no offense,

739
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:19,289
but you're wearing flashy sunglasses

740
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:20,929
with a hairstyle like that.

741
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,889
I think you should learn a skill

742
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,208
and find a real job.

743
00:39:26,969 --> 00:39:28,048
This is a real job,

744
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:28,528
Mr. Tan.

745
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:31,208
What exactly do you mean by that?

746
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:34,009
What I mean is...

747
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:36,048
I mean,

748
00:39:36,048 --> 00:39:37,849
what you're doing now is crooked.

749
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:39,048
You're forcing them.

750
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:41,168
People will gossip
about you behind your back.

751
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:42,648
I don't care.

752
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:45,889
Besides, I'm trading my labor for money.

753
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:51,449
People say
you charge higher prices than others.

754
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:53,048
Go ask around, Mr. Tan.

755
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:55,449
Prices are the same throughout Yuehai.

756
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:57,088
I don't set the price.

757
00:39:58,449 --> 00:39:58,969
Fine then.

758
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:03,048
You walk around the street all day.

759
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:05,329
If you see anyone unloading by force,

760
00:40:05,688 --> 00:40:07,009
please let me know, okay?

761
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,568
Okay, no problem.

762
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:13,128
I'll do what you say.

763
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:15,168
You should find a real job.

764
00:40:15,168 --> 00:40:15,889
Got it.

765
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:16,889
Let's go.

766
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:18,088
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

767
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:23,929
Mr. Tan.

768
00:40:24,128 --> 00:40:28,128
Someone's charging a high price
for unloading on Binhai Road.

769
00:40:28,648 --> 00:40:30,568
Stop! I don't need you to do this.

770
00:40:30,648 --> 00:40:32,248
Stop it! Don't!

771
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:33,608
Don't hurt her.

772
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:36,329
Hey, why did you raise the price again?

773
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:37,528
Why shouldn't I?

774
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:39,048
It's just a small sum for you.

775
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:41,369
This is our price.

776
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:43,409
But that's way too high.

777
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,688
Can you lower it a bit?

778
00:40:46,329 --> 00:40:47,369
Well...

779
00:40:48,528 --> 00:40:50,769
If it were the old price...

780
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,168
Get out of here!

781
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:54,289
Mr. Tan!

782
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:55,248
Mr. Tan!

783
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:56,289
Come take a look!

784
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:57,728
These guys are running wild!

785
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,009
They're a bully!

786
00:40:59,009 --> 00:40:59,409
Alright.

787
00:40:59,409 --> 00:41:00,568
Look what they've done!

788
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:02,289
I can't believe this!

789
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:04,849
Look, Mr. Tan!

790
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:05,969
(Dongfeng Printery)
Stop!

791
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,168
I can unload myself!

792
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:07,969
I don't need you!

793
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:09,369
Where are they from?

794
00:41:09,688 --> 00:41:10,889
They are all my own workers.

795
00:41:10,889 --> 00:41:11,929
They can unload my goods.

796
00:41:12,048 --> 00:41:12,889
Won't hire us, huh?

797
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:13,969
I have to stop you.

798
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:14,369
Yeah!

799
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:15,528
All of you, stop! Sit down!

800
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:16,048
Get out!

801
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:16,728
Sit!

802
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:17,769
Trying to play tough?

803
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:21,929
- Go!
- Leave!

804
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,809
Mr. Tan, look!

805
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:24,409
Hey!

806
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:25,969
How am I supposed to run my business?

807
00:41:26,088 --> 00:41:26,969
- This way!
- This way!

808
00:41:27,168 --> 00:41:28,449
Don't run! Stop!

809
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:30,048
Stop!

810
00:41:32,248 --> 00:41:33,809
You have to fix this for us.

811
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:37,528
Chief Tian.

812
00:41:50,489 --> 00:41:50,929
Xiaoyu!

813
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:52,409
Xiaohai!

814
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:54,289
Xiaohai.

815
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:56,728
What's up?

816
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:00,489
How have you been lately?

817
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,969
Same as usual.

818
00:42:03,248 --> 00:42:04,088
I have no business.

819
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:11,128
Come and unload the goods!

820
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:12,608
Come on.

821
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:18,168
Xiaohai!

822
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:20,208
Wait a second.

823
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:22,929
Hold up!

824
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:25,809
Mr. Jin, unloading goods?

825
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:27,728
Don't let the workers do it today.

826
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:29,168
Give this job to Xiaohai.

827
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:34,289
Xiaoyu, don't do anything reckless.

828
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:36,568
Ms. Gao already
told our workers to do it.

829
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,369
If they do it, they'll overcharge you.

830
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,849
Don't worry. Xiaohai won't do that.

831
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:43,009
You all head back now.

832
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:45,248
I've got this.

833
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:47,088
Go on. You guys go.

834
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:48,369
Go back then.

835
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:50,849
Xiaohai!

836
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:53,248
You guys do it.

837
00:42:54,128 --> 00:42:55,329
Okay, let's go.

838
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:56,568
Get to work!

839
00:42:58,809 --> 00:42:59,528
(Quick-Drying Ink)
Untie the rope!

840
00:42:59,728 --> 00:43:00,449
Untie the rope.

841
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:01,809
Come on!

842
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:02,809
Lend a hand here!

843
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:03,608
Go.
