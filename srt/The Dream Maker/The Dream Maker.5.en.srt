16
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:39,591
I left everything behind

17
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:41,672
to build Yuehai City with you

18
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,151
to reach a new height in my life.

19
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,151
But now...

20
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:47,311
I...

21
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:55,752
I... I...

22
00:01:55,912 --> 00:01:58,231
E-Enough. I understand.

00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:58,912
I...

24
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,672
Xie, after all these years,

25
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:03,632
how could I not understand you?

26
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:06,231
Why are you acting like a child?

27
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:08,631
Let's not talk about...

28
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:09,191
Don't...

29
00:02:09,272 --> 00:02:10,911
Let's not talk about

30
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,352
Li.

31
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:13,591
But you three.

32
00:02:14,232 --> 00:02:16,311
I can't guarantee

33
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,871
which one of you will be the Town Mayor.

34
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:21,552
But Li Qiuping certainly won't

35
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:23,232
take that position.

36
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,552
I'm impressed. I knew I could trust you.

37
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,711
But what if they assign her here?

38
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:29,871
Mr. Zheng.

39
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,552
Phone call from the county.

40
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:34,672
See? Speak of the devil.

41
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,072
They're calling you.

42
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:48,792
Hello?

43
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:50,751
Guan.

44
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:57,631
Guan. Mr. Guan.

45
00:02:58,072 --> 00:02:58,952
I disagree.

46
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:00,672
I firmly oppose this.

47
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:12,751
It's decided?

48
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:18,552
The Town Mayor is coming.

49
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,311
Come on, take it easy.

50
00:03:21,392 --> 00:03:23,431
I believe the higher-ups
made this decision

51
00:03:23,512 --> 00:03:25,311
out of careful consideration...

52
00:03:55,832 --> 00:03:58,072
How do you feel about Li Qiuping
being the Town Mayor?

53
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:00,312
You know how I feel.

54
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:01,911
(Petition)

55
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:02,392
Sign this.

56
00:04:06,232 --> 00:04:07,232
Petition.

57
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:09,911
Mr. Zhao and esteemed leaders,

58
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:13,832
please withdraw Li Qiuping's appointment
as Town Mayor of Yuehai.

59
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:16,592
Zheng Decheng.

60
00:04:17,271 --> 00:04:18,552
Mr. Zheng, personally,

61
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,592
I don't have a problem
with who becomes Town Mayor.

62
00:04:20,592 --> 00:04:23,592
Xie Chunlai.

63
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:25,352
Will you sign it?

64
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:27,311
Come on.

65
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:29,792
We shouldn't
hinder Yuehai's development.

66
00:04:29,792 --> 00:04:30,672
The higher-ups...

67
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:32,056
Lin Dongfu, what do you say?

68
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,511
Does she know anything

69
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:35,472
about engineering or road construction?

70
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:37,672
I oppose the appointment.

71
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:38,631
But

72
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:41,912
I'm also against Xie Chunlai.

73
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:43,712
It's okay.

74
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:44,712
I'm against you as well.

75
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,071
Come on, we'll settle this later.

76
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:02,592
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

77
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:04,311
I truly believe

78
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,232
this isn't a good idea.

79
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,472
We're all cadres.

80
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,672
We shouldn't
violate the procedure, right?

81
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:10,912
Discipline, you know?

82
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,631
Procedure is extremely important.

83
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:21,831
(Collective signing
of withdrawal petition)

84
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:22,311
Zhang.

85
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:24,631
Do you know where Mr. Guan is?

86
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:25,831
He's in a meeting.

87
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:26,831
Busy day.

88
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:27,472
Thanks.

89
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:28,032
No problem.

90
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,200
(Conference room)

91
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:38,152
Decheng, what's wrong?

92
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:40,152
Guan.

93
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,751
Do you have a minute?

94
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:42,472
Yeah.

95
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:44,831
It's about the candidates
for the Town Mayor position.

96
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,871
You see...

97
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:49,152
Save your breath.

98
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:50,232
Get out.

99
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:51,232
This isn't appropriate.

100
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:52,271
Guan.

101
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:53,311
Zheng Decheng.

102
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:55,152
How dare you pull this trick?

103
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,352
I told you clearly on the phone.

104
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:58,992
This is an appointment.

105
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,232
By higher-ups. Do you understand?

106
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,712
How dare you organize a joint petition?

107
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:07,592
Do you have no respect
for discipline and principle?

108
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:10,152
I do. But she's the wrong choice.

109
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:10,751
You can't...

110
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,112
Give me a break!

111
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:19,352
Hello.

112
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:19,792
Mr. Guan.

113
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:21,271
Get ready.

114
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,071
I'm busy.

115
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:24,391
Get out of here.

116
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,271
Your mom said she loved this, right?

117
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:45,311
Yeah.

118
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,032
She keeps talking about it.

119
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,271
Good to know.

120
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,112
I wouldn't want to look insincere.

121
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:54,271
Do you really think this will work?

122
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:56,232
A smile is the best defense.

123
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:57,712
Do you have a better idea?

124
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:01,311
You know, my dad is easy to deal with,

125
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:03,112
but my mom won't budge.

126
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:06,311
Then I'll threaten her.

127
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:07,871
I'm going all out for you.

128
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,831
Liu.

129
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:14,912
You've got to back me up.

130
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,352
If they disagree,

131
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:17,631
just run away from home

132
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:19,032
and stay at my place.

133
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,112
Liu. Let's still try
to persuade them first.

134
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:23,951
Don't use the key.

135
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:24,912
Knock first.

136
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,152
They need to see me.

137
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:27,152
Okay.

138
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:45,352
Ms. Liu.

139
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,472
Li.

140
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:47,391
You're back.

141
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:48,511
Come on in.

142
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:51,232
Mr. Zheng.

143
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,751
Why are you here?

144
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:54,112
Come in.

145
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:56,992
Mr. Li.

146
00:07:56,992 --> 00:07:58,511
You weren't at the office.

147
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:02,152
So I asked for your home address.

148
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:03,472
I just came here

149
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:04,831
and you're back.

150
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,751
You came to see me? What for?

151
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,431
I wanted to talk to you.

152
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:11,071
Mom, Dad.

153
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,311
This is Zheng Decheng,
Secretary of Yuehai.

154
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,751
I've met Uncle and Auntie

155
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:18,672
and introduced myself.

156
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:21,191
But we had barely talked

157
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:22,672
by the time you came.

158
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:24,672
Call me Ms. Yan.

159
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:32,312
Alright, Ms. Yan.

160
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,232
Call me Mr. Li.

161
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,151
Okay, Mr. Li.

162
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:35,631
Alright.

163
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:36,952
Is this about work?

164
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:38,232
If it is,

165
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,631
let's talk at the office.

166
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:41,271
Well...

167
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,031
Talk in private.

168
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:45,791
I'll keep Mr. Li and Ms. Yan

169
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:46,432
company.

170
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:48,271
It's fine.

171
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:49,712
Talk right here.

172
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:50,472
It's fine.

173
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,352
Your water.

174
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:52,511
Thank you.

175
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,072
No problem.

176
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:53,712
Go ahead.

177
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:00,712
Mr. Zheng, please sit.

178
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:01,992
- Okay.
- Sit here.

179
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:04,751
Ms. Liu, sit.

180
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:06,671
You're the guest here.

181
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:07,271
Okay.

182
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:10,712
Mr. Zheng.

183
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,592
What can I do for you?

184
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:19,312
Li,

185
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:21,511
I'm here to tell you

186
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:23,592
that I can't keep my job.

187
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:25,432
Why not?

188
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:26,791
You know,

189
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:30,151
this job hasn't been easy for me.

190
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:33,551
Scraping together funds wasn't easy.

191
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:35,871
Building a city wasn't easy.

192
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:39,631
But the main problem is

193
00:09:39,992 --> 00:09:42,312
that my three deputies are opposing it.

194
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:45,551
You quit just because of that?

195
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:46,992
What do they oppose?

196
00:09:48,232 --> 00:09:49,511
Your appointment.

197
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:01,952
That doesn't make any sense.

198
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,432
Why does my appointment

199
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,511
have anything to do with your job?

200
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:08,631
Because they all
want to be the Town Mayor.

201
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:11,432
And?

202
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:14,592
And they'll quit
if they don't stand a chance.

203
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,712
If they quit,

204
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,112
I can't build the city.

205
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,192
In that case,

206
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,631
I can't keep my job, right?

207
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:24,151
Li,

208
00:10:25,072 --> 00:10:27,671
I'm begging you, okay?

209
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:29,911
Please let me off the hook.

210
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,671
I'll find a way to repay you, I promise.

211
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:36,911
How about this?

212
00:10:37,232 --> 00:10:39,472
I'll recommend you to be the Secretary

213
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,112
in the neighboring town
to be the one in charge.

214
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:42,832
No need.

215
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:45,192
If they quit, I'll help you.

216
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,592
Mr. Zheng, I'm assigned to Yuehai
to support you.

217
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:49,511
Rest assured.

218
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:50,511
I'm still young.

219
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:52,791
I have ample time and energy.

220
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,712
I'll devote myself fully
to assisting your work.

221
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:00,832
Yes.

222
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:02,432
You're young.

223
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:05,031
You're a delicate young lady.

224
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:07,312
You know Yuehai Town.

225
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,511
It's dirt-poor.

226
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:10,031
Life is quite hard there.

227
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:11,992
Scruffy guys like us

228
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:15,031
barely eat decent meals
or get proper sleep.

229
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:16,072
We keep running

230
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,671
around the construction sites.

231
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,511
You know...

232
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:21,031
Mr. Zheng,

233
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:23,151
you look down on Yuehai this much?

234
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:26,072
I remember you once said

235
00:11:26,592 --> 00:11:30,511
that Yuehai has great potential
to be a thriving city.

236
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:33,631
I don't think
it will remain poor for long.

237
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:38,992
That's not what I meant.

238
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,911
Let me be honest.

239
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:49,631
Our veteran cadres in Yuehai

240
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:51,952
have been working

241
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,992
diligently for years,

242
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:58,312
dedicating their lives.

243
00:11:58,832 --> 00:11:59,871
They finally

244
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,992
have a chance for promotion

245
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:03,871
and then you came

246
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,551
to be the Town Mayor.

247
00:12:06,031 --> 00:12:08,391
Put yourself in their shoes.

248
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:12,151
So how do you think
they are feeling now?

249
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:14,791
Li.

250
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:18,312
You're only in your thirties, right?

251
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:19,952
No, you're not even thirty.

252
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:22,112
The future is yours.

253
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:24,952
So what?

254
00:12:26,832 --> 00:12:27,911
"So what?"

255
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:30,432
What about those veterans?

256
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:32,671
Young lady.

257
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,031
I thought you were kind.

258
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,031
How can you be so heartless?

259
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:37,832
No matter what you think,

260
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,952
I am the so-called "Little Woman".

261
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:41,712
What is that?

262
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:42,871
Little Woman.

263
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:43,952
English.

264
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,271
He knows English?

265
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:48,472
Mr. Zheng.

266
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:49,952
Let's cut to the chase.

267
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:52,551
You're the one
who doesn't want me there, right?

268
00:12:53,271 --> 00:12:54,432
Well, let me tell you.

269
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:57,151
I've been involved
in Yuehai's planning from the start.

270
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:59,072
I've always wanted to go there.

271
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:01,472
I'm definitely going.

272
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:05,592
And your days of dictatorial rule
in Yuehai are numbered.

273
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,592
If you keep trying to stop me,

274
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:11,432
I won't just be competing
for the Town Mayor position.

275
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:13,151
I'll be coming for your job.

276
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,432
You stubborn lady.
Why won't you listen to reason?

277
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:21,592
Fine.

278
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:24,072
Even if you don't care about others,

279
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:26,391
at least think about your parents.

280
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:28,271
If you work in Yuehai,

281
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:30,312
who will take care

282
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:31,312
of your parents?

283
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:32,391
Right?

284
00:13:32,832 --> 00:13:33,551
I believe

285
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:34,992
they wouldn't agree

286
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:38,151
for you to work in Yuehai, right?

287
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,072
Liu Dan.

288
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:04,391
I haven't seen you for ages.

289
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:08,791
Once Qiuping goes to Yuehai,

290
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:10,352
you must visit often.

291
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:13,151
Of course.

292
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:20,232
So this is your new leader?

293
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:23,151
Auntie, I'm not her leader.

294
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,031
We're just colleagues.

295
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:25,992
I told you.

296
00:14:26,751 --> 00:14:27,992
Call me Ms. Yan.

297
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:29,992
Alright, Ms. Yan.

298
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:31,911
First, I'm still young.

299
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:34,551
Second, I don't need being looked after.

300
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:36,352
Mr. Zheng,

301
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:38,511
once Qiuping is in Yuehai,

302
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:40,992
please look out for her.

303
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:46,871
Of course.

304
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:56,992
When are you leaving?

305
00:14:57,952 --> 00:14:59,072
I'll see you off.

306
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,432
Sweetie, I will see you off, too.

307
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,592
We won't stand in the way.

308
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:06,671
For truly great figures,

309
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:07,832
look to this age alone.

310
00:15:08,712 --> 00:15:10,871
Go there and give it your all.

311
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:19,112
Alright then. See you in Yuehai.

312
00:15:19,871 --> 00:15:22,472
Let's unite as one
and progress together.

313
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:23,791
Progress together.

314
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:24,151
Okay.

315
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:25,352
Mr. Zheng.

316
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:28,432
Take these with you and give them out.

317
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,151
Consider it a gift from me.

318
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:32,911
This is inappropriate.

319
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:33,832
Just take them.

320
00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:34,871
It's the thought

321
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:36,271
that counts.

322
00:15:36,472 --> 00:15:37,671
Besides, these

323
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,031
are quite valuable.

324
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,832
This is Qiuping's gesture.

325
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:41,751
I'll carry them

326
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:42,791
and see you off.

327
00:15:43,031 --> 00:15:43,432
Let's go.

328
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:44,791
Alright, thank you.

329
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:45,911
Well... I'm off.

330
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:46,911
- Uncle, Auntie.
- Goodbye.

331
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:48,592
Mr. Li, Ms. Yan.

332
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:49,312
Okay.

333
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:50,472
Bye.

334
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:51,112
Bye.

335
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:52,992
I need to thank you.

336
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,151
You did what I wanted to do.

337
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:56,871
What did I do?

338
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:58,511
Good job.

339
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:02,031
G-Goodbye.

340
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:09,312
Look.

341
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:11,791
Mr. Zheng brought so many treats.

342
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:14,151
Where is he?

343
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,352
- Yeah.
- In the restroom.

344
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:16,832
So many snacks.

345
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,031
So it's good news.

346
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:21,112
Yeah.

347
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:22,271
I bet

348
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:23,751
there is good news.

349
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:25,432
That's our Secretary.

350
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:27,671
He is so thoughtful.

351
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:28,671
He knows what I like.

352
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:29,791
What is this?

353
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:30,232
Candy.

354
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:30,992
I-I love candy.

355
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:31,631
- Come on.
- Come on.

356
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:32,751
I didn't buy those.

357
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,432
You didn't?

358
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:35,232
Then who did?

359
00:16:35,352 --> 00:16:36,271
I got it.

360
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:37,671
These are from

361
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:38,472
a fellow villager.

362
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:39,832
Everyone likes Mr. Zheng.

363
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:40,631
Come on.

364
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:42,791
Candy.

365
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:46,432
♪We toast to victory together♪

366
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:49,072
Candy.

367
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:51,391
The new Town Mayor of Yuehai,

368
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:52,280
Li Qiuping.

369
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,312
She bought these.

370
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:01,832
Take it.

371
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:02,952
Go away.

372
00:17:05,472 --> 00:17:06,872
So it's finalized.

373
00:17:09,872 --> 00:17:11,311
Ms. Li is quite capable.

374
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:14,311
She knows

375
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:18,751
that an army marches on its stomach.

376
00:17:21,672 --> 00:17:24,952
These pastries are really nice.

377
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:29,152
Everyone.

378
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:31,071
Tomorrow is the ceremony.

379
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:33,432
Keep working on your current tasks.

380
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,351
We'll visit the band first, okay?

381
00:17:35,392 --> 00:17:36,031
Got it.

382
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:36,311
Okay.

383
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:36,912
Okay.

384
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:37,551
Keep it up.

385
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:40,536
(Yuehai Town People's Government,
Yuehai Town Committee)

386
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:43,551
- So dangerous, Xie.
- What's up?

387
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:45,031
Won't you wait

388
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:45,791
for Ms. Li?

389
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,152
You've got this.

390
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,791
Me? Alone?

391
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:52,712
What's wrong?

392
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:08,311
Xie.

393
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:11,311
I know you feel wronged about this.

394
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:11,872
No, no.

395
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:13,351
E-Enough. I know you do.

396
00:18:13,751 --> 00:18:14,831
I did promise you

397
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,071
that position.

398
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:18,111
I broke my word.

399
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,152
I owe you an apology.

400
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:21,511
I'm sorry.

401
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:22,912
I know. It's not your fault.

402
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:24,152
No. It is my fault.

403
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:24,831
It is.

404
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:26,351
I'm sorry.

405
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:37,392
You need to face this, okay?

406
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:38,472
What?

407
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:39,511
Face it.

408
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:40,751
Okay?

409
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:42,192
- Okay.
- Okay.

410
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:42,791
Okay.

411
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:58,551
Xie.

412
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:01,551
Rest assured.

413
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:03,952
Li Qiuping

414
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:06,952
has never known hardship.

415
00:19:07,351 --> 00:19:08,192
She's not like us.

416
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:10,232
What is Yuehai like?

417
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:11,872
Poor environment.

418
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,591
How can she handle this?

419
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:14,432
She can't handle it.

420
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:15,392
Yeah.

421
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,472
You mean, she won't stay long?

422
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:18,712
I didn't say that.

423
00:19:18,952 --> 00:19:19,800
So what do you mean?

424
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:24,031
I mean,

425
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:28,192
Ms. Li will be here.

426
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:30,311
You need to host her properly.

427
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:31,992
Tend to her basic needs.

428
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:34,472
Make sure she isn't mistreated

429
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:37,511
and fully express our hospitality.

430
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,992
But, don't overdo it.

431
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,192
She won't be mistreated.

432
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,511
I won't overdo it.

433
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:20,712
Tied it up?

434
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:22,912
Okay, don't let go.

435
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:25,712
Let's do it right.

436
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:37,672
Hello.

437
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:39,751
Vendors aren't allowed.

438
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:40,472
Move along.

439
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,111
You misunderstood.

440
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:45,791
I'm not a vendor, I'm...

441
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,071
Hurry, come on.

442
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:49,672
It's okay.

443
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:50,192
Come on.

444
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:53,511
Mr. Xie.

445
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:54,472
We meet again.

446
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:56,831
Our warmest welcome.

447
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:58,031
This is Mayor Li.

448
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:58,831
Mayor?

449
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:00,551
This is Zhang, our publicity staff.

450
00:21:00,831 --> 00:21:01,831
Are you crazy?

451
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:02,472
Sorry.

452
00:21:02,672 --> 00:21:03,311
It's alright.

453
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:04,031
It's okay.

454
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,351
Will you forgive him?

455
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,831
Let's start over.

456
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:07,632
Come on.

457
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:08,511
Start over.

458
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:09,192
It's fine.

459
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:10,351
- But...
- It's okay.

460
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:11,791
We were prepared.

461
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,791
Look. Just a moment.

462
00:21:15,271 --> 00:21:15,672
Look.

463
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:20,432
Ms. Li.

464
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,751
We warmly welcome Ms. Li.

465
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,111
Come here.

466
00:21:31,432 --> 00:21:31,992
Ms. Li.

467
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,311
Heavy burden, huh?

468
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:36,952
It's a heavy burden for all of us.

469
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,872
Well said, Ms. Li.

470
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:42,192
I could have

471
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:43,031
sent a vehicle.

472
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:45,712
We have vehicles?

473
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:46,511
Well, no.

474
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:48,472
I would have picked you up
with my motorcycle.

475
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:51,192
I wouldn't let you walk here.

476
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:53,751
If I didn't walk here,
you'd have to carry me.

477
00:21:56,912 --> 00:21:57,432
Wait.

478
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:57,952
Don't.

479
00:21:58,271 --> 00:21:58,712
Okay.

480
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:01,672
There's more?

481
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,912
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

482
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:14,992
Okay, stop.

483
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:19,271
Welcome!

484
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,152
Ms. Li.

485
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:21,392
Time is tight.

486
00:22:21,712 --> 00:22:23,311
Everyone's busy with the ceremony

487
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:24,632
tomorrow.

488
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:25,831
It's a token gesture

489
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:27,511
and a rehearsal.

490
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:28,472
But of course,

491
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,912
we must give you a warm welcome.

492
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,632
We have to do what's proper, right?

493
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:33,992
It is indeed a token gesture.

494
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:36,311
Thank you so much, Mr. Xie.

495
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:37,031
Meng, come on.

496
00:22:37,392 --> 00:22:38,912
Share Ms. Li's burden.

497
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:39,432
Got it.

498
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:40,088
No need.

499
00:22:40,351 --> 00:22:41,511
I've got this.

500
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:42,031
All set.

501
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:43,511
Ms. Li, let me help you.

502
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:44,872
It's fine. I got this.

503
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:45,712
- Wait.
- Let's go.

504
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:46,872
This way.

505
00:22:47,192 --> 00:22:47,712
That way?

506
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:49,392
This way.

507
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:50,511
Where are we going?

508
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:51,511
Binjiang Guesthouse.

509
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,271
Guesthouse?

510
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:54,751
You stay at the guesthouse?

511
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:56,071
We live here.

512
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:58,992
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Lin, Mr. Tan,

513
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,591
Mr. Xie, I, and Qingtian

514
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:01,351
live in the dorm.

515
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:02,831
I'll stay with you.

516
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:03,551
I...

517
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,992
We haven't cleaned up the room.

518
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,071
It's a mess.

519
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:08,551
The guesthouse is better.

520
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:09,432
It's fine.

521
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:10,992
I can clean it up myself.

522
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,311
It's too small.

523
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:14,912
What?

524
00:23:15,472 --> 00:23:17,111
Ms. Li, you want to stay in the dorm?

525
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:19,952
They ate everything.

526
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,192
Am I late?

527
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:24,511
Is there no food left?

528
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:26,511
You must be Ms. Li.

529
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,152
I'm so sorry.

530
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:30,712
Dinner time has passed.

531
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:32,271
That's all there is.

532
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:32,791
That's all?

533
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,271
Ms. Li, here for dinner?

534
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:37,031
Well...

535
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:38,071
All gone.

536
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:40,432
Come on.

537
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,111
Ms. Xiao, what's going on?

538
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:44,751
Didn't I tell you

539
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,632
to prepare more?

540
00:23:45,952 --> 00:23:46,992
The ceremony is tomorrow.

541
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:48,192
Can you handle this?

542
00:23:49,751 --> 00:23:51,071
I did make extra.

543
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:52,551
You only took two portions.

544
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:54,351
One extra bun here,

545
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:55,472
one extra scoop there,

546
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:56,311
everything's gone.

547
00:23:58,152 --> 00:23:59,152
Well, Ms. Li.

548
00:23:59,392 --> 00:24:01,551
Everyone was exhausted today.

549
00:24:01,712 --> 00:24:02,992
Some didn't even get lunch.

550
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:04,551
So they ate everything.

551
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:05,712
You might be a bit late.

552
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:06,831
Right, Xiaoli.

553
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:07,992
Come here.

554
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:09,872
We're so sorry.

555
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:10,791
Yeah?

556
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:11,751
Tell me.

557
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,872
Is Ms. Xiao's cooking good or not?

558
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:15,031
Be honest.

559
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:16,152
Everything is gone.

560
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:17,271
It must be good.

561
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,392
I'm telling you, it's really not good.

562
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:21,912
You're lucky you didn't get any.

563
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:24,271
Meng Xiaoli.
Take Ms. Li to a restaurant.

564
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:24,591
Go on.

565
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:25,688
Hasn't she eaten?

566
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,351
No.

567
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:27,111
Ms. Li, let's go.

568
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,111
No need.

569
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:30,712
Can I use the kitchen?

570
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:32,192
This is yours.

571
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:32,952
Go ahead.

572
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:42,872
Need help, Ms. Li?

573
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:44,071
No need.

574
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:18,831
Smells amazing.

575
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:19,472
It's hot.

576
00:25:20,591 --> 00:25:21,311
Want a bite?

577
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:22,712
Just one bite.

578
00:25:22,992 --> 00:25:23,672
Don't.

579
00:25:23,672 --> 00:25:24,591
I want to try it.

580
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:25,152
Just eat.

581
00:25:25,271 --> 00:25:25,672
It's okay.

582
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,152
It's good.

583
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:36,031
Ms. Xiao, here.

584
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:38,392
Much tastier than yours.

585
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:45,751
Stop eating her food.

586
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:46,712
She hasn't eaten.

587
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:47,952
No, thanks.

588
00:25:48,152 --> 00:25:48,712
One bite.

589
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:49,712
It's good.

590
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:50,751
I'm full.

591
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:53,912
You double-checked these?

592
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:54,791
Yeah.

593
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:05,472
We should all match tomorrow.

594
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,392
White shirts.

595
00:26:07,672 --> 00:26:08,031
Alright?

596
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:09,872
Stop

597
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:12,472
emphasizing the dressing code.

598
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:13,872
It's pointless.

599
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:14,831
How is it pointless?

600
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:16,551
We're discussing important issues.

601
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,912
Don't distract us.
There's so much work...

602
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:20,031
Uniform clothing

603
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,152
represents our collective spirit.

604
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:22,791
We know that.

605
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,192
We'll be in white shirts in photos.

606
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,432
How do we do that?

607
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,511
We will dress up for the ceremony.

608
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,872
You don't need to demand anything.

609
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:30,392
Tan.

610
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:30,712
Okay.

611
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:31,992
Just be clean and neat.

612
00:26:32,152 --> 00:26:33,551
Let's get back to business.

613
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,632
There's another thing.

614
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:37,591
Mr. Tan estimated 4,000 people,
but there will be more people.

615
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:38,632
How do you know?

616
00:26:38,712 --> 00:26:39,472
On what basis?

617
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:41,712
Only 5,000 people came
to the Spring Festival

618
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:42,751
market.

619
00:26:42,791 --> 00:26:43,791
You can't refer to that.

620
00:26:44,031 --> 00:26:46,791
Don't underestimate the enthusiasm
of the Yuehai people.

621
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:48,872
Everyone should be vigilant

622
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:50,152
and responsible.

623
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,872
So, let's double-check the procedures.

624
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:53,712
Let's continue.

625
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:55,031
It's important.

626
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:55,992
The procedure.

627
00:26:56,111 --> 00:26:56,432
Yeah.

628
00:26:56,432 --> 00:26:57,071
The procedure.

629
00:26:57,952 --> 00:27:01,432
- First, the band performs.
- Right.

630
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:03,712
Brass band plus gongs and drums.

631
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,031
After both bands play...

632
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:05,831
Wait a moment.

633
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:07,551
After both bands play...

634
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:07,952
Wait.

635
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:10,712
Then flower presentation,
ribbon-cutting. The leader's speech.

636
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:11,632
Mr. Xie.

637
00:27:11,912 --> 00:27:12,992
We need to applaud.

638
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:14,392
Mr. Xie.

639
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:15,551
Right?

640
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:16,712
- Say something.
- Without this,

641
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:18,152
- how can he...
- I feel

642
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:20,031
- The town fellows...
- that's completely wrong.

643
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:21,031
Aren't you...

644
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,311
The people need to applaud.

645
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:23,751
They...

646
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:24,992
We're talking...

647
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:25,912
Come out here.

648
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:26,432
Get them

649
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:26,992
hyped.

650
00:27:27,152 --> 00:27:27,952
Mr. Zheng.

651
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:31,311
- Mr. Zheng.
- Stack these boxes in a row, okay?

652
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:33,351
Mr. Zheng. Xie is being difficult again.

653
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:35,071
Why so many pigeons?

654
00:27:35,192 --> 00:27:35,912
Extra food?

655
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:37,712
You only think about eating.

656
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,831
I had Qian Changyuan buy these pigeons.

657
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:41,872
We'll release doves of peace

658
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:43,271
at the ceremony.

659
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,031
For the vibe.

660
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:44,872
Okay.

661
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:45,311
Mr. Zheng.

662
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:46,432
You're mixing things up.

663
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:47,392
Doves of peace?

664
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,511
That's so irrelevant.

665
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,432
This is good.

666
00:27:49,712 --> 00:27:51,071
Call them doves of prosperity.

667
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:51,511
Exactly.

668
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:52,992
Doves of prosperity.

669
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:54,632
Great minds think alike.

670
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:58,831
Li.

671
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:00,031
When did you get here?

672
00:28:00,232 --> 00:28:00,831
Why didn't I...

673
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:02,872
I mean, Ms. Li.

674
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,031
Why didn't any of you tell me?

675
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:07,632
You left early.

676
00:28:07,672 --> 00:28:08,071
Yeah.

677
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:10,472
Come on in.

678
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:11,071
Come in.

679
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,152
Let me introduce you.

680
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:13,432
Formally.

681
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:15,311
Come on.

682
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:16,511
Hurry up.

683
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:19,111
Hurry up. Stand there.

684
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:20,751
Applause.

685
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:21,831
Alright.

686
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:23,192
Let's

687
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,351
formally welcome Ms. Li.

688
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:26,952
Li Qiuping

689
00:28:26,992 --> 00:28:29,952
is a highly educated graduate
of Dongjiang University.

690
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:31,511
She's the only graduate

691
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:33,831
from a top-tier university
in our entire county.

692
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:35,791
She was a secretary in the county.

693
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:38,432
She's highly educated and talented.

694
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:40,071
She speaks foreign languages.

695
00:28:40,672 --> 00:28:41,591
Li Qiuping.

696
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:44,432
Why don't you introduce yourself
in a foreign language?

697
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:45,192
Okay?

698
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:46,031
- Applaud.
- Alright!

699
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:46,912
- Alright!
- Alright!

700
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,551
I know none of you welcome me.

701
00:28:54,672 --> 00:28:56,952
Nor do you believe
I can be a good Town Mayor.

702
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:58,351
But if you think

703
00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:00,952
I'll leave after just a few days,

704
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:02,432
then you're underestimating me.

705
00:29:03,071 --> 00:29:05,551
I'm staying put right here.

706
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:09,368
That's it?

707
00:29:09,912 --> 00:29:10,271
Alright.

708
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:11,071
Alright.

709
00:29:12,712 --> 00:29:15,111
Ms. Li speaks great English.

710
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:16,831
Ms. Li.

711
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:17,831
Bravo.

712
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:19,192
What did you say?

713
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:22,111
It means "good".

714
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:22,992
You're acquainted.

715
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:24,672
You speak English?

716
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:26,672
What did Ms. Li say?

717
00:29:27,872 --> 00:29:30,311
I don't know.
Because she didn't speak English.

718
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:32,071
It sounded like French.

719
00:29:32,111 --> 00:29:32,872
French?

720
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:33,751
Yeah.

721
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:35,271
That's amazing.

722
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,392
She isn't an easy one to handle.

723
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:40,511
I won't repeat tomorrow's work plan.

724
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:41,912
Finish your work

725
00:29:41,992 --> 00:29:42,992
and rest early.

726
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:45,232
Get ready to win
our first battle tomorrow.

727
00:29:45,432 --> 00:29:45,712
Okay.

728
00:29:45,912 --> 00:29:46,511
- Okay.
- That's it.

729
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,912
- Okay.
- Okay.

730
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:50,031
That's it?

731
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:57,432
Mr. Zheng.

732
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:58,751
About my assignment...

733
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:00,392
Li, give me a second.

734
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:04,912
Let me emphasize something.

735
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:06,831
We'll leave at 4 AM tomorrow.

736
00:30:06,992 --> 00:30:08,712
So go to sleep, alright?

737
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:09,912
- Okay.
- Okay.

738
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:10,551
Yeah?

739
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:11,152
Mr. Zheng,

740
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:11,912
what should I do

741
00:30:11,952 --> 00:30:13,432
at the ceremony tomorrow?

742
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:14,712
Take care of the leaders

743
00:30:14,952 --> 00:30:16,432
from the county tomorrow.

744
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:17,232
Okay.

745
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:18,472
One more thing.

746
00:30:18,872 --> 00:30:20,392
At the end of the ceremony,

747
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,111
release the doves.

748
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:22,992
Okay, no problem.

749
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:25,912
Everyone seems so busy tonight...

750
00:30:26,311 --> 00:30:27,912
Forget it. You just came.

751
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:30,192
It's a long journey. Just get some rest.

752
00:30:30,351 --> 00:30:30,952
Ms. Zheng.

753
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:32,311
We need to check the accounts.

754
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:33,392
Let's talk inside.

755
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:33,831
Come on.

756
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:43,271
16, 17, 18,

757
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:44,152
- Meng.
- 19, 20...

758
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:45,712
Meng, let me help you.

759
00:30:45,751 --> 00:30:46,472
No need, Ms. Li.

760
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,271
I'm almost done.

761
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:48,351
No need.

762
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:49,511
Thank you.

763
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:54,952
One, two, three.

764
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:55,872
Yu.

765
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:57,632
It's fine, Ms. Li.

766
00:30:57,712 --> 00:30:58,192
All set.

767
00:30:58,432 --> 00:30:59,031
Let's go.

768
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:11,912
Mr. Xie, don't be shy.

769
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:12,912
I can help you.

770
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:13,591
Yeah.

771
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,071
Look after the leaders.

772
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:15,992
I got this.

773
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:18,432
Be careful with it.

774
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:21,111
Coming.

775
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:22,872
Catch it.

776
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:24,271
Okay.

777
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,311
Excuse me.

778
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:28,591
Yes, I called before.

779
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:30,912
I'm Tan Guangming. Can't find it?

780
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:33,952
Alright, please call this number
if you have any news.

781
00:31:34,712 --> 00:31:35,351
Okay, bye.

782
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:42,672
You want to make a call?

783
00:31:43,831 --> 00:31:44,728
Business or private?

784
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:45,311
Private.

785
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:46,952
Come on.

786
00:31:48,432 --> 00:31:49,311
L-Listen.

787
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:50,311
For personal calls,

788
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:52,751
both making and receiving calls
are charged.

789
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:56,271
How much per minute then?

790
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,152
- Where are you calling?
- The provincial capital.

791
00:31:58,672 --> 00:31:59,952
Fifty cents per minute.

792
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:01,511
Okay, no problem.

793
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:02,591
Ms. Li.

794
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:04,432
Once you're done,

795
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:05,632
please write down

796
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:08,111
where you called and how long you talked

797
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,152
on that notebook.

798
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:11,111
Then just put the money in the drawer.

799
00:32:11,912 --> 00:32:12,751
Okay, thanks.

800
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:23,791
Hello?

801
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:24,591
Hello?

802
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:27,071
Qiuping? How was your first day?

803
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,791
Did you impress everyone?

804
00:32:30,271 --> 00:32:31,271
I'm doing fine here.

805
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:34,271
Everyone's been very welcoming.

806
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:36,392
The ceremony is tomorrow.

807
00:32:36,672 --> 00:32:37,712
Wish me luck.

808
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:41,192
I have to go.

809
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:42,311
Love you.

810
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:43,551
Bye.

811
00:32:43,992 --> 00:32:44,511
Love you too.

812
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:45,192
Bye.

813
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:42,872
Lin, I'm brushing my teeth.

814
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:43,831
Just a second.

815
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:47,712
We're not eating anything again.

816
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:49,464
Why brush your teeth?

817
00:33:50,392 --> 00:33:51,351
It's my routine.

818
00:33:51,432 --> 00:33:53,351
- Mind your own business, okay?
- Okay.

819
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:04,351
Are you pressured
because Ms. Li brought so many books?

820
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:07,311
I'm busy during the day,

821
00:34:07,351 --> 00:34:08,151
but free at night.

822
00:34:08,191 --> 00:34:08,591
Good.

823
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:09,631
So I'm reading novels.

824
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:10,151
Good.

825
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:12,352
She put up the wall paneling.

826
00:34:13,591 --> 00:34:14,511
Impressive.

827
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:15,312
Done.

828
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:18,952
Here we go.

829
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,711
It looks like a college dorm.

830
00:34:23,071 --> 00:34:24,912
She's here to stay for long.

831
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:27,711
Nice flow.

832
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:30,111
Wish us success tomorrow.

(Celebrating the Launch of Yuehai City)

834
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:34,872
Hello, everyone.

835
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:37,312
Welcome to this news broadcast.

836
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:40,111
I'm Xu Zhimin from Pingchuan County TV.

837
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:43,952
I'm at Yuehai Town's Kaicheng Square.

838
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:44,832
As you can see,

839
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,591
it is incredibly lively.

840
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:48,832
The government
built a city out of this town.

841
00:34:57,631 --> 00:34:58,551
(During the ceremony,)

842
00:34:59,151 --> 00:35:00,832
(people came from all directions,)

843
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,832
(gathering here like rivers to the sea)

844
00:35:04,472 --> 00:35:06,071
(to witness this moment together.)

845
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:10,071
(Yuehai finally reached this point.)

846
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:13,191
(People planted seeds of hope)

847
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:16,272
(and stepped onto an unknown path.)

848
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:20,671
So many people

849
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,312
are coming to town.

850
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:23,352
That's right.

851
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,071
Kiddo.

852
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:27,952
Wake up. Still sleeping?

853
00:35:28,591 --> 00:35:30,872
Mom, I dreamed I found money.

854
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:32,511
- Really?
- Lots of money.

855
00:35:32,832 --> 00:35:34,472
Our dream is about to come true.

856
00:35:35,432 --> 00:35:36,671
Look sharp, everyone.

857
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:40,472
Show Chunmei Printery's spirit.

858
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,711
- Okay.
- Okay.

Paper trays.

862
00:36:17,912 --> 00:36:18,872
Ten cents for three.

863
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:20,872
Take a look.

864
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:21,752
Paper trays.

Ten cents for three.

866
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:24,151
Paper trays?

867
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:25,952
Nice trays.

868
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:27,192
Take a look.

869
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:28,231
Ten cents for three.

870
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:29,111
How much for four?

871
00:36:29,472 --> 00:36:31,031
Four? These are the last four.

872
00:36:31,071 --> 00:36:32,031
Twelve cents.

873
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:34,631
This one looks damaged.

874
00:36:38,392 --> 00:36:39,392
It's broken.

875
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:41,111
Take these three.

876
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:42,711
Ten cents for three?

877
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:43,912
Yeah.

878
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:44,551
Deal.

879
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:48,151
Here's ten cents.

880
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:48,551
Okay.

Okay, thanks.

883

Lots of people today.

884
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:54,992
We sold everything.

885
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,511
Granny, want some rice cake?

886
00:36:57,952 --> 00:36:58,392
Let's go.

887
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:10,832
Granny.

888
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:12,151
We sold everything.

889
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:13,511
Yeah. Let's go.

890
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:14,312
Let's go.

891
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:15,111
Okay.

892
00:37:15,872 --> 00:37:17,472
I can't hold it.

893
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:18,792
Easy, we'll wait up ahead.

894
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:25,111
- Are You blind?
- Why'd you kick me?

895
00:37:25,352 --> 00:37:26,551
Can't you see my granny?

896
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,191
So what? She wasn't hurt.

897
00:37:29,312 --> 00:37:30,392
Fine. Just you wait.

898
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:33,952
He ran away.

899
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:37,792
He's over there.

900
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:39,752
Why are you running?

901
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:41,671
You just wait.

902
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:43,111
Wait until I pee.

910
00:37:56,832 --> 00:37:57,872
Stop pushing.

911
00:37:58,031 --> 00:37:59,191
Don't rush.

912
00:37:59,191 --> 00:37:59,952
No cutting in line!

913
00:38:00,272 --> 00:38:00,671
- Come on.
- Come on.

914
00:38:00,671 --> 00:38:01,511
Where to next?

915
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:03,472
To the big tree of the AIC.

916
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:04,111
Where?

917
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:05,031
The big tree.

918
00:38:05,071 --> 00:38:06,551
Why did you draw such a huge map?

919

Yeah.

922
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:10,992
It's small enough.

923
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,504
Coming through!

924
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:14,992
Who's stepping on me?

925
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:15,671
Who?

926
00:38:15,912 --> 00:38:16,551
Slow down.

927
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:17,191
Don't push.

928
00:38:17,191 --> 00:38:17,752

It's that far?

933
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:23,472
Forget the line.

934
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:24,432
Let's go.

935
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:27,231
Whose money is this?

936
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,031

This way.

940
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:36,472
Over here.

941
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:38,352
Line up.

942
00:38:38,551 --> 00:38:39,312
One at a time.

943
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:42,511
Excuse me.

944
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:44,752
If you're here,

945
00:38:44,952 --> 00:38:46,432
where are the other departments?

946
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:48,600

Yes, Ms. Li.

950
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:00,392
Alright. Got it.

951
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:02,551

Stop pushing!

957
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:08,872
Let me through.

958
00:39:09,151 --> 00:39:09,912
Safety first.

959
00:39:10,352 --> 00:39:11,952
- Don't push the ladies.
- Stop it.

960
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:12,231
Move.

961
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:13,312
Lin.

962
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:14,671
Coming.

963
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:16,992
This is Tian.

964
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:17,952
This is Tian.

965
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:18,872
You've met before.

966
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:19,832
Yeah.

967
00:39:19,872 --> 00:39:20,111
Yeah.

968
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,912
This is the officer

969
00:39:21,952 --> 00:39:23,071
sent from the county.

970
00:39:23,312 --> 00:39:23,992
Work with him.

971
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:25,392
Keep everyone safe.

972
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:26,191
Maintain order.

973
00:39:26,272 --> 00:39:26,872
Stop pushing.

974
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:28,111
Safety first, understand?

975
00:39:28,111 --> 00:39:28,872
Rest assured.

976
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:29,952
Don't worry.

977
00:39:30,352 --> 00:39:31,111
Safety first.

978
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:31,992
I have to go.

979
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:32,952
Mr. Zheng.

980
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:34,312
I'll take Tan over there.

981
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:35,752
Stop pushing. Line up.

982
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:36,832
Excuse me.

983
00:39:36,992 --> 00:39:37,832

984
00:39:37,952 --> 00:39:38,792

00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:39,912

I'm short-handed right now.

990
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:46,111
Mr. Zheng.

991
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:48,111
Maintaining order
won't solve the problem.

992
00:39:48,832 --> 00:39:50,352
- What do you mean?
- I asked around.

993
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:51,312
Don't push.

994
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,872
The six departments
do paperwork at different locations,

995
00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:54,792
far from each other.

996
00:39:54,952 --> 00:39:55,792
The people

997
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:57,511
are suffering.

998
00:39:57,912 --> 00:39:58,872
What do you suggest?

999
00:39:58,912 --> 00:40:00,111
Bring them all together.

1000
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,472
That would speed things up.

1001
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:03,272
Good idea.

1002
00:40:03,631 --> 00:40:04,511
Let's do that.

1003
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:04,752
Okay.

1004
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:05,352
Right away.

1005
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:05,711
Okay.

Leave it to me.

1007
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:07,472
Alright, stop pushing.

1008
00:40:07,992 --> 00:40:08,752
Be careful.

1009
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:10,392
