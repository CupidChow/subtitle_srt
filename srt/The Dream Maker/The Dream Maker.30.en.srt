16
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:40,337
What did you promise me on the phone?

17
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:42,818
Didn't you say
all names were reviewed by Ms. Li?

18
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,577
You're getting bold, huh?

19
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:45,177
How insincere.

20
00:01:45,177 --> 00:01:46,738
You must censor yourself

21
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:48,337
until Ms. Li is satisfied.

22
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:49,658
Are you listening to me?

23
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,577
Seriously damaged...

24
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:52,697
Stop reading it! Stop!

25
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:56,857
Mr. Zheng,
Mr. Xie has reflected on himself.

26
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:58,898
No major losses have occurred yet.

27
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:01,697
Go away! Don't touch me.

28
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:03,178
During your absence,

29
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,497
the town government
lost its head and direction.

30
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,378
Yes, I bear responsibility too.

31
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:10,338
But I entrusted the major task to him.

32
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:12,177
After all your years as a cadre,

33
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:13,457
you couldn't make judgments?

34
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:15,258
You've betrayed my trust in you.

35
00:02:15,457 --> 00:02:16,378
It wasted effort.

36
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:17,938
You messed up the night school.

37
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:18,797
Mr. Zheng.

38
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:22,778
Xie barely slept for days
because of the night school.

39
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:23,697
That's true.

40
00:02:24,017 --> 00:02:26,058
Mr. Xie was thinking of Yuehai's people.

41
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:26,938
That's true.

42
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:28,938
Xie's intentions really were good.

43
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:30,978
And he paid for it all himself.

44
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:31,992
Stop speaking up for him.

45
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:35,137
With the wrong direction,
all efforts are futile.

46
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:36,897
How could he afford the cost?

47
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,338
His salary can't cover the fees
for any 'masters.'

48
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,058
It must've all come from Xuemei.

49
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:50,417
Xie.

50
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:51,737
Mr. Xie.

51
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:52,697
Alright, Xie.

52
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,658
Is he glaring at me?

53
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:00,857
Where are you going?

54
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:02,658
I'll censor myself again.

55
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:09,339
(Business with Courtesy, Customer First)

56
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:17,438
Mr. Zheng.

57
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,017
Mr. Xie knows he was wrong.

58
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:21,538
Yet you mentioned Xuemei.

59
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:23,577
You know that's his weak spot.

60
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:24,897
I regretted it.

61
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,417
Actually, Xie isn't entirely to blame.

62
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:29,577
I'll go apologize to him later.

63
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,897
How come so many 'masters'

64
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:36,258
popped up?

65
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:39,697
It's not strange.

66
00:03:40,098 --> 00:03:41,338
That means it's in demand.

67
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:44,258
Society is progressing and developing.

68
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:46,098
Temptations are everywhere.

69
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:49,778
The papers are full
of get-rich-quick stories.

70
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:52,577
A single idea can supposedly
change a whole family's fate.

71
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:55,498
Wouldn't you be tempted?

72
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:56,498
True.

73
00:03:58,098 --> 00:03:59,137
But having said that,

74
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:02,017
there's nothing wrong
with earning money.

75
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,778
The key is how we guide them

76
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,297
to earn it the right way.

77
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:07,117
Exactly.

78
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:09,378
That's why we run the night school.

79
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:12,778
Teach them skills
while improving their understanding.

80
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:14,857
Teach them the right money beliefs.

81
00:04:16,138 --> 00:04:17,978
Then, they won't be deceived again.

82
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,057
So we must make progress

83
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:24,617
materially and culturally.

84
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,098
Don't change the subject.

85
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:28,458
Give me your explanation.

86
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:31,218
You attended the Party School.

87
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:33,497
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

88
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,257
If you'd informed me in advance,

89
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,297
things wouldn't have
gotten so out of hand.

90
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:38,658
See? I knew it.

91
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:40,538
I feared you'd think like this.

92
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:42,297
If you had known

93
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:43,538
I left,

94
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:45,917
you'd have insisted on coming
back to work, right?

95
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:47,177
What about your health?

96
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:51,138
Hey, don't look at me like that.

97
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,698
I'm telling the truth.

98
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:55,898
What would I do without you?

99
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:59,098
No, I mean...

100
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:01,218
Look, while I was at the Party School,

101
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:03,377
so many classmates there

102
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:05,218
kept pestering me with questions.

103
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:06,937
Yet they never beat me.

104
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:08,497
That's when I thought

105
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:11,978
how good it would be
if Ms. Li were here.

106
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:14,136
You don't know how much I missed you.

107
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:17,297
Stop! That's getting a bit nauseating.

108
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:19,937
Mr. Zheng.

109
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:22,218
Since you went to the Party School,

110
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:23,297
I expect

111
00:05:23,338 --> 00:05:25,817
the county will talk to you soon.

112
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:27,857
It has happened.

113
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:31,138
Decheng.

114
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:32,978
Since you've graduated,

115
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:34,538
any thoughts?

116
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:36,057
Of course.

117
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,497
I'll arm myself
with the theoretical knowledge I learned

118
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,778
to better dedicate myself
to building Yuehai.

119
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,937
Are you serious

120
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:48,538
or playing dumb with me?

121
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:55,057
Decheng.

122
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,496
When you were running
for Secretary of Yuehai,

123
00:05:57,496 --> 00:06:00,578
you complained
about never getting promoted.

124
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,857
Now, your chance has finally come!

125
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:08,817
Decheng,

126
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,538
we've seen your achievements in Yuehai

127
00:06:12,778 --> 00:06:13,778
these past years.

128
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:18,578
We intend to transfer you back
to the county as Deputy County Magistrate.

129
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:20,218
Thank you.

130
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:23,817
You'll focus on its economy,
playing to your strengths.

131
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,098
What do you think?

132
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:29,658
Back to the county?

133
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:34,297
I'd rather not.

134
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:35,278
I...

135
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:38,937
County cadres hold grudges against me.

136
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,417
That was ages ago!

137
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,857
Now, the vast majority of the cadres

138
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,018
in the county

139
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,978
have recognized your ability
and character.

140
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:50,478
Look,

141
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,497
even a few holding grudges
is too much for me to handle.

142
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:55,297
Mr. Xia, as you know,

143
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:57,698
when our town government
was first established,

144
00:06:58,098 --> 00:06:59,098
Ms. Li, only one person,

145
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:01,257
threw us into utter chaos.

146
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:02,078
Right?

147
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:04,857
Don't digress. This is about you.

148
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:06,658
We're talking to you.

149
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:08,857
Be serious. Watch your attitude.

150
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:10,937
Sure, I'm serious.

151
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:20,937
Then, I'll be honest with you both.

152
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:23,377
I simply don't want to leave Yuehai.

153
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,218
If you stay in Yuehai,

154
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,338
you'll never get promoted.

155
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:30,497
Think carefully.

156
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:32,737
I know.

157
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:36,338
But I can't leave Yuehai now.

158
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:38,658
When can you leave? Tell me when.

159
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:42,712
When Yuehai's population
reaches 500,000,

160
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:44,138
I'll feel at ease.

161
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:47,417
At that point,
even if you assign me to guard the gate,

162
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:48,497
I'll do it.

163
00:07:50,297 --> 00:07:51,098
500,000?

164
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,377
God knows when!

165
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,218
You're being silly!

166
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:00,098
Decheng,

167
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:01,658
you must think twice.

168
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:04,257
At your age,

169
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:08,057
this might be your last chance.

170
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:27,737
Are you serious?

171
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:30,057
Such a great opportunity!

172
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:30,978
Just turned it down?

173
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,137
It's a promotion.

174
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:33,798
Exactly!

175
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:35,160
That's true.

176
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,218
Mr. Zheng formally declined Mr. Xia
and Mr. Guan.

177
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:42,777
He clearly stated
that he wants to stay in Yuehai.

178
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:52,857
What's with those expressions?

179
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:53,897
What?

180
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:57,098
Are you tired of working with me?

181
00:08:57,657 --> 00:08:59,357
I'm holding you back, aren't I?

182
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:00,798
Yes.

183
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:03,617
I knew you'd say that.

184
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:04,578
Even if I didn't,

185
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:06,178
you'd assume it was in my mind.

186
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,578
We're mainly concerned
about hindering your progress.

187
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:11,617
We're very reluctant to see you go.

188
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,897
That sounds a bit insincere.

189
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:15,678
Insincere?

190
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:17,537
The way you said it felt fake.

191
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,657
I meant it sincerely!

192
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:19,897
We've been friends for years.

193
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:20,578
Alright.

194
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,357
I'll take it as genuine, okay?

195
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:23,157
Come on.

196
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:25,497
Let's stop joking around now.

197
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,617
Let's be serious

198
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,497
and talk about the night school.

199
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,298
I'm not targeting you, Xie.

200
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:31,978
Let me apologize first.

201
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,857
I said something before out of anger.

202
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:34,840
- Well...
- It's fine.

203
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,377
Don't get discouraged about this.

204
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:38,058
Well,

205
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:39,737
there are so many new things now.

206
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,418
It's a trial-and-error process.

207
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:43,897
The night school
is definitely a good initiative.

208
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:45,818
We still need to keep running it.

209
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,818
Among us, Ms. Li is well-educated.

210
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:49,818
So I think,

211
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:50,818
starting today,

212
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:52,920
you should take over the night school.

213
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,537
Okay?

214
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:55,978
No problem. I already have some ideas.

215
00:09:56,218 --> 00:09:58,257
I think the class schedule
needs a change,

216
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,178
focusing mainly on practical courses.

217
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,537
We need to find some reliable teachers.

218
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:04,137
Any candidates?

219
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,338
My parents could fill in temporarily.

220
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:09,497
They were well-known teachers
in the county.

221
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:11,897
They've just been retired for years.

222
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:16,418
No wonder they love arguing
on the blackboard.

223
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:24,178
It's because they're intellectuals.

224
00:10:25,938 --> 00:10:27,857
I'll ask my parents to come help.

225
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,578
That way, we'll have ample time

226
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,058
to discover local talent.

227
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,857
I have another idea.

228
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:37,137
We can invite successful
self-employed individuals from Yuehai

229
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:39,578
to share their success stories.

230
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,257
For example, Ms. Gao.

231
00:10:42,537 --> 00:10:43,777
That's a great idea!

232
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:48,497
What about you?
Any thoughts or suggestions?

233
00:10:48,938 --> 00:10:50,698
Regarding the night school,

234
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:52,978
you didn't give me another chance.

235
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:57,377
Personally, I still feel a bit sad.

236
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:01,497
Just now, Ms. Li suggested
inviting Ms. Gao to lecture.

237
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,698
I think that's a fantastic idea.

238
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:04,818
I fully support it.

239
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:07,178
I also suggest you

240
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,377
give a speech.

241
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:10,058
Ms. Li is well-educated.

242
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:12,257
She can lecture too, right?

243
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:14,938
Mr. Tan used to teach, right?

244
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:15,438
Exactly.

245
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:17,777
Honestly,
when you're not butting heads with me,

246
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,897
what you say makes a lot of sense.

247
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:22,328
I never tried to start a fight.
I'm always pragmatic

248
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:23,320
in a discussion. Right?

249
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,818
You need to let others feel that.

250
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:27,978
Well, if you need me to do this job,

251
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:28,978
I'll obey.

252
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:30,318
Good.

253
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:34,137
Actually, Lin,
I think you could share your expertise.

254
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,497
You have years
of experience in engineering

255
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,737
and construction.

256
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:39,032
(Yuehai Town People's Government)
Your knowledge comes entirely

257
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,178
from practical experience.

258
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,017
I came at the right time.

259
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,377
Sorry! So sorry, Ms. Yan.

260
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:03,298
My mistake.

261
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:06,377
I got a few work calls
and got sidetracked.

262
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:08,657
Your class was swapped with Mr. Li's.

263
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:09,857
Your class is tomorrow.

264
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:10,978
Li Dafu?

265
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,596
Why should his class be swapped
with mine?

266
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:14,418
Where is he?

267
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:19,298
Mr. Li,

268
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:21,418
why did you order food we don't like?

269
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:25,978
Tasty, right? Try it.

270
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:27,338
This is good!

271
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:28,537
Let me try this.

272
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:34,098
Mr. Li.

273
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:36,137
Why is this so fishy?

274
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:40,818
It's too spicy.

275
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,058
No! Don't touch this.

276
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:46,578
Smells so familiar.

277
00:12:46,978 --> 00:12:48,737
It's the cilantro with tofu.

278
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:50,377
Hello, what would you like to order?

279
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,537
Let me see.

280
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:54,377
That night school teacher
is really impressive.

281
00:12:54,777 --> 00:12:56,418
Look how popular he is
with the students.

282
00:12:57,698 --> 00:12:59,137
This is stinky tofu.

283
00:12:59,257 --> 00:12:59,938
Smell it.

284
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:02,458
Do his students really like him?

285
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:03,857
This stinky tofu smells bad.

286
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:05,058
I think they prefer the food.

287
00:13:05,657 --> 00:13:08,017
That's fine too.
At least, I have customers.

288
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:10,338
Look at this.

289
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:12,657
I want two of your signature dishes.

290
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:13,517
Sure.

291
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:14,318
Like what?

292
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:16,818
Like on a hot summer day,

293
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,978
walking on the asphalt road,

294
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,257
I heard the sizzling sounds
under my shoes.

295
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:22,777
You're quite descriptive.

296
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:25,637
Okay.

297
00:13:26,377 --> 00:13:29,298
Now, let me summarize your feelings.

298
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:31,098
Fishy. Spicy.

299
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:32,298
Like soap.

300
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,857
Or like soda.

301
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:36,657
Taking us back to midsummer.

302
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,698
The soles of shoes melting on asphalt

303
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:42,657
are soft and sticky,

304
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:44,938
sizzling.

305
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:48,537
So evocative.

306
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,537
It all connects.

307
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:52,017
Mr. Li,

308
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,058
what you said sounds similar
to what we just said,

309
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:58,137
but somehow it feels different.

310
00:13:59,298 --> 00:13:59,798
Exactly!

311
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,178
Just moments ago,

312
00:14:01,497 --> 00:14:04,257
using your own feelings about life,

313
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:09,777
you created your first
modern misty poem.

314
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:10,737
We wrote a poem?

315
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:11,818
Misty poem?

316
00:14:11,897 --> 00:14:12,737
Misty poem.

317
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,397
Mr. Li, be honest.

318
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:15,578
When you were young,

319
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:18,497
did lots of girls chase after you?

320
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:19,578
Tell us!

321
00:14:19,978 --> 00:14:21,218
That's not true.

322
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:22,458
No jokes.

323
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:23,897
Mr. Li.

324
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:25,377
Did you ever write misty poems?

325
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:26,058
Misty poem.

326
00:14:26,137 --> 00:14:27,377
Misty poem.

327
00:14:27,377 --> 00:14:29,137
Yes, misty poems.

328
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:30,657
I did write some.

329
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:32,818
Could you recite one for us?

330
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:34,257
Let's hear him

331
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:35,218
recite one for us!

332
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:36,578
- Good!
- Good!

333
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:37,617
Come on, Mr. Li.

334
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:38,377
We want to hear it.

335
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:51,818
The hibiscus flowers have blossomed,

336
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:56,857
melted on the windowpane outside.

337
00:14:58,657 --> 00:14:59,818
I count specks of dust.

338
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:03,938
I count the time in the hourglass.

339
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:09,017
Wind brings the music from afar.

340
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,058
My hand touches only the cold wall.

341
00:15:14,978 --> 00:15:16,897
Thorns spread.

342
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:20,098
Wilderness grows.

343
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,298
I wait for dawn.

344
00:15:24,017 --> 00:15:26,257
But nights without you

345
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,178
are a wilderness of thorns,

346
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:34,137
also thorns of wilderness.

347
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:35,058
I don't get it.

348
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:39,117
That's it?

349
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:44,017
It's beautiful,

350
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,777
but I just don't understand it.

351
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:47,178
Did you understand it?

352
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:48,178
- No.
- No.

353
00:15:48,377 --> 00:15:49,497
That's right.

354
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:51,938
My talent is limited.

355
00:15:53,098 --> 00:15:57,098
It's the first misty poem
I ever wrote in my life.

356
00:15:57,617 --> 00:15:58,578
It's really good.

357
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:01,338
Sir, that's not what I meant.

358
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:02,458
It's quite good.

359
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:09,497
Look how late it is.

360
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:15,737
Ms. Li, Ms. Yan.

361
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:17,617
There's not much food left,

362
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,497
but the buns will be ready soon.

363
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:20,857
Could you wait a bit?

364
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:21,978
Okay.

365
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:25,578
Nights without you

366
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:28,698
are a wilderness of thorns,

367
00:16:30,017 --> 00:16:31,857
also thorns of wilderness.

368
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:35,257
Mom, wasn't this the poem

369
00:16:35,257 --> 00:16:37,017
Dad gave you years ago?

370
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:40,777
What kind of poem is this?
Just a few meaningless sentences.

371
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:44,137
But you recited it with feelings.

372
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,978
Wait. Meaningless sentences?

373
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,897
If you think they're meaningless,

374
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:51,338
then just don't recite them.

375
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:54,298
Why?

376
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:57,617
It's called Hibiscus,
and it's always been mine.

377
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,257
Listen,

378
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:01,777
you shouldn't recite it for others.

379
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:04,297
How does it belong to you?

380
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:05,858
How is it not mine?

381
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,337
It is mine.

382
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:14,537
Dad, now I have to criticize you.

383
00:17:14,978 --> 00:17:16,938
You gave this poem to Mom back then.

384
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:17,938
So it belongs to Mom.

385
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:28,097
Okay, fine.

386
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:29,218
Let me ask you.

387
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:33,458
Wang Wei's poem "Thinking of My Brother
on the Double Ninth Festival".

388
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:36,537
Is it Wang Wei's poem
or his brother's poem?

389
00:17:38,898 --> 00:17:40,777
I think that makes perfect sense.

390
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:42,938
Is he Wang Wei?

391
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,257
He was just a high school teacher.

392
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:47,537
So good at glorifying himself.

393
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,218
35 years ago, on September 2,

394
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:53,057
when you gave me this poem,
you said to me,

395
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:56,938
"From this moment,
this poem belongs to you."

396
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,737
You remember it so clearly.

397
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:04,497
You think
my memory is fading like yours?

398
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:07,698
I'm not like you tricking students
with useless stuff.

399
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:09,858
Ms. Yan.

400
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:12,698
Say whatever you like.

401
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:14,858
At least, students enjoy my class,

402
00:18:15,297 --> 00:18:16,218
not someone else's.

403
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:20,497
Fine.

404
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,698
Tonight, I'll show you the power

405
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:24,618
of math and science.

406
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:28,898
This is a classic math problem.

407
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:31,638
It's also the most common type.

408
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:35,497
One pool is filling with water
on one side and draining on the other.

409
00:18:35,938 --> 00:18:38,178
So, how long until the pool is full?

410
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:40,257
Now, one might ask,

411
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:43,978
who would fill a pool
while simultaneously draining it?

412
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,057
Isn't that just foolish behavior?

413
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,737
Listen to me, everyone.

414
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:54,737
My mom's lectures are still so humorous.

415
00:18:55,017 --> 00:18:55,737
It's so good.

416
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:57,938
What's so good about it?

417
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:00,458
No one can understand my lessons.

418
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:02,057
But they can understand hers?

419
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:04,817
Did you understand?

420
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:06,337
I didn't.

421
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:10,378
Let's think about it differently.

422
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:15,138
If we imagine
this pool of water is money,

423
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:17,378
it becomes a situation where

424
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:19,497
we're earning money while spending it.

425
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:22,337
How long until we become broke?

426
00:19:22,658 --> 00:19:24,898
Does anyone know
how to solve this problem?

427
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:27,777
If no one can solve it,

428
00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:30,057
listen to me carefully.

429
00:19:30,978 --> 00:19:32,938
Dad, what are you doing here?

430
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,218
Your mom

431
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,938
loves the dried pickled vegetable buns.

432
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:37,378
I'll take some back for her.

433
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:38,618
Have they sold out?

434
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:39,817
No, there is plenty left.

435
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:40,618
Great.

436
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:41,737
Dad.

437
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:45,537
I actually think
you've always loved Mom.

438
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:47,378
Come on.

439
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:49,978
What a silly thing to say!
Of course, I do!

440
00:19:58,138 --> 00:19:58,898
Ms. Li.

441
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,057
There's something I need to tell you.

442
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:04,458
Go ahead.

443
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:07,698
Du Tao called from Shanghai yesterday.

444
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:09,978
He gave up the land in Yuehai.

445
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:12,537
Okay.

446
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:27,497
Ms. Li, is this enough?

447
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:28,938
Sure.

448
00:20:29,158 --> 00:20:29,658
Thank you.

449
00:20:29,658 --> 00:20:30,378
You're welcome.

450
00:20:58,297 --> 00:20:59,178
Ms. Li.

451
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:03,817
Should you really
be fixing this public property yourself?

452
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:07,497
Well done.

453
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:29,577
Back when Yuehai wasn't developed yet,

454
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:32,898
it was really tough
for me to get an order.

455
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:36,458
Many clients thought
our place was too far away.

456
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:40,537
Deals eventually fell through,
one after another.

457
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:42,618
So I made a decision.

458
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:46,337
We wouldn't be picky.
We'd print anything,

459
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,458
from big signs and trademarks

460
00:21:48,737 --> 00:21:51,178
down to small labels like this.

461
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:53,938
See how fine the detail is?

462
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:55,577
Here,

463
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:56,537
take a look.

464
00:21:56,577 --> 00:21:57,592
These are labels

465
00:21:57,976 --> 00:21:59,192
for things like canned goods

466
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:00,178
and liquor.

467
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:00,737
Brandy.

468
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:02,658
The colors are printed beautifully.

469
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:03,378
Well,

470
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:04,737
this is what I mentioned.

471
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:06,898
They're boiled water coupons.

472
00:22:07,337 --> 00:22:08,938
So now, wherever I go,

473
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:10,218
I can proudly say

474
00:22:10,378 --> 00:22:12,337
there's nothing Yuehai can't print!

475
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:13,218
Good.

476
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:18,418
I used all my savings

477
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:20,458
and bought 10,000 watches

478
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:21,618
just like this.

479
00:22:22,178 --> 00:22:23,737
I took those 10,000 watches

480
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:26,698
to the far west of the county
and sold them for 18 yuan each.

481
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:28,337
10,000 watches were all sold.

482
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:30,978
In the end, I earned 97,000 yuan.

483
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:33,017
The allocation of equity shares

484
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:35,337
must be calculated clearly in advance.

485
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:36,577
If there are

486
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:40,218
disagreements among the shareholders,

487
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:41,218
what can we do?

488
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:44,017
We use the calculated equity allocation
to determine

489
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,297
who makes the call.

490
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,328
Sales?

491
00:22:47,064 --> 00:22:47,777
One word.

492
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:49,848
(Wolf)

493
00:22:50,257 --> 00:22:50,840
Wolf?

494
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,737
(Fierce)

495
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:53,752
Be fierce with yourself!

496
00:22:54,577 --> 00:22:55,938
Dare to think, act, and fight.

497
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:58,218
There's another crucial point.

498
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,297
We need to...

499
00:23:01,737 --> 00:23:02,458
Keep your cool.

500
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:04,257
I remember one time,

501
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,378
I was trying to get close to a client.

502
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:07,658
I thought of a way.

503
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:08,978
Should I

504
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:11,178
use his kid as a way in?

505
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:12,257
I waited

506
00:23:12,698 --> 00:23:13,618
for the chance to come.

507
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,458
Just on the day I decided to give up,

508
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:16,497
his child

509
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:18,817
accidentally fell into the lake
in his backyard.

510
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:20,297
I'm a good swimmer.

511
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:21,777
I dove right in

512
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:23,378
and saved that kid.

513
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:32,178
I know.

514
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:33,097
What do you know?

515
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,858
After all these years of struggle,

516
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:37,978
what's my biggest takeaway?

517
00:23:38,737 --> 00:23:39,737
It's tough being a woman.

518
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:43,138
It's even tougher being a businesswoman.

519
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:46,097
But we women must never yield

520
00:23:46,698 --> 00:23:47,817
at any time!

521
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:48,777
Never yield!

522
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:51,938
This isn't anything valuable.

523
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:56,097
It's a shard from the porcelain bowl
I used when begging.

524
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:58,378
This bowl was left to me by my grandpa.

525
00:23:58,658 --> 00:24:01,218
My parents died when I was little,
and Grandpa raised me.

526
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:03,497
When I was eight, I had a high fever.

527
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,698
It lasted seven days and nights.

528
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,257
He heard about some remedy
two miles outside town.

529
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:09,337
He ran to buy it.

530
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:11,418
When I finally woke up again,

531
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,138
he was lying on the ground.

532
00:24:15,737 --> 00:24:17,898
A car had hit him.

533
00:24:18,817 --> 00:24:20,938
After that, I begged alone to survive.

534
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,337
Once, I remember

535
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:26,057
I fought another beggar over territory.

536
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:27,352
As a result, my bowl was broken.

537
00:24:29,898 --> 00:24:31,418
Do you know how desperate I felt then?

538
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:33,418
I thought to myself,

539
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:35,737
"Life is too hard."

540
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,218
"Too bitter."

541
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:41,537
"Maybe I should just end my own life."

542
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:44,057
So I slashed my wrist.

543
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:45,297
But then,

544
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:47,178
the moment I saw the blood,

545
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:48,418
I suddenly realized

546
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:52,497
that if I'm not afraid of death,
why fear living?

547
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:55,057
So I pressed on my wound and ran

548
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:56,218
to the hospital.

549
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:57,017
I kept running.

550
00:24:57,138 --> 00:24:57,858
I kept thinking

551
00:24:57,978 --> 00:25:00,178
that I wanted to live and couldn't die.

552
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:04,537
I'm standing here right now.

553
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:05,658
I survived!

554
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:08,618
I've gone off track.

555
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:11,378
Back to sales.

556
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:13,858
Don't underestimate salespeople.

557
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:16,938
It's because of salespeople

558
00:25:17,178 --> 00:25:18,418
that goods flow through Yuehai,

559
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:21,618
nationwide, and across the world.

560
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:24,458
At our level,
we're just sales 'monkeys'.

561
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:25,497
On a grand scale,

562
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:26,858
we're like Sun Wukong,

563
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,257
the monkey

564
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:30,938
who can somehow do anything.

565
00:25:32,337 --> 00:25:32,938
Good!

566
00:25:33,218 --> 00:25:33,898
Well said!

567
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,858
I'm Bajie.

568
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:43,337
After all this,

569
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:45,737
what I'm trying to say is

570
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,698
that a woman

571
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:49,938
can be forced to be strong.

572
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,418
Even without a man,

573
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,938
women can still live proudly.

574
00:26:02,337 --> 00:26:03,057
Good!

575
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,017
Stay humble!

576
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:05,938
Goodbye.

577
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,378
Lili.

578
00:26:10,017 --> 00:26:10,737
Heading home?

579
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:11,398
Yes.

580
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:12,858
Let me give you a ride.

581
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:13,777
It's on my way.

582
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:15,017
Is it?

583
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:16,618
Sure.

584
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:18,337
How exactly?

585
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,737
Pretty convenient.

586
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:22,858
Thanks, but I'll walk alone.

587
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,137
(Yuehai Town People's Government)

588
00:26:25,698 --> 00:26:26,378
Lili!

589
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:28,218
Do you have a flashlight?

590
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:29,618
Yes, why?

591
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:30,497
Nothing.

592
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:32,577
The streetlight on Ping'an Road is out.

593
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:35,458
Be careful walking alone at night.

594
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:43,458
Now, you've scared me!

595
00:26:44,378 --> 00:26:45,097
Let's go together.

596
00:26:45,257 --> 00:26:47,097
Alright. Come on.

597
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,178
Hop on.

598
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:51,497
Okay.

599
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:53,497
Hold tight.

600
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:57,138
I agree.

601
00:26:57,138 --> 00:26:58,017
I'll vote for you.

602
00:26:58,178 --> 00:26:58,777
Well...

603
00:26:58,777 --> 00:26:59,537
Yes!

604
00:26:59,537 --> 00:27:00,618
I could also...

605
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,577
I can do it myself.

606
00:27:02,618 --> 00:27:03,118
Mr. Zheng!

607
00:27:03,698 --> 00:27:04,698
Mr. Zheng looks handsome!

608
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,658
Mr. Zheng really is handsome!

609
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:14,138
You're making me blush.

610
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:17,577
Is it because I dressed well today?

611
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:18,658
Yes, very nice!

612
00:27:18,858 --> 00:27:20,017
- Handsome!
- Handsome!

613
00:27:20,257 --> 00:27:21,497
Do you know why?

614
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:22,577
No.

615
00:27:22,817 --> 00:27:24,658
I'm wearing Mr. Xie's clothes.

616
00:27:25,257 --> 00:27:27,858
I thought they looked familiar!

617
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:28,658
See?

618
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:30,777
I'll change later.
You return them to him.

619
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:31,438
No.

620
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:34,378
Alright, no more jokes.

621
00:27:34,537 --> 00:27:35,618
Let's get down to business.

622
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:37,017
Before class begins,

623
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,497
I'd like to say a few words.

624
00:27:40,017 --> 00:27:41,418
I think first we all need

625
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:43,497
to thank your bosses.

626
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:46,777
Well, social production...

627
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:49,978
Without money from the government,
how could I build the city?

628
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:52,178
I had to raise funds.

629
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:55,478
Isn't Mr. Zheng great?

630
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:57,218
Sure, he is pretty impressive.

631
00:27:58,257 --> 00:27:59,898
Plus, I know lots of stories about him.

632
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:01,097
I'll tell you later.

633
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:01,938
Okay.

634
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:06,658
We're graduating soon. Any plans?

635
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:10,817
I think Changyuan's class is quite good.

636
00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:12,664
I want to do sales with him.

637
00:28:13,537 --> 00:28:14,257
But...

638
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:18,057
But what? Say it!

639
00:28:18,737 --> 00:28:19,817
I already asked him,

640
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:21,418
and he said no.

641
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:23,096
And then?

642
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,057
Then that was it.

643
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,017
No means no.

644
00:28:30,698 --> 00:28:32,138
You haven't understood his class.

645
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:38,577
If Qian Changyuan

646
00:28:39,097 --> 00:28:40,698
or Gao Xuemei were refused,

647
00:28:41,537 --> 00:28:42,537
what would they do?

648
00:28:48,938 --> 00:28:49,618
Is this spicy?

649
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:50,497
A bit spicy.

650
00:28:52,418 --> 00:28:53,537
Will you eat the meat?

651
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:54,698
If not, give it to me.

652
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:55,777
Don't waste it.

653
00:28:56,698 --> 00:28:57,777
Dad, don't take hers.

654
00:28:58,057 --> 00:28:58,577
Have mine.

655
00:28:58,698 --> 00:28:59,198
No.

656
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,097
You've worked hard. Eat more.

657
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:02,057
Lean meat.

658
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:03,817
Eat less fatty meat.

659
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:05,218
My good daughter.

660
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:08,938
Oh, Dad, Mom. I want
to discuss something with you.

661
00:29:09,938 --> 00:29:12,938
The first term is ending soon.

662
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,658
We should award a certificate

663
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:16,257
to every graduating student.

664
00:29:17,537 --> 00:29:21,218
Then, we should select a good student
as a role model.

665
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:24,138
Let me cut in.

666
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:26,017
When it comes to a good student,

667
00:29:26,218 --> 00:29:28,057
the first person who came to my mind

668
00:29:28,337 --> 00:29:29,497
was Wang Lili.

669
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,737
Sorry.

670
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:34,097
Funny.

671
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:36,458
The second person
in my mind was also Wang Lili,

672
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:37,912
but she was the only one.

673
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:41,577
Wang Lili

674
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,537
is very smart
and grasps concepts quickly.

675
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,158
Yes.

676
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:47,138
Her thinking really stands out.

677
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:52,497
What's going on today?

678
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:53,497
Sorry.

679
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:55,458
It seems we don't need a meeting.

680
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,938
The teachers' opinions are unanimous.

681
00:29:58,618 --> 00:29:59,777
So Wang Lili is selected.

682
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:01,858
I'll have Mr. Zheng award her.

683
00:30:02,418 --> 00:30:03,064
- Agreed.
- Okay.

684
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,418
Good.

685
00:30:04,577 --> 00:30:08,458
(Graduation Certificate)
With good grades, I'm allowed to graduate.

686
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:14,337
Sun Xiaoyan.

687
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:15,337
Yang Xiaohai.

688
00:30:17,057 --> 00:30:18,017
Check please.

689
00:30:18,104 --> 00:30:18,872
(Graduation Certificate)
Coming.

690
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:21,898
(Strengthen Market Management)

691
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:22,537
Mr. Zheng.

692
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:24,938
Okay. Come again.

693
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:28,178
Zhu.

694
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:31,097
Here's the red banner
recognizing your work.

695
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,618
You came personally.

696
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:34,777
Well, Xie was supposed to come,

697
00:30:34,938 --> 00:30:37,418
but he's busy, so I came instead.

698
00:30:37,898 --> 00:30:40,577
Your hygiene standards are great.
Keep it up.

699
00:30:40,698 --> 00:30:42,057
Absolutely, rest assured.

700
00:30:42,104 --> 00:30:43,000
(Red Banner)
Thank you.

701
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,737
Not at all.

702
00:30:45,858 --> 00:30:46,458
Mr. Zheng.

703
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,418
I need to report something.

704
00:30:49,497 --> 00:30:50,257
What is it?

705
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:53,497
About the new location
for the night school,

706
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:54,537
it's settled.

707
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:56,097
Well done, Qian Changyuan!

708
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:57,898
That town mayor is difficult.

709
00:30:58,138 --> 00:31:00,577
You got it done so fast. Impressive.

710
00:31:00,978 --> 00:31:03,418
It is the place we chose, right?

711
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,237
Yes.

712
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,257
The unused ancestral hall
we saw last time.

713
00:31:06,577 --> 00:31:08,618
Can we hang our night school's sign?

714
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,698
Of course. No problem.

715
00:31:11,017 --> 00:31:11,537
That's good.

716
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:12,658
But there's one thing

717
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,577
I need to confess.

718
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:17,418
That town mayor proposed a condition.

719
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:19,337
I agreed without consulting you first.

720
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,178
What is it?

721
00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:21,658
He wants five to ten spots

722
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:25,418
for each class each year.

723
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:28,658
No problem.

724
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:29,777
Okay.

725
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:31,057
What a smooth talker!

726
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:31,832
Qian Changyuan.

727
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,017
No big deal. No...

728
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:38,337
He keeps showing up.

729
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:39,858
What's wrong?

730
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:41,858
Mr. Zheng.

731
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:43,817
Have you seen Yang Xiaohai?

732
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:45,178
Where?

733
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:46,938
Behind me, my six o'clock.

734
00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:50,297
He wants to learn sales from me.

735
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,378
But I refused, so he came in my way.

736
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:53,138
Look.

737
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:54,898
His bowl is empty.

738
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:56,337
He's pretending to eat there.

739
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:57,458
He's been like this

740
00:31:57,878 --> 00:31:59,138
for two whole months.

741
00:31:59,658 --> 00:32:00,418
In your way?

742
00:32:01,297 --> 00:32:02,017
He made a move?

743
00:32:03,817 --> 00:32:04,858
I'd have preferred that.

744
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:06,138
An easy "no" for me.

745
00:32:06,378 --> 00:32:07,978
Guess what makes it hard for me?

746
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:10,817
He really is different from before.

747
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:12,898
He is respectful to me.

748
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:14,097
I'm in a dilemma.

749
00:32:14,297 --> 00:32:15,378
Why not teach him?

750
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:16,678
Right?

751
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:18,097
Just accept him.

752
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,658
Teaching him won't make you lose.

753
00:32:21,138 --> 00:32:24,257
You'll get a helper,
a good young man. Right?

754
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:26,817
Alright, let me show you.

755
00:32:27,418 --> 00:32:27,918
Eat.

756
00:32:28,097 --> 00:32:29,178
Fine. You eat.

757
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:30,458
It's delicious.

758
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:30,978
Here.

759
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:32,337
I'll pay myself.

760
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,577
Okay.

761
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:36,218
Yang Xiaohai.

762
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:39,317
Sit.

763
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:47,777
Mr. Zheng.

764
00:32:49,418 --> 00:32:49,918
Sit.

765
00:32:52,497 --> 00:32:53,257
Mr. Qian.

766
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:55,097
You're here too.

767
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:57,577
W-What a coincidence.

768
00:32:58,497 --> 00:33:00,497
Yes, what a coincidence.

769
00:33:04,497 --> 00:33:05,777
Do you want to be my apprentice?

770
00:33:05,978 --> 00:33:06,478
Yes, I do!

771
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:08,257
To learn sales?

772
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:08,858
Yes.

773
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:10,297
Alright.

774
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:11,178
Really?

775
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:12,458
Master!

776
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,737
You misunderstood. Get up.

777
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:14,777
Get up.

778
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:16,978
You just said "Alright."

779
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,537
Now, I'm giving you a chance.

780
00:33:21,057 --> 00:33:22,458
Today, right in front of Mr. Zheng,

781
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:23,858
I'll test you.

782
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:26,337
If you pass, I'll teach you.

783
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:27,418
Got it?

784
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:32,938
Sure.

785
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:33,878
Come on.

786
00:33:37,658 --> 00:33:39,898
Assume Mr. Zheng is your customer.

787
00:33:40,858 --> 00:33:44,978
You have five minutes
to sell this pot to him.

788
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:47,037
Start.

789
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,337
Don't be nervous. You can do it.

790
00:34:00,978 --> 00:34:01,737
Go for it, Xiaohai.

791
00:34:02,017 --> 00:34:02,817
30 seconds passed.

792
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:20,536
Are you appraising it?

793
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:21,697
One minute now!

794
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:27,818
M-Mr. Zheng.

795
00:34:30,378 --> 00:34:32,017
P-Please buy this pot.

796
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:33,978
I-It can hold water.

797
00:34:34,258 --> 00:34:36,338
Nonsense! What pot can't hold water?

798
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:38,537
It's big.

799
00:34:38,978 --> 00:34:40,258
It can hold a lot of water.

800
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,560
It can hold a lot of water.

801
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,657
A watering can is bigger.

802
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:43,818
Why wouldn't I just buy that?

803
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:46,497
Why on earth should I buy this pot?

804
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:48,378
Because...

805
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:51,378
Because...

806
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:54,657
He's Mr. Zheng!

807
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:55,497
What?

808
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:57,057
Mr. Zheng.

809
00:34:57,657 --> 00:34:59,258
Y-You buy this pot.

810
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:08,898
Mr. Zheng.

811
00:35:09,258 --> 00:35:10,978
See? He has a wooden head.

812
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:13,057
How do I teach him?

813
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:17,738
Ms. Li.

814
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:20,978
I can't drink anymore! I really can't!

815
00:35:21,378 --> 00:35:22,858
Your drinking capacity is impressive.

816
00:35:23,298 --> 00:35:25,057
I thought
I was the best drinker in Yuehai.

817
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:26,217
Turns out it's you!

818
00:35:26,617 --> 00:35:28,458
I think you can drink more.

819
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:29,338
Come on.

820
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,137
Alright.

821
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:33,697
So what can I do for you?

822
00:35:34,577 --> 00:35:36,097
I'll definitely help you with anything

823
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:38,858
except Yang Xiaohai.

824
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:40,818
You know what?

825
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:43,418
I actually want
to talk about Yang Xiaohai.

826
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:45,818
I'll cut straight to the point.

827
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:48,497
Just take Yang Xiaohai as your student.

828
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:50,818
Ms. Li, it's not
that I don't want to take him.

829
00:35:51,177 --> 00:35:53,497
To be frank, he's a bit wooden.

830
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:55,418
He simply isn't cut out for sales.

831
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,818
I'm not the right teacher for him.

832
00:35:58,258 --> 00:35:58,818
I understand.

833
00:35:59,217 --> 00:36:00,818
Mr. Zheng mentioned that too.

834
00:36:01,418 --> 00:36:04,537
Xiaohai is indeed kind of wooden.

835
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:06,978
It's a bit hard for him to do sales.

836
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:07,697
Exactly.

837
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:11,697
But he possesses something
you're lacking.

838
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:13,298
What is it?

839
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:16,738
Finish this cup, and I'll tell you.

840
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:17,318
I...

841
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:21,818
Alright, okay.

842
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:22,858
I'll drink too.

843
00:36:24,378 --> 00:36:25,258
Thank you.

844
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:33,017
I really can't drink.

845
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:34,298
- I...
- Come on.

846
00:36:35,537 --> 00:36:36,378
Think about it.

847
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:38,818
You're running such a big business now.

848
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:40,378
You're a big boss.

849
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:43,298
You carry so much cash
when you go out for deals.

850
00:36:43,657 --> 00:36:47,258
I think your assets
and personal safety should be protected.

851
00:36:48,097 --> 00:36:51,258
Look, Xiaohai is young and strong.

852
00:36:51,738 --> 00:36:53,097
Plus, he is reliable.

853
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,577
Having him as your bodyguard

854
00:36:55,978 --> 00:36:57,217
wouldn't hurt, right?

855
00:36:57,858 --> 00:37:00,177
He really can fight.

856
00:37:01,657 --> 00:37:02,938
Remember Ms. Chang?

857
00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:06,617
She had two bodyguards with her.

858
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:11,217
It shows she's serious
about protecting her assets and safety.

859
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:12,697
So, your business

860
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,458
will be bigger than hers, right?

861
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:15,378
Absolutely.

862
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:17,298
Don't you need a bodyguard?

863
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:23,497
Ms. Li.

864
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:25,097
I think

865
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:28,577
you're way better at sales than I am.

866
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:30,697
Fine.

867
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:32,378
Okay, Ms. Li.

868
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:33,858
I promise.

869
00:37:34,657 --> 00:37:37,208
I will genuinely consider this.

870
00:37:37,752 --> 00:37:39,818
You really need to think carefully.

871
00:37:44,537 --> 00:37:45,938
No, I can't drink anymore.

872
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:46,778
I have to go.

873
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,057
Wait just a second.

874
00:37:49,738 --> 00:37:51,258
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

875
00:38:02,778 --> 00:38:04,258
Ms. Li. What does this mean?

876
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:06,057
Happy Birthday!

877
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:06,978
Birthday?

878
00:38:08,017 --> 00:38:08,657
Whose birthday?

879
00:38:08,978 --> 00:38:09,617
Your birthday?

880
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:11,097
It's your birthday.

881
00:38:12,617 --> 00:38:15,338
I knew you were focused on your business

882
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,378
and would forget your own birthday.

883
00:38:17,938 --> 00:38:18,938
But it's okay.

884
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:22,978
I...

885
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:30,177
Happy Birthday, Mr. Qian!

886
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,704
- Happy Birthday!
- Happy Birthday, Mr. Qian!

887
00:38:31,704 --> 00:38:32,338
Happy Birthday!

888
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:33,097
Thank you.

889
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:34,097
Thanks.

890
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:34,858
Thank you.

891
00:38:35,017 --> 00:38:37,258
Thank you so much.

892
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:39,057
Make a wish.

893
00:38:45,177 --> 00:38:45,697
Like this?

894
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:20,418
Okay.

895
00:39:22,657 --> 00:39:23,577
Thank you.

896
00:39:25,177 --> 00:39:26,418
What a surprise, Ms. Li.

897
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:28,697
You know what?

898
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:31,617
It's my first birthday.

899
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,298
Thank you.

900
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:42,200
(Super Dog Restaurant)

901
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:44,577
(The man, surnamed He, falsely claimed)

902
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:46,497
(that he had been captured by aliens)

903
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:50,258
(and used fake supernatural abilities
to swindle large sums of money.)

904
00:39:50,818 --> 00:39:52,938
(Police, through investigations,)

905
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:55,097
(finally gained evidence of his fraud.)

906
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:58,458
(The case is currently
under further investigation.)

907
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,177
(Police remind the public)

908
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:03,778
(to be more vigilant
and not believe in miraculous power.)

909
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,537
See? He got what he deserved.

910
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:06,617
It's over.

911
00:40:06,898 --> 00:40:07,657
Let's go.

912
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:10,778
I'm off.

913
00:40:11,738 --> 00:40:13,298
Mr. Xie, don't go yet.

914
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:14,818
Mr. Xie.

915
00:40:16,137 --> 00:40:16,938
Please don't go.

916
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:18,617
Can I ask you something?

917
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,057
You know much.

918
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:25,057
There's a machine
called a karaoke machine.

919
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,057
Do you know it?

920
00:40:28,137 --> 00:40:29,177
Where did you see it?

921
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:30,378
- Madam.
- I...

922
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:31,197
Check.

923
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:32,497
Okay. See you.

924
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:33,418
See you.

925
00:40:33,418 --> 00:40:36,258
I delivered goods
to the Yuehai Grand Hotel this morning.

926
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:37,097
No. No need to pay.

927
00:40:37,177 --> 00:40:38,017
I'm consulting you.

928
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:39,458
No problem. Go on.

929
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:41,037
Alright.

930
00:40:42,097 --> 00:40:45,458
When I delivered goods
to the hotel this morning,

931
00:40:45,657 --> 00:40:47,778
I saw that they have a karaoke machine.

932
00:40:48,338 --> 00:40:50,537
It connects to a TV set,
so you can sing.

933
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,497
I thought it was pretty new.

934
00:40:53,738 --> 00:40:54,697
Nothing new about it.

935
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:57,097
You've asked the right person.

936
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,697
I knew about the machine years ago.

937
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:02,177
So, you're thinking of buying one?

938
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:02,938
Sure.

939
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:05,577
Today, I saw lots of people
ordering songs there.

940
00:41:05,778 --> 00:41:06,938
Two yuan per song.

941
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:09,577
Two yuan is what I get
from selling four bowls of wontons.

942
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:10,818
So I was thinking

943
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:13,378
if I had a machine like that too,

944
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:16,458
even if only 20 people sang each day,

945
00:41:16,738 --> 00:41:18,258
that would be 40 yuan a day.

946
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:19,818
Over 1,000 a month!

947
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:22,137
I could recoup the cost
in months, right?

948
00:41:24,458 --> 00:41:25,208
Good for you!

949
00:41:25,912 --> 00:41:26,776
Very clever of you!

950
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:28,338
I learned a lot at the night school.

951
00:41:28,818 --> 00:41:31,097
Ms. Yan taught me mathematical thinking.

952
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,577
Mr. Li taught me
how to find what I truly love.

953
00:41:35,258 --> 00:41:36,057
And Xuemei,

954
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:37,978
she gave fantastic lessons.

955
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:40,697
I admire her. I want to be like her.

956
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,177
She is bold, decisive,
and has a head for business.

957
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:44,024
Yan.

958
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:45,176
- Money.
- Bold and decisive.

959
00:41:45,176 --> 00:41:45,938
Take care.

960
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:47,137
Night school's good?

961
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:47,738
Yes.

962
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:48,378
Right?

963
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:49,017
Is it good?

964
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:49,657
Sure.

965
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:50,177
It's good.

966
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:50,898
Sure.

967
00:41:51,097 --> 00:41:51,938
Another bowl.

968
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:52,697
Okay.

969
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:54,258
I'll give you a hand.

970
00:41:54,497 --> 00:41:56,017
No, thanks, but I can do it myself.

971
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:56,517
Come on.

972
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:57,368
Karaoke.

973
00:41:57,944 --> 00:41:58,858
Okay.

974
00:41:59,017 --> 00:41:59,778
Thank you.

975
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:01,464
Yuehai will always be okay!

976
00:42:02,168 --> 00:42:03,576
Night school will always be okay!

977
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:04,408
Okay.

978
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:04,997
Yes.

979
00:42:05,258 --> 00:42:08,057
So, is the machine very expensive?

980
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:08,858
Over 10,000 yuan.

981
00:42:09,298 --> 00:42:10,258
What?

982
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:12,378
I mean imported ones.

983
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:15,137
There are domestic ones now. Cheaper.

984
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:17,057
Where can I buy the machine?

985
00:42:17,217 --> 00:42:18,968
Go to Chengxin Department Store.

986
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:20,920
Xincheng Building,
second floor, on the right.

987
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:22,097
The second shop.

988
00:42:22,617 --> 00:42:23,738
I helped that shop owner.

989
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:25,657
You can mention my name.

990
00:42:25,657 --> 00:42:26,418
Say I sent you.

991
00:42:26,517 --> 00:42:28,017
He'll definitely give you a deal.

992
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:29,657
Okay.

993
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:30,418
Alright, that's it?

994
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:31,177
Yeah.

995
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:31,738
I'm off.

996
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:33,418
Mr. Xie, thank you in advance!

997
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:35,458
Not at all.

998
00:42:36,537 --> 00:42:39,657
If you're serious about buying it,

999
00:42:40,017 --> 00:42:41,617
you need to tell Lin Tofu.

1000
00:42:42,057 --> 00:42:43,958
Otherwise, Lin Dongfu

1001
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:45,418
will blame me for meddling.

1002
00:42:45,418 --> 00:42:46,338
I'll tell him.

1003
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:47,978
What are you meddling in now?

1004
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:49,978
Mr. Lin.

1005
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,057
Mr. Xie.

1006
00:42:51,298 --> 00:42:52,097
When did you come?

1007
00:42:52,344 --> 00:42:53,272
(Yan's Wontons)
You guess.

1008
00:42:53,418 --> 00:42:54,418
How did you hear us?

1009
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:55,177
What is it?

1010
00:42:56,418 --> 00:42:59,378
Well, I want to buy a karaoke machine.

1011
00:43:00,338 --> 00:43:01,497
