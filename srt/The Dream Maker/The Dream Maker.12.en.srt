Here we go again.

00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:42,732
You are unreasonable.

19
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:44,133
Poor choice of words.

20
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:46,413
What do you mean by "put up to"?

21
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:47,413
You...

22
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,853
Mr. Wang, Mr. Zheng speaks bluntly.

23
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,892
To put it plainly, we just want to know

24
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:54,732
if this is a sudden regulation,

25
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:56,732
which department issued it?

26
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:58,413
Well...

27
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:03,732
Well...

28
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:05,493
Wang Defa, are you going
to the bathroom?

29
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:08,332
No.

30
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:13,492
You know those
Power Supply Bureau leaders well.

31
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:15,452
Please, I beg you.
Let me go to the bathroom.

32
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:19,212
Government Office.

33
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,172
Liu Dan.

34
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:21,652
I didn't say anything.

35
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:32,293
Who is it?

36
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,492
Coming!

37
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:51,492
Why are you standing? Have a seat.

38
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:54,853
How impressive.

39
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,253
Just come. Don't bring anything.

40
00:02:59,093 --> 00:03:00,212
I have something for you.

41
00:03:11,813 --> 00:03:13,853
The other day, you looked pale.

42
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:15,853
Take these lotus seeds. Brew them.

43
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:16,732
Okay.

44
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:20,693
Take a seat.

45
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:24,573
Tang, we have a guest! Didn't you hear?

46
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:25,693
Keep it down.

47
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:27,253
Okay.

48
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,052
Why are you still standing? Take a seat.

49
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:35,576
(Rouyan)

50
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:43,612
Liu, about that...

51
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:47,093
What did I want to ask?

52
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:52,573
Oh, I remember.

53
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:04,452
Look at these colors.

54
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:06,253
Which looks better for knitting a hat?

55
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:07,853
A hat?

56
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,133
This one. This one's nice.

57
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:13,533
Alright then.

58
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,332
I trust your taste.

59
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:34,092
Liu, regarding Binhai Road...

60
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,053
That has nothing...

61
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:39,800
Is Zheng Decheng

62
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:41,892
even a man?

63
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,733
Why didn't he come personally?
Why are you taking the heat?

64
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:48,292
And you,

65
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:51,412
don't be foolish and let others
use you as a pawn.

66
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:52,852
Don't get involved.

67
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:56,712
Liu,

68
00:04:57,432 --> 00:04:59,173
I simply can't stay out of this.

69
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:02,613
After all, both you and the cadres
were invited by me.

70
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:05,933
And from my campaign until now,

71
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,332
you've always supported me
behind the scenes.

72
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:11,693
I owe you a formal apology.

73
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:13,852
Off topic.

74
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:22,452
By the way,

75
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,693
Liu, about Yuehai's
electricity standards,

76
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,373
could you consider restoring them
to how they were before?

77
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,133
About the power supply,

78
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:33,253
a new regulation was recently issued.

79
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:37,813
Previously, we did give
preferential treatment to Yuehai,

80
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,412
but other towns objected,
calling it unfair.

81
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:43,292
What could we do?

82
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,104
It seems difficult

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,013
to favor you again later.

84
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,212
Just favor us a little bit.

85
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,208
I'm just

86
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,253
a cadre from the Government Office.

87
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:58,693
How could I override regulations?

88
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,733
Liu, here's the situation.

89
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,373
With these sudden
and prolonged blackouts,

90
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:08,133
the businesses weren't prepared.

91
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:11,173
Without power,
they can't complete production,

92
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:12,892
so they can't fulfill orders.

93
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,573
The losses are enormous.

94
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,253
Liu, how about this?

95
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:23,693
I drafted a proposal.

96
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:29,092
Let's take it together

97
00:06:29,852 --> 00:06:31,452
to report to Mr. Xia.

98
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:38,013
Qiuping,

99
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:41,772
in what capacity
are you visiting me today?

100
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,292
As my longtime good friend?

101
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,573
Or as the Mayor of Yuehai?

102
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:53,412
As the Mayor of Yuehai.

103
00:06:58,373 --> 00:06:59,013
Okay.

104
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,173
Ms. Li,

105
00:07:03,493 --> 00:07:04,892
let's stop beating around the bush.

106
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:06,733
Tell me honestly.

107
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,292
Regarding Binhai Road,

108
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,772
what exactly are your plans?

109
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:13,292
To whom?

110
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:24,053
Liu, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,253
Back then,

112
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,772
you came to me first, right?

113
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,253
You asked me to lead

114
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:40,892
the mobilization of all cadres

115
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:43,373
to support Yuehai's development.

116
00:07:48,452 --> 00:07:50,813
The cadres didn't have faith in Yuehai.

117
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:53,452
It was me.

118
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,613
I did it for you.

119
00:07:56,892 --> 00:07:58,253
I was trying to help you.

120
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:02,452
I persuaded them one by one.

121
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,412
In the end,

122
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:08,933
over a thousand cadres

123
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,332
took their household registers,

124
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:13,573
ready to pay fees in Yuehai.

125
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:15,960
But what did you do?

126
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,532
You backed out without warning.

127
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:22,092
You even made excuses,

128
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:25,772
talking about building
a printing street.

129
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:27,013
Let's be blunt.

130
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,013
Aren't you just driven by greed?

131
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:32,613
For a bit of money,

132
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:35,172
you made fools of all our cadres.

133
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,572
What do you take me for?

134
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,453
Do you even consider me
your good friend?

135
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:48,892
Is this how cadres should behave?

136
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,532
What kind of cadres are you?

137
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:57,572
Liu, I understand.

138
00:08:58,373 --> 00:08:59,652
I'm truly sorry.

139
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:02,652
I compromised my principles.

140
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:04,733
I betrayed the trust you placed in me.

141
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:06,853
But

142
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:09,733
Yuehai genuinely needs this street.

143
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:11,973
We need this pillar industry.

144
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:20,692
No matter what,

145
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:23,093
we will give you a proper explanation.

146
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:25,572
However,

147
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:27,772
this power outage...

148
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:31,892
The power issue was approved
by Government Office

149
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,172
in a meeting based
on the latest regulations.

150
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:36,133
If you have objections,

151
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:39,013
report them to higher-ups
through proper channels.

152
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:44,093
Furthermore,

153
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,892
the Binhai Road issue isn't settled.

154
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,093
Tell Zheng Decheng.

155
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:53,733
We've only ever wanted Binhai Road.

156
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:55,853
Don't try fobbing us off
with other roads.

157
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,013
All the cadres' household registers

158
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:00,373
are now with Yuehai.

159
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:03,692
I'll bring people at 8 AM tomorrow.

160
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:05,133
I expect your explanation.

161
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:11,652
Tang, that was a lovely song earlier.

162
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:13,133
Sing it again.

163
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:14,333

180

Liu said she'll come tomorrow morning
to process the paperwork.

181

Do you change your mind?

182
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:19,292
No.

183
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:21,973
Then I have an idea now.

184
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,052
I also have an idea.

185
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:25,932

- We must collect the fees.

187
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:30,333
Are you sure?

188
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:36,453
Then let's notify them right now.

189
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:38,093
Only the two of us know?

190
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,172
Even we don't know.

191
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,892
I'll be brief.
The situation is complicated.

192
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:46,812
I hope to get your Binhai Road
paperwork done quickly

193
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:48,052
to avoid complications.

194
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,013
Understood?

195
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:49,973
Understood.

196
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:50,652
Understood.

197
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:53,013
This paperwork
must be kept confidential.

198
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:56,172
Calculate the total
city construction fees for Binhai Road.

199
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:57,624
Starting tonight at 10 PM,

200
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,493
we must gather it all by 6 AM tomorrow.

201
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:02,052
Remember, we only have one night.

202
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:04,453
Okay.

203
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,853
But won't you doing this...

204
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:07,853
Don't worry.

205
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,172
We've thought it through.

206
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,013
We'll report to Mr. Zhao
before 9 AM tomorrow.

207
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:13,292
Right.

208
00:14:13,532 --> 00:14:15,812
Before Liu Dan comes to Yuehai
to do the paperwork.

209
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,333
Okay.

210
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,412
We're so grateful to you.

211
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:19,133
Thank you.

212
00:14:19,453 --> 00:14:20,932
Thank you, Ms. Li, Mr. Zheng.

213
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:22,373
- Thank you, Ms. Li.
- Wonderful!

214
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:23,213
Thanks!

215
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:25,973
What? Three months?

216
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,253
Impossible! Absolutely impossible!

217
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,133
Don't tell me that.

218
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:32,973
It's not a discussion.

219
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:34,613
I am telling you.

220
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:37,692
Construction of Xingfu Road must be
completed in three months.

221
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:40,613
Even if you rush,
you must consider feasibility.

222
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,052
Before, you told us to complete
in six months, right?

223
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:47,853
Now you're cutting it down
to three months. I really can't do it.

224
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:50,572
In Shenzhen,
they build a story in three days.

225
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,612
But in Yuehai,

226
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,412
why can't road construction
be completed in three months?

227
00:14:54,412 --> 00:14:55,853
How can you talk about Yuehai speed?

228
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,013
How can we compare with Shenzhen?

229
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,453
They have countless
engineers and machinery.

230
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,373
Just talking about speed is useless.

231
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:03,613
Anyway, Listen.

232
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:05,652
You must get this done!

233
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:08,572
Otherwise, I can't explain things
to the cadres about Binhai Road.

234
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:11,932
Mr. Zheng, you...

235
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:13,812
Look here.

236
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:17,613
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Xingfu Road here is 910 meters long.

237
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:19,692
You know how wide
the main road is, right?

238
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,983
Down below, I need to lay

239
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,493
eight underground pipelines.

240
00:15:23,572 --> 00:15:24,133
I also need...

241
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,133
Don't tell me all this.

242
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,652
I don't want to hear it.

243
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,333
I only care about results! Got it?

244
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:31,772
Mr. Zheng.

245
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:34,453
What's up?

246
00:15:35,253 --> 00:15:35,853
Five months.

247
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:37,572
I guarantee completion.

248
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:38,493
Three months.

249
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:40,692
Four months.

250
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:45,613
Lin Tofu! You're haggling
with me now, right?

251
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:46,652
Three months.

252
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:49,973
You'll do it no matter what.

253
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,772
I told you. I can't do it!

254
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:57,853
Lin Tofu, you...
You're getting defiant now?

255
00:15:58,652 --> 00:15:59,672
Daring to slam my door!

256
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:01,453
This... This is your room!

257
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:03,292
Why are you slamming the door?

258
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:17,892
Who's there?

259
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,453
Why did you put money in the fridge?

260
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:24,812
Turn it off.

261
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,253
You scared me!

262
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:28,892
What if my dad sees it?

263
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:30,973
He's been staying at the office lately,

264
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:32,733
dealing with the power outage issue.

265
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,052
He's quite dedicated.

266
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:36,052
Need any help?

267
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:38,973
The best help is you leaving
and shutting the door, my dear.

268
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:42,892
You'll give me a heart attack one day.

269
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:48,652
Xuemei,

270
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:50,932
our funds are in place.

271
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,493
How much do we have in total?

272
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:55,812
Over 3.5 million.

273
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,292
Time is limited.

274
00:16:58,373 --> 00:17:01,052
When can we gather 5.7 million?

275
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:03,333
Such a big gap?

276
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,933
Let me think.

277
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:08,052
Here's the thing.

278
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:09,532
Let's pool it.

279
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,532
I have 80,000 yuan at home.
It's my last savings.

280
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:13,772
I'll fetch it later.

281
00:17:21,612 --> 00:17:24,413
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

282
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:27,893
Thanks.

283
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:33,432
Wait.

284
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:36,052
Shine all you want.
It won't come out right.

285
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:38,332
I've handed over all my money.

286
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:40,812
Everything at home adds up
to less than 20,000.

287
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:42,933
No. Even combined, it's not enough!

288
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,332
Weren't you broke
when I asked to repay last time?

289
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:47,733
It was nearly 20,000.

290
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:48,852
It was less than 20,000.

291
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,052
Still not enough.

292
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:53,612
Time is running out.

293
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,103
Alright, Fatty.

294
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:58,132
Later, let's go out together
and borrow money door-to-door.

295
00:17:58,372 --> 00:17:59,693
We must secure Binhai Road.

296
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:02,933
Right! Go find Chen Hui.

297
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:04,612
I heard that recently,

298
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:07,384
he landed an overseas order
and would make good money.

299
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:08,572
Also, the one who

300
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:10,893
split orders with us, Liu Jingcai.

301
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:11,532
Liu Jingcai.

302
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:12,893
- He doesn't need money now.
- Right.

303
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:14,612
He had outstanding entry at my place.

304
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:15,453
At least, it was...

305
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:16,453
Aunties and uncles,

306
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,052
get all the money over here.

307
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:18,933
Who hasn't?

308
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,812
I've borrowed
from every relative possible.

309
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:22,733
If we can get this done

310
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,973
and pay before the cadres
in the county...

311
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:26,852
Get that certificate approved.

312
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:28,253
Not sure about the plan.

313
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:30,493
We still need to prepare
other things at home.

314
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,852
We can set things up properly.

333
00:19:57,973 --> 00:19:58,532
Hello.

334
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,132
Good morning.

335
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:09,532
Mr. Zhao, I have something
to report to you.

336
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:10,933
Come on up.

337
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:16,253
Go on.

338
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:28,812
Gentlemen,

339
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:30,232
over a thousand

340
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,572
cadres in our county

341
00:20:33,173 --> 00:20:34,532
report under our real names.

342
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:37,013
This has all the cadres' signatures.

343
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,653
We strongly condemn Zheng Decheng.

344
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:41,852
We demand he be punished.

345
00:20:49,653 --> 00:20:51,013
Our original intention

346
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:52,888
is that we are all actually

347
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:54,852
responding to the call.

348
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:01,292
We were actively supporting
the construction of Yuehai.

349
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:04,733
As for Zheng Decheng,
he also promised us.

350
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:07,612
He signed to give us Binhai Road.

351
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:11,572
Take a look.

352
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,253
His signature.

353
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:16,772
(Letter of Intent)
And his name is here, Zheng Decheng.

354
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:19,213
How... How did it become like this?

355
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:21,132
He signed it,
but didn't want to admit it.

356
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:23,532
He wanted to eat it.
He swallowed it whole.

357
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:25,852
I snatched this from his mouth.

358
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:27,896
You tell me. As a leader,

359
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:29,733
he signed it, but now he's backing out.

360
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:32,052
Moreover,
after our communication failed,

361
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,092
he gave that road
to someone else overnight!

362
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:38,092
What kind of behavior is this?
What kind...

363
00:21:39,693 --> 00:21:41,173
What kind of behavior is this?

364
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:42,232
Mr. Zhao,

365
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,812
Zheng Decheng signed it,
yet still did this.

366
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:47,852
How could he go back on his word?
He must be severely punished.

367
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,653
That's right. How could he do this?

368
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,733
He can't take Binhai Road back!

369
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:52,253
That's right.

370
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,453
He must be severely punished.

371
00:21:53,493 --> 00:21:54,372
Severely punished.

372
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,292
He can't take it back.

373
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:57,693
- Right.
- Absolutely cannot let this happen.

374
00:21:58,332 --> 00:22:00,653
The news spreads really fast.

375
00:22:02,772 --> 00:22:03,532
Regret it now?

376
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,372
What do you think?

377
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:09,693
Go back and wait.

378
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,612
You two go wait
in the conference room downstairs.

379
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:38,332
(Petition)
Look at your achievements.

380
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:41,624
Over 1,000 people accused you.

381
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:43,413
And this.

382
00:22:45,292 --> 00:22:46,332
You bit this, didn't you?

383
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:50,013
It was snatched from your mouth.
She said you ate it.

384
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:52,532
I find this ridiculous, you know?

385
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:56,253
Well done, Li.

386
00:22:57,052 --> 00:22:58,493
You just acted before reporting.

387
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:01,812
You took the money,
completed the procedures.

388
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:04,052
and rushed here overnight
like a heroine.

389
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:06,413
You think that way I won't punish you?

390
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,332
Mr. Zhao, the Binhai Road incident

391
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:11,013
is indeed our mistake.

392
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:12,572
We should be punished.

393
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:15,372
(Conference Room)
But the people of Yuehai

394
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:17,772
have nothing to do with this.

395
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,693
Could you first help us coordinate

396
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:22,933
to restore the electricity in Yuehai?

397
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:24,173
Right.

398
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,532
I told the Power Supply Bureau
to restore production electricity first,

399
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,736
and then the domestic electricity.

400
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:32,812
Hurry back to Yuehai.

401
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:35,013
Calm down the people's emotions.

402
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:38,453
But you, Zheng Decheng.

403
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,253
As the Secretary,

404
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:42,653
you have indeed hurt
the cadres' feelings.

405
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:43,612
Do you admit it?

406
00:23:43,852 --> 00:23:44,453
I admit it.

407
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,132
I'm giving you a warning this time.

408
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:48,173
Okay.

409
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,013
Teach you a lesson.

410
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:52,602
Remember to clarify the situation first

411
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,052
- before deciding next time.
- I got it.

412
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:55,064
Moreover,

413
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:58,213
as Yuehai's leader,
you must take responsibility.

414
00:23:58,532 --> 00:23:59,893
Tomorrow morning at 9 AM,

415
00:24:00,253 --> 00:24:01,532
come to the county government.

416
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:02,912
Apologize to all the cadres

417
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,493
for the personal debt you owe.

418
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:07,973
Okay.

419
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:12,653
Mr. Zhao, I arranged for the cadres
to move to Yuehai

420
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:14,292
to settle down initially.

421
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,413
I am responsible for this
in the first place.

422
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:19,973
If there's punishment

423
00:24:21,213 --> 00:24:24,052
or an apology required,
I'll bear it as well.

424
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:26,933
Li, I haven't criticized you yet.

425
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,612
You come to take the blame?

426
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:30,493
Tell me, what was the task I gave you?

427
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:32,413
It was when Zheng Decheng messes around,

428
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:33,292
you hold him back.

429
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:35,132
What now?

430
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:37,332
You betrayed the trust placed in you.

431
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:41,453
I'll get back to you later.

432
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:43,413
In the town government,

433
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:45,893
someone has to be responsible
for production.

434
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:47,173
Get back immediately.

435
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:48,733
Resume work.

436
00:24:49,612 --> 00:24:51,092
Ensure Yuehai operates normally.

437
00:24:52,052 --> 00:24:52,413
Okay.

438
00:24:52,572 --> 00:24:53,173
Okay.

439
00:25:05,532 --> 00:25:06,968
Zheng Decheng, where are you going?

440
00:25:07,893 --> 00:25:09,372
How dare you leave?

441
00:25:09,733 --> 00:25:11,893
Listen, you're not going anywhere today.

442
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:13,132
You'll stay put here.

443
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:14,322
(Conference Room)

444
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:16,693
Think hard about how you'll face
the cadres tomorrow.

445
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:19,864
Write an apology letter.

446
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:23,132
Write what you truly think.
Show some sincerity.

447
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:24,653
Do I make myself clear?

448
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:25,973
Yes.

449
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:28,253
Then go write it.

450
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:29,332
Okay.

451
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:30,532
Well...

452
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:33,413
Make it profound.

453
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:34,733
Yes, got it.

454
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:47,772
Mr. Zhao,

455
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:52,253
do you really want
Zheng Decheng to apologize?

456
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,493
This incident has already damaged

457
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,092
his credibility.

458
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,292
If he apologizes,

459
00:26:00,612 --> 00:26:02,092
will it escalate tensions?

460
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:03,733
How about this?

461
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,332
First, issue a notice

462
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:07,532
to clarify the situation.

463
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:11,013
Reprimand Zheng Decheng internally.

464
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:12,933
Tone down the incident.

465
00:26:13,253 --> 00:26:14,973
How can we tone down this?

466
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:18,532
Guan, the cadres are so furious.

467
00:26:18,852 --> 00:26:19,893
As county leaders,

468
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:21,893
we must make Zheng Decheng step forward.

469
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,973
He owes them
an explanation and accountability.

470
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:30,253
This situation has escalated

471
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:32,812
beyond what a simple notice can resolve.

472
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:35,973
The cadres' frustrations must be vented.

473
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:37,233
Otherwise,

474
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:40,024
the pressure on the management
of Yuehai will be greater.

475
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,168
The one who tied the bell must untie it.

476
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:44,052
Why am I demanding his apology?

477
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:46,493
To relieve his own burden first,

478
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,332
teach him a lesson,

479
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:52,812
and make him realize
the consequences of acting recklessly.

480
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:54,733
Power's back!

481
00:26:57,612 --> 00:26:58,132
Power's back!

482
00:26:59,013 --> 00:26:59,693
Power's back!

483
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:04,973
Hello, Ms. Li.

484
00:27:05,173 --> 00:27:05,893
Hello.

485
00:27:07,173 --> 00:27:07,973
Hello, Ms. Li.

486
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:08,772
Hello, Ms. Li.

487
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:09,653
Ms. Li.

488
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,013
Coming, coming!

489
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:11,812
Hello, Ms. Li.

490
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:12,693
Hai!

491
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:14,693
Hai! Hai!

492
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:15,612
Mantis style!

493
00:27:16,013 --> 00:27:16,893
Qiang, Hai.

494
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:18,532
Ms. Li.

495
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:28,852
Ms. Li.

496
00:27:29,493 --> 00:27:30,213
Ms. Li.

497
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:31,092
Busy working?

498
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:33,733
Ms. Li,

499
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:34,532
hello.

500
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,253
Hello.

501
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:37,493
Ms. Li,

502
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:38,532
have you eaten?

503
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:39,772
Ms. Li, join us.

504
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:40,893
No, thanks.

505
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:41,852
You all go ahead.

506
00:27:41,933 --> 00:27:42,572
Okay.

507
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,888
(Unite to Build
a Brighter Future for Yuehai)

508
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:45,572
Foolish.

509
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:49,493
How much did you earn?

510
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:54,852
Just about

511
00:27:56,812 --> 00:27:57,332
six yuan.

512
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:05,332
You think I'm an idiot, huh?

513
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,973
Renting comic books for three months,

514
00:28:09,612 --> 00:28:10,653
you only made six yuan?

515
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,572
I bet you made ten times that.

516
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,052
No! I... I'm not lying.

517
00:28:16,052 --> 00:28:17,092
That's truly all I earned.

518
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,332
Dad, don't go further.
There's nothing there.

519
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:24,332
You told me not to come here...

520
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:33,253
Why does this one look different?

521
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:37,092
No, that... That one has insects.

522
00:28:37,372 --> 00:28:38,132
Insects?

523
00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:41,733
Let me see. Where are they?

524
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:51,253
Quite a few.

525
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:54,973
Smart to hide it in a tin box.

526
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:56,132
Not as smart as you.

527
00:29:05,532 --> 00:29:07,092
Decheng, you startled me!

528
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:12,493
Dapeng, why are you back so early?

529
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:16,772
I thought no one was home.

530
00:29:18,253 --> 00:29:19,852
I forgot my keys.

531
00:29:20,532 --> 00:29:22,092
Do you always break in like this?

532
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:24,332
Of course not!

533
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,132
Just once or twice.

534
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:27,852
Maybe three times.

535
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:30,532
The kid is unruly.
The young one is no better.

536
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:31,572
Hurry up!

537
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:32,852
Go cook now!

538
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:34,213
Stop bickering! I know.

539
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:35,092
Honestly!

540
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:37,213
What's up?

541
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:42,973
No, this...

542
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:55,893
Decheng, what are you looking for?

543
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:56,693
Money.

544
00:29:57,052 --> 00:29:57,413
Money?

545
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,253
Exactly like me when I was young.

546
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:04,013
Even this gets inherited?

547
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:06,693
You're definitely my son.

548
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,812
Come on. Let's count it.

549
00:30:10,772 --> 00:30:11,693
How much is there?

550
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:12,973
54 yuan and 62 fen.

551
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:16,013
You remember it quite clearly.

552
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:17,253
That's all?

553
00:30:17,532 --> 00:30:18,092
Nothing left.

554
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:19,173
Is that the truth?

555
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:20,292
Then I'll swear it.

556
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:27,213
Earning money is secondary, but lying?
I won't tolerate that.

557
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:28,733
Decheng! Decheng!

558
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:30,453
You can scold your kid.

559
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,612
But you can't hit him.

560
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:35,132
It's my principle.
Or I can't explain it to my sister.

561
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,816
(Dear county committee leaders,)

562
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:47,544
(I was wrong.)

563
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:22,040
Personally, I believe
there's only one path now.

564
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:24,253
Return Binhai Road project
to save the Secretary.

565
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:25,292
I think we can return.

566
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:26,132
Exactly.

567
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:27,256
It must be returned.

568
00:31:27,372 --> 00:31:27,812
Right.

569
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:30,132
If Ms. Chang backs out,
we'll find other solutions.

570
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:31,292
Can't we find someone else?

571
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:32,013
Ms. Gao, you...

572
00:31:32,013 --> 00:31:32,893
Just stop talking.

573
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:35,693
You know exactly
what happened here, don't you?

574
00:31:36,052 --> 00:31:37,413
Stop. Just reflect on ourselves.

575
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:39,893
Right? We all understand.
Let's just reflect.

576
00:31:40,173 --> 00:31:41,693
It's already happened. Let's think

577
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,372
about how we can help
the Secretary, right?

578
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:44,453
Let's go to the county

579
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,453
and support the Secretary tomorrow.

580
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:47,453
I'll go with you.

581
00:31:47,653 --> 00:31:48,493
Why are you going?

582
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:49,572
You shouldn't go!

583
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:52,092
The Secretary ended
up like this for our sake.

584
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:53,132
We can't abandon him!

585
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:55,092
Exactly! What would it mean
if we didn't go?

586
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:56,453
So what other options do we have?

587
00:31:56,973 --> 00:31:57,413
Right.

588
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:58,292
We'll all go together.

589
00:31:58,413 --> 00:32:00,253
Hear that? They're very emotional.

590
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,453
I originally wanted to make a decision.

591
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:04,933
But I'm the deputy mayor.

592
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,733
Then let them in. I'll talk to them.

593
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:09,812
I will let them in.

594
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:12,772
Stop arguing!

595
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:13,973
Come in. Come on. Get inside.

596
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,372
Ms. Li will speak.

597
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:15,973
Come on.

598
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:16,572
Let's go.

599
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:17,453
Great!

600
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:19,512
Listen, I'll remember you.

601
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:20,893
Didn't you go search before?

602
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,052
Enough. Get down to business.

603
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:22,372
Ms. Li.

604
00:32:22,372 --> 00:32:22,933
Come on.

605
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:23,493
Come here.

606
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:23,896
Ms. Li.

607
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:24,812
Find a spot to stand.

608
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:25,893
Stand over there.

609
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:26,893
Everyone, quiet now!

610
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:28,132
Raise your hand to ask.

611
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:28,772
Okay, okay.

612
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:29,772
- Alright.
- Okay.

613
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:30,973
Come on, Ms. Li. Please speak.

614
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:32,532
I'll say a few words.

615
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,092
Two things.

616
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,472
First, tomorrow, no one

617
00:32:36,632 --> 00:32:37,973
goes to the county except me.

618
00:32:38,413 --> 00:32:38,893
Why?

619
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:39,372
Wait.

620
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,292
If all of you swarm down there,

621
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,772
you'll put immense pressure
on county leaders.

622
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:47,608
How could they make a decision?
Have you considered the consequences?

623
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:48,893
What was I saying?

624
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:50,493
Raise hands! Raise hands to speak.

625
00:32:51,372 --> 00:32:51,733
Don't...

626
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:52,413
Okay, I...

627
00:32:52,532 --> 00:32:53,372
I think

628
00:32:53,693 --> 00:32:54,744
we should create

629
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:56,733
some pressure for them, right?

630
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:57,413
So we could...

631
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:58,973
I mean, I should go with you.

632
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:01,052
Good idea.

633
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:02,372
No, absolutely not.

634
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:03,052
Go on.

635
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:05,253
I realize my suggestion also has issues.

636
00:33:05,772 --> 00:33:07,572
Mr. Zheng is fighting
on the front lines.

637
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:10,372
We can't hold him back.

638
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,024
We just got power back.

639
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:14,372
There's still much work to be done.

640
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:15,733
Right?

641
00:33:16,372 --> 00:33:18,413
Second, who said we needed
to return Binhai Road?

642
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:19,893
- I did.
- We all said.

643
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:20,733
Yeah, and me too.

644
00:33:21,812 --> 00:33:23,128
This isn't child's play.

645
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,092
Binhai Road gets returned so easily?

646
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:25,653
Then...

647
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:28,052
Printing Street must
seize the market opportunity.

648
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:29,933
We cannot back down on this road.

649
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:32,056
Moreover, we should build it up

650
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,253
as soon as possible.

651
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:37,532
I know you all want to help Mr. Zheng.

652
00:33:37,973 --> 00:33:38,532
But

653
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:40,173
since Mr. Zheng and I

654
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:42,772
handed Binhai Road over to you,

655
00:33:43,532 --> 00:33:45,372
we had already anticipated
the worst outcome.

656
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:48,612
Now Mr. Zheng alone

657
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:50,332
bears all the responsibility.

658
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,893
Before I returned, he instructed me

659
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,332
to ensure production

660
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,413
and also Yuehai's stable progress.

661
00:33:59,292 --> 00:34:01,092
We can't let him down.

662
00:34:02,052 --> 00:34:03,013
We... We got it.

663
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:04,253
Yes, got it.

664
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:06,733
Oh, right. And Xingfu Road too.

665
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:07,572
Mr. Lin,

666
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:10,813
under no circumstances should we
delay the construction schedule.

667
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:12,652
Got it. I've got it under control.

668
00:34:13,893 --> 00:34:14,893
Well...

669
00:34:15,172 --> 00:34:16,773
Ms. Li, I have another question.

670
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:17,933
Tomorrow,

671
00:34:18,132 --> 00:34:20,413
Mr. Zheng won't really
get dismissed, will he?

672
00:34:20,612 --> 00:34:21,092
Yeah.

673
00:34:21,252 --> 00:34:22,652
Will he actually be removed?

674
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:25,572
- No way.
- I wanted to ask that too.

675
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:27,212
- This is everyone's...
- Will he?

676
00:34:27,252 --> 00:34:27,960
He won't, right?

677
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:29,652
Right.

678
00:34:30,493 --> 00:34:31,813
I trust Mr. Zheng.

679
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:35,333
And I trust our leaders and cadres too.

680
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:37,624
Get two dough sticks and head to work.

681
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:45,413
Get them before going to work.

682
00:34:45,413 --> 00:34:46,853
Tie up yesterday's loose ends.

683
00:34:47,222 --> 00:34:47,612
Okay.

684
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:48,853
Sir, what's wrong?

685
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:51,252
Is something wrong
with the bun? Not tasty?

686
00:34:55,132 --> 00:34:55,532
No.

687
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:58,973
Not sure why, but I have no appetite.

688
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:00,532
Do you have tea?

689
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:01,853
Yes.

690
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,813
It's quite lively today.

691
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:15,252
I heard some fool

692
00:35:15,773 --> 00:35:18,373
offended thousands
of cadres county-wide.

693
00:35:19,572 --> 00:35:22,092
So today, he's apologizing
to all county cadres.

694
00:35:24,293 --> 00:35:24,933
I know.

695
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:27,773
That fool is me.

696
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:57,413
What's going on?

697
00:35:58,052 --> 00:35:59,493
I didn't eat much this morning.

698
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:09,933
Mr. Zheng.

699
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:13,052
Is your apology letter ready?

700
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:17,933
Of course not.

701
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:20,252
I couldn't squeeze out a word all night.

702
00:36:20,893 --> 00:36:21,732
Why are you here?

703
00:36:24,052 --> 00:36:26,813
Ms. Li said you're not here
to apologize today.

704
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:27,933
You're here to fight.

705
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:31,172
Ms. Li was worried, so she brought me.

706
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:36,692
How's the town?

707
00:36:37,413 --> 00:36:38,293
Is everyone okay?

708
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:39,800
Don't worry, power's restored.

709
00:36:40,132 --> 00:36:41,652
Factories are back to production.

710
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:44,172
Mr. Lin's Xingfu Road project
is proceeding normally.

711
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:45,212
That's good.

712
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:48,376
Tiger balm. It refreshes your mind.

713
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:49,532
This should help you.

714
00:36:57,572 --> 00:36:59,453
Mr. Zheng, open your mouth.

715
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:02,252
Wh... What is it?

716
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:03,652
Licorice tablets for throat.

717
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:04,373
I...

718
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:08,973
You want me to swallow it dry?

719
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:22,252
Open your mouth.

720
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:24,893
What is it?

721
00:37:25,252 --> 00:37:26,172
Tranquilizing tablets.

722
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,440
Tranquilizing tablets.

723
00:37:28,532 --> 00:37:30,333
They relieve tension and help you relax.

724
00:37:30,652 --> 00:37:32,984
Pure herbal ingredients,
without side effects. Don't worry.

725
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:35,013
Swallow it.

726
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:45,572
Mr. Zheng, take off your clothes.

727
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:46,853
Are you crazy?

728
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,013
We're in public!

729
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:49,373
Don't be nervous.

730
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:51,132
Enough! Who's nervous?

731
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:53,172
I wasn't nervous
until you made me nervous.

732
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,333
Stop. Let it be.

733
00:38:00,532 --> 00:38:01,172
Take this.

734
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,652
Who takes this many?

735
00:38:02,732 --> 00:38:03,773
Are you refining elixirs?

736
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:05,052
You've got me nervous too.

737
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:06,893
Don't be nervous. It's fine.

738
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:10,052
Take these
quick-acting heart relief pills.

739
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:12,853
Take one if you feel short
of breath later

740
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,200
- when you are on stage.
- Take this.

741
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,933
This will help.

742
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:15,933
Yes, take it.

743
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:23,013
You can do it. You can.

744
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:24,973
That scared me to death!

745
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:26,813
It's fine. No problem.

746
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:51,572
He has no sense of time.

747
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:54,003
Today, all the cadres and their families

748
00:38:54,424 --> 00:38:55,252
are here.

749
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:57,612
Let's see how Zheng Decheng
explains this to everyone.

750
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,692
(Auditorium)

751
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:00,333
Mr. Zheng,

752
00:39:01,453 --> 00:39:03,052
I knew you couldn't draft a speech.

753
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:04,052
So

754
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:06,853
when you don't know what to say,
just read this.

755
00:39:06,973 --> 00:39:07,893
It'll help.

756
00:39:12,692 --> 00:39:13,532
Das Kapital?

757
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:15,453
Will it work?

758
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:18,613
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Zhao is waiting
for you inside.

759
00:39:18,872 --> 00:39:19,453
Hurry up.

760
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:20,052
Okay, okay.

761
00:39:20,212 --> 00:39:20,652
Hurry.

762
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,000
(Auditorium)

763
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,013
Make way.

764
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,252
Make way.

765
00:39:27,252 --> 00:39:28,013
- He's here.
- Excuse me.

766
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:28,612
Coming through.

767
00:39:29,612 --> 00:39:30,293
Let me through.

768
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:31,893
You wait here for me.

769
00:39:32,052 --> 00:39:32,692
Alright.

770
00:39:39,172 --> 00:39:40,092
Let's see what he says.

771
00:39:58,453 --> 00:39:59,013
Everyone.

772
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:02,413
Recently, the Yuehai Binhai Road issue

773
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:04,472
has made Pingchuan County

774
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:06,373
Committee Compound unsettled.

775
00:40:07,052 --> 00:40:08,172
Regarding the causes

776
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:10,413
and consequences of this matter,

777
00:40:10,773 --> 00:40:13,052
let's invite Zheng Decheng,

778
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:15,413
Secretary of Yuehai,
to report in detail.

779
00:40:18,413 --> 00:40:19,092
Make it good.

780
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,853
Mr. Zheng is so pitiful. What can he do?

781
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:35,333
My heart is pounding.

782
00:40:37,092 --> 00:40:38,212
(Meng was right.)

783
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,933
(It's hard for us now to imagine)

784
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,212
(in such an innocent era,)

785
00:40:44,132 --> 00:40:46,252
(how one person openly apologizing
to thousands)

786
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,052
(must have felt.)

787
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:51,532
(And most of them)

788
00:40:52,013 --> 00:40:54,652
(were cadres higher in rank
and position than himself.)

789
00:40:56,773 --> 00:40:58,104
(I'm not sure if Zheng Decheng)

790
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,933
(could actually speak.)

791
00:41:28,373 --> 00:41:29,732
Zheng Decheng ran away.

792
00:41:29,732 --> 00:41:30,616
Why did he run away?

793
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:32,333
- Why did Zheng Decheng run away?
- What's he doing?

794
00:41:37,692 --> 00:41:38,373
What's going on?

795
00:41:39,612 --> 00:41:40,572
Where did he go?

796
00:41:49,652 --> 00:41:50,212
Water.

797
00:41:54,853 --> 00:41:56,333
Slow down. Don't choke!

798
00:41:56,732 --> 00:41:57,813
Just take it all up.

799
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:31,293
Hello, everyone.

800
00:42:32,732 --> 00:42:34,293
I am the man known as

801
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:36,413
Pingchuan County's biggest fool,

802
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:37,973
Zheng Decheng.

803
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:42,853
You heard him?

804
00:42:43,052 --> 00:42:45,293
Mr. Zheng said he's
Pingchuan County's biggest fool.

805
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:47,453
- First,
- I heard.

806
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:49,612
I want to apologize

807
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:51,896
to all cadres and families
who came to build

808
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:53,172
in Yuehai.

809
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:55,652
My personal mistake

810
00:42:56,732 --> 00:42:57,692
has caused you hardship.

811
00:42:59,373 --> 00:42:59,933
