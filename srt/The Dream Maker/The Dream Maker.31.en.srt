When did you get here?

17
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:40,225
(Yan's Wontons)
When?

18
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:41,505
You hear everything?

19
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:42,266
What do you want?

20
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:46,026
Well, I want to buy a karaoke machine.

21
00:01:46,345 --> 00:01:47,345
What machine?

22
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:50,225
Master, that karaoke machine

23
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:52,466
is something
that can be used for singing.

24
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:57,425
A singing machine?

25
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:58,166
Yes.

26
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:00,585
Then it's similar to a guitar, right?

27
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:02,145
- Guitar?
- No.

28
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:04,425
It's more advanced than a guitar, right?

29
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:05,945
You can sing with it.

30
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,986
There's a...

31
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:09,826
It can play by itself.

32
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:11,066
You'll figure it out.

33
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:12,066
Otherwise...

34
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:13,666
It's okay or it's not.

35
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:14,826
Anyway, see if it's okay.

36
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:15,446
Right?

37
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:16,266
You tell him.

38
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:17,266
He doesn't know it.

39
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,786
Well, Dongfu.

40
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:21,546
I delivered goods
to the Yuehai Grand Hotel this morning.

41
00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:22,666
I saw they had

42
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:24,465
a karaoke machine.

43
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:25,405
- Yan.
- I...

44
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,346
Buy it.

45
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,745
As long as you like it, buy one.

47
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,106
You helped a lot today.

48
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,152
Thanks for introducing me to Mr. Zhang,

49
00:02:56,386 --> 00:02:58,145
or I couldn't land this order.

50
00:02:58,546 --> 00:02:59,185
Not at all.

51
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:01,226
I thought to have dinner with you,

52
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:02,946
but I have something to do. Another day.

53
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:03,606
Okay.

54
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:04,546
- I'll leave.
- Yuan.

55
00:03:04,745 --> 00:03:05,245
Thanks.

56
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,145
- Not at all.
- Bye.

57
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:06,645
Take care.

58

(Chunmei Printery Welcomes You)

59
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:17,066
Mr. Qian.

60
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,546
Wait for me?

61
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:23,705
Been waiting here?

62
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:24,546
Yes.

63
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,625
What if I leave through the back door?

64
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:28,946
Then I'll wait there.

65
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:32,585
If I intentionally avoid you,

66
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,465
would I let you know that?

67
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:37,826
If I were you, I would've rushed in,

68
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,946
pestering, making a scene,
and threatening.

69
00:03:40,106 --> 00:03:42,745
You should've ruined my business
until I agree to teach you.

70
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:46,386
So, to get something done,

71
00:03:46,905 --> 00:03:48,346
you can't only rely on persistence.

72
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,425
Use tricks when necessary, understand?

73
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:53,705
I understand. Thank you, sir.

74
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,705
- What did you call me?
- Sir.

75
00:03:57,145 --> 00:03:57,826
Mr. Qian.

76
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,305
Call me Master.

77
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,546
Master.

78
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:06,766
Alright.

79
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,066
Have dinner with me tonight
to meet a client.

80
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:10,585
But first,

81
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,386
you have to change your clothes.

82
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:14,826
As the saying goes,
"Clothes make the man."

83
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,466
First impressions are very important.

84
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:18,986
If you're dressed so shabbily,

85
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:20,666
they won't even talk to you.

86
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:25,666
Right here?

87
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:30,825
It fits quite well.

88
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:34,745
What's up, Master?

89
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:36,586
Don't be so tense.

90
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:37,625
Come on, turn around.

91
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:40,745
Xiaohai, remember.

92
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,786
If you're not good with words,
then play to your strengths.

93
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,546
Speak less, observe more.

94
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:48,065
When you're with me,

95
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:49,906
you have to know what I want to do

96
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:51,586
with just one look from me.

97
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:53,505
Well, what do I want to do now?

98
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:57,986
You want to...

99
00:04:58,706 --> 00:04:59,305
Now you...

100
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,346
Enough. You'll learn.

101
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:02,305
What matters most now

102
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:04,586
is to relax.

103
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:06,586
Relax. Don't look so serious.

104
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:07,945
Smile.

105
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:13,065
One more.

106
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,305
Okay, pretty good.

107
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:24,305
This haircut should last a month or so.

108
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:25,906
Okay.

109
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:30,865
Lili.

110
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,226
Did you paint this picture?

111
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:35,986
Yes, I painted it.

112
00:05:36,865 --> 00:05:37,666
You painted it?

113
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:38,385
Yes.

114
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:48,305
What is this?

115
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:49,865
I made it.

116
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:51,865
You can press the button over there.

117
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:52,825
After you press it,

118
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:54,425
it'll really move

119
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:55,425
like a record player.

120
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:56,666
Really.

121
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:57,865
Fun, right?

122
00:05:58,385 --> 00:06:00,786
Lili, I only knew
you were great at drawing.

123
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:03,106
Didn't expect your crafts
to be this amazing too.

124
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:05,706
Business at the salon has been slow.

125
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,786
I made these to kill time.

126
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:08,865
Keep it if you like it.

127
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:09,706
No way.

128
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:12,664
You must have put a lot of thought
into making this.

129
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:13,706
I'll pay for it.

130
00:06:14,546 --> 00:06:15,425
No need.

131
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:16,825
I just made these to kill time.

132
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:18,786
I can make one anytime.

133
00:06:19,226 --> 00:06:21,625
Look, I made all of these.

134
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:22,625
And these.

135
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:26,146
I made this from junk.

136
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:29,906
You're so creative.

137
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:33,425
And this one. I made it with shells.

138
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:34,786
I picked shells up myself.

139
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:37,425
This is a bunny, and here's a bird.
Cute, right?

140
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:38,906
So creative.

141
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,625
Look how fun those eyes are.

142
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,486
And this.

143
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,146
Look,

144
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,026
I painted these.

145
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,185
I paint when I have free time.

146
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,425
Take a look.

147
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:52,666
Too many to keep up.

148
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:53,346
Look from here.

149
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,226
The paint will dirty your hands.

150
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:55,885
Okay.

151
00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:00,305
Did you design all of these?

152
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:04,065
You're practically China's Picasso.

153
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:05,646
Who?

154
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:07,625
A great artist, very unconventional.

155
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:08,906
A great artist?

156
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,106
I'll bring you one of his art books.

157
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:14,825
It will surely open your eyes.

158
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,666
Alright, I'll take a good look

159
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:21,265
at P-Picasso.

160
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:26,666
Ms. Li.

161
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:30,865
Do you really think
the things I made are good?

162
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,906
Very good! Unrestrained and creative!

163
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,026
Do you think others

164
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,945
would also think
the things I made are good?

165
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:46,106
Who are you referring to?

166
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,305
Money's on the table.

167
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:51,325
Got it.

168
00:07:51,825 --> 00:07:52,546
See you next time.

169
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:53,526
Okay.

170
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,330
(Yan's Wontons)

171
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,185
You're here. Take a seat.
I'll make you some wontons.

172
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:11,265
No, no need.

173
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,226
What's wrong?

174
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,106
Take this.

175
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:19,065
Keep this.

176
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:20,666
What is it?

177
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:27,265
That machine you want?

178
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:29,546
It must be expensive.

179
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,745
Just take it.

180
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,306
No, I can't take your money.

181
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:39,865
Take it back.

182
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:40,865
Why do you reject?

183
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:41,706
Take it, you keep it.

184
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:42,946
I can't take it. Listen.

185
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:43,645
Don't.

186
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:44,505
Don't do this.

187
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:45,865
There are people here.

188
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:46,785
- Many people are here...
- You...

189
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:48,826
Keep it.

190
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:53,586

How thoughtful.

381
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:07,825
Very thoughtful.

382
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:09,305
Hurry up and eat.

383
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:10,186
Let me try it.

384
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:12,726
How is it?

385
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:14,105
Delicious.

386
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:14,906
- Delicious!
- Soup.

387
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:16,505
- It isn't your cooking.
- You're lucky.

388
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:17,466
Really lucky.

389
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:18,245
Who made it?

390
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:19,576
Someone who cares about you.

391
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:20,285
Who is it?

392
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:22,146
Your fangirl.

393
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:23,866
What do you mean?

394
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:24,686
Who is it?

395
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:26,045
Wang Lili.

396
00:18:27,545 --> 00:18:28,045
Wang Lili.

397
00:18:28,706 --> 00:18:29,206
What?

398
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,226
Wang Lili.

399
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:41,986
What's wrong?

400
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:46,505
Listen, your wife has been gone
for so many years,

401
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,105
and Dapeng is in college.

402
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:50,706
You're living all alone, struggling.

403
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:51,785
That won't do.

404
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,426
You need someone.

405
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:56,426
She's such a good girl
and has expressed her affection to you.

406
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:57,906
You should start considering her.

407
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:58,406
Mr. Zheng.

408
00:18:58,466 --> 00:18:59,426
My foot!

409
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,426
Wang Lili is a young girl.

410
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:02,706
A young girl?

411
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:04,906
Xuemei already had Xiaoyu at her age.

412
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:06,886
Eat it.

413
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:08,845
No.

414
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:10,386
Wait, you saw

415
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:11,386
her come to me, right?

416
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:13,305
It's just that she had an idea

417
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:14,946
and wanted me to give her advice.

418
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:19,305
Yes, you two communicate
through official channels.

419
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:20,386
Very good.

420
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,186
What else do you want her to do?

421
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,986
You just helped her a little,
and she immediately made you food.

422
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:28,025
You two make a perfect match,

423
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:28,785
in my opinion.

424
00:19:28,946 --> 00:19:30,426
How happy you were during eating.

425
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:31,926
Listen.

426
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:33,946
She even went to Mr. Lin for your photo.

427
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:36,986
He didn't give it to her.

428
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:37,886
Didn't.

429
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:40,186
And he doesn't have any good photos

430
00:19:40,186 --> 00:19:40,686
of you.

431
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:43,025
Don't you like her?

432
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:45,345
My foot!

433
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:47,626
I never even thought of her that way.

434
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:49,666
Come on, make way.

435
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,105
(Integrity Comes First)
Okay, one moment.

436
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:52,226
Yours is coming.

437
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:53,146
Coming.

438
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:54,666
Here.

439
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,025
See what you want to sing.

440
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:56,946
Okay.

441
00:19:58,345 --> 00:19:59,505
Okay.

442
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:01,624
Please wait. One more ahead of you.

443
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:06,386
Mr. Zheng, you're here.

444
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:08,285
Yan.

445
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,186
It's fine. You go ahead.

446
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:11,545
I'm here to look around.

447
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:13,226
Quite a crowd here.

448
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:14,466
Very good.

449
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:17,186
Thanks, Mr. Zheng.
Why don't you sing one song?

450
00:20:17,545 --> 00:20:18,146
Pick one song.

451
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,025
No, I don't sing.

452
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:21,025
I'm tone-deaf.

453
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:23,866
It's okay. Practice makes perfect.

454
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,426
Let Lili teach you.
Lili sings quite well.

455
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:27,545
Good!

456
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:28,345
What?

457
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:32,025
You two are engaged. Don't be shy.

458
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:32,866
Good!

459
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:37,706
Don't talk nonsense.

460
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,466
Stop talking nonsense.

461
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:44,946
No, Mr. Zheng. I saw it.

462
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:47,466
A photo of you two
displayed right in her salon.

463
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:49,305
It shows you two are very close.

464
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:59,305
♪A loving couple
finds sweetness even in hardship♪

465
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:00,706
Mr. Zheng.

466
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:01,626
(Integrity Comes First)
Good!

467
00:21:13,626 --> 00:21:14,265
Mr. Zheng.

468
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:22,706
Lili.

469
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:24,305
I'm off now.

470
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:25,706
Take care.

471
00:21:26,426 --> 00:21:26,926
Okay.

472
00:21:32,706 --> 00:21:33,305
Mr. Zheng.

473
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,065
Are you here for me?

474
00:21:37,626 --> 00:21:38,126
No.

475
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:40,226
I was just passing by.

476
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:42,706
I saw the light on and came in to look.

477
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:44,785
Feel free.

478
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:03,585
When was this photo taken?
I don't remember it.

479
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:05,585
At the graduation ceremony.

480
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:07,426
You forgot?

481
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,186
Come on, adjust your clothes.

482
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:10,065
Come on. Smile.

483
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:11,025
- Yes, smile.
- Make a big smile.

484
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:12,226
Make a big smile.

485
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:12,785
Come on.

486
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:13,345
Big smile.

487
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,166
Come on.

488
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,706
Come on, look over here.

489
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:17,585
Three, two...

490
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:18,986
Wait!

491
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,005
Mr. Zheng.

492
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:21,426
Come take a photo with us.

493
00:22:21,426 --> 00:22:21,785
- Right.
- Right.

494
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:22,466
I'll pass.

495
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,986
Come on. Right?

496
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:24,545
You take it.

497
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:25,626
Come on, move in.

498
00:22:25,626 --> 00:22:26,545
- Stand in the middle.
- Come on, Mr. Zheng.

499
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,505
Come on, make way.

500
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:28,466
Take one.

501
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:29,545
Stand in the middle.

502
00:22:31,146 --> 00:22:32,866
Mr. Zheng, my name is Wang Lili.

503
00:22:33,946 --> 00:22:35,265
So you're Wang Lili.

504
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:36,926
Take it.

505
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:38,105
I'll take it.

506
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:38,646
Okay.

507
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:39,906
Come on, smile.

508
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:43,025
Three, two, one.

509
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:53,785
How could you cut up
the photo like this?

510
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:55,825
I-I want...

511
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,386
It's not suitable to display

512
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:58,505
this photo here, you know?

513
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:00,545
Why is that?

514
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:08,245
I'm over forty, right?

515
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:12,505
You're only in your twenties.
You're so young. It's not suitable.

516
00:23:12,785 --> 00:23:14,866
I'm the Secretary.
It might get me in trouble.

517
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:16,745
Rumors would spread, you know?

518
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:22,825
Stop this absurd behavior.

519
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:28,025
Should I burn it?

520
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:34,906
Not necessary. Just put it away.

521
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:38,986
I've put it away.

522
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:39,765
I'm leaving.

523
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:40,585
Mr. Zheng.

524
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:45,745
Mr. Zheng.

525
00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:49,466
I understand.

526
00:23:50,585 --> 00:23:52,305
I won't put you in a difficult position.

527
00:23:53,986 --> 00:23:54,626
I understand.

528
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,005
Mr. Zheng.

529
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:28,305
Someone prepared this for you.

530
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:34,706
Return it.

531
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,585
I don't know who made it.

532
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:37,666
Then why took it?

533
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:38,666
I really don't know.

534
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,345
It was on the counter when I arrived.

535
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:41,386
I know.

536
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:42,745
Don't say anything.

537
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,345
I'm not hungry. You have it.

538
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,545
Aren't you hungry, Mr. Zheng?

539
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:49,906
It has a heart on top.

540
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:52,845
Mr. Zheng.

541
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,226
Mr. Zheng, want to see me?

542
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:44,706
Meng.

543
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,505
Tell Ms. Lin

544
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:49,345
what's my blood pressure now.

545
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:52,706
Your systolic pressure is over 140.
You need to be careful.

546
00:25:53,146 --> 00:25:53,745
Meng.

547
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:57,906
I think I left my water cup in my room.

548
00:25:58,466 --> 00:25:59,745
Could you go look for it?

549
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:00,285
Okay.

550
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:04,065
If it's not in the office,
maybe it's in the canteen.

551
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:05,946
If not,

552
00:26:05,986 --> 00:26:07,265
it might be by the sink.

553
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:09,265
Just look around.

554
00:26:09,265 --> 00:26:10,186
Okay, I'll look around.

555
00:26:14,345 --> 00:26:16,146
Are you alright, Mr. Zheng?

556
00:26:17,265 --> 00:26:17,866
Not really.

557
00:26:20,626 --> 00:26:21,386
Ms. Li.

558
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:24,305
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

559
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:25,466
What is it?

560
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:28,505
Talk to Wang Lili.

561
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:29,986
Why?

562
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:32,505
Back then,

563
00:26:32,946 --> 00:26:34,626
you told me to look out for Wang Lili

564
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:36,646
and take extra care of her, right?

565
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:39,706
You said she was a genius
with great potential.

566
00:26:40,146 --> 00:26:40,666
I did.

567
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:41,906
And now?

568
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:43,825
Such a misunderstanding occurred.

569
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:45,226
Be responsible.

570
00:26:45,545 --> 00:26:46,265
It's my fault?

571
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,825
Then whose fault is it?

572
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,146
Go now.

573
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:52,426
Right away.

574
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:53,386
Mr. Zheng.

575
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,146
Actually, I don't think it's a big deal.

576
00:26:56,386 --> 00:26:58,466
It's a new era,
and people are free to love.

577
00:26:58,666 --> 00:26:59,706
You're both single.

578
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:02,265
If you like each other,
isn't that great?

579
00:27:02,426 --> 00:27:03,666
Who said I like her?

580
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:07,505
Who said I like her?

581
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:08,946
If not,

582
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,426
then why did she bring you meals?

583
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:11,626
How would I know?

584
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:14,825
I had no idea when
she developed such fleeting thoughts.

585
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:18,505
Mr. Zheng, you didn't get it.

586
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:21,065
Listen carefully.

587
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:25,105
These aren't just fleeting thoughts.
It's genuine affection.

588
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,946
You can't devote your life to a city.

589
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:31,065
It's time to consider your happiness.

590
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:34,466
Even so, I couldn't consider her.

591
00:27:35,265 --> 00:27:38,406
She's young and I'm old.

592
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,785
She might be ignorant, but I am not.

593
00:27:41,105 --> 00:27:42,906
Then make it clear to her yourself.

594
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:45,906
If I could make it clear to her,
why would I need you?

595
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:48,866
You know how high my blood pressure is.

596
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:51,785
I did talk to her.

597
00:27:52,065 --> 00:27:54,226
I told her
to stop such absurd behaviors.

598
00:27:54,986 --> 00:27:55,825
She agreed,

599
00:27:56,146 --> 00:27:57,906
yet now, it's like she never heard me.

600
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:04,226
Mr. Zheng, I want to help,

601
00:28:04,906 --> 00:28:06,466
but I am the mayor.

602
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:09,825
It's inappropriate for me to
constantly meddle in personal matters.

603
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:13,226
And frankly, I'm not good at it.

604
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:16,025
Li Qiuping.

605
00:28:16,226 --> 00:28:19,226
I'm not speaking to you
as Zheng Decheng,

606
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:21,585
but as the Secretary
of the town committee.

607
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:24,226
I order you
to handle this matter properly.

608
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:25,706
Is that clear?

609
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:26,946
Mr. Zheng.

610
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,025
I can't guarantee I could make it.

611
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:30,146
I'll do my best.

612
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,745
No way, you have to make it.

613
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:39,314
(Chunmei Printery)

614
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:43,706
Ms. Li.

615
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:46,406
Lili.

616
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,966
Mr. Zheng. Wait...

617
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:52,406
Ms. Li.

618
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:54,065
What's wrong?

619
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:55,906
Why do you know I am here?

620
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:59,065
I called your salon.
Your assistant said you'd be here.

621
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:02,545
Hairstyle catalog.

622
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:04,426
(Quality First)
I asked them to print it.

623
00:29:05,986 --> 00:29:06,745
What's wrong?

624
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:12,545
I brought you the Picasso art book

625
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:13,745
I mentioned.

626
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:15,005
Thank you.

627
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:32,866
Picasso is really amazing.

628
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:37,505
He painted blue
with such depth and beauty.

629
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:39,226
Yes.

630
00:29:42,585 --> 00:29:44,785
Lili, these hairstyles look great.

631
00:29:49,386 --> 00:29:51,386
What's wrong? Lacking inspiration?

632
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:53,105
Something upsets me,

633
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:56,585
so I can't focus.

634
00:30:01,745 --> 00:30:02,626
What is it?

635
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,345
I can't tell anyone.

636
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:17,426
It might get him in trouble.

637
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:20,065
I won't tell others.

638
00:30:21,666 --> 00:30:22,386
Who is it?

639
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:32,785
Mr. Zheng.

640
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:37,825
Mr. Zheng?

641
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:38,825
Mr. Zheng.

642
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:42,626
Lili, what do you like about Mr. Zheng?

643
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:46,906
He's so handsome and incredible!

644
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:49,666
With broad shoulders and long legs,
he's so humorous.

645
00:30:49,785 --> 00:30:51,025
Everything he explains

646
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:52,825
just clicks for me.

647
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:54,505
Once I heard his big ideas,

648
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:55,906
I would be

649
00:30:55,946 --> 00:30:57,025
giggling away like crazy.

650
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:58,626
During class, he told us

651
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:02,105
the story of raising turtles,
running for Secretary,

652
00:31:02,426 --> 00:31:03,745
and peeling shrimp for years.

653
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,265
Peal one shrimp per second.

654
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:06,186
Who can do that?

655
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:08,386
He can.

656
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,986
I think he's just incredible.

657
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:11,426
There's nothing he can't do.

658
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,186
And he dresses well.
The color combinations are spot on.

659
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:16,545
I think everything about him
is perfect and incredible.

660
00:31:17,345 --> 00:31:18,626
You're with him every day.

661
00:31:18,785 --> 00:31:20,466
Don't you think
he's incredibly handsome?

662
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,386
Don't you?

663
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,226
Right.

664
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:25,626
Right.

665
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:28,146
I think,

666
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,585
when you like someone,

667
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:40,745
you should like everything about him
and know him inside out.

668
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:42,426
Not just his strengths.

669
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:44,545
The flaws are also part of a person.

670
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:46,186
Otherwise,

671
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:49,186
you'd become very blind.

672
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:04,785
I did find one of his flaws.

673
00:32:06,745 --> 00:32:07,946
Because of this,

674
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:11,265
I can't sleep for days.

675
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,025
What is it?

676
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:15,065
I thought he was perfect

677
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:16,986
in every way.

678
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:19,986
But he told me

679
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,466
to keep my distance from him,

680
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:26,265
so I could only stalk him.

681
00:32:27,065 --> 00:32:27,946
And I found out...

682
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:38,105
His neck is crooked.

683
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,025
His neck is crooked?

684
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:43,226
His crooked neck.

685
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:46,666
Didn't you notice that?

686
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,585
You're with him every day.

687
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:51,305
Didn't you notice that?

688
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:54,866
It might be a tiny bit crooked.

689
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:56,585
A tiny bit?

690
00:32:58,545 --> 00:32:59,866
It's seriously crooked!

691
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:02,906
I asked myself,

692
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:04,426
"What do you like about him?"

693
00:33:04,785 --> 00:33:05,865
"Do you like his neck?"

694
00:33:05,865 --> 00:33:07,626
"Do you like him or his neck?"

695
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:09,126
I like him, right?

696
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:10,946
Then why am I always
focusing on his neck?

697
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:12,906
And ever since I noticed it was crooked,

698
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:15,226
it just seems
more and more crooked to me.

699
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,345
Now it's unbearable to me!

700
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,505
Lili...

701
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,866
What I want to ask is,

702
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:28,785
how can I

703
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:31,626
keep liking him

704
00:33:33,585 --> 00:33:34,745
but also ignore

705
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:38,345
his crooked neck?

706
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,345
Then I think you just don't like him.

707
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:44,626
I don't like him?

708
00:33:44,986 --> 00:33:46,305
Right, you don't.

709
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:47,146
Why?

710
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:49,545
If you truly liked him,

711
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:51,986
you wouldn't focus on his crooked neck.

712
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:54,186
You'd overlook this little flaw.

713
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:55,505
Can you?

714
00:34:03,466 --> 00:34:03,986
Exactly.

715
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:11,946
So, I don't like him.

716
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:15,386
You don't like him.

717
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:19,466
Will he be sad if I tell him?

718
00:34:19,906 --> 00:34:23,225
No, he will understand you.

719
00:34:39,266 --> 00:34:40,946
Didn't I just take this yesterday?

720
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:41,986
Why check again today?

721
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:44,426
We need to monitor your blood pressure.

722
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:45,705
Here then.

723
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:46,366
Alright.

724
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:48,545
Such a hassle.

725
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:50,705
Put your arm on this.

726
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,266
What difference could it make?

727
00:34:58,105 --> 00:34:59,665
I suspect you have hypertension.

728
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,625
I'll monitor for three days.

729
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:05,786
Just take it.

730
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:06,625
Fine.

731
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:13,786
Ms. Li.

732
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:14,525
Mr. Zheng.

733
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:15,545
Shut it.

734
00:35:16,145 --> 00:35:16,786
Shut it.

735
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:18,665
High blood pressure again?

736
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:24,906
Ms. Li.

737
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:27,505
The task I assigned yesterday...

738
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:30,246
Well...

739
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:33,746
That person...

740
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:35,025
Who?

741
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:36,386
Shut it.

742
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:37,605
Put it on.

743
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,005
Well...

744
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:51,986
What's wrong?

745
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:55,746
Why are you staring at me?

746
00:35:56,466 --> 00:35:58,665
Once it's noticed,
it's really hard to overlook.

747
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,786
What do you mean?

748
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:03,065
I'm asking you

749
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:05,426
if you make it clear to that person.

750
00:36:05,986 --> 00:36:07,826
Rest assured, I've clarified it.

751
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:10,386
That person said it was
just a misunderstanding.

752
00:36:14,426 --> 00:36:15,585
A misunderstanding?

753
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:19,346
Mr. Zheng, your blood pressure
is normal now.

754
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:24,866
Mr. Qian,

755
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,585
I feel like

756
00:36:27,906 --> 00:36:29,386
I've seen this

757
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:31,306
(Super Dog Restaurant)
happen before.

758
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:34,266
Not exactly.

759
00:36:34,746 --> 00:36:36,826
Back then, you just arrived.

760
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:37,986
We weren't familiar

761
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:41,386
with this new type of restaurant,
so nobody came.

762
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:45,346
But now everyone's business
is struggling,

763
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:48,466
so no one's coming.
There is a big difference.

764
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:52,505
I've sold at cost price.

765
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:54,466
Can't make it any lower.

766
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:55,225
Right.

767
00:36:57,346 --> 00:36:58,705
With so few customers,

768
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:00,705
just turn off some lights.

769
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:04,105
I don't care.

770
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:07,665
You asked me to come to Yuehai.

771
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,025
Take responsibility.

772
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,466
Otherwise, I have to move.

773
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:12,225
Wait, come on.

774
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:13,906
Don't be so anxious.

775
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,225
Well, listen.

776
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:18,585
Tomorrow I'll go to the town government

777
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:20,605
and ask them
to think of a solution, okay?

778
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:22,205
Okay.

779
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,125
Well...

780
00:37:24,986 --> 00:37:26,545
I'm a bit hungry. Get me

781
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:27,946
a roast duck rice meal, okay?

782
00:37:29,386 --> 00:37:30,225
Rice is available,

783
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:32,585
but no roast duck.

784
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:34,065
Wait, I just want a roast duck.

785
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:34,826
No duck!

786
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:36,105
I haven't eaten meat in days.

787
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:36,826
No duck!

788
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:39,545
Look, those ducks you have will go bad.

789
00:37:41,866 --> 00:37:42,625
Thanks!

790
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:50,266
(Buy Three Get One Free)
Are you two eating?

791
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:51,246
No.

792
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:52,145
Okay.

(Grand Sale! All Dishes 30 Percent Off.

794
00:38:19,065 --> 00:38:20,105
Yan.

795
00:38:20,585 --> 00:38:23,346
You spent so much money
on this karaoke machine,

796
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:26,386
but with business struggling,
who's coming to sing now?

797
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:39,306
Yan.

798
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:40,065
Meng.

799
00:38:40,346 --> 00:38:42,306
- Ms. Li.
- Where are you off to?

800
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,986
I am heading to the mall

801
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:47,025
to return this karaoke machine.

802
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:49,065
Return it? Why?

803
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:52,266
I was too impulsive back then.

804
00:38:52,505 --> 00:38:54,665
The machine was only popular
for a few days.

805
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:57,065
Now, hardly anyone comes to sing.

806
00:38:57,746 --> 00:38:58,246
And,

807
00:38:58,386 --> 00:39:00,625
even this big mall is empty now.

808
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,665
Let alone this street.
There's no foot traffic.

809
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,625
So I thought to return it.

810
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:08,466
I'd lose money even if I sold it now.

811
00:39:08,665 --> 00:39:11,746
I bought it for 2,500 yuan,
now it's only worth 1,800 yuan.

812
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,105
You're right. Better return it now.

813
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:15,906
Don't.

814
00:39:16,185 --> 00:39:16,705
Yan.

815
00:39:16,946 --> 00:39:19,346
Do you know the economic theory
called the lipstick effect?

816
00:39:19,946 --> 00:39:22,346
When the economy faces difficulties,

817
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,386
mass entertainment actually thrives.

818
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:28,306
Lipstick effect?

819
00:39:28,906 --> 00:39:29,665
In other words,

820
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:31,625
everyone's struggling to make money,

821
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:32,946
so they're feeling upset.

822
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:34,826
They actually need

823
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:37,105
entertainment that can cheer them up.

824
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:41,065
Anyway, don't rush to return it.
Just hold on.
