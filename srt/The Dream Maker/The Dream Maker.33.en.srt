Here's the money you lent me
to buy the karaoke machine.

17
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,065
Within three months,

18
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:47,826
I've already earned back the money.

19
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:48,865
Here you are.

20
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:52,826
You keep this.

21
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:55,306
I didn't lend you the money.

22
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:03,306
Okay, then I'll save it for us.

23
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:06,505
When we've saved up enough,
I want to open a shop.

24
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:09,785
Yan.

25
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:12,186
I...

26
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:14,665
I have a few thousand yuan saved up.

27
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:16,225
If you open a shop,

28
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:17,586
I'll withdraw it all.

29
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:20,586
Then I'll ask Xie

30
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,586
where to rent a cheap place.

31
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:28,385
Dongfu.

32
00:02:30,105 --> 00:02:30,866
You're wonderful.

33
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:35,466
Actually, I was worried

34
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:38,345
you wouldn't approve of me
opening the karaoke bar.

35
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:40,625
I overthought it.

36
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:47,825
Wait, what did you say?

37
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,026
Open a karaoke bar.

38
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,426
What else did you think?

39
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:57,026
A wonton shop?

40
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,306
A snack shop or a restaurant
would be fine too.

41
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:04,266
If you don't want to sell food,
then you could open a shop

42
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,146
to sell toys or clothes.

43
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:09,866
Why do you want to open a karaoke bar?

44
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:12,625
Because it can make much money.

45
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:17,505
Making money?
Is it really that important?

46
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,146
Can't you pursue something else?

47
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,466
Making money is important.

48
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:22,426
You are a deputy mayor.

49
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:23,665
Yuehai was built

50
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,065
to encourage people
to come and make money.

51
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,105
If not, how can I be a "monkey"?

52
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:29,866
If not, how can I live a good life?

53
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:30,526
Right.

54
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:33,026
But there are many ways to make money.

55
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,945
You don't have to open a karaoke bar.

56
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:37,706
What's wrong with opening a karaoke bar?

57
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:39,825
I think you've just been in a bad mood.

58
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,345
I thought you'd figured it out.

59
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:43,906
Now I see
you haven't figured it out at all.

60
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,866
You just don't like me singing.

61
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,385
This isn't about singing at all!

62
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:49,746
I-I think...

63
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,866
Just say what's on your mind.

64
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:58,105
I understand that you women
like to look beautiful,

65
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:00,426
but you...

66
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,785
You are already...

67
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:03,306
You don't have to dress up

68
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:04,945
when you sing, do you?

69
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:08,186
You...

70
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:09,665
Wait, you...

71
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:10,945
Didn't you notice?

72
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:13,105
You've changed
since buying that karaoke machine.

73
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:14,906
Changed?

74
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:17,066
I've changed.

75
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:20,506
I've become prettier,
more confident, and happier.

76
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:21,865
What's wrong with that?

77
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:23,266
But is that still you?

78
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:26,865
Is that still Sun Xiaoyan I knew?

79
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:28,586
What was Sun Xiaoyan you knew like?

80
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:31,646
Fine.

81
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,745
Yan, if you want to make money,
and become independent

82
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:37,906
and self-supporting, I will support you.

83
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:39,545
But there are many other ways.

84
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:41,026
You could do some business.

85
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:41,745
You...

86
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:44,785
Even finding a job could make money.

87
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,545
I'm a deputy mayor.

88
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:49,626
I-I work for the government.
I am a cadre.

89
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:50,665
You...

90
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,985
If my girlfriend opened a karaoke bar,

91
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:56,985
would that sound decent?

92
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,345
Now you're afraid it won't sound decent?

93
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:01,586
Now you're afraid of the gossips?

94
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:03,946
Why weren't you afraid when you date me?

95
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:04,966
Right.

96
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,906
Finding a decent job...

97
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,225
Being a deputy mayor
is decent enough, right?

98
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:11,865
Mr. Lin, how much can you earn a month?

99
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,706
Right, you earn more than me.

100
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:26,466
But to be honest,

101
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,026
you earned that money from singing.

102
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,326
Do you think those people
who request songs

103
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:31,946
really like singing?

104
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:33,266
They're just after you.

105
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:34,326
You...

106
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,266
Don't you think earning money like that
is disgraceful?

107
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:41,425
Disgraceful?

108
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:45,688
I'm disgraceful.

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,225

Li.

142
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:31,785
Well, listen.

143
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,146
We just had Lin

144
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:35,506
reflect on his problems.

145
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,946
We talked to him
and scolded him properly.

146
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:40,506
But you know how stubborn Lin is.

147
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:41,506
He had no choice.

148
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:43,946
Could you help persuade Yan?

149
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:44,665
- Just help.
- Right?

150
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:47,706
They're just having a quarreling.

151
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:49,626
They can settle it through discussion.

152
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:51,706
Ms. Li, how about

153
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:53,706
we try to approach it

154
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:55,506
from a work perspective?

155
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:58,665
See, Lin is the key player

156
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,225
to Yuehai's construction, right?

157
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:03,105
Now he has something on his mind.

158
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:03,906
If we didn't

159
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:04,946
help him to solve it,

160
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:06,466
it might affect his work.

161
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:09,225
Then Yuehai will suffer, right?

162
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:10,185
So I think...

163
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,545
Do any of you three
have the awareness befitting cadres?

164
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:17,665
It's true
that we are Mr. Lin's colleagues.

165
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:18,665
As his colleagues,

166
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,906
(Chats under 5 minutes)
we should care about his personal life.

167
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:24,066
But we should have bottom lines

168
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,266
in caring about his personal life.

169
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:27,665
We have no obligation

170
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:30,545
or the right
to interfere in his personal life.

171
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:31,545
We're not.

172
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,465
We're not interfering,

173
00:08:32,986 --> 00:08:34,065
but doing a good deed.

174
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:34,986
We care about him.

175
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:35,945
As the saying goes,

176
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:38,305
"Never tear apart a marriage
for all the world."

177
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:39,545
You're interfering.

178
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,146
What era is this?

179
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:42,986
They fell in love freely

180
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:44,705
and tried dating.

181
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:46,465
But in Lin Dongfu's opinion,

182
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,952
singing by Sun Xiaoyan
is what he can't compromise.

183
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,866
And in Sun Xiaoyan's opinion,

184
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:52,465
in their relationship,

185
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:55,185
Lin Dongfu showed male chauvinism.

186
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:57,592
It's also something
she can't compromise.

187
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:00,626
Sun Xiaoyan and Lin Dongfu
are both good people.

188
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,146
But two good people
aren't necessarily suited as lovers.

189
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:05,705
Yes.

190
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:06,746
It makes sense.

191
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:08,545
Well, Xie.

192
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:09,506
You're right.

193
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:10,506
Yes, right.

194
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:12,366
People can change, right?

195
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:14,665
Look at me, I used to be
very male chauvinistic too.

196
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:15,386
See?

197
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:16,185
Yes, now...

198
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:16,746
The same now.

199
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:17,746
We correct our mistakes.

200
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:18,386
Stop it.

201
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:19,626
Who isn't male chauvinistic?

202
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:20,626
Look at me now,

203
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:24,026
I can speak from a female's perspective.

204
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:24,665
Exactly.

205
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,425
But Mr. Lin is different.

206
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:27,866
He's an adult.

207
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,465
If he figures it out himself,

208
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:30,785
he'll go find Sun Xiaoyan.

209
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,266
I'll say it again.

210
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:33,746
As his colleagues,

211
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:36,065
we should not
interfere in his personal life.

212
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:37,386
You can't force anyone.

213
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:40,026
Yes, you are absolutely right.

214
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,825
But we need to finish
the good deed we started.

215
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:44,665
Right?

216
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:45,545
Give him a way out.

217
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:49,906
Yan, what brings you here?

218
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:52,045
You're here to talk to Ms. Li, right?

219
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,705
That's perfect.

220
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:55,106
We just finished our talk.

221
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:56,026
Let's go.

222
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:57,266
Yes, we're done.

223
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,106
Right, chat with Ms. Li.

224
00:09:59,146 --> 00:09:59,705
Exactly.

225
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:00,785
Come on, Yan.

226
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:01,665
Sit here and chat.

227
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:02,266
Take your time.

228
00:10:02,465 --> 00:10:03,386
Thank you, Mr. Tan.

229
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:04,506
Take your time.

230
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,185
Ms. Li.

231
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:05,945
Just chat.

232
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:07,386
Please.

233
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:08,705
Have a good chat.

234
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:09,325
Okay.

235
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:10,185
Let's go.

236
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:11,065
Alright.

237
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:11,960
Get some water.

238
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:14,185
No need.

239
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:14,945
Hurry up and go.

240
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,266
Yan, I'll get you some tea.

241
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:22,065
No need.

242
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:24,146
Ms. Li, no need.

243
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,185
I just have one thing to say.

244
00:10:29,825 --> 00:10:31,866
This is the money Mr. Lin lent me.

245
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:33,825
Please return it to him.

246
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:34,766
Thank you.

247
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:36,006
Yan.

248
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:36,626
Ms. Li.

249
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,746
Actually, I overheard
what you said just now.

250
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:41,825
Thank you.

251
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:46,146
But don't try persuading me anymore.

252
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,585
I'm not trying.

253
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,106
I just wanted to tell you,

254
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:50,465
you should

255
00:10:50,585 --> 00:10:52,386
return this to Mr. Lin yourself.

256
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:54,506
The relationship between you two

257
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,185
only concerns you two.

258
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,386
And only you two

259
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,665
can decide the future
of your relationship.

260
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,026
Do you understand what I mean?

261
00:11:10,506 --> 00:11:11,305
Thank you, Ms. Li.

262
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:23,106
(Secretary's Office)
What are you doing?

263
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:25,386
Look.

264
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:26,746
You go.

265
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:29,506
See?

266
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:30,825
I told you.

267
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:32,986
She'll definitely listen to Ms. Li.

268
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:34,785
She's going to Lin now.

269
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:39,705
Women understand women, after all.

270
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:10,545
She's in.

271
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:12,146
Lin Tofu needs to seize this chance.

272
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,305
He can't mess it up again.

273
00:12:14,945 --> 00:12:15,866
You will scare Lin.

274
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:16,866
Stop it.

275
00:12:35,866 --> 00:12:36,785
Today, I...

276
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,126
What I said...

277
00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:41,825
I know.

278
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:44,126
It's fine.

279
00:12:58,106 --> 00:12:58,866
Here, take it.

280
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:03,026
(Yuehai Master Plan)

281
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:04,266
I just want to tell you

282
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:05,945
I've thought it over.

283
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:10,425
I am determined
to open that karaoke bar.

284
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:14,026
If you truly cannot accept it,

285
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,465
then let's break up.

286
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:24,266
Life is hard.

287
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:26,986
Everyone has to go through this.

288
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:27,906
Right?

289
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,665
You just shut the door on me.

290
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:32,906
How great.

291
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,305
With this teamwork,

292
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:36,226
it is a miracle
we could build this city.

293
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:36,746
Listen.

294
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:39,506
There will be more miracles coming.

295
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,425
Miracles keep happening here in Yuehai.

296
00:13:42,585 --> 00:13:43,665
I think

297
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:45,866
singing by Sun Xiaoyan

298
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,106
is really no big deal.

299
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:48,825
Just a perfectly normal hobby.

300
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,346
Lin...

301
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:52,746
I wonder how Xuemei is doing
at home alone.

302
00:13:52,785 --> 00:13:54,705
You are so lucky to have...

303
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:55,545
Exactly.

304
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:56,305
Look at you.

305
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:57,785
You are so lucky to have a family.

306
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,906
- You...
- Every family is different.

307
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,578
(Yuehai Master Plan)

308
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:11,006
Yan...

309
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:13,906
Yan.

310
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:16,106
Let me tell you,

311
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,305
it's something I can't compromise.

312
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:21,226
I don't understand.

313
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:24,565
Do you think opening a bar
is more important than our relationship?

314
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,425
I don't get it.

315
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:29,866
What's so joyful

316
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:33,465
about singing songs?

317
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,026
A bunch of people spend money,

318
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,665
going wild like lunatics there.

319
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:38,626
Are they happy? What's the point?

320
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,065
Everyone has a hobby.

321
00:14:42,626 --> 00:14:44,705
Then why do you
enjoy building roads and houses?

322
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:46,665
If Yuehai wants to develop,

323
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:48,746
roads and houses must be built, right?

324
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:50,866
Dongfu, I'm not here to argue with you.

325
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:53,425
Stay calm.

326
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:55,366
Take a seat.

327
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:07,986
I...

328
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:16,106
I'm truly grateful for your care

329
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,825
to me and my family during this time.

330
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:24,226
You're an incredibly good person.

331
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:29,848
You're probably the kindest man

332
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:31,945
I have ever met.

333
00:15:34,906 --> 00:15:35,585
It's my fault.

334
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,545
I'm not a proper woman

335
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,106
you consider.

336
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:49,785
Yan.

337
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:51,486
I...

338
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:53,945
I...

339
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:58,346
I-I didn't mean that.

340
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:01,506
Can't...

341
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:06,465
Can't you just

342
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:09,506
go back to being

343
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,065
that simple Sun Xiaoyan?

344
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:16,026
I know you don't love singing

345
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:17,986
or making money.

346
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:22,346
You love having

347
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:25,016
others listen to you singing.

348
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:27,305
You're simply

349
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:31,386
seeking vanity.

350
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:36,785
Yes.

351
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:45,746
I am seeking vanity.

352
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:50,106
Maybe I used to be like this.

353
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:52,945
I love singing.

354
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:55,945
Every time I finish singing
and hear those praises,

355
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:59,746
I feel so satisfied.

356
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:02,386
I love singing.

357
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:05,185
I love hearing those praises.

358
00:17:05,705 --> 00:17:08,146
I love pretty clothes and dressing up.

359
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:09,505
I also love making money.

360
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,265
You can love building roads and houses.

361
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,985
You can build roads and houses
your whole life.

362
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,025
But I hate to make wontons
my whole life.

363
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:22,465
I never liked making wontons.
I've had enough.

364
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,546
I made wontons to earn money too.

365
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:31,906
I work so hard to earn money,

366
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:36,146
because I want a different life
for me and my son.

367
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:38,386
Any problem?

368
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:54,505
Why isn't she out?

369
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:56,745
Why is it taking so long?

370
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:04,505
Let's end here.

371
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:17,025
This part right here.

372
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:17,765
Right.

373
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:18,546
- Mr. Zheng.
- Over here.

374
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:20,346
The economic revitalization concept here

375
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:21,586
is quite fascinating.

376
00:18:21,705 --> 00:18:23,906
We must promote
China's outstanding cultural heritage.

377
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:24,945
- Over here.
- Mr. Zheng. Look.

378
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,185
The newspaper now mentions

379
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:27,546
four legal drafts had been

380
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,106
submitted to relevant departments...

381
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:29,985
Everyone,

382
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:36,185
thank you for worrying about us.

383
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:38,005
Not at all.

384
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:40,146
Leaving?

385
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:41,265
Goodbye.

386
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:42,425
Goodbye.

387
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:47,505
She's out empty-handed.

388
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:48,425
Oh my.

389
00:18:56,225 --> 00:18:57,265
Oh my.

390
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:58,025
Oh my.

391
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:00,906
They just fell apart.

392
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:15,425
(Taste)
I designed this box.

393
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:17,786
Two drawers here for perfume storage.

394
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:23,505
Quite distinctive.

395
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,705
Do you think this could sell?

396
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:30,025
A creative idea.

397
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:31,346
Selling ideas?

398
00:19:33,826 --> 00:19:36,346
You should've said so.
No problem. Ideas could sell.

399
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:38,386
However,

400
00:19:39,705 --> 00:19:41,945
I think your design is

401
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:43,465
overengineered.

402
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:44,386
Right?

403
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:46,705
Production costs would be too high.

404
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,705
And frankly,

405
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:51,225
it's not very practical.

406
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:55,665
Not practical?

407
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:56,965
By the way,

408
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:06,025
try this Belgian chocolate.

409
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,425
Melts on your tongue.

410
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:09,346
From Belgium?

411
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:10,245
Try one.

412
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:16,626
Is it good?

413
00:20:17,786 --> 00:20:18,425
Sweet.

414
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:19,005
Good, right?

415
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:20,106
Yes.

416
00:20:22,906 --> 00:20:23,505
Oh, Lili.

417
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:25,626
How about this?

418
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,965
I'll buy this design from you.

419
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:29,906
How about 200 yuan?

420
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:38,066
500 yuan is fine.

421
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:41,826
You really deserve a reward.
You did great on your first attempt.

422
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:43,705
If you come up with other designs,

423
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:45,025
just come to me anytime.

424
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:48,425
0.5 yuan.

425
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:50,546
0.5 yuan?

426
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,265
I want to be your creative partner.

427
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,705
You can turn this box into a product,

428
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:58,106
and give me 0.5 yuan from the profit

429
00:20:58,505 --> 00:21:00,306
of every product sold.

430
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:07,346
Want to be my creative partner?

431
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:08,225
Yes.

432
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,146
0.5 yuan from every one sold?

433
00:21:11,826 --> 00:21:13,786
0.45 yuan for the first deal is okay.

434
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:16,346
Seems you had no experience before.

435
00:21:16,906 --> 00:21:18,546
See how nice the box looks.

436
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:20,346
You can profit from it.

437
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:20,985
Take a look.

438
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:21,826
Okay.

439
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:23,626
Besides, Ms. Li told me

440
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,386
that a designer

441
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,745
is vital to a company.

442
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,106
They can become partners,

443
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:30,465
steering the company.

444
00:21:31,985 --> 00:21:34,786
That's why I thought of you.

445
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:38,146
I have many more designs.
This box is just one of them.

446
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,945
Ms. Li hasn't done business either.
How would she know?

447
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:43,786
She was trying to encourage you.

448
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:47,505
Do you know how hard it is
to run a business?

449
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:50,066
Creativity is important,

450
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,866
but the production process
is very complicated.

451
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:56,306
Designing one box makes you a partner?

452
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:59,106
There's no such amazing thing
in this world.

453
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:02,106
That's why I came to you.
You're amazing!

454
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:04,146
You can teach me. I'm a quick learner.

455
00:22:04,265 --> 00:22:06,185
Right.
With our long-standing friendship,

456
00:22:06,465 --> 00:22:08,465
I can let you join me.

457
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:12,146
Look,

458
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:14,945
give both of us some time

459
00:22:15,346 --> 00:22:17,086
to think it over, okay?

460
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,025
Alright then.

461
00:22:21,745 --> 00:22:22,906
I'll leave the box here.

462
00:22:23,546 --> 00:22:24,265
Okay.

463
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:25,826
Think it over carefully, okay?

464
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:26,806
Okay.

465
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:31,465
And I can do ten boxes like this

466
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:34,066
each week.

467
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:35,626
You're that talented?

468
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:37,626
I'll wait.

469
00:22:41,346 --> 00:22:42,066
Take it.

470
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:44,265
I'll wait for your reply.

471
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:44,846
Okay.

472
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,386
Go and arrange it.

473
00:22:59,386 --> 00:23:01,225
If there's any problem,
you go handle it.

474
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:01,866
You two,

475
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,066
any problem?

476
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:08,568
(Chunmei Printery Ltd.)

477
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:14,505
Hello.

478
00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:16,425
Qiuping? Is that you?

479
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:18,106
Monica?

480
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:20,425
I have good news for you.

481
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:23,586
There's progress on the thing
we discussed last time.

482
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:26,586
Really? Fantastic!

483
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:27,465
Of course.

484
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:31,665
Before making a decision,
I need to go over for inspection.

485
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:33,626
I'll fly over next week.

486
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:35,866
Okay. No problem.

487
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:37,945
Then let's meet next week.

488
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,985
Okay. See you next week.

489
00:23:45,185 --> 00:23:45,705
(Future beckons)
Okay.

490
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:47,386
Come again if you like it.

491
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:48,826
Okay.

492
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:51,786
- Okay.
- Come look.

493
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,146
(Every bite delivers ocean's sincerity)
It's really delicious.

494
00:23:57,826 --> 00:23:58,326
(Natural taste)
Really?

495
00:23:58,465 --> 00:23:59,146
(Fresh and nutritious)
Take it home.

496
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:00,225
Just buy one.

497
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,146
Why push down my stuff?

498
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:04,386
Who did this packaging?

499
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,465
No matter what, you can't...

500
00:24:06,786 --> 00:24:07,286
Stop!

501
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:08,205
Pay up!

502
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:11,906
How ridiculous!

503
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:14,146
Come pick them up.

504
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:21,705
Come on. Please have some tea.

505
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,225
Thank you.

506
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:26,306
Miss Monica, you've really changed.

507
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:27,225
Madam Gao.

508
00:24:27,826 --> 00:24:28,705
Monica is here

509
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:31,945
because her candy factory
needs to print a batch of candy boxes

510
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:33,465
for overseas Chinese.

511
00:24:33,866 --> 00:24:35,985
I immediately recommended
your Chunmei Printery.

512
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:37,465
Yes.

513
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:40,425
Qiuping has been strongly recommending
your printery to me.

514
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:42,025
That is truly an honor.

515
00:24:42,386 --> 00:24:44,626
Thank you, Ms. Li.
Thank you, Miss Monica.

516
00:24:45,346 --> 00:24:47,025
Let's take a look at these samples.

517
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:47,546
Okay.

518
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:48,046
Take a look.

519
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:49,826
Yes, we've done

520
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:51,866
a lot of overseas business.

521
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:54,225
We've even sold to
as far as Northern Europe.

522
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:57,265
Okay, I'll take a look first.

523
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:57,866
Right.

524
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:05,985
Gao Xuemei!

525
00:25:06,626 --> 00:25:07,906
This is the workshop. No entry.

526
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:09,745
No entry.

527
00:25:09,985 --> 00:25:10,626
Gao Xuemei?

528
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:11,626
Who are you?

529
00:25:12,146 --> 00:25:12,786
Workshop here.

530
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:13,745
- Don't run around!
- Gao Xuemei!

531
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:15,705
- Gao Xuemei!
- What's going on?

532
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:16,425
Get her out.

533
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:17,505
What's up? What's wrong?

534
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:18,126
Where's she?

535
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:18,906
Who let you in?

536
00:25:18,906 --> 00:25:19,406
Come out!

537
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:20,665
Gao Xuemei!

538
00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:22,386
Where's Gao Xuemei?

539
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:23,985
What are you doing?

540
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:24,906
Where's your mom?

541
00:25:24,906 --> 00:25:26,866
My mom is busy. What's up?

542
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:28,225
Gao Xuemei!

543
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:29,505
What's wrong?

544
00:25:29,546 --> 00:25:30,265
- Get out!
- Gao Xuemei!

545
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:30,945
Come out!

546
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:31,886
Wang Lili.

547
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:32,745
Get your mom here.

548
00:25:32,945 --> 00:25:33,705
- Are you crazy?
- Shut up!

549
00:25:34,086 --> 00:25:34,586
Where's she?

550
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:35,465
What's up? Get out!

551
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:36,066
Go find her.

552
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:36,786
Back to work.

553
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,225
Gao Xuemei!

554
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:42,098
(Sample Catalog)

555
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:55,425
Sorry, Madam Gao.

556
00:25:56,106 --> 00:25:59,386
None of these designs are what I want.

557
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:04,546
You wanted none of them.

558
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:09,745
Right. There's more.

559
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,985
Please wait, there's more.

560
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:17,626
How about this?

561
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:19,826
This is

562
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:23,505
missing a touch of Chinese elements.

563
00:26:24,786 --> 00:26:25,505
Here.

564
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:28,665
Miss Monica, this...

565
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:30,505
This is selling best.

566
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:31,505
That's it.

567
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,546
It's excellent.

568
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:35,586
This one has very high sales.

569
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:38,306
See? This is very good
for holding candy.

570
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:39,465
Look.

571
00:26:39,786 --> 00:26:40,465
Flower.

572
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:43,066
Very good.

573
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:47,866
Excuse me. You take a look.

574
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:52,346
Hello.

575
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:55,066
What?

576
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:01,386
Now?

577
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:04,346
Okay. I'll be right down.

578
00:27:04,826 --> 00:27:05,425
Okay.

579
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,025
Miss Monica, sorry.

580
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,265
A client wants to see me now.

581
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,606
I'm going downstairs.
I'll be right back, okay?

582
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:16,066
- Okay.
- Ms. Li, please stay

583
00:27:16,306 --> 00:27:16,906
with Monica.

584
00:27:17,025 --> 00:27:17,626
(Sample room)
Okay. You go ahead.

585
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:18,985
- Sorry.
- Okay.

586
00:27:31,346 --> 00:27:32,866
- Gao Xuemei!
- You hit me?

587
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:33,586
Come out!

588
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:34,745
- Are you crazy?
- Gao Xuemei!

589
00:27:34,745 --> 00:27:35,306
Get out.

590
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:36,465
- Why go out?
- Mom.

591
00:27:37,146 --> 00:27:37,646
Look.

592
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:38,425
Lili.

593
00:27:39,225 --> 00:27:39,985
What's wrong?

594
00:27:42,465 --> 00:27:43,225
Did you make this?

595
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:46,505
I thought it was a big deal.

596
00:27:46,786 --> 00:27:48,146
Hurry. Go back to work.

597
00:27:48,185 --> 00:27:48,866
- Don't...
- Back to work.

598
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:51,586
Nobody moves. You answer me.

599
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:53,066
(The Taste of the Sea)
Did you make this?

600
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:55,225
Can we talk later?

601
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:56,106
I have things to do.

602
00:27:56,346 --> 00:27:58,146
I'll go to your salon
to change my hairstyle.

603
00:27:58,546 --> 00:27:59,346
Did you make this?

604
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:00,945
Yes. So what?

605
00:28:01,705 --> 00:28:02,866
I designed this.

606
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:05,346
Why did you make it?

607
00:28:05,906 --> 00:28:08,546
Don't be agitated.
I can give you the money.

608
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:11,106
Is it about money?

609
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:12,225
Let me tell you.

610
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:14,546
This is plagiarism.

611
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,505
Gao Xuemei, you're a thief!

612
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:19,366
Gao Xuemei, plagiarism, a thief!

613
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:21,546
This is too much.
I won't show any mercy to you.

614
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:22,866
Did you show any mercy to me?

615
00:28:23,146 --> 00:28:23,906
Did you?

616
00:28:24,225 --> 00:28:24,745
You...

617
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:26,665
You show no mercy to me.

618
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,346
If you don't clear it up today,

619
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:29,546
you'll not get away with it.

620
00:28:30,465 --> 00:28:31,705
- What are you doing?
- Wang Lili.

621
00:28:32,465 --> 00:28:33,465
What are you doing?

622
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:35,005
Get down.

623
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:36,586
You want to go to the salon?

624
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:37,465
- Get down!
- Get down!

625
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,866
Want to change your hairstyle?

626
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:39,945
Cut the power.

627
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:41,386
- You!
- Get down!

628
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,265
You're a thief.

629
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:43,066
Turn it on.

630
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:43,985
Turn it on!

631
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:49,866
Tell me what exactly you want.

632
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:51,665
I'll see if they can make it.

633
00:28:52,265 --> 00:28:53,346
I can't really tell.

634
00:28:53,626 --> 00:28:54,906
But I just want

635
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:58,225
the packaging could incorporate
some Chinese elements,

636
00:28:58,586 --> 00:29:00,505
so it could catch

637
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:03,025
those overseas Chinese's eyes.

638
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:05,705
- Well...
- Ms. Li,

639
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:10,465
the client downstairs
also wants to see you.

640
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:13,465
Explain this.

641
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:14,425
Get down.

642
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:16,146
Tell me, why did you do this to me?

643
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:16,786
No!

644
00:29:17,025 --> 00:29:18,306
You owe me an explanation!

645
00:29:19,505 --> 00:29:21,185
Wang Lili, get down here!

646
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:25,425
Well,

647
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:27,906
a few days ago,
a seafood seller came to me.

648
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,106
(The Taste of the Sea)
I thought

649
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:32,306
this dolphin also belongs
to the seafood category.

650
00:29:32,425 --> 00:29:32,925
What?

651
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:34,185
Anyway, it was suitable,

652
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,025
so I printed it.

653
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:36,745
But I redesigned it.

654
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:37,786
There's a difference.

655
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:41,106
What difference?
It's completely identical.

656
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:44,386
Ms. Li, I designed it.
This is my drawing.

657
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:47,826
I designed this box for perfume storage.

658
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:50,185
And now she's using it
for fish and shrimp.

659
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:51,705
And look at the paper she used.

660
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:54,306
She used such terrible paper.
Do you have any taste?

661
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:56,265
- Wait.
- This is my design.

662
00:29:57,346 --> 00:29:58,945
Lili, don't make things up.

663
00:29:59,106 --> 00:29:59,665
Ms. Li.

664
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,786
I offered to pay her.

665
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:04,525
500 yuan. But she refused.

666
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:06,346
Ms. Li, I can't take money from a thief.

667
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:08,745
Call me a thief again if you dare.

668
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:09,826
You thief!

669
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:10,945
You thief!

670
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:12,826
Look, you're still young

671
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:14,745
and ignorant, so I kept holding back.

672
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:16,705
If you say it again,
I'll call the police.

673
00:30:16,745 --> 00:30:17,245
Go ahead.

674
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:18,826
You caused a scene in my printery,

675
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,586
delaying production. Can you afford it?

676
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:21,386
- Call the police.
- Stop it!

677
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:21,945
Let's see

678
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,185
if the police arrest you or me.

679
00:30:23,225 --> 00:30:25,106
You caused trouble,
yet think you're right?

680
00:30:25,106 --> 00:30:25,985
You thief!

681
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:27,225
Both of you, stop it!

682
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:32,985
(Business Flourishing)

683
00:30:32,985 --> 00:30:33,665
Madam Gao.

684
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,106
Look, your packaging

685
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:37,745
and her design

686
00:30:38,386 --> 00:30:40,146
are practically identical.

687
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:41,346
Identical!

688
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:43,505
Wait, so what if I made a familiar one?

689
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:46,146
Does the law forbid me from doing so?

690
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,346
It's just somewhat similar.
What's the big deal?

691
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:50,586
What?

692
00:30:51,025 --> 00:30:54,066
The problem is you don't
respect intellectual property rights

693
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:55,745
and creative ideas.

694
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:56,485
Right.

695
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:58,906
Intellectual property rights?

696
00:30:59,465 --> 00:31:01,505
Ms. Li, don't think I don't understand.

697
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:04,106
I know trademarks are legally protected.

698
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:06,586
But the style isn't a trademark.

699
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:09,965
Everyone's a copycat, right?

700
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,106
Good printing quality matters the most.

701
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:13,225
Our ancestors

702
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,945
invented the art of printing, right?

703
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,985
Then the other countries are copycats?

704
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:17,705
If you dare,

705
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:20,106
go talk to them
about intellectual property rights.

706
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:22,066
If you don't call the police now,
I will.

707
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:22,685
Shut up!

708
00:31:22,745 --> 00:31:23,626
I'll report you!

709
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,546
Now you're just twisting logic.

710
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:28,185
The usual practice
doesn't make it right.

711
00:31:28,866 --> 00:31:30,744
If you don't respect
the intellectual property,

712
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:33,465
the value of innovation is meaningless.

713
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,425
Our country's Patent Law

714
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:38,745
clearly defines and protects
appearance design.

715
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:40,425
Alright, you're right.

716
00:31:40,546 --> 00:31:41,386
You are right.

717
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:45,225
There's a VIP sitting next door.

718
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:46,866
Let's talk later, okay?

719
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:48,185
Talk later?

720
00:31:48,265 --> 00:31:48,826
Talk now.

721
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:50,586
No one leaves until we sort this out.

722
00:31:51,546 --> 00:31:53,546
Lili, don't be anxious.

723
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:54,665
Don't worry.

724
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:57,225
I'll give you
a proper explanation today.

725
00:32:01,225 --> 00:32:03,265
Monica, do you like this?

726
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:12,626
Fantastic!

727
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:14,906
Do you like it?

728
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:16,546
Even though it's made of paper,

729
00:32:17,106 --> 00:32:19,866
it breaks away
from conventional design concepts.

730
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:22,306
I really like it. It is so innovative.

731
00:32:22,665 --> 00:32:23,505
Now look at this.

732
00:32:31,786 --> 00:32:34,546
Were these all designed
by your designers?

733
00:32:35,505 --> 00:32:36,185
Yes.

734
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:38,066
My designers, of course.

735
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:39,505
Right, Ms. Li?

736
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:43,906
Monica, do you really like this design?

737
00:32:44,185 --> 00:32:45,066
Of course.

738
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:47,745
That is exactly what I'm looking for.

739
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:50,306
Beautiful.

740
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:52,306
(Today's quality)
Wonderful!

741
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,025
Then wait here.

742
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:55,106
Take a look at these.

743
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:55,846
Okay.

744
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:56,465
Wait a moment.

745
00:32:59,346 --> 00:32:59,985
In your dreams!

746
00:33:00,786 --> 00:33:02,505
How could I possibly be her designer?

747
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:04,505
Absurd!

748
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:06,705
Alright.

749
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:08,225
My Lili.

751

It's all my fault. I was wrong.

752
00:33:15,025 --> 00:33:16,505
This is such a great opportunity.

753
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,146
We can't just watch it slip away.

754

It's your opportunity slipping away,
not mine.

00:33:22,265 --> 00:33:22,826

756
00:33:23,945 --> 00:33:25,745
Well, right?

757
00:33:27,985 --> 00:33:29,146
- Lili.
- Lili.

758
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:30,945
I've told you,

759
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:33,705
your designs have real value.

760
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:36,665
Exactly. My designs have value,

761
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:39,546
so I can collaborate with
whoever I want.

762
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,106
Anyway, not her.

763
00:33:45,505 --> 00:33:47,665
Lili, my Lili.

764
00:33:48,346 --> 00:33:49,106
Tell me,

765
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:51,425
what do I do to soothe you

766
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:52,600
and make you forgive me?

767
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,346
Then kneel down.

00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,326

769
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:03,586
This is really going too far.

770
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:05,185
Too far.

771
00:34:05,705 --> 00:34:07,025
No, don't.

772
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:08,145
It is going too far.

773
00:34:08,786 --> 00:34:09,465
Stop it.

774
00:34:09,906 --> 00:34:10,666
Don't be mad.

775
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:12,786
Lili, come here.

776
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:14,425
A word with you.

777
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:18,286
Impressive.

778
00:34:19,585 --> 00:34:20,226

780
00:34:31,906 --> 00:34:33,266
Let me be honest with you.

781
00:34:33,866 --> 00:34:36,186
Monica is my longtime friend.

782
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:39,266
She's from the US
and visited Yuehai before.

783
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:42,025
But back then,
Yuehai was just starting to develop.

784
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,186
Due to something,

785
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:46,746
we sadly missed
that chance to collaborate.

786
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:49,145
It's been my regret ever since.

787
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:52,346
So this time, I have personal desires.

788
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:57,065
Xuemei's printery leads the industry.

789
00:34:57,585 --> 00:34:59,145
If this collaboration succeeds,

790
00:34:59,425 --> 00:35:00,545
Yuehai

791
00:35:00,906 --> 00:35:03,105
might get more overseas orders,

792
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:04,945
even step onto the global stage.

793
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:08,786
Lili, think about it calmly.

794
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:11,706
If this works out,

795
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:13,826

796
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,465
it's a rare opportunity too.

798

So nice to meet you.

799
00:35:33,025 --> 00:35:34,945
I love your designs.

800
00:35:35,105 --> 00:35:36,025
Me too.

801
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:39,945
She's our top designer here.

802
00:35:40,246 --> 00:35:41,985
Xuemei is my teacher at night school.

803
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:43,585
That's why

804
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:45,826
she's so great.

805
00:35:45,866 --> 00:35:46,826
She is really talented.

806

Hello.

807
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:49,706
By the way,

808
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:52,266
I really like your Chinese knot design.

809
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,945
Could you

810
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:56,826
incorporate that design
into my candy box?

811
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:58,065
No problem. It's simple.

812
00:35:58,346 --> 00:35:59,105

813
00:35:59,266 --> 00:36:01,666

831

I put it upside down.

939
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:10,906
Granny, hold on. Let me check this.

940
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:12,266
It's upside down.

941
00:41:16,105 --> 00:41:18,065
Granny, this tape is upside down too.

942
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:19,786
All upside down?

943
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:22,386
It's fine. Just watch this one for now.

944
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:23,465
I'll rewind this one.

945
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:25,866
How am I supposed to watch this?

946
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,585
Just tilt your head, okay?

947
00:41:32,066 --> 00:41:33,145
This is how it is watched.

948
00:41:33,145 --> 00:41:34,386
Watching a movie is this hard?

949
00:41:51,025 --> 00:41:52,866
Granny, that...

950
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,945
That isn't for you.

951
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:58,266
But it looks good on you.

952
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,145
You look just like that movie star.

953
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,186
Xiaohai, are you dating someone?

954
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:12,625
Good news.

956
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,232
(Welcome)

957
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:41,386
Yang.

958
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:45,985
Xiaohai, you're back.

959
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,306
What's going on here?
Why is everything cleared out?

960
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:51,625
We're not doing this.

961
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,545
Lili opened a gift studio.

962
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:55,545
Looking for her?

963
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:57,866
Yes. I want to say something to her.

964
00:42:58,306 --> 00:42:59,226
What exactly?

965
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:02,826
Nothing. I just came
to ask her to the movies.
