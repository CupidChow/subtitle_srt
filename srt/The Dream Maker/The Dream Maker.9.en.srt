Who did this?

- They.
- Who did this?

18
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:41,288
What happened?

19
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,467
M-Ms. Li, you're here.

20
00:01:47,668 --> 00:01:48,708
Why is it so messy here?

21
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:49,428
Mr. Xie,

22
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:52,508
Ms. Gao's factory has over 20 employees.

23
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:54,547
Severely overstaffed.

24
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,148
This situation carries risks.

25
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,107
I had no choice.

26
00:01:58,428 --> 00:01:59,827
Look. So many precedents.

27
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:02,347
Gao Xuemei, you're wrong.

28
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:03,387
How am I wrong?

29
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:04,467
You tell me what you did.

30
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:06,028
You are wrong. Accept it.

31
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:06,987
A huge mistake!

32
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,067
How is it a huge mistake?

33
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:10,028
Y-Your mistake's impact

34
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:11,000
- is significant.
- How is it significant?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,028
How is it significant?

36
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,108
Ms. Li shows you great care
and deep consideration.

37
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:15,947
What's Ms. Li saying?

38
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:17,428
Don't mind what she says,

39
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:18,148
right?

40
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:20,067
She does it for you. Deep consideration.

41
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:21,907
You're stubborn, acting like a show-off.

42
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:22,507
Zip it.

43
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:24,548
Just shut it down. Ms. Li said so.

44
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:25,588
Why should I?

45
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:27,507
We workers have strength!

46
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:28,440
Do you have strength?

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,028
I'm not forceful enough?

48
00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:31,328
You...

49
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:35,067
Don't you understand
why you're being told to stop?

50
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:35,888
You...

51
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,667
Do you understand what I'm saying?

52
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:45,187
You crow like a rooster now?

53
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:47,268
Ms. Li, let's talk.

54
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:51,512
Closing a factory doesn't require
this many people.

55
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:52,907
- Exactly.
- Has it exceeded or not?

56
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:53,880
- It exceeded.
- It's over the limit, right?

57
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,108
No, just to maintain order.

58
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:55,907
See? It exceeds.

59
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:56,728
You misunderstood.

60
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:57,868
They weren't brought by us.

61
00:02:57,947 --> 00:02:58,588
Right, not us.

62
00:02:58,627 --> 00:02:59,864
Then who brought them? Me?

63
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:00,667
Xie brought them?

64
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:02,608
Honestly!

65
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:03,548
All heartless, huh?

66
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,028
You're wearing clothes we made!

67
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:06,588
Right? Clothes we made.

68
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:07,947
About face! Forward march!

69
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:08,627
Come on. Move.

70
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:09,627
Move!

71
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:11,448
- Mr. Xie.
- Misunderstanding.

72
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:13,507
For now, this factory
must suspend operations.

73
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:14,268
Knock off work.

74
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:15,167
Knock off.

75
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:16,868
Set off firecrackers. Knock off.

76
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:19,347
Xie, are we really stopping?

77
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:20,388
You...

78
00:03:20,507 --> 00:03:22,428
D-Don't discuss this with me.

79
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,747
The Town Mayor asked us to stop.

80
00:03:25,308 --> 00:03:26,187
So we stop.

81
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,388
Seven people. Knock off.

82
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:29,428
Okay.

83
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,227
Seven people.

84
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:37,627
Hear that?
The Town Mayor said seven people.

85
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:38,227
Seven people.

86
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:40,467
Ms. Li says seven people,
so let it be seven people.

87
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:42,467
The original six, plus me, seven people.

88
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:43,667
The rest can just leave.

89
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:44,287
I...

90
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:46,507
Ms. Gao, you can't be serious, right?

91
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:48,507
My whole family depends on my wages.

92
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,067
Yeah! How are we supposed to live?

93
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:50,787
Ms. Gao.

94
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:52,227
We have a family to support!

95
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:54,988
Stop talking. Enough.

96
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:57,988
I understand, all of it.
But it's no use.

97
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,787
We have to do what Ms. Li said.

98
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:02,268
Listen to the Town Mayor.

99
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,347
Explain it clearly. Stop crying.

100
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:05,347
- Ms. Li!
- Ms. Li!

101
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:08,108
Calm down!

102
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,787
Calm down!

103
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:13,347
Go back!

104
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,828
(Let's All Look After Public Property)

105
00:04:14,828 --> 00:04:15,787
We'll see how it goes.

106
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:17,907
They are going too far.

107
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:19,188
How can they do this?

108
00:04:19,347 --> 00:04:20,068
Let's go.

109
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,464
Turn right. It's right there.

110
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:23,427
Fatty.

111
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:24,748
Fatty, come.

112
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:25,467
Perfect timing.

113
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:26,360
- Fatty.
- Come here.

114
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,736
- Let me introduce you.
- Stay calm.

115
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,867
Some top businessmen from the Northeast.

116
00:04:30,508 --> 00:04:31,388
Five Hus.

117
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:33,388
Hello, sir.

118
00:04:33,628 --> 00:04:34,128
Come on.

119
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,008
Come on.

120
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,107
Come over here.

121
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:51,307
Keep them company for a bit.

122
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:52,748
- Got it.
- I need to step out.

123
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,588
It's about what we're
treating you to for lunch.

124
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:57,907
What happened?

125
00:04:58,188 --> 00:05:00,148
Ms. Li is trying
to shut down Xuemei's factory.

126
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,467
We're going to help.

127
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:04,408
Shut down the factory?

128
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,828
Li Qiuping?

129
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:08,547
Mr. Zheng, you must
know about this, right?

130
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:10,828
I'll show clients around the factory.

131
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:11,547
How would I know?

132
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,508
No, you absolutely can't go there!

133
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:15,948
Listen. They're almost coming
to blows over there.

134
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:21,028
If they see that mess,

135
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:22,667
who'd dare do business with us?

136
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:24,427
What's going on?

137
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,547
I heard they exceeded hiring limits.

138
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,188
Got a job for you.

139
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:37,967
Go ahead.

140
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,867
Do whatever you can

141
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:41,787
to keep these clients here.

142
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:42,667
Got it.

143
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:43,588
Mission accomplished.

144
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:44,467
Yes.

145
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:45,888
Gentlemen,

146
00:05:45,907 --> 00:05:47,068
anything you want to eat?

147
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:49,107
W-What's going on?

148
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,828
Let me introduce you.

149
00:05:51,307 --> 00:05:53,388
These are Yuehai's finest entrepreneurs.

150
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:54,028
Yes.

151
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:54,588
I'm flattered.

152
00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:56,188
Hearing you came all this way,

153
00:05:56,427 --> 00:05:57,787
they insisted on treating you

154
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:59,628
to Yuehai's most authentic cuisine.

155
00:05:59,787 --> 00:06:00,307
Yes.

156
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:01,588
And our finest Yuehai liquor.

157
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:04,787
Something urgent just came up.

158
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,268
I need to handle it now.

159
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,227
So, I'll pick you up later.

160
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:09,148
Enjoy the meal!

161
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:10,188
Mr. Zheng.

162
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:11,508
Look after them.

163
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,107
My apologies. Sorry.

164
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:14,028
Hu.

165
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,028
All Hu here, right?

166
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,467
Stay calm.

167
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,388
Don't get worked up.

168
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:20,948
Calm down first, okay?

169
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:21,987
Mr. Zheng.

170
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:22,787
What are you doing?

171
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:23,307
You're here!

172
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:24,148
I know. Talk later.

173
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:24,907
Give us justice.

174
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:25,547
Just go.

175
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:26,227
Mr. Zheng.

176
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,948
- Give us justice!
- Come on. Disperse.

177
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,208
Standing right here.

178
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,828
What will people think if they see this?

179
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:32,547
Mr. Zheng, glad you're back.

180
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,347
Let me brief you on the situation.

181
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:36,427
Their factory can't operate any longer.

182
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:37,588
Alright, Ms. Li.

183
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:38,904
We'll talk in a moment.

184
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:39,500
- Okay.
- Okay?

185
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:40,028
Listen.

186
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:41,268
No, what are you saying?

187
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:42,392
Are you dense or what?

188
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:43,768
Get everyone to disperse now!

189
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,580
W-Wouldn't that be a joke?

190
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,347
What are you doing?

191
00:06:46,347 --> 00:06:47,268
Disperse first!

192
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:48,427
Go! What are you doing?

193
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:52,068
Disperse? No... I'm not...

194
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,547
Ms. Gao, tell your workers to go home.

195
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,708
- What a disgrace!
- Disperse!

196
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:56,748
Go! Move along!

197
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:57,427
Let's go.

198
00:06:59,148 --> 00:06:59,748
M-Mr. Zheng.

199
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:00,987
Go home.

200
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:01,656
- Mr. Zheng.
- Ms. Li.

201
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:02,808
- Just go.
- Let's talk over there.

202
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:03,628
Mr. Zheng.

203
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,388
Alright. Let's talk later.

204
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:05,948
What's wrong?

205
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:06,588
Go home!

206
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:07,948
Just go.

207
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:10,787
Did I see it right?

208
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:20,028
Ms. Li, how did you
let things get this bad?

209
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,427
What was the rush?

210
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:24,388
I was just securing a client.

211
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:26,547
I wasn't flying to Mars, was I?

212
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:27,828
Just wait for me.

213
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:28,952
Can you wait

214
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:30,200
- until I'm back before handling this?
- Mr. Zheng,

215
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,748
I did intend to wait for you.

216
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:33,948
But you never told us specifically
where you went.

217
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:35,547
So I had to make the decision first.

218
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,787
It concerns seven-up, eight-down.
I can't wait.

219
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:39,148
Seven-up, eight-down?

220
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:41,588
The people of Yuehai

221
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:43,307
are up and down now, all because of you.

222
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,307
I just brought over a major client.

223
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:46,987
They are already here.

224
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:48,667
Luckily, I ran into Fatty.

225
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,227
Otherwise, if they see this,

226
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:52,227
where could I put my face?

227
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,828
- What about Yuehai people's dignity?
- You brought these clients here,

228
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:57,188
and you're not worried
they'll see the labor violation?

229
00:07:57,307 --> 00:07:58,667
They came here to do business.

230
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,467
Who has the time to scrutinize that?

231
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,188
And how does the factory make money?

232
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:03,907
Isn't it the people?

233
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:05,588
This is far from trivial.

234
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:07,948
With numerous cases nationwide,

235
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:09,880
(Dongjiang Province Government Document)
I can't turn a blind eye to this.

236
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,427
This is like a ticking time bomb.

237
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:14,107
If not defused promptly,
it could blow up Yuehai anytime.

238
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,680
(State Council's
Several Policy Stipulations)

239
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,867
(Concerning Non-Agricultural
Self-Employed Individuals in Urban Areas)

240
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,828
Even if you don't care
about personal gains,

241
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:24,028
what about Yuehai's development?

242
00:08:24,987 --> 00:08:25,667
Regardless,

243
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,787
we must temporarily
shut down the factories

244
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,028
exceeding the hiring limit.

245
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:30,787
We'll report to the county committee,

246
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,228
and proceed based on their instructions.

247
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:36,468
You said shut down the factories?

248
00:08:37,427 --> 00:08:39,348
Why not shut down
the Yuehai city construction?

249
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:40,367
Li Qiuping,

250
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,508
do you think you're the only smart one?

251
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:43,388
Let me tell you.

252
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:46,348
I already knew these documents.

253
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:51,547
You knew all along?

254
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:55,067
So did Mr. Tan and Mr. Xie

255
00:08:55,388 --> 00:08:56,748
also know beforehand?

256
00:08:59,128 --> 00:08:59,827
(Conference Room)

257
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:00,667
Today,

258
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,348
Li Qiuping

259
00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:05,468
proposed convening a meeting

260
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:08,907
specifically to address

261
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:12,547
the issue of self-employed individuals
exceeding hiring limits.

262
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,348
Please speak freely.

263
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:16,528
Okay?

264
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,868
You all know the details already.

265
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,748
My stance is straightforward.

266
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,667
For Yuehai's security,

267
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,107
I propose

268
00:09:30,107 --> 00:09:32,787
shut down
the non-compliant factories for now,

269
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:35,148
report this to the county committee,

270
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:37,468
and await their instructions.

271
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:45,468
You've all heard it.

272
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,427
It's Li Qiuping's opinion.

273
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:50,547
Does anyone else have thoughts?

274
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,628
Speak up. Okay?

275
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:53,868
Who goes first?

276
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,268
Xie Chunlai, you first.

277
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,307
Mr. Zheng,

278
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,587
my wife is the director
of Chunmei Printery.

279
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:17,784
Discussing matters

280
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,907
related to Chunmei Printery,

281
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,108
I should recuse myself.

282
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:22,427
You're recused from voting,

283
00:10:22,587 --> 00:10:24,067
but you can still share your views.

284
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:26,427
Then, per Mr. Zheng's request,
I'll be brief.

285
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,228
Chunmei Printery

286
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:31,787
is Yuehai's flagship enterprise,

287
00:10:32,187 --> 00:10:32,787
right?

288
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:34,028
However,

289
00:10:34,628 --> 00:10:36,587
it also struggles
with inconsistent orders.

290
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,268
The next order is uncertain.

291
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:39,707
Professionally,

292
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,348
as Town Mayor...

293
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
I mean, Deputy Mayor,

294
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:47,787
I worry about Yuehai's development.

295
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:49,587
If a flagship can't lead,

296
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,427
smaller businesses have no chance.

297
00:10:51,748 --> 00:10:53,787
Personally, as head of my household,

298
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,187
I deeply sympathize with my wife,

299
00:10:58,547 --> 00:10:59,468
Xuemei.

300
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,567
But

301
00:11:03,064 --> 00:11:04,827
today, Ms. Li and I

302
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:06,787
had a thorough discussion.

303
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:09,427
I've learned

304
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:12,307
that we must follow the correct path.

305
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:14,307
On Yuehai's development journey,

306
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:15,988
however severe the pains,

307
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,228
they must be endured.

308
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:26,348
Yes, exactly.

309
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:27,468
That's all?

310
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:28,547
I'm done.

311
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,508
Tan, what about you?

312
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:33,667
And you?

313
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:36,187
Let me add a few words.

314
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:39,108
I-I've also been thinking

315
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:41,148
that for a factory

316
00:11:42,707 --> 00:11:44,508
with only seven or eight workers,

317
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:46,748
it's practically impossible to expand

318
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:48,468
or compete beyond.

319
00:11:50,028 --> 00:11:52,348
Slightly more orders,
and staff shortages become obvious.

320
00:11:52,348 --> 00:11:54,268
Here, I must highlight
something important.

321
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:57,348
The Party Central Committee said
in the Third Plenary Session

322
00:11:57,707 --> 00:12:00,307
that we need Reform and Opening-up
and economic revitalization.

323
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,307
What year was this document from?

324
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,988
If we're still following it today,

325
00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:07,067
how can Yuehai develop and progress?

326
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:11,028
Ms. Li, let me finish. Don't rush.

327
00:12:12,307 --> 00:12:14,187
But today, Yuehai Town

328
00:12:14,427 --> 00:12:17,388
has reached this critical point.

329
00:12:18,148 --> 00:12:20,468
So I believe

330
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:21,907
we should not

331
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:23,707
hide problems.

332
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,148
We should report to higher authorities.

333
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,508
But I urge everyone
to consider carefully.

334
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,787
If we shut down

335
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:34,427
all these factories,

336
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:36,628
what would happen to the workers?

337
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,187
How do we address the losses

338
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:40,187
of these private enterprises?

339
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,628
Mr. Xie, Mr. Tan,

340
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,868
your remarks deeply moved me.

341
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:48,148
I never expected

342
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:51,148
you'd discuss this issue
with such depth.

343
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:53,707
You prioritize the greater good

344
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:55,988
- and dare to take...
- Ms. Li,

345
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:57,468
my apologies.

346
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:58,268
Our

347
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,307
Mr. Lin hasn't spoken yet.

348
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,816
R-Right. Lin.

349
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:02,907
Say something.

350
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:06,907
I think you all made
some really good points.

351
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:12,947
That's all?

352
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:15,587
I'm just Yuehai's deputy mayor,

353
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:17,988
overseeing urban construction in Yuehai.

354
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,108
I'll fulfill my duties properly.

355
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,508
You said it best.

356
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:22,868
Alright.

357
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:25,748
Since everyone's opinions are expressed,

358
00:13:26,748 --> 00:13:27,480
Li Qiuping,

359
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,628
do you have any other opinions?

360
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:30,868
Please say it.

361
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:34,187
I believe our priority
is solving problems.

362
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:35,508
Rather than hiding,

363
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:38,228
we should promptly report to leadership.

364
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,827
Let them evaluate and decide.

365
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:43,348
Otherwise, if complications arise,

366
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:44,868
the consequences

367
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,907
could be far worse
than halting production.

368
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:50,468
Alright then.

369
00:13:51,187 --> 00:13:52,787
Let's vote, shall we?

370
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:55,348
Mr. Zheng, anything to add?

371
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,148
I've said everything needed earlier.

372
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:01,307
Let's vote. I respect everyone's views.

373
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:02,947
Come on. Let's vote.

374
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:05,427
Okay.

375
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:07,988
Li Qiuping suggested

376
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,228
notifying

377
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,587
all Yuehai factories
with more than seven employees

378
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,587
to temporarily shut down.

379
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:16,827
Those in favor, hands up.

380
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,307
Li Qiuping, you may lower your hand.

381
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,368
Zheng Decheng suggested

382
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:35,187
disapproving the proposal

383
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:36,984
of notifying all Yuehai factories

384
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:38,827
with more than seven employees

385
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:40,468
to temporarily shut down.

386
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:41,827
Those in favor, hands up.

387
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:44,667
- I'm...
- Put your hand down.

388
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:45,348
I'm ineligible.

389
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:48,028
Okay.

390
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:51,067
Now announcing voting results.

391
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:55,067
Results of Yuehai Town
Part committee vote.

392
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:57,547
Five expected, five present.

393
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:00,707
But Xie Chunlai abstained.

394
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:02,827
So four votes counted.

395
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:04,667
What?

396
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:07,468
Don't you see?

397
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:08,427
Ms. Li.

398
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:09,587
What does this mean?

399
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:11,907
Meng, guard Chunmei Printery.

400
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:12,888
Don't let it operate.

401
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:13,567
Okay.

402
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:21,592
What are you doing?

403
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:22,488
What are you doing?

404
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:24,868
I'm reporting to the county committee.

405
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:25,827
I'm reporting too.

406
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,307
Leaders shouldn't hear only your side.

407
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,307
Mr. Zheng, proper distance
between genders.

408
00:15:30,628 --> 00:15:31,947
It's inappropriate! Get off.

409
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,587
If you think it's appropriate, I do.

410
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:37,547
Can you ride?

411
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:39,307
Slow down.

412
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,587
If you can't, I can.

413
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:43,388
She rides motorcycles?

414
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:45,108
Impressive.

415
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:48,028
X-Xie,

416
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,468
what did Mr. Zheng mean?

417
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:51,707
Secure the client.

418
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:55,512
I'll call Xuemei now
and ask her to give them a tour.

419
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,868
Tan, you acted well earlier.

420
00:15:57,907 --> 00:15:58,707
Almost fooled me.

421
00:15:58,728 --> 00:15:59,228
No.

422
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:00,508
I thought you supported closure.

423
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:02,468
I wasn't acting. Why would I act?

424
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:03,827
Listen. I was not acting.

425
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:05,667
Listen. At first, I was very hesitant.

426
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,187
But the moment I voted, it was clear.

427
00:16:07,307 --> 00:16:08,667
My analysis was correct, right?

428
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:10,547
These outdated regulations

429
00:16:10,587 --> 00:16:12,108
must be discarded, absolutely,

430
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:12,907
right?

431
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,108
Meng, don't cause trouble.
I'm warning you.

432
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:16,087
Meng!

433
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:55,148
Get off!

434
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:58,907
Get off!

435
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,108
I'm talking to you. Get off.

436
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:10,207
Li Qiuping,

437
00:17:10,648 --> 00:17:12,708
today I'll settle accounts
with you properly.

438
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,268
Look at you, a young woman,

439
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,508
delicate and refined.

440
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:20,827
People would think you're
reasonable and kind-hearted.

441
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,268
Who knew you're such a troublemaker?

442
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,668
I have no grudge against you.

443
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:27,587
Why do you insist on opposing me?

444
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,228
Mr. Zheng,

445
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,028
you still don't get it?

446
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,668
I'm not opposing you.

447
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:33,988
I'm helping you.

448
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:36,827
Other cities have precedents for this.

449
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:39,188
Fines were levied. People were arrested.

450
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:41,908
Haven't you realized
the seriousness of this?

451
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:45,748
Li Qiuping, before you came,

452
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:48,268
this issue didn't even exist
on the surface.

453
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,067
Perhaps with time,

454
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:52,028
a solution would have emerged naturally.

455
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:53,228
But now?

456
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:55,827
You've turned all of Yuehai upside down.

457
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:58,508
A minor issue has become
a colossal problem.

458
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:01,448
Fine.

459
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,448
I can't convince you.

460
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:05,147
You have your reasons

461
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:06,307
and your principles.

462
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:09,188
Even if I face
some punishment over this,

463
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:10,028
I'll accept it.

464
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,948
But I only ask one thing of you.

465
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,147
What?

466
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:14,908
Request a transfer yourself.

467
00:18:15,384 --> 00:18:16,248
You're not welcome.

468
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,268
Please, never stay in Yuehai anymore.

469
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:35,748
Why didn't you get on?

470
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:00,787
Li Qiuping's considerations and concerns

471
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,307
aren't unfounded.

472
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:05,748
This matter is indeed quite tricky.

473
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:07,428
Mr. Zhao,

474
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:10,827
we can't ignore national regulations.

475
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:12,428
But...

476
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:16,468
Xia, you just

477
00:19:16,627 --> 00:19:18,748
express your most honest opinion.

478
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:19,827
Alright.

479
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:21,347
Let me state first.

480
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,347
I'm not speaking for Zheng Decheng.

481
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,347
I'm speaking for the golden goose.

482
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,627
Since Yuehai was built,

483
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:31,668
its tax contributions have kept growing.

484
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:33,107
At this rate,

485
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:34,827
if things run smoothly,

486
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:37,428
Yuehai's annual tax revenue

487
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:41,067
could exceed half
of our entire county's.

488
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:43,468
In the future, Yuehai could very well

489
00:19:43,787 --> 00:19:46,028
be Pingchuan County's golden goose.

490
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,908
If production really halts

491
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:58,028
and production lines stop,

492
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:00,696
who will be responsible

493
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:01,508
for Pingchuan's

494
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:03,188
future economy?

495
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:06,347
That is a question.

496
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,307
Indeed, it will cause some impact.

497
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:17,787
Zheng Decheng's got some nerve.

498
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,268
He actually played dumb for so long.

499
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:23,948
Now Zheng Decheng and Li Qiuping

500
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:25,827
are deadlocked over this.

501
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:27,736
Shouldn't we

502
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:29,228
show them our stance now?

503
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,387
The labor issue

504
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,867
is explicitly regulated by the state.

505
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,867
As cadres,

506
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,787
we should follow the rules.

507
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:40,312
However,

508
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,827
regulations are rigid,

509
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,190
yet people are adaptable.

510
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:46,587
We still need to make

511
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,468
flexible adjustments based on reality.

512
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,672
Xia, I think we need

513
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:52,908
to go to the provincial office

514
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:54,168
and report this

515
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:56,188
to the responsible leaders,

516
00:20:56,428 --> 00:20:57,708
seeking their instructions.

517
00:20:57,748 --> 00:20:58,248
Okay.

518
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:00,428
Mr. Zhao, it's late now.

519
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:01,268
It's fine.

520
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:03,347
Leave it to me.

521
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,748
Yuehai's factories can't wait.

522
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:08,587
Before the Provincial Committee
made the decision,

523
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:10,147
halt all operations in Yuehai.

524
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:32,547
Mr. Zheng, what's going on?

525
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,787
The county committee
has decided on a shutdown.

526
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:37,988
As a Party member cadre,
your family must set an example first.

527
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:39,867
But, Mr. Zheng...

528
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:40,627
But what?

529
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,232
The Secretary has agreed

530
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:44,228
to solve this problem soon.

531
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:49,347
Listen, you need to stay sharp.

532
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,387
Don't let
the Northeast Five Hus slip away.

533
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:54,107
I risked my life drinking
to get them here, got it?

534
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:55,147
They won't.

535
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:01,948
Then, wishing our collaboration
smooth sailing.

536
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:04,147
Okay.

537
00:22:04,468 --> 00:22:05,347
May it go smoothly.

538
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:09,547
Attention, all private enterprises
in Yuehai Town.

539
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:11,988
Now, considering

540
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:14,387
the widespread issue
of factory overstaffing,

541
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:17,428
and in accordance
with the State Council's

542
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:19,988
several policy stipulations
concerning non-agricultural

543
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:21,988
self-employed individuals
in urban areas,

544
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,787
the county committee has decided

545
00:22:23,827 --> 00:22:24,908
that all enterprises

546
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:27,468
found to employ workers
beyond the set limit

547
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:29,147
must suspend operations for now,

548
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:32,760
awaiting authorities'

549
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,627
next instructions.

550
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,268
We assure everyone

551
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:38,264
that this situation

552
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:41,028
won't last long.

553
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:42,787
- Right.
- Yes.

554
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:44,188
It will not last long.

555
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:45,787
Production will resume very soon.

556
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:48,547
You see, the leadership
has their reasons, right?

557
00:22:48,787 --> 00:22:49,587
Come. Take a seat.

558
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:50,387
It's okay.

559
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:51,387
Wait a second. Hold on.

560
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,827
Ms. Gao, what's happening?

561
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,468
Please cooperate, everyone.

562
00:22:57,468 --> 00:22:59,587
Mr. Tan is now

563
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:02,587
going to all factories to cut the power.

564
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:05,787
Please cooperate.

565
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:07,347
Mr. Tan

566
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,627
is now going to all factories
to cut the power.

567
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:13,748
Wait, Ms. Gao.

568
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:16,147
Shanghai is waiting for our update.

569
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,988
Next week, we have to hold
the product launch.

570
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:20,867
Yes.

571
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:21,668
Well...

572
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:24,428
Please don't worry,
clients from the Northeast.

573
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:27,948
We will resume production
as soon as possible.

574
00:23:28,188 --> 00:23:29,708
Yeah.

575
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:31,028
No matter what,

576
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:35,147
we won't delay clients' orders.

577
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:36,067
Yes.

578
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:38,547
- It won't affect it.
- Yes.

579
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:39,827
The government has said so,

580
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:41,627
so it's definitely fine, right?

581
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:42,428
Come on.

582
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:44,107
You say it won't affect production,

583
00:23:44,468 --> 00:23:47,067
but how long are we supposed to wait?

584
00:23:47,387 --> 00:23:49,988
Maybe we should just
cooperate next time.

585
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:51,908
No!

586
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:53,988
Why should we even consider

587
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:55,748
next time?

588
00:23:56,508 --> 00:23:58,067
We must guarantee

589
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:00,748
this current project goes smoothly.

590
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:02,428
It'll go smoothly.

591
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:03,188
This time.

592
00:24:03,188 --> 00:24:04,347
Ms. Gao, wait.

593
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:05,748
Tell your leaders.

594
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:07,347
Don't mess around with me.

595
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:08,748
The town government

596
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:11,708
always means what it says.

597
00:24:12,228 --> 00:24:14,228
We don't joke. Take it or leave it.

598
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:17,668
S-Such wise leadership.

599
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:21,188
Yes. Maybe we should wait a bit longer.
See how things go.

600
00:24:21,387 --> 00:24:22,680
- Wait a bit.
- See how things go.

601
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,672
A bit longer, okay?

602
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:24,347
A favor to you.

603
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:26,627
We can stay tonight.

604
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:29,827
But tomorrow, we'll wait
no later than 9 AM.

605
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:30,408
Yes.

606
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:32,028
We hope to hear good news.

607
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:33,188
Thank you.

608
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:34,028
Okay.

609
00:24:34,028 --> 00:24:35,307
- Let's have another drink.
- Let's... Yes.

610
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,028
No. Let's go.

611
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:37,560
- Just a little more...
- Hu, just one more drink.

612
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,028
Hu, another drink.

613
00:24:39,508 --> 00:24:40,347
Hu, another drink.

614
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:42,668
What...

615
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,587
What's going on?

616
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,632
(Gao Xuemei)

617
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:08,908
Mr. Zhao.

618
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:09,627
Mr. Li.

619
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:10,508
Mr. Xia.

620
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,280
Mr. Zhang has finished the meeting.

621
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:13,468
Please go in now.

622
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:14,428
Okay.

623
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:15,367
This way.

624
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:15,968
Okay.

625
00:25:18,547 --> 00:25:20,268
Dongsheng, Changyou.

626
00:25:20,948 --> 00:25:23,228
The investigative report
submitted by Pingchuan

627
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:24,587
has been reviewed.

628
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:26,808
On behalf of the Provincial Committee,

629
00:25:27,468 --> 00:25:28,627
I am here to discuss its view

630
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:31,428
on excessive hiring
by self-employed individuals.

631
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:38,867
(Chunmei Printery)
A decent factory.

632
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:40,387
Good price and quality.

633
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:50,908
They are leaving.

634
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:52,827
- Hu!
- Hurry!

635
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:53,908
- Hu!
- Stop them!

636
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:57,028
Hu!

637
00:25:57,948 --> 00:25:59,787
You can't leave! Absolutely not!

638
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:00,787
Where are you headed?

639
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:02,908
What's going on here?

640
00:26:03,367 --> 00:26:03,867
Yes.

641
00:26:03,867 --> 00:26:04,787
I gave you face, right?

642
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:05,508
Yes.

643
00:26:05,587 --> 00:26:07,307
I waited till 9 AM, didn't I?

644
00:26:07,387 --> 00:26:08,067
Yes.

645
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:10,948
I guarantee this situation
won't last much longer.

646
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:11,928
Yes.

647
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:13,496
- I'm the Town Mayor.
- Yes, our leader.

648
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,920
The leader from yesterday's radio?

649
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:18,188
Yeah, right?

650
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:20,028
The leader promised.
Just wait a bit longer.

651
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:21,468
- What's the word?
- What's the situation?

652
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:23,908
- Let's have another drink.
- It's no big deal, right?

653
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:24,508
Another drink.

654
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:25,188
Another drink.

655
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:27,188
No more drinks.
We've done this four times.

656
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:28,984
- Just another drink.
- Mr. Xie.

657
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,268
Secretary... The Secretary's coming.

658
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:35,096
Everything will be okay.

659
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:36,807
No.

660
00:26:36,988 --> 00:26:38,268
I'll take you for a good meal.

661
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:39,188
How about it?

662
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:39,928
Yes.

663
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:40,627
Another drink.

664
00:26:40,627 --> 00:26:41,127
I'll go.

665
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:42,067
No.

666
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:42,708
- No.
- Solve.

667
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:43,928
- Solve the problem.
- Another drink.

668
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:46,547
(Conference Room)
After discussion, the leadership thinks

669
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:48,867
the seven-up, eight-down issue

670
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:50,627
is a challenge we must confront

671
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:52,188
in Reform and Opening-up.

672
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:54,268
We can't avoid it
or shirk responsibility.

673
00:26:54,908 --> 00:26:55,867
We must respond to it.

674
00:26:56,827 --> 00:26:57,867
Wait. Respond, Mr. Zhao...

675
00:26:58,028 --> 00:26:58,528
What then?

676
00:26:58,748 --> 00:26:59,428
What, Mr. Xie?

677
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:00,387
That urgent?

678
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:01,107
No.

679
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,627
Our clients are about to leave.

680
00:27:04,347 --> 00:27:04,867
Yes.

681
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:05,708
Resume work.

682
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:07,367
Resume work.

683
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,268
H-He's excited.

684
00:27:10,668 --> 00:27:12,268
X-Xie, be careful.

685
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:13,228
Slow down!

686
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:15,708
Have another drink.

687
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:16,908
What are you doing?

688
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:18,188
Do me this favor.

689
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,067
- We're resuming work any minute.
- Aren't you tired all this way?

690
00:27:20,107 --> 00:27:20,908
We'll resume work.

691
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,547
What should we stay
if work won't resume?

692
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,208
Move aside!

693
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,067
Wait a bit longer.

694
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:24,567
Let's go.

695
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:25,908
Alright.

696
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:28,748
Wait a bit longer.
We're resuming work now.

697
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,908
Work has resumed!

698
00:27:31,428 --> 00:27:32,387
Work has resumed!

699
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,107
Work has resumed!

700
00:27:36,428 --> 00:27:37,627
Work has resumed!

701
00:27:39,228 --> 00:27:40,107
Work has resumed!

702
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:44,188
Work has resumed!

703
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:52,748
Work has resumed!

704
00:27:56,147 --> 00:27:57,787
The committee has reached a consensus.

705
00:27:58,867 --> 00:27:59,908
They believe...

706
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:02,428
If it benefits the people,

707
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,208
we will uphold it.

708
00:28:06,104 --> 00:28:06,748
Recognize it.

709
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,028
If the people dislike it,

710
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:11,508
we will modify it.

711
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:14,228
Cease it.

712
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:24,748
It doesn't matter
if we don't fully understand.

713
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:26,428
We can let it develop first.

714
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:29,188
And let time render judgment.

715
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:31,428
After some time has passed,

716
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:33,347
we'll reevaluate the situation.

717
00:28:35,067 --> 00:28:37,268
Thus, the provincial leaders
repeatedly emphasize

718
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:38,457
that practice

719
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,748
is the sole criterion for testing truth.

720
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:43,908
So regarding
the seven-up, eight-down issue,

721
00:28:44,228 --> 00:28:45,627
we make no decisions.

722
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:47,587
No debates.

723
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:49,787
No interventions.

724
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:51,547
Let it evolve.

725
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:53,587
Then

726
00:28:54,147 --> 00:28:56,757
we'll review it later

727
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:57,627
and decide.

728
00:29:01,468 --> 00:29:02,468
In short,

729
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:04,067
seek truth from facts.

730
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,228
That is the answer from the committee.

731
00:29:07,347 --> 00:29:07,948
Good.

732
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,188
Everyone, applaud.

733
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:18,107
Alright.

734
00:29:19,147 --> 00:29:19,647
Enough.

735
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:20,547
Too theatrical.

736
00:29:22,268 --> 00:29:22,867
Everyone,

737
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,307
Yuehai Town

738
00:29:24,668 --> 00:29:25,948
proactively reported

739
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:27,867
the investigation on the labor issue.

740
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:31,307
This received affirmation and praise
from provincial leadership.

741
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:32,428
They noted

742
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:34,748
that when confronting issues,
Yuehai Town's cadres

743
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:37,468
remained composed
and avoided impulsiveness.

744
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:39,508
They acted with measured calm.

745
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:42,228
Here, I must particularly

746
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,347
commend Li Qiuping.

747
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:46,347
I can tell you.

748
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:49,188
You owe gratitude to Qiuping

749
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,228
for defusing this ticking bomb.

750
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:55,188
When this matter surfaced,
she stood her ground,

751
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:57,304
and knew what mattered.

752
00:29:58,228 --> 00:29:58,904
Qiuping,

753
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:01,067
because you insisted
on reporting this time,

754
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:02,497
what was done

755
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:04,307
in secret were brought

756
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,147
into the open,

757
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:07,668
even securing directives
from higher authorities.

758
00:30:08,107 --> 00:30:08,908
It's good.

759
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:12,867
When problems arise,

760
00:30:12,948 --> 00:30:13,988
you must address them

761
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,067
openly for resolution.

762
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:17,428
So production could proceed.

763
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:21,468
So let's give Qiuping some applause.

764
00:30:30,468 --> 00:30:32,268
Mr. Zhao, please reassign her.

765
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,988
I know you deployed her to monitor me.

766
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:37,147
I recognize my shortcomings now.

767
00:30:37,428 --> 00:30:38,587
I'll improve later, okay?

768
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:39,347
I'll be careful.

769
00:30:39,468 --> 00:30:41,708
No, you're acting coy after benefiting.

770
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:43,468
Be grateful.

771
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:45,347
Without her, you'd have faced disaster.

772
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:47,107
I know.

773
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,028
But she creates more trouble.

774
00:30:49,228 --> 00:30:50,147
With cadres like her,

775
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:51,748
gentle critiques are useless,

776
00:30:51,748 --> 00:30:53,347
and harsh words make her hostile.

777
00:30:53,908 --> 00:30:54,948
It's a tough situation.

778
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,787
Can't ignore it, can't fix it.

779
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:00,387
She's completed
her grassroots training anyway.

780
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:01,787
Just recall her back.

781
00:31:01,908 --> 00:31:03,067
She's just a young woman.

782
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:05,188
Why subject her to township hardships?

783
00:31:05,228 --> 00:31:06,627
Enough nonsense!

784
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,188
Zheng Decheng, keep this up,

785
00:31:08,188 --> 00:31:08,988
and you go back.

786
00:31:09,428 --> 00:31:10,708
Mr. Guan will enlighten you

787
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:12,468
on teamwork and shared purpose.

788
00:31:12,988 --> 00:31:14,028
This is nonnegotiable.

789
00:31:14,908 --> 00:31:16,147
I'm leaving Li Qiuping to you.

790
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:17,827
You have two years

791
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:20,188
to cultivate a competent female cadre.

792
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,307
If she doesn't grow,
you'll answer for it.

793
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:24,428
Stop this nonsense.

794
00:31:24,547 --> 00:31:25,787
You're treating it as a joke!

795
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:33,268
Careful. It's hot.

796
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:34,147
Okay, thanks.

797
00:31:37,668 --> 00:31:38,827
Could I get a spoon?

798
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:41,748
Sorry.

799
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:42,528
Thank you.

800
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:51,147
No worries. I'm alone.

801
00:31:51,228 --> 00:31:53,067
It's fine, Ms. Li. Take this seat.

802
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:54,647
Buddy.

803
00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:05,016
It's already cold.

804
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,748
(I understand their hatred.)

805
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,627
(But facing a risky thing)

806
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:14,908
(like seven-up, eight-down,)

807
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:17,147
(I'd repeat my actions every time.)

808
00:32:18,708 --> 00:32:20,827
(And as Yuehai's mayor,)

809
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:22,776
(making them grasp my intent)

810
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:23,827
(is also my job.)

811
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:26,867
(No matter how hard it is,
I have to do it.)

812
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,708
Mom, Ms. Li is here.

813
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:38,360
Xuemei.

814
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,480
Ms. Li, you're here.

815
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,188
What brings you here?

816
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,827
Nothing. Just passing by.
Thought I'd visit.

817
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:48,347
Make yourself comfortable. I'm swamped.

818
00:32:58,028 --> 00:32:58,587
Hu.

819
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:00,347
It's me, Qian from Yuehai.

820
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:01,827
Any update on the order

821
00:33:01,827 --> 00:33:02,787
we discussed last time?

822
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:03,992
When should we meet

823
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:04,988
to have another drink?

824
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,147
We're overwhelmed now.

825
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:09,188
My workshop's printing nonstop.

826
00:33:09,547 --> 00:33:10,587
The Northeast batch,

827
00:33:11,147 --> 00:33:12,508
the one that almost got canceled.

828
00:33:16,867 --> 00:33:17,748
Wait a few more days.

829
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:19,188
Those workers you fired

830
00:33:19,587 --> 00:33:20,908
will be rehired, right?

831
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:23,948
They've scattered. Where to find them?

832
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:37,188
Do you have their information?

833
00:33:37,428 --> 00:33:38,508
Any information helps.

834
00:33:38,867 --> 00:33:40,028
I'll help you contact them.

835
00:33:46,668 --> 00:33:49,188
You never actually fired them, right?

836
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,497
Training skilled workers is grueling.

837
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:57,228
Do you know that?

838
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,708
Could I bear it?

839
00:34:07,827 --> 00:34:08,547
Come on.

840
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:09,747
Ms. Li, water.

841
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:10,788
Thanks.

842
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:11,788
Have some peanuts.

843
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,428
Alright, Qian.

844
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,832
- Price is not an issue.
- This garment will be finished soon.

845
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:17,667
Look.

846
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:19,627
I gave you such a low price.

847
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:21,428
Maybe next time,

848
00:34:21,468 --> 00:34:22,627
when I come to you,

849
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,308
give me a chance to treat you to a meal?

850
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:27,308
Do you charge for calls here?

851
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:28,707
No charge.

852
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:30,587
People who come are all townsfolk.

853
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:34,227
They tend to be long calls, huh?

854
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:36,468
For discussing business,
it's all normal.

855
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:40,067
Qian, my dearest Qian.

856
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:42,707
Work doesn't matter.

857
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,187
Having a meal with you is the big deal.

858
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,707
Have you ever considered

859
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:48,988
that making phone calls

860
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:50,908
holds business opportunities too?

861
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:53,067
The phone here?

862
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:54,747
What opportunities?

863
00:34:55,348 --> 00:34:56,028
Think about it.

864
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:58,104
Businesses in Yuehai are diverse.

865
00:34:58,104 --> 00:34:59,547
All contact the outside world.

866
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:00,747
Since it's free,

867
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,468
you could turn your phone
into a public phone,

868
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:06,147
so everyone comes here
to make calls and discuss business.

869
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:09,308
Then, business information
would keep pouring in.

870
00:35:11,627 --> 00:35:13,227
And my business would be more dynamic.

871
00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:14,028
Yes.

872
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:15,908
Since they use your number,

873
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,788
the sales reps
without their own factories

874
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:19,928
can affiliate with you to process
their payments

875
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:21,107
through your account,

876
00:35:21,107 --> 00:35:22,747
increasing your transaction volume too.

877
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:25,432
Alright. That's a deal then.

878
00:35:26,988 --> 00:35:27,587
You hang up.

879
00:35:29,747 --> 00:35:30,747
You hang up first.

880
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:33,348
You hang up first.

881
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,747
What are you doing?
You've been talking forever.

882
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:38,227
Almost done, almost!

883
00:35:38,468 --> 00:35:40,267
Qian this, Qian that. You're hopeless!

884
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:42,468
Qian, I need to go now.

885
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:43,348
I've got business.

886
00:35:43,388 --> 00:35:44,107
Call you later.

887
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:45,147
Hurry up!

888
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:46,547
Done! All done!

889
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:47,508
We're discussing things.

890
00:35:47,587 --> 00:35:48,428
It's finished.

891
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:52,028
Ms. Li, will what you said earlier work?

892
00:35:52,388 --> 00:35:53,747
It'll work. Give it a try.

893
00:35:55,627 --> 00:35:57,667
It's getting late.
The town meeting starts soon.

894
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:58,627
I'll head out first.

895
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,428
Wait. Hold on.

896
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:03,948
Ms. Li, I truly don't know
how to thank you.

897
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:05,948
It's nothing special.

898
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:07,547
Take it back for sharing.

899
00:36:07,547 --> 00:36:08,508
- Come on!
- No, thanks.

900
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:09,227
Come on. Take it!

901
00:36:09,348 --> 00:36:10,227
Take it back to eat!

902
00:36:10,508 --> 00:36:11,508
Here, off you go.

903
00:36:12,828 --> 00:36:13,468
That's enough.

904
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:14,948
Come on. Take it!

905
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:15,988
Take it. It's delicious.

906
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:19,288
(Conference Room)

907
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:27,267
Is everyone here?

908
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:28,468
Yuehai efficiency!

909
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:30,868
Everyone's here, right?

910
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:32,227
Mr. Zheng,

911
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:33,227
Ms. Li isn't here.

912
00:36:33,627 --> 00:36:34,127
Get started.

913
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:36,067
There are still two minutes.

914
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:37,187
Get on with the business.

915
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:38,147
We're all busy.

916
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:41,707
Then let's begin today's agenda, okay?

917
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:46,428
She's coming.

918
00:36:58,627 --> 00:37:00,868
Everyone, regarding
the seven-up, eight-down issue,

919
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,788
I was terrified Yuehai
would face penalties.

920
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:06,308
I dragged you all into this trouble.

921
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:07,547
No, no trouble at all.

922
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:09,428
But I still want to say

923
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,608
that if this happens again,

924
00:37:12,152 --> 00:37:13,067
I will still do it.

925
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:47,388
The peanuts are good.

926
00:37:48,147 --> 00:37:48,707
Quite tasty.

927
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,028
Mr. Zheng, use this.

928
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,028
Put the peanut shells here.

929
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:54,828
Keep things clean.

930
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:55,968
Here.

931
00:37:56,428 --> 00:37:57,028
Ms. Li.

932
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:57,587
Here.

933
00:37:57,587 --> 00:37:58,107
Thanks.

934
00:37:58,348 --> 00:37:58,868
Lin.

935
00:37:59,707 --> 00:38:00,428
Xie.

936
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:01,308
Come on. Have some.

937
00:38:01,828 --> 00:38:03,227
Don't just litter peanut shells.

938
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:04,107
This smell

939
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:06,428
is familiar.

940
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:08,828
Brought it from your place.

941
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:13,828
Then dig in.

942
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:14,868
Then let's

943
00:38:15,227 --> 00:38:16,187
start the meeting, okay?

944
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:16,828
Okay.

945
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:19,348
Well, I've run into some trouble.

946
00:38:20,547 --> 00:38:22,028
I'd like to ask for your advice.

947
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,547
Up to today,

948
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:26,788
Yuehai's total population stands

949
00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:30,348
at 30,285 people.

950
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:42,308
Mr. Zheng,

951
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:44,908
didn't you mention a problem?

952
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:47,227
This is the problem.

953
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:55,267
It was 30,083 last month.

954
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:56,227
That means,

955
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:59,107
this month Yuehai only grew
by 202 people.

956
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,667
Averaged out daily,

957
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:02,948
less than 10 people come
to Yuehai per day.

958
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:06,348
Indeed.

959
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:09,988
As for Yuehai,

960
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:11,868
from its founding until today,

961
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:14,508
it has attracted over 30,000 people.

962
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:16,707
But now, that number has stagnated.

963
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,067
We won't meet our target.

964
00:39:19,227 --> 00:39:21,627
Don't you think this is a problem?

965
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,828
Let's hear everyone's thoughts.

966
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:26,788
Share your opinions.

967
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:28,348
Who goes first?

968
00:40:00,747 --> 00:40:01,988
I recall there was a document,

969
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,908
Pingchuan Government Document
No. 1984-2.

970
00:40:05,428 --> 00:40:07,308
Wait a moment.
I know where that document is.

971
00:40:08,267 --> 00:40:09,948
When I worked at the county committee,

972
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:13,107
that document was approved
and stamped under my purview.

973
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:15,147
I remember

974
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,587
Article Three of that document states

975
00:40:17,868 --> 00:40:19,587
that it is proposed

976
00:40:20,147 --> 00:40:21,948
that cadres
of the County Committee Office

977
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:24,468
spare no effort in supporting
Yuehai's construction.

978
00:40:24,868 --> 00:40:27,308
Step one, relocate ten
state-owned factories to Yuehai.

979
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:29,707
Step two, propose that

980
00:40:29,788 --> 00:40:31,227
leading cadres from all county units

981
00:40:31,707 --> 00:40:34,067
actively respond to Yuehai's call,

982
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:35,428
help Yuehai's construction,

983
00:40:35,707 --> 00:40:37,187
and build homes and businesses here.

984
00:40:38,948 --> 00:40:39,667
Amazing!

985
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:41,828
Word for word.

986
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:50,988
Impressive, Ms. Li.

987
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,627
You have a photographic memory.

988
00:40:54,308 --> 00:40:56,587
Alright, go ahead and share your idea.

989
00:40:57,107 --> 00:40:59,547
I think we should have
county committee cadres take the lead.

990
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:02,747
If the cadres all come
to Yuehai to build houses,

991
00:41:02,788 --> 00:41:05,028
it shows Yuehai has promise.

992
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:06,547
It has potential to grow.

993
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:09,428
Then others will follow suit.

994
00:41:09,948 --> 00:41:10,667
What do you think?

995
00:41:13,828 --> 00:41:14,667
I like it.

996
00:41:15,468 --> 00:41:16,067

997
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:17,147
Moreover,

998
00:41:18,107 --> 00:41:19,308
this plan is feasible.

999
00:41:20,107 --> 00:41:22,468
Ms. Li, since you previously worked
in the county,

1000
00:41:22,788 --> 00:41:24,696
you should have dealt with all

1001
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:25,707
the county units.

1002
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:28,067
It'll make the work easier.

1003
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:30,707
So I believe this should be assigned
to you to implement.

1004
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:31,408
Okay?

1005
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:32,707
