00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:40,393
There's no starting over.

17
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:43,673
A sanitation blitz for one day is fine,

18
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:46,273
but it can't be a permanent thing.

19
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:47,993
Who can handle it every day?

20
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:49,913
You know it.

21
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:53,712
Yesterday we just made do
with steamed buns and pickles.

22
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:55,592
We can't live like that every day.

23
00:01:56,312 --> 00:01:58,512
I have to cook three meals a day.

24
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm not afraid of hard work.

25
00:02:01,816 --> 00:02:03,096
It's just not sustainable.

26
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:08,462
Ms. Li,

27
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:11,256
I can't move today.

28
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,833
I'm not a young man.

29
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,472
After yesterday's work,

30
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:19,632
my body really hurts.

31
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,273
I can't move.

32
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,152
Understood.

33
00:02:27,353 --> 00:02:28,472
Have a good rest.

34
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:30,252
Okay.

35
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:36,393
Nice shot!

36
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,192
Got it in one hit!

37
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:48,273
Next!

38
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:50,393
Please, Mr. Xie.

39
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:55,472
Mr. Xie, go!

40
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:57,273
Mr. Xie, go!

41
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,513
- Mr. Xie, go!
- Mr. Xie, go!

42
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:06,733
Take this!

43
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:15,673
It doesn't count!

44
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:16,953
It's one-ball decider.

45
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:18,233
What are you yelling about?

46
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:19,872
Let the young...

47
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:21,113
Come here.

48
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:22,673
What are you doing?

49
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:23,872
Chen is amazing.

50
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,872
None of us could beat her.

51
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,192
Really?

52
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:28,752
That good?

53
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:30,073
Let me try.

54
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:30,613
Go ahead.

55
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:33,793
Hit to her middle-right with spin.

56
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,513
No need for your advice.

57
00:03:37,872 --> 00:03:39,833
If you can beat me,

58
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,432
I'll recommend you
to the city sports school.

59
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:43,793
I'll write the recommendation.

60
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:45,833
Mr. Zheng, you keep your word?

61
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:48,152
When have I not?

62
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:49,472
Come on.

63
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:51,064
See?

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,912
Y-Your paddle is great.

65
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,353
You...

66
00:03:54,632 --> 00:03:55,872
She's just skilled.

67
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:57,712
Pure talent.

68
00:03:58,912 --> 00:03:59,412
Wu.

69
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:00,953
Can I borrow your knife?

70
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:02,273
This is really sharp.

71
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:03,353
Let me try.

72
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:04,393
Be careful.

73
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:05,912
Why take a knife?

74
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:06,793
It might fly out.

75
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,592
Mr. Zheng, I can play with this.

76
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:09,793
Be careful.

77
00:04:09,793 --> 00:04:12,513
Don't swing it over here and hit me.

78
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:18,153
She made it.

79
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:19,293
Nice shot!

80
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:23,632
Mr. Zheng.

81
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:24,553
You can't match her!

82
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:25,952
Write the letter!

83
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:26,692
Okay.

84
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:28,872
I'll write the recommendation.

85
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:29,713
Come on.

86
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:31,192
Give it up, Xie.

87
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:31,993
Really?

88
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:33,233
Really?

89
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:35,713
It's my turn.

90
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:47,153
Little Conch!

91
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:50,793
Where's Ms. Li and Meng?

92
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,353
Probably still on the street.

93
00:04:55,153 --> 00:04:56,432
Haven't come back for dinner.

94
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,153
What are they doing out?

95
00:04:59,113 --> 00:04:59,613
Well...

96
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,593
- Where've they gone?
- Ping'an Road.

97
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:04,600
(Pitch in, keep it clean.
No public urination here.)

98
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:19,288
(Pitch in, keep it clean.
No public urination here.)

99
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:22,913
No peeing here! I'm watching you!

100
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,353
Hey! You scared me half to death.

101
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:27,512
Why aren't you two back?

102
00:05:27,553 --> 00:05:28,473
It's late.

103
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,072
Mr. Zheng. What are you doing here?

104
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:32,632
I thought it was someone peeing.

105
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,153
What are you two
doing out here at this time?

106
00:05:35,153 --> 00:05:35,768
Don't open it!

107
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:37,392
Too many mosquitoes outside.

108
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,512
We won't go out.

109
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:41,312
Mr. Zheng, why are you here?

110
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:44,632
Not back for dinner,
what are you doing here?

111
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,752
We're on duty.

112
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:47,913
What duty?

113
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,993
Stopping littering and public urination.

114
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,593
Nonsense! Who'd be out this late?

115
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:56,072
What if you run into bad people?

116
00:05:56,512 --> 00:05:57,072
Get back now.

117
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:57,952
It's fine.

118
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,952
Look, I brought weapons.

119
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,673
You... That's terrifying.

120
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:02,512
Alright.

121
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,233
No one'd be out this late.

122
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:05,272
Go home now.

123
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:10,432
No peeing here!

124
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:11,512
Stop it!

125
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:13,913
Peeing on my bike?

126
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:15,312
Why not pee on my head instead?

127
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:16,673
I can't hold it.

128
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:17,832
You're challenging me.

129
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:19,233
Stay right there!

130
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:20,832
I'll take you somewhere else.

131
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:22,233
Behave!

132
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:24,553
Okay.

133
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:25,832
Hurry up!

134
00:06:25,832 --> 00:06:27,872
Eat up. It's still hot.

135
00:06:28,392 --> 00:06:29,033
Thank you.

136
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:31,353
If you run into trouble, shout loudly.

137
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:33,713
The locals here will help.

138
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,072
Got it.

139
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:35,993
Safety first.

140
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:37,173
Okay.

141
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:38,233
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

142
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:40,752
Look at you.

143
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:43,312
Why drink so much water at night?

144
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:45,473
Get on. I'll take you elsewhere.

145
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,033
Don't pee here again.

146
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:49,173
Let's eat.

147
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:54,113
Two meat buns.

148
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:55,233
Hi.

149
00:06:58,312 --> 00:06:59,312
Hello.

150
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:00,233
This is it?

151
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:00,793
Yes.

152
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:01,473
Also.

153
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:02,072
Are we here?

154
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:04,673
Yeah, it's here.

155
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:07,153
That's all, boarding.

156
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,432
Just a good place.

157
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:19,312
Stop!

158
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:20,673
Hello.

159
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:21,392
Hello.

160
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:22,312
You... Who are you?

161
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:23,793
What "Hello"?

162
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:24,832
I don't understand.

163
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:26,512
Where are you from?

164
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:27,312
Why come here?

165
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:29,872
We're looking for someone.

166
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:30,793
For whom?

167
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:32,192
Monica?

168
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:34,593
Qiuping!

169
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,233
She's coming.

170
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:38,553
Your friends?

171
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:39,832
Monica!

172
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:41,312
Qiuping!

173
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:45,392
Long time no see.
I've missed you so much!

174
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,673
I can't believe you're here.

175
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,353
Let me introduce you.

176
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:52,432
This is my band.

177
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:53,553
My drummer.

178
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,993
- I'm Steve.
- Steve.

179
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:57,952
- My guitarist.
- I'm David.

180
00:07:58,153 --> 00:07:58,952
And bassist, Mark.

181
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,192
Nice to meet you.

182
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,793
Hello, I'm Li Qiuping, the Town Mayor.

183
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:05,872
Monica is my longtime friend.

184
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:07,752
Welcome to Yuehai.

185
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:09,033
Yes!

186
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,473
Yuehai!

187
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:15,272
We biked for eight hours to get here,

188
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:19,072
and rented these bikes in Nanzhou.

189
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:20,153
(Dare to explore. Dare to act.)
So cool!

190
00:08:20,153 --> 00:08:21,072
(Work hard. Unite for Yuehai.)

191
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:23,793
My fault. I should've sent a car.

192
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,593
No need. We're here now.

193
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:32,993
Who are they?

194
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:35,152
Cadres from our town government.

195
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,792
Mr. Tan and Mr. Xie, both deputy mayors.

196
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,032
Nice to meet you.

197
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,333
Hi.

198
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:44,833
He's not used to this.

199
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:45,993
Sorry.

200
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:47,152
It's fine.

201
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:48,752
Nice to meet you.

202
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:53,132
Chinese great cadres, right?

203
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,713
Chinese great cadres.

204
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:56,953
Ms. Li's friends, right?

205
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:57,772
Yes.

206
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,392
Monica came specifically to see me.

207
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:00,272
Foreign friends.

208
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:01,372
Great.

209
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:04,073
Monica, let me show you around.

210
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:04,792
Great.

211
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:06,493
Okay.

212
00:09:07,193 --> 00:09:08,392
Is this where you work?

213
00:09:08,392 --> 00:09:08,892
Yes.

214
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:10,272
Nice.

215
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:13,688
- That's our canteen.
- Ms. Li is great.

216
00:09:14,872 --> 00:09:17,792
- Ms. Li seems the most normal.
- This is...

217
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:39,632
Ms. Li, who are they?

218
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,632
They're my friends from abroad.

219
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:43,593
Want to join?

220
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:45,792
I'll pass.

221
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:48,752
My English is not great.

222
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:50,193
They can speak Chinese.

223
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:53,912
And they're a band.

224
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:56,752
You can communicate with music.
Music has no borders.

225
00:09:57,593 --> 00:09:58,152
Really?

226
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:02,032
Then I'll go wash up, change clothes,

227
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:03,473
and get my guitar.

228
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:04,392
Thanks, Ms. Li.

229
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:05,052
We'll wait.

230
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:06,512
Bring your guitar.

231
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:07,833
Got it.

232
00:10:11,593 --> 00:10:13,593
Even if they are foreigners,

233
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:16,353
dressing like this,
don't their parents care?

234
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,433
Even if parents don't, teachers should.

235
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:23,193
What are you muttering? Are you hungry?

236
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,993
No. I think they dress...

237
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:27,272
You want to join? Why didn't you go?

238
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:28,953
I don't want at all. You go if you want.

239
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,593
Why didn't you keep an eye on them?

240
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:31,512
What if they overspend?

241
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,752
You watch me all day. Why not go?

242
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:35,032
I'm not watching you.

243
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:37,392
Ms. Li already gave me the money.
They're self-funded.

244
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:39,512
Nothing to supervise.

245
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,113
Yeah. It's good.

246
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:42,993
Not bad.

247
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:43,632
It's good.

248
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:44,912
It likes... Let me...

249
00:10:45,113 --> 00:10:45,752
Great.

250
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:47,632
Mark

251
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:51,152
studied directing in college.

252
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:53,073
So, this time,

253
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:54,233
his first task here

254
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:56,313
is to shoot a documentary.

255
00:10:57,193 --> 00:10:57,953
A documentary?

256
00:10:58,113 --> 00:10:58,613
Yes.

257
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:02,953
The first task. Is there another task?

258
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:05,872
Another task is from my dad.

259
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:10,152
He said domestic development is booming,

260
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,993
especially our hometown
along the Dongjiang coast.

261
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:16,313
The next decade looks great.

262
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:17,512
My grandpa

263
00:11:17,632 --> 00:11:20,593
sees a map of China every day,

264
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:22,073
saying he misses home terribly.

265
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:24,272
He wants us to catch this wave.

266
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,593
So my dad asked me to come back,

267
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,512
and see if there's anything
worth investing in.

268
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:31,713
Investing?

269
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:35,953
Anyway, just show me around,

270
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,433
and see how things are.

271
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:39,752
You're the leader here.

272
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:41,113
And policies are flexible.

273
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:43,152
If acceptable,

274
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:45,792
I'll tell my dad to choose here.

275
00:11:48,392 --> 00:11:49,656
Choose... Here?

276
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:51,872
Ms. Li.

277
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:54,752
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng.

278
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:56,272
Mr. Lin.

279
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:56,872
This is...

280
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,032
My classmate from France,

281
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,152
Monica, an American Chinese.

282
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:03,912
This is Zheng Decheng,
Secretary of Yuehai.

283
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:06,032
Secretary?

284
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:09,833
What does "Secretary" mean?

285
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:11,833
Is he your leader?

286
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:12,693
Yeah.

287
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:15,353
So, you're a great cadre.

288
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:16,792
A Chinese great cadre.

289
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:18,453
Chinese...

290
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:20,512
Got it. Hello, Mr. Zheng.

291
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:22,113
Hello.

292
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:23,912
My hands are dirty. Sorry.

293
00:12:24,813 --> 00:12:25,313
Well...

294
00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:25,813
It's fine.

295
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,652
Friends from abroad?

296
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:28,252
Yes.

297
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:30,752
No wonder you look different.

298
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:32,272
Our distinguished guests.

299
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:33,336
Distinguished guests.

300
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,313
Ms. Li, host them well.

301
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:35,833
I will.

302
00:12:36,032 --> 00:12:37,412
Distinguished guests, please sit.

303
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:38,713
Come, sit.

304
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:39,593
- Bye.
- Bye.

305
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:43,353
Monica, I think your idea is excellent.

306
00:12:43,713 --> 00:12:45,193
I'll report it

307
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,333
to our great cadre right now.

308
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:48,233
Great. Go ahead.

309
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:51,096
(Please conserve water)

310
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:54,328
I just wonder

311
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:57,473
are they men or women?

312
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:01,313
Mr. Zheng.

313
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,512
I have something to discuss with you.

314
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:04,372
Go ahead.

315
00:13:04,752 --> 00:13:07,473
Monica's ancestral home is Dongjiang.

316
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:10,953
Her grandpa went to the US,

317
00:13:11,473 --> 00:13:13,272
and now her dad is in Los Angeles.

318
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:15,172
And?

319
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:18,872
She says her dad wants
to invest back home.

320
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,073
He's optimistic about China,
especially Yuehai.

321
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,193
I really want to make it happen.

322
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:26,152
At least, leave a good impression.

323
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,272
Investment? That's excellent news.

324
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:30,353
Absolutely excellent news.

325
00:13:37,113 --> 00:13:37,632
Great!

326
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:40,952
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Ms. Li.

327
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,113
Their accommodations are arranged.

328
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:44,292
Thanks.

329
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:46,552
Tomorrow I'll take them to Ping'an Road.

330
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:48,752
Meng and I already cleaned it.

331
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:50,152
Why not go to Fuyu Road?

332
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:53,233
Because it has been poorly maintained
for too long.

333
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:55,353
I can't clean it up in a short time.

334
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:57,672

350
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:13,292
Morning.

351
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:15,912
Meng, have you seen my friend Monica?

352
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:17,593
No.

353
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:19,833
Where did they go?

354
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:20,833
Ms. Li.

355
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:22,752
You didn't see them?

356
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:27,073
When I woke up, I saw that David.

357
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:28,713
And that...

358
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:30,672
David...

359
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:32,313
Did you see where they went?

360
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:39,313
I'm coming.

361
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:40,552
I'm coming.

362
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:41,240
Little Conch!

363
00:15:41,656 --> 00:15:42,680
Have you seen them?

364
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:43,872
Who?

365
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:47,233
Those foreigners... Ms. Li's friends.

366
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:49,193
I did see them.

367
00:15:49,473 --> 00:15:51,073
They went out before dawn broke.

368
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:52,032
Went out?

369
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:53,193
Why didn't you tell us?

370
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:56,073
You were all still asleep.

371
00:15:56,473 --> 00:15:57,512
They're here on vacation,

372
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,713
not for work. Why not rest properly?

373
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:01,953
I just remembered.

374
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,353
They're jet-lagged.

375
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,193
They couldn't sleep right now.

376
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:09,433
- Where...
- Where would they go?

377
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:10,392
Where could they go?

378
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:15,512
I'm worried they went to Fuyu Road.

379
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:18,512
(Fuyu Road)
Hai!

380
00:16:18,632 --> 00:16:19,132
Come on!

381
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,344
- I guess he's my guy.
- Oh, my God!

382
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,032
I got this.

383
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:26,313
You got this. Got this.

384
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:28,512
Great!

385
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:30,032
Hai.

386
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:30,652
I'll do it!

387
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:31,313
Go ahead!

388
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:33,713
Go!

389
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:39,239
You can do it.

390
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:43,953
Nice try!

391
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:44,613
Bring it!

392
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:45,953
Here it comes!

393
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:46,693
Let's go!

394
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,664
Hai!

395
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,912
This is our last one.

396
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:58,392
We won!

397
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:01,552
Can we borrow this?

398
00:17:02,713 --> 00:17:03,473
This one.

399
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:07,633
This thing.

400
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:09,304
I'll trade these for it.

401
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:14,193
He will give us those
if you let them try the video recorder.

402
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:15,272
Just try?

403
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:16,592
Yeah. Just try.

404
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:18,473
Alright. Come.

405
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:20,633
Okay. Give them to her.

406
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,272
Give me. Give me more.

407
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:23,512
Thank you!

408
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:25,112
Be careful.

409
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:27,453
Give.

410
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:29,072
Put it on your shoulder.

411
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:32,512
Eyes over here.

412
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,072
Got it.

413
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:35,112
Can you see?

414
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:36,193
I see it!

415
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,393
Can you see us, Hai?

416
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:40,592
Quan.

417
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:41,752
Can they see us?

418
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:42,252
Zoom in.

419
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:44,473
Give a try!

420
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:45,713
This is how you do it.

421
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:47,852
Here.

422
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:49,012
Your hands.

423
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:55,233
They're really here.

424
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:57,693
Xiaoli.

425
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:00,873
Bring some vendors over
to distract them.

426
00:18:00,953 --> 00:18:02,633
I'll stall them.

427
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:03,133
Got it.

428
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:04,233
(Fuyu Road)

429
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,312
That's a sweep kick.

430
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:06,840
- Aren't you from the martial arts team?
- Monica!

431
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,032
Monica!

432
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,512
Qiuping, come here!

433
00:18:12,713 --> 00:18:14,173
Join us!

434
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:16,633
You like playing with this?

435
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,512
This is really fun!

436
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:19,633
Why didn't you tell me

437
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:20,993
when you went out?

438
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:23,792
That jet lag

439
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:25,713
hit me hard.

440
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:27,032
I woke up very early.

441
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,153
I saw you were sleeping well,
so I didn't wake you.

442
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:31,233
This...

443
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:31,792
Try this.

444
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:32,993
Ms. Li, try it.

445
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,032
Okay, zoom in.

446
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:37,592
Zoom out.

447
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:38,352
Zoom out.

448
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:39,352
What does that mean?

449
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:43,393
Monica, let me take you somewhere else.

450
00:18:43,713 --> 00:18:44,213
Great!

451
00:18:44,913 --> 00:18:45,413
This way.

452
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:48,233
Something smells.

453
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:50,352
What is that? Fragrant and stinky.

454
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:51,393
Is there?

455
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:54,552
Seems to be coming from over there.

456
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:57,272
Probably stinky tofu.

457
00:18:57,713 --> 00:18:58,953
You might not be used to it.

458
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:01,352
No! I wanna try.

459
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:03,312
Let's go and check it out!

460
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,633
Mark! David! Let's go!

461
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:07,112
That way.

462
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,913
Let's go! Buy something to eat.

463
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,473
I gotta go. Say bye!

464
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,153
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

465
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,193
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

466
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:14,913
Bye!

467
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:22,473
Is this chicken or duck?

468
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:24,873
This is chicken.

469
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:29,352
Look here.

470
00:19:29,352 --> 00:19:30,424
(Fruits, Poultry, Meat, Vegetables)

471
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:36,512
Okay. I will pay later. Just go.

472
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:37,433
Yan!

473
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:38,433
Ms. Li.

474
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:40,112
We've got four international guests.

475
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:42,153
Prepare four bowls of Rouyan.

476
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,633
Okay. Come in. Have a seat!

477
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:44,673
Let's sit over there.

478
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:45,213
Okay.

479
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,233
Go sit over there.

480
00:19:47,873 --> 00:19:49,393
There is yangqin!

481
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:50,193
What's this?

482
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:50,913
So cool!

483
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:52,213
Play it.

484
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:53,072
How do you play it?

485
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:53,572
Monica.

486
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:55,352
Monkeys!

487
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:55,913
The monkey!

488
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:59,592
Let's sit here. Sit inside.

489
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:00,792
Okay.

490
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:05,393
Can I help with anything?

491
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:05,993
No need.

492
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:07,480
- I'll wash my hands.
- I can handle it.

493
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:10,552
(Protect the Environment)

494
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:14,233
I'll mix the sauce.

495
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:16,153
Okay. Put a bit of each.

496
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:18,052
Four bowls.

497
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:20,512
I'll mix to my favorite taste.

498
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:21,453
Okay.

499
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,072
Let's go.

500
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:44,832
Monica!

501
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,647
Arguing.

502
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:05,752
You block the whole road!

503
00:21:06,592 --> 00:21:08,352
Why are your sheep here?

504
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,072
My sheep need exercise too.

505
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:13,528
I'll go once they finish unloading.

506
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:16,592
Move aside! Let my sheep pass first!

507
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:28,752
You're completely blocking the road.

508
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:30,713
Fine. I'll leave once they unload.

509
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:32,913
I'll go when it's clear.
I can't move now.

510
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:34,733
Well...

511
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,320
- Monica.
- Yeah?

512
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:40,512
What about Ms. Li?

513
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,153
It's okay. Just don't let her find us.

514
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:44,673
She's the leader here.

515
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:45,993
I came here to investigate.

516
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:47,953
We won't see the real situation

517
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:49,512
if she comes with us.

518
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,112
Careful.

519
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:04,993
I'm going.

520
00:22:06,312 --> 00:22:07,673
Finally time to go home.

521
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,688
We will never come back here.

522
00:22:12,312 --> 00:22:13,082
Qiuping.

523
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:15,393
Just see me off here.

524
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,176
(Yuehai Town People's Government)
This time we part.

525
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:19,312
(The CPC Yuehai Town Committee)
I don't know when we'll meet again.

526
00:22:20,552 --> 00:22:21,433
Take care of yourself.

527
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,272
You too.

528
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:24,552
Monica.

529
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:26,552
How will you tell your dad about Yuehai?

530
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:28,752
I really like Yuehai.

531
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:30,473
Truly.

532
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:32,673
Then, I'll wait for good news.

533
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:37,552
But if it's about investment,

534
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,873
my dad may not choose here.

535
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:43,713
He really cares about cleanliness.

536
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,153
But the sanitary conditions here...

537
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,153
We'll improve it for sure.

538
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:52,312
It's not just about that.

539
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:54,512
I really like Yuehai.

540
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:58,633
I love its vitality, freedom,

541
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,673
and the atmosphere.

542
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:03,032
But my dad wants a city

543
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:05,993
with real development potential.

544
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:10,512
Right now,
Yuehai still feels like a village.

545
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:12,272
Do you understand?

546
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:14,673
Yes.

547
00:23:19,112 --> 00:23:21,792
Mark, can you give me the footage?

548
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:27,352
Okay, I can make a copy for you.

549
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,792
No. Please leave it here.

550
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,352
I don't want it to get out.

551
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,112
What are you doing?

552
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:40,193
Just give it to her.

553
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,473
This matters more to her.

554
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:53,433
Monica, thank you for understanding.

555
00:23:56,752 --> 00:23:59,393
My dear friend, I wish you all the best.

556
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,032
All the best. Good luck.

557
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:02,193
Bye.

558
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:26,473
This way.

559
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:28,193
Changyuan, Fatty.

560
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,272
I might borrow this TV for a few days.

561
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:33,193
Don't say that. Just leave it here.

562
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,673
(Yuehai Town Master Plan)
Consider it a gift.

563
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,473
No. I'll return it later.

564
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:37,193
No need.

565
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:38,552
It's secondhand anyway.

566
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:39,352
Just keep it.

567
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:39,993
Secondhand?

568
00:24:40,673 --> 00:24:43,312
Then, Changyuan, we'll buy it.

569
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:44,633
How can I take your money?

570
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:45,993
Take the video recorder back.

571
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,953
No.

572
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:48,752
Stop right there.

573
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:52,352
That's the rule. We must pay.

574
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:53,552
Name your price.

575
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:56,673
Ms. Li, a TV is expensive.

576
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:58,512
May be thousands. We can't afford that.

577
00:24:58,592 --> 00:24:59,272
We can rent it.

578
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:01,512
I'll decide on this.

579
00:25:01,913 --> 00:25:03,393
Alright. 800 yuan.

580
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:04,512
Okay?

581
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:07,153
That's cheap, but we...

582
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:07,913
Mr. Tan.

583
00:25:07,993 --> 00:25:09,393
I think we do need a TV.

584
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,832
We can watch the news,

585
00:25:11,153 --> 00:25:13,233
and enrich our free time.

586
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:15,873
Watching the news is important.

587
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,352
Stay informed matters.

588
00:25:17,552 --> 00:25:18,584
I'll find a way. Okay?

589
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:19,792
Qian, come with me to finance.

590
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:21,272
Go to finance? Don't bother.

591
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,272
- Just keep it.
- 800.

592
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:22,993
Okay, 800 yuan.

593
00:25:22,993 --> 00:25:23,873
Rules are rules.

594
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,552
Why are you winking at me?

595
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:26,752
No, I...

596
00:25:47,433 --> 00:25:49,153
I'm not doing it on purpose!

597
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:51,992
What do you mean?

598
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:52,633
You hit me!

599
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,473
You slug!

600
00:25:53,913 --> 00:25:55,993
What? You want to hit me?

601
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,153
What do you mean?

602
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:04,592
Oh, stop there!

603
00:26:06,112 --> 00:26:06,612
Don't go!

604
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:21,433
What?

605
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,512
Can we go in?

606
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:25,052
Yes.

607
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:26,393
Line up.

608
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:27,352
Line up!

609
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,312
Video time!

610
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:30,352
How is it? Is it good?

611
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:31,552
What film?

612
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:32,873
What's up?

613
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:33,592
What film is it?

614
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:34,233
Well...

615
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:34,913
Why so upset?

616
00:26:34,913 --> 00:26:36,193
Is it a martial arts film?

617
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:38,153
A tragedy?

618
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:39,233
- Is it a tragedy?
- A tragedy?

619
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,032
Come by.

620
00:26:40,153 --> 00:26:40,832
- Hi!
- A tragedy?

621
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:41,332
Ms. Gao!

622
00:26:41,552 --> 00:26:42,752
It's a tragedy.

623
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:43,352
A tragedy.

624
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:43,913
A tragedy?

625
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,913
I didn't bring tissues!

626
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:46,873
Be serious.

627
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:47,673
It's a tragedy.

628
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:48,713
Come on. Hurry up.

629
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:49,473
Sunflower seeds!

630
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,193
Don't waste time.

631
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:50,832
Come on.

632
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:51,393
Here.

633
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:51,893
Fatty, here.

634
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:53,873
Come on. Here you are.

635
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:55,153
More. Give me more.

636
00:26:55,153 --> 00:26:56,032
- More?
- More, please.

637
00:26:56,272 --> 00:26:56,772
Okay.

638
00:27:01,032 --> 00:27:01,913
What's all this about?

639
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:03,272
What are you doing?

640
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,233
Don't bother me with trivial stuff.

641
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:06,272
I have important matters.

642
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:07,873
We need to be ready

643
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:09,153
for the investment.

644
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:09,752
Right?

645
00:27:09,832 --> 00:27:10,393
Mr. Xie.

646
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:11,252
Come here.

647
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:12,453
Come here.

648
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:14,393
There you are.

649
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:16,352
Quick! The video's starting.

650
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,272
Hurry!

651
00:27:17,272 --> 00:27:18,272
What a big deal.

652
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:19,193
Hurry!

653
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:19,832
It's starting.

654
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:20,792
Sit here.

655
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:22,433
We're watching a tragedy.

656
00:27:22,592 --> 00:27:23,312
Isn't it a comedy?

657
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,153
What?

658
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:24,772
What?

659
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:25,873
No. It's a tragedy.

660
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:27,112
Come on.

661
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:28,552
Everyone's here.

662
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:29,953
What's this about?

663
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:31,832
To watch the video.

664
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:33,032
Here! Two fish.

665
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:33,873
Come on. Fish.

666
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:40,752
Come here.

667
00:27:40,752 --> 00:27:42,792
How about that great thing?
That's so bravo.

668
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,512
You're so pretty.

669
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:57,032
So beautiful.

670
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:59,272
Let me cut your hair. Snip, snip, snip!

671
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:02,112
Snip, snip, snip!

672
00:28:02,993 --> 00:28:04,193
Why are there foreigners?

673
00:28:06,233 --> 00:28:06,832
It's Changyuan.

674
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:08,993
I'm on TV!

675
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:10,552
I'm in the back.

676
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,433
Like that man,

677
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:13,312
Sammo Hung Kam-Bo.

678
00:28:18,272 --> 00:28:19,592
Look, that's you.

679
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,351
Ms. Gao.

680
00:28:21,873 --> 00:28:22,473
No!

681
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:23,713
My hairstyle's terrible.

682
00:28:23,713 --> 00:28:25,193
You're the female lead!

683
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:26,712
- Really?
- Makes sense.

684
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,112
Always the center of attention.

685
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:29,953
Like a peacock.

686
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:31,512
I did her hairstyle.

687
00:28:31,512 --> 00:28:32,913
Yes. She did.

688
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:35,633
Need any actors?

689
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:37,153
They're killing a chicken.

690
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:38,296
Killing a chicken.

691
00:28:39,312 --> 00:28:40,592
Now, plucking the feathers.

692
00:28:47,953 --> 00:28:49,072
Why are they fighting?

693
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:01,433
Stop it!

694
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:02,633
You, stop it!

695
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:03,592
Stop!

696
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:05,312
It's over.

697
00:29:06,592 --> 00:29:07,092
Finished?

698
00:29:07,352 --> 00:29:07,873
Is it over?

699
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:08,393
I don't know.

700
00:29:08,393 --> 00:29:08,893
Is it over?

701
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:09,933
Mr. Tan.

702
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,673
What's that mean?

703
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:12,852
Everyone.

704
00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:16,153
Xie, you know.

705
00:29:16,552 --> 00:29:18,112
The young people

706
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:19,233
in this video

707
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:21,473
are Ms. Li's foreign friends.

708
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:22,673
Good friends.

709
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:24,512
They came specially to Yuehai

710
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,153
to see if Yuehai

711
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,112
is suitable for investment.

712
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,393
But you've all seen it.

713
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:33,433
About Yuehai's condition,

714
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:35,153
they left without saying a word.

715
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:36,393
Calling it off?

716
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:37,072
What?

717
00:29:37,112 --> 00:29:38,112
Why?

718
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,312
Not investing?

719
00:29:42,752 --> 00:29:43,433
That won't do!

720
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,433
They can't back out like that.

721
00:29:45,473 --> 00:29:46,424
Really.

722
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:48,512
What does this mean?

723
00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:50,032
Withdraw it so casually?

724
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:51,693
That's not a small thing.

725
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:53,153
- Right.
- Any problem,

726
00:29:53,153 --> 00:29:54,512
we can negotiate.

727
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:55,272
Right.

728
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:56,473
Whose friends are they?

729
00:29:56,473 --> 00:29:57,953
Everyone's waiting.

730
00:29:58,392 --> 00:29:59,288
We are waiting. Right?

731
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:00,512
Ms. Li's friends

732
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:02,040
should be...

733
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,993
Be reasonable, right?

734
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:03,953
- Exactly.
- Right.

735
00:30:04,352 --> 00:30:06,873
She can't toy with Yuehai's people.

736
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,072
We're all ready.

737
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:09,352
- All waiting.
- Right.

738
00:30:09,352 --> 00:30:10,512
Be reasonable, okay?

739
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:11,512
How am I not?

740
00:30:11,512 --> 00:30:12,752
The day they arrived,

741
00:30:12,752 --> 00:30:14,312
you littered right in front of them.

742
00:30:14,792 --> 00:30:15,913
Are you crazy?

743
00:30:16,012 --> 00:30:17,713
That's not the day.

744
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:19,512
You're crazy! All of you!

745
00:30:19,873 --> 00:30:21,233
Asked you to watch a video,

746
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,552
and you just eat!

747
00:30:22,713 --> 00:30:23,713
Why eat these here?

748
00:30:23,713 --> 00:30:24,832
Never had them before?

749
00:30:24,993 --> 00:30:27,272
He has a point. Why did you bring them?

750
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:28,713
- I...
- It's not a show.

751
00:30:28,792 --> 00:30:30,272
Why did you give me these?

752
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:31,512
You brought them here.

753
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:32,792
You! Stop eating the banana.

754
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,752
Clean up. Put them away.

755
00:30:34,873 --> 00:30:36,433
You really have no manners.

756
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,873
I've traveled to so many big cities.

757
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:41,312
They all emphasize civility
and sanitation.

758
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:42,512
Don't litter!

759
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:45,873
You just littered. Look!

760
00:30:46,032 --> 00:30:47,193
See? Look at you.

761
00:30:47,393 --> 00:30:48,352
Wasn't that you?

762
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:49,233
Stop blaming us.

763
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:49,832
Well, I...

764
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:52,473
I'm just adapting to the environment.

765
00:30:52,673 --> 00:30:54,433
If you live in a pile of trash,

766
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,272
isn't it normal to throw trash around?

767
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,312
What? Pile of trash?

768
00:30:57,312 --> 00:30:58,232
What do you mean?

769
00:30:58,312 --> 00:30:59,312
Pile of trash?

770
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:01,752
Fatty, how dare you lecture me?

771
00:31:01,873 --> 00:31:02,473
So what?

772
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:03,393
Aren't you in it too?

773
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:05,512
Well... I...

774
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:06,433
I was following you!

775
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:07,552
I was just with you!

776
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:08,233
How can you...

777
00:31:08,393 --> 00:31:09,193
I'm sorry!

778
00:31:09,713 --> 00:31:10,673
I apologize. Sorry.

779
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:11,633
I apologize again.

780
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:12,193
Enough.

781
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,112
Stop arguing! You...

782
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:17,433
I'm not here to assign blame.

783
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,352
I asked you here

784
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:20,792
is not to force confessions.

785
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:22,393
It has happened.

786
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,352
We need to face it and solve it. Right?

787
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:26,592
First, Yuehai

788
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:29,592
was built by all of us together.

789
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,473
All of you

790
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,473
came here to settle down.

791
00:31:34,552 --> 00:31:36,233
And we have overcome many difficulties

792
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:39,032
to get to where we are today.

793
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:40,752
Soon,

794
00:31:40,993 --> 00:31:43,393
your factories
will open one after another.

795
00:31:43,713 --> 00:31:45,913
Now, Yuehai's sanitation

796
00:31:46,433 --> 00:31:47,592
may seem like a small issue,

797
00:31:47,913 --> 00:31:51,233
but it can damage Yuehai's image.

798
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,233
If the image is damaged,

799
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,792
clients may not come.

800
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:57,552
No clients, no business.

801
00:31:57,552 --> 00:31:58,713
How will Yuehai develop?

802
00:31:59,272 --> 00:32:00,473
So I suggest

803
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,352
that from today,

804
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:04,272
let's make some changes.

805
00:32:04,473 --> 00:32:06,072
For ourselves, and for Yuehai.

806
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,852
Let's change, okay?

807
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:08,772
Okay.

808
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,552
Listen to me.

809
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,312
The video is proof.

810
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:15,112
No one can deny it.

811
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,673
It's not just about one person.

812
00:32:17,953 --> 00:32:18,453
Right.

813
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:20,713
It reflects Yuehai's overall spirit.

814
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:21,453
Right.

815
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:22,873
I've learned something today.

816
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,272
I'll take a stance.

817
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,792
I'm a leader.

818
00:32:27,673 --> 00:32:29,633
And my family member's also here.

819
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:30,993
Okay, sit.

820
00:32:31,873 --> 00:32:32,393
All here.

821
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,112
I must admit

822
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:37,512
we didn't pay enough attention
to sanitation before.

823
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:39,592
We must take it seriously.

824
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:40,312
Right.

825
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:42,473
We must solve this problem together.

826
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:43,233
Yeah.

827
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:45,673
Let the short-sighted people regret it.

828
00:32:46,012 --> 00:32:46,512
Okay?

829
00:32:46,512 --> 00:32:47,752
- Right!
- Okay!

830
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:48,592
Right.

831
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:51,193
- Ms. Gao, I suggest...
- Yes.

832
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:52,653
We will donate money.

833
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:53,272
Okay.

834
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,112
To buy one broom for each household.

835
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:56,592
One for each?

836
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:57,092
Right.

837
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:01,272
Not enough? How about two?

838
00:33:01,832 --> 00:33:03,953
Well, every household gets one broom?

839
00:33:03,993 --> 00:33:07,233
So many brooms.
People may think you're a broom spirit.

840
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,112
Then, I'll be Yuehai's broom spirit.

841
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:11,552
And you be a dustpan spirit.

842
00:33:11,752 --> 00:33:12,953
Why not donate dustpans too?

843
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:14,792
Broom spirit and dustpan spirit.

844
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:16,072
A perfect match, right?

845
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:16,733
A set!

846
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:18,713
Well, I-I want to say something.

847
00:33:18,752 --> 00:33:20,393
I won't claim one.

848
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:21,072
I won't.

849
00:33:21,272 --> 00:33:22,393
I'll pay for it myself.

850
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:23,433
I'll pay.

851
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:24,512
Want to sponsor?

852
00:33:24,512 --> 00:33:25,713
- He...
- Excellent!

853
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:26,292
He donates.

854
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:26,873
Yes.

855
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:28,056
- You...
- You donate mops!

856
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:29,272
Mops! You donate mops!

857
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:30,913
One mop per household!

858
00:33:30,913 --> 00:33:31,953
- He...
- Okay!

859
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:33,112
My brother and I

860
00:33:33,393 --> 00:33:35,193
will donate the mops together.

861
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:35,993
You want to donate?

862
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:36,873
Do you?

863
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:38,233
I didn't say anything.

864
00:33:38,713 --> 00:33:39,873
We will donate mops.

865
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,252
Alright.

866
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,713
Well, my factory

867
00:33:42,713 --> 00:33:44,112
is about to open soon.

868
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:47,433
I'll take the lead on this.

869
00:33:47,713 --> 00:33:49,272
I will clean it up.

870
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:51,052
You can come supervise, okay?

871
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:52,913
- Great!
- Great!

872
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:54,512
Then, I'll make a commitment too.

873
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:56,832
(Watching Video)
I wanted to donate this TV.

874
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,008
You insisted on paying.

875
00:33:58,112 --> 00:33:59,352
I'll take that 800 yuan

876
00:33:59,393 --> 00:34:02,032
and add some
to buy hundreds of large trash bins.

877
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:03,792
How many?

878
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:04,473
Make it clear!

879
00:34:04,473 --> 00:34:05,072
Three hundred!

880
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:06,953
Dear residents,

881
00:34:07,272 --> 00:34:10,793
to further improve Yuehai's
overall sanitation,

882
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:12,353
ensure public health,

883
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:14,913
and strengthen
socialist spiritual civilization,

884
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,473
following government directives

885
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:19,232
on urban and rural
sanitation management,

886
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,632
(Pitch in, keep it clean.)
we established the following regulations.

887
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:24,393
(No public urination here.)
First, residents must regularly clean

888
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:26,753
(Sanitation Management Regulations)
areas in front of and around their homes.

889
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:30,632
Littering or public urination
will be fined 5 yuan.

890
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:33,032
That's not reasonable.

891
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:33,953
Right.

892
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:35,512
Who made these rules?

893
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:38,672
Who else? The new town mayor.

894
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:40,592
A new broom sweeps clean.

895
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:41,953
Now she's sweeping here.

896
00:34:41,993 --> 00:34:44,313
She can't just fine us as she likes!

897
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:45,100
- Right!
- Right!

898
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,793
Not just a fine,
but also a public shaming?

899
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,313
Yeah.

900
00:34:47,313 --> 00:34:52,353
(Pitch in, keep it clean.
No public urination here.)

901
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:53,313
This is the last batch.

902
00:34:53,873 --> 00:34:55,433
Finish it, and we can go back to rest.

903
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:56,192
Got it.

904
00:35:01,072 --> 00:35:01,712
Don't move!

905
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:06,552
I don't.

906
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:09,192
I-Is it

907
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:10,873
a robbery?

908
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,112
What robbery?

909
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:14,192
Sir, you violated regulations.

910
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:15,833
You can't litter here.

911
00:35:16,672 --> 00:35:18,993
We always dump here.

912
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:21,793
Let me tell you.

913
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,313
Starting yesterday,

914
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:26,032
the town government called everyone
to watch the video.

915
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:27,313
It's still playing now.

916
00:35:27,712 --> 00:35:28,953
This morning,

917
00:35:29,313 --> 00:35:31,232
new sanitation rules were issued.

918
00:35:31,953 --> 00:35:32,793
Look.

919
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:34,873
The notices are posted.

920
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:36,433
I can't read.

921
00:35:39,712 --> 00:35:40,512
Alright, I...

922
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:43,032
The broadcast's been playing nonstop.

923
00:35:43,353 --> 00:35:44,152
Didn't you hear it?

924
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:45,393
Well...

925
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:48,152
Alright. Whether you heard it or not,

926
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:50,953
you violated the rules.
You must pay the fine.

927
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,712
Who are you?

928
00:35:53,592 --> 00:35:55,112
We're from the Yuehai Town government.

929
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:57,032
This is our town mayor, Ms. Li.

930
00:35:58,192 --> 00:35:59,112
Ms. Li.

931
00:35:59,473 --> 00:35:59,993
Hello.

932
00:36:00,152 --> 00:36:01,953
I-I won't do that again.

933
00:36:02,473 --> 00:36:04,112
Please let me off this once.

934
00:36:04,232 --> 00:36:04,873
No.

935
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,072
We must enforce the regulations.

936
00:36:07,473 --> 00:36:07,973
Well...

937
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:09,873
Just this once.

938
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:11,753
I'm Zheng...

939
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:15,913
Zheng Decheng's older brother.

940
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:17,632
- What?
- What?

941
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:21,232
Forget it.

942
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:27,112
Leaders, I didn't bring money.

943
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,592
Could you come back with me to get it?

944
00:36:29,793 --> 00:36:31,192
Don't play tricks.

945
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:32,232
No. I...

946
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,753
Look, I really didn't bring it.

947
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,032
See?

948
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,793
M-My home's up ahead. Very close.

949
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,953
Just follow me to get it.

950
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:41,572
Alright.

951
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:44,232
You walk ahead. We'll follow.

952
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:49,353
Got fined for dumping trash.

953
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:04,512
Well, Ms. Li.

954
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:07,433
How much is the fine?

955
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:09,072
Five yuan.

956
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:10,273
That much?

957
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:14,152
Can't you cut some?

958
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:16,232
No. Enforcement must be strict.

959
00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:20,152
Alright.

960
00:37:20,592 --> 00:37:21,273
I'll go get it.

961
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:28,313
Is this his home?

962
00:37:29,112 --> 00:37:29,712
You're back.

963
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:44,273
Give me five yuan.

964
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:47,473
What?

965
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:50,112
Go get five yuan.

966
00:38:13,913 --> 00:38:14,592
What's up, Dad?

967
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:28,712
Forget it. You don't need to pay.

968
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:32,632
But remember, no more littering.

969
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,232
Okay, I will.

970
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:39,913
Thank you, Ms. Li.

971
00:38:39,993 --> 00:38:40,953
Thank you so much!

972
00:38:42,192 --> 00:38:44,552
You are so kind.

973
00:38:45,112 --> 00:38:45,833
See?

974
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:47,672
- Let's go.
- I'm so lucky.

975
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:49,592
Always run into good people.

976
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:54,953
Give this to Mr. Tan.

977
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:57,192
I'll pay the fine for him.

978
00:38:57,592 --> 00:38:58,712
Didn't you spare the fine?

979
00:38:58,953 --> 00:38:59,873
It still must be paid.

980
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:01,473
Rules are rules.

981
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:02,212
Take it.

982
00:39:04,112 --> 00:39:05,512
Do we keep watching?

983
00:39:06,032 --> 00:39:08,473
No need. We've already made an example.

984
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,592
(Pitch in, keep it clean.)
Zheng Desheng.

985
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:19,032
(No public urination here.)
Littering. Got fined for five yuan,

986
00:39:19,512 --> 00:39:22,632
and is publicly criticized as a warning.

987
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:27,152
They really fined him?
Five yuan? That's a lot!

988
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,753
Exactly.

989
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:29,753
Who was so unlucky?

990
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:31,712
Build a civilized Yuehai.

991
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:32,753
Who is it?

992
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,328
They fined Mr. Zheng's older brother?

993
00:39:34,993 --> 00:39:37,793
What does it say up there?

994
00:39:38,072 --> 00:39:39,672
Zheng Desheng,
Secretary's older brother,

995
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:40,592
(Zheng Desheng: littering; Fine: 5 yuan)
got fined.

996
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,712
No urinating or defecating.

997
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:45,192
No painting on public building walls.

998
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,473
Desheng?

999
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,032
Violators will be fined.

1000
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:52,793
This new town mayor has no heart.
It's all business with her.

1001
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:54,232
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

1002
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:55,393
Don't take it to heart.

1003
00:39:56,072 --> 00:39:57,473
Right.

1004
00:39:57,672 --> 00:39:59,473
Desheng, don't take it to heart.

1005
00:39:59,632 --> 00:40:01,273
Maybe they got the name wrong.

1006
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:02,192
Exactly.

1007
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:05,273
Littering. Got fined for five yuan.

1008
00:40:05,273 --> 00:40:06,192
Don't take it to heart.

1009
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:09,072
And he is publicly criticized
as a warning.

1010
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:10,993
Stop littering on the ground.

1011
00:40:11,313 --> 00:40:12,112
Five yuan!

1012
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:13,953
I'll be more careful.

1013
00:40:14,072 --> 00:40:16,152
One, two! Yes!

1014
00:40:16,473 --> 00:40:18,793
One, two! Yes!

1015
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:23,672
One, two! Yes!

1016
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:26,032
One, two! Yes!

1017
00:40:26,313 --> 00:40:28,313
One, two! Yes!

1018
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:29,712
One, two.

1019
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,473
Why stop? Keep pulling!

1020
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:35,833
Zheng Desheng.

1021
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:38,993
Littering. Got fined for five-yuan,

1022
00:40:39,512 --> 00:40:42,672
and is publicly criticized as a warning.

1023
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:46,273
Hope you all start with yourselves.

1024
00:40:46,552 --> 00:40:48,552
Promote civility,
foster new social trends.

1025
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:52,032
Work together
to build a civilized Yuehai.

1026
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:55,592
Protecting the environment
is everyone's responsibility.

1027
00:40:56,273 --> 00:40:59,873
Posting or drawing on public buildings
is strictly prohibited.

1028
00:41:06,353 --> 00:41:06,993
Li Qiuping.

1029
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:09,032
Are you targeting me?

1030
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,393
What's up, Mr. Zheng?

1031
00:41:11,753 --> 00:41:14,072
I'm announcing
the violation of sanitation regulations.

1032
00:41:14,512 --> 00:41:15,224
They're arguing.

1033
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,072
Who?

1034
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,753
Ms. Li and Mr. Zheng.

1035
00:41:18,112 --> 00:41:18,632
Really?

1036
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:19,753
Do you know who you fined?

1037
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:21,433
It's my older brother!

1038
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:24,393
You broadcast it
and put up big-character posters!

1039
00:41:24,893 --> 00:41:26,552
Why not stick it on my face?

1040
00:41:28,273 --> 00:41:29,072
Your older brother?

1041
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,480
You wanted to improve sanitation.

1042
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:34,092
I had the entire town government
support you. Right?

1043
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:35,512
Our work was disrupted.

1044
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:37,632
You've made enough trouble!

1045
00:41:37,873 --> 00:41:39,112
What more do you want?

1046
00:41:39,672 --> 00:41:40,433
Mr. Zheng.

1047
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,512
Just the town government
to mind hygiene is not enough.

1048
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:45,753
This concerns every resident of Yuehai.

1049
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:47,993
That's why I established these rules.

1050
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,112
You can make rules.

1051
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,092
Dad.

1052
00:41:52,112 --> 00:41:52,873
Let me help you.

1053
00:41:53,112 --> 00:41:53,612
Go back!

1054
00:41:57,672 --> 00:41:58,273
Wait.

1055
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:00,032
Open that.

1056
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,913
Standing outside. Not embarrassing?

1057
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,993
Mr. Zheng, we must face this problem.

1058
00:42:10,512 --> 00:42:12,433
Sanitation is crucial
for Yuehai's development.

1059
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:15,112
Do you know
that because of bad sanitation,

1060
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:17,273
Monica's family withdrew investment?

1061
00:42:21,753 --> 00:42:23,712
Who knows
if she really intends to invest?

1062
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:25,313
Maybe she was lying!

1063
00:42:25,672 --> 00:42:26,793
How can you say...

1064
00:42:29,192 --> 00:42:29,873
What's up?

1065
00:42:30,672 --> 00:42:31,552
Mr. Zheng.

1066
00:42:32,393 --> 00:42:34,152
Your argument was broadcast live.

1067
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:43,672
It's a dual-track.

1068
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:54,293
