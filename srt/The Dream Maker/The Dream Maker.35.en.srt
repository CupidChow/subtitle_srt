I'm sorry.

What was that?

21
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:06,575
You said you were a bad guy?

22
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,336
You said you were wrong

23
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,855
and wanted to apologize to me?

24
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,656
You said you'd bow to me

I'm sorry, alright?

What's this?

We'll go to Guangzhou tomorrow.

41
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:03,415
Master.

42
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:07,175
I need to tell you something.

43
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:07,675
What is it?

44
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:12,536
I... I want to quit.

45
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,376
I want to open a theater.

46
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:17,056
You want to quit

47
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:18,816
and want to open a theater?

48
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:19,955
Yes.

49
00:03:20,056 --> 00:03:21,056
Have you lost your mind?

50
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:23,175
Theaters are closing rapidly nowadays.

51
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:25,735
Even state-owned ones can't keep going.

52
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:27,256
Why do you think you can run one?

53
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:28,256
With what?

54
00:03:34,656 --> 00:03:35,175
Master,

55
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,336
look how happy they are when they laugh.

56
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:39,295
I haven't planned that far.

57
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:40,695
Can laughter feed your family

58
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:42,096
or make money?

59
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:42,955
No.

60
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:44,175
It's non-negotiable.

61
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:45,735
But, Master.

62
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:46,776
Who am I to you?

63
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:50,096
You're my master.

64
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:52,455
I'm more like a father to you.

65
00:03:57,795 --> 00:03:58,976
Listen to me on this.

66
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:00,816
I'll never mislead you.

67
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:01,695
I know.

68
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:03,216
Pack tonight. Let's go to Guangzhou.

69
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,336
A theater? You got to be kidding me.

70
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:09,216
I think your master is wrong.

71
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:11,115
Lili?

72
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,056
When did you come?

73
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:14,795
Just now.

74
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:18,264
Running a theater is great.

75
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:20,855
Not working elsewhere

76
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:22,656
doesn't mean it won't work in Yuehai.

77
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,055
It might be tough to run a theater now,

78
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:27,875
but that doesn't mean
it always will be, right?

79
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,036
Right.

80
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:33,295
Since we spend

81
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:35,216
most of our lives working,

82
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,656
we should do something we love.

83
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:40,935
That makes life meaningful.

84
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:45,036
Exactly.

85
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:46,096
That's so true, Lili.

86
00:04:46,656 --> 00:04:48,536
I'll definitely talk to my master again.

87
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:49,815
Do whatever you want.

88
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:50,576

92
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:12,315
Yes, I am.

93
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:13,336
Please follow me.

94
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:14,696
Finally.

00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:32,136
Mr. Zheng might bring
some people over later.

107

Go check and receive them.

108
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:34,536

109

Go.

He used to be from Zhengjia Village.

116
00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:48,855
He does business
in the Nanzhou New District.

117
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:50,415
He heard Wang Lili is a great designer.

118
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:51,375
So he came for her.

119
00:05:51,415 --> 00:05:51,915
Yes.

120
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:52,776

00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:56,815
How long will we queue with this crowd?

124
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:57,976
May I cut in line?

125
00:05:58,336 --> 00:05:59,536
No. We don't cut in line.

126
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:02,055
We wait our turn. Give us a number.

127

Miss,

131
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:15,456
could I keep this number plate later?

132
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,896
If we sign the contract,
you can have it.

133
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:20,855
If not, it'll cost two yuan.

134
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:24,675
Ms. Wang,

135
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,096
the draft I showed you last time,

136
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,576
the one by a foreign designer,

137
00:06:28,896 --> 00:06:29,855
cost us a fortune.

138
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:30,808
But sales were poor.

139
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:32,776
Do you have any fresh ideas?

140
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:34,295

141
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:34,976
Yes.

We produce tissues

143
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:36,696

Okay.

147
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:40,576
Tell them.

148
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:43,216
The face cream packaging's color
is wrong. They must redo it.

149
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:44,935
- Okay.
- Alright, come with me, please.

150

Mr. Zheng.

151
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:01,656
Consumers will want
to collect all four designs.

152
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:03,696
This boosts their urge to buy tissues.

153
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,896
Stimulates consumption. Deal?

154
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:07,255

00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:28,184
Don't "ma'am" me.

192
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:34,135
We've been shouting for over an hour
with no customers.

193
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:35,535
Lower your voice.

194
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,735
The boss's right there.

195
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,176
Keep going.

196
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,375
Grand opening.

197
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,416
Grand opening: 20% off.

198
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,576
20% off on songs.

199
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:42,655
Spend 50 yuan

200
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,495
to sing with Sun Xiaoyan,
the Wonton Beauty.

201
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:46,296
Reasonably priced drinks.

202
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:47,735
(Grand Opening)
Come take a look.

203
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:50,255
Grand opening: 20% off on songs.

204
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:51,495
Spend 50 yuan

205
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,816
to sing with Sun Xiaoyan.

206
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:53,615
Grand opening.

207
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:54,456
20% off on songs.

208
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:55,696
Come take a look.

209
00:08:55,696 --> 00:08:57,336
Everyone, come on in and take a look.

210
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:11,655
Is everything ready?

211
00:09:11,655 --> 00:09:12,336
Yes.

212
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:13,096
Good.

213
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:32,255
Li,

214
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:35,855
I've made a major discovery
crucial to Yuehai's future development.

215
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:36,995
What is it?

216
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:39,936
Guess where I went today?

217
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,495
I went to see Wang Lili.

218
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:45,720
I took a friend
from my hometown to see her.

219
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:47,655
We ended up queuing for hours.

220
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:50,456
Then Wang Lili came up with an idea
in just five minutes.

221
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,056
My friend signed a contract
with her on the spot.

222
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,176
You're just realizing?

223
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:57,216
Wang Lili is quite famous now.

224
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,735
Many businesses
from out of town come for her.

225
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:02,576
I've been thinking lately

226
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:05,655
about how we can fully
harness her talents.

227
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:07,336
I've even written a proposal,

228
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,655
planning to present it for discussion
at next week's meeting.

229
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:11,535
Let's not wait.

230
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:14,255
Let's have a meeting now.

231
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:19,416
It might be a first.

232
00:10:19,655 --> 00:10:20,535
The place is good.

233
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,135
Not bad.

234
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:23,000
We have customers.

235
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:24,920
Boss, we have customers.

236
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:27,655
Welcome.

237
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,056
Welcome.

238
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:29,936
Ma'am,

239
00:10:29,936 --> 00:10:31,535
can we sing using this flyer here?

240
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:32,735
It says right here.

241
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:34,056
Yan Dance Hall's

242
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,056
grand opening special.

243
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,775
Free two songs with this flyer
within three days.

244
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:38,296
Really?

245
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:39,135
Will you deny it?

246
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,416
We won't.

247
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:44,696
This way.

248
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:46,056
Sixi, show them in.

249
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:47,216
This way.

250
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:47,855
This way.

251
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:49,035
- Welcome.
- Boss,

252
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:50,495
did we make flyers?

253
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:51,135
Come on in.

254
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,456
Forget that.
Focus on serving the customers.

255
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,135
Welcome.

256
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:57,216
Sit anywhere.

257
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:09,895
Welcome.

258
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:10,696
Ma'am,

259
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:13,015
we can sing for free with this, right?

260
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:14,855
Yes, please come in.

261
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,296
Show them in, Jia.

262
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:17,416
- Follow me.
- Welcome.

263
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,135
This way, please.

264
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,936
Over here. This way, please.

265
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:20,456
Sit anywhere.

266
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:21,535
Welcome. Welcome.

267
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:22,375
This way, please.

268
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:22,976
Come on, sit.

269
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:24,216
What do you want?

270
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:24,976
Let me know.

271
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:26,416
Okay, I'll get it for you shortly.

272
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:31,176
Sixi,

273
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:32,576
did you ask?

274
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:34,015
Where did these come from?

275
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:36,255
Yan, I asked around just now.

276
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,775
They said they got them
from the Super Dog Restaurant.

277
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,855
Do you think someone's messing with us?

278
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,056
Super Dog Restaurant?

279
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:47,495
Welcome.

280
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:49,816
Welcome.

281
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:54,416
We can sing for free
with this flyer today, right?

282
00:11:55,936 --> 00:11:57,296
Business is booming here.

283
00:11:57,576 --> 00:11:58,816
Not even one seat available?

284
00:11:59,015 --> 00:11:59,696
It's fine.

285
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,208
I'll make sure we get seats.

286
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:01,995
Let's go.

287
00:12:02,495 --> 00:12:03,255
We'll head over.

288
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:03,936
Okay.

289
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,255
Hello.

290
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:07,296
Hurry up. Come on.

291
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:08,576
- You came too?
- Let's have fun together.

292
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:09,296
Congratulations.

293
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:10,976
You've opened today.

294
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,296
Thank you.

295
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,416
The printing is excellent.

296
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:22,520
How many copies printed?

297
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:23,976
Not many. 100 copies.

298
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:25,735
100 copies.

299
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:28,952
Everyone gets to sing
two songs for free.

300
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:30,655
Each song costs three yuan.

301
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:33,375
100 copies would be 600 yuan.

302
00:12:41,216 --> 00:12:42,096
So far,

303
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:43,255
17 customers have come

304
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:44,416
and sung 18 songs.

305
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:47,375
However, they've ordered
27 bottles of soda,

306
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:49,096
30 bottles of beer,

307
00:12:49,255 --> 00:12:50,456
and various kinds of snacks.

308
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,015
Calculated this way,

309
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:54,135
even if I let 100 people sing for free,

310
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,456
I'd still make a profit.

311
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,176
You've got good business sense.

312
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:04,775
Although it was a misunderstanding
between you and Xie,

313
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,255
the incident did cause quite a stir.

314
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,416
Everyone thinks you offended me,

315
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,936
so they're hesitant
to patronize your business.

316
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:16,344
That's why I thought of printing flyers,

317
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,056
hoping it could help you out.

318
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:21,336
Xuemei.

319
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:24,895
Ms. Gao.

320
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:29,135
At the night school,
you taught us how to do business.

321
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:33,655
Today, you've given me
another vivid lesson in marketing.

322
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:35,655
By rights,

323
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:37,135
I should call you 'teacher.'

324
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:40,056
But even if you are my teacher,

325
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,296
you can't falsely accuse me
without reason.

326
00:13:50,936 --> 00:13:52,375
I'll cover these printing costs,

327
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:55,216
but I don't want your business.

328
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:59,456
I was considering
an annual membership here.

329
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:02,895
If you want to sing,

330
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,655
there are eight other karaoke bars
in Yuehai.

331
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:09,296
I'm sure they'd be delighted
to have you sign up.

332
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:10,576
Think carefully.

333
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:12,696
If you offend me,

334
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:14,816
you'll be offending half of Yuehai.

335
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:16,336
There's still the other half.

336
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,855
What if I insist on singing today?

337
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:32,895
Next up, let's welcome No. 19, Mr. Sun.

338
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:34,196
Bravo!

339
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:35,535
Excuse me.

340
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,416
Sorry.

341
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:40,015
Sorry to take up your time.

342
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:44,615
I see many familiar faces here today.

343
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,495
- Hello, Ms. Gao.
- Hello, Ms. Gao.

344
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:47,816
You're all here. Good.

345
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:54,135
As you all know,
I recently got divorced.

346
00:14:55,255 --> 00:14:56,015
Today,

347
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,336
I mainly came to say one thing
to Sun Xiaoyan:

348
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,495
I'm sorry.

349
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:03,976
I misunderstood you.

350
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:10,735
Good!

351
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,855
- Good!
- Good!

352
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,576
Pretty creative, right?

353
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:39,655
Why take it apart?

354
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:43,056
Grapes, fine wine, luminous cups.

355
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:44,696
It's simple.

356
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:46,155
Qingtian, have some walnuts.

357
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,255
Where did all these goodies come from?

358
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:53,015
Mr. Zheng and I brought these
back from Wang Lili's place.

359
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,176
It's the weekend,

360
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:57,416
and we'll have this 7:30 meeting.

361
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,255
So we thought we'd share
these treats with everyone.

362
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:02,655
You have no idea.

363
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,344
Now many big out-of-town investors

364
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,735
come to Wang Lili with their products,

365
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:08,895
asking her to create
innovative packaging designs.

366
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:12,416
There's a huge line
outside Wang Lili's company now.

367
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:13,816
She's amazing.

368
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,216
She's become
a signature brand for Yuehai.

369
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:18,735
Look at this hazelnut box she designed.

370
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:20,176
One half for hazelnuts.

371
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:21,535
The other, the shells.

372
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:23,976
That's very thoughtful
and creative, right?

373
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:25,135
This is good.

374
00:16:25,176 --> 00:16:26,255
I really like this.

375
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:28,456
I was about to say.

376
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:29,976
Yes, I was just about to say,

377
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:30,416
Lin,

378
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:31,535
don't litter shells.

379
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:32,336
Right?

380
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:35,056
It's like the newspaper holders
you used to fold for us.

381
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:35,495
Well,

382
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,895
the ones for peanut shells.

383
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:38,456
But hers is much prettier.

384
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,735
Yeah, better than yours.

385
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:40,336
Convenient.

386
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:41,015
It's thoughtful.

387
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:41,976
It got me thinking.

388
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:45,015
Besides printing,
Yuehai could develop a new industry.

389
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,255
An industry?

390
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:47,480
The gift industry.

391
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:49,615
Gifts can become an industry?

392
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:51,056
Of course.

393
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:52,816
Life was tough back then.

394
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:55,375
People just wanted
enough food and warm clothes.

395
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:58,255
Now, as life gets more prosperous,

396
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:01,255
our pursuits and preferences
are changing.

397
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:02,816
During holidays and festivals

398
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:07,055
or for openings, promotions, weddings,
and such, we need to give gifts, right?

399
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:10,775
We can gather all our products together,

400
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:12,696
categorize them by different occasions,

401
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:13,696
festivals,

402
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:14,535
and seasons,

403
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:16,856
and design and package them
into different gifts

404
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:19,015
to meet all kinds of gift-giving needs.

405
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:21,216
Doesn't that form a complete industry?

406
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:22,416
Yes, look.

407
00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:24,896
These are just ordinary peanuts
and sunflower seeds.

408
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:26,255
But once packaged,

409
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:27,976
people get the urge to buy them.

410
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:28,636
Right?

411
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:29,936
And the price is higher too.

412
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:31,735
Because packaging design has costs.

413
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:33,176
Look at this.

414
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,976
The tableware.

415
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:36,376
It's just ordinary tableware.

416
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:38,376
But once it's packaged nicely,

417
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:40,255
it can be given as a gift.

418
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:41,035
Right?

419
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:42,495
Look, it's great.

420
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:43,696
We can do it.

421
00:17:44,575 --> 00:17:45,075
Mr. Zheng,

422
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:45,795
Ms. Li,

423
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,495
let's help Wang Lili
get this industry going.

424
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:50,856
She also has a capable partner.

425
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,095
Now, she just needs a bigger space.

426
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:56,255
Wang Lili only has a design studio now.

427
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,255
It's not enough.

428
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:58,235
Well then,

429
00:17:58,616 --> 00:17:59,495
tomorrow, Ms. Li,

430
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:01,075
you go and talk with Wang Lili.

431
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,376
See what ideas she has.

432
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,616
We'll meet her needs as much as we can.

433
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:05,476
Okay.

434
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:08,136
I think Wang Lili is indeed a talent.

435
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,255
And this industry

436
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,575
sounds very promising.

437
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:13,856
So I have a suggestion.

438
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:17,015
How about we don't just
offer political support?

439
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:20,015
This time, the town
should invest real money in it.

440
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:20,555
Alright?

441
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:22,335
That's so you.

442
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:22,995
Tan,

443
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:23,976
I think that's so you.

444
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:24,956
Tan,

445
00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:26,656
this money won't be wasted.

446
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:28,656
I believe the gift industry here

447
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:31,055
will be a pioneer in our country

448
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:32,856
and bring huge returns.

449
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:36,255
So Wang Lili will be our secret weapon.

450
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:37,035
Yes.

451
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:39,335
Now, just walking isn't enough.

452
00:18:39,815 --> 00:18:40,696
We've got to run.

453
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,376
Even walking will get us left behind.

454
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:43,176
Yes.

455
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,095
Yuehai speed.

456
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,775
Look at how many trends
have emerged in the past.

457
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:47,636
Right?

458
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:50,856
Dacron shirts and bell-bottoms.

459
00:18:51,136 --> 00:18:52,656
Who watches black-and-white TVs now?

460
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,575
The Sixteen Steps, right?

461
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:55,136
Mr. Xie,

462
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,735
what's the Sixteen Steps?

463
00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:58,815
How do you hear everything?

464
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:00,216
Focus on the game.

465
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:02,616
You're too young.

466
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:03,815
You wouldn't know.

467
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,055
- Just a dance.
- Sixteen Steps...

468
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,696
Back then, we were addicted to it.

469
00:19:07,055 --> 00:19:08,136
I could dance all night.

470
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:10,015
I was the dance king of our village.

471
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:11,416
Michael Jackson Xie.

472
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:14,416
Haven't shown it off yet.
Never seen you dance.

473
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,136
Your hairstyle
is copying his too, right?

474
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:17,075
Yes.

475
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:18,936
But let me tell you.

476
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:20,136
In dancing,

477
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:21,896
you might not be able to beat Ms. Li.

478
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:23,575
Ms. Li is a great dancer.

479
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,416
Why don't you two have a dance-off?

480
00:19:26,535 --> 00:19:27,335
Li is shy.

481
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,136
Come on, compete.

482
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:29,815
You two compete.

483
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:31,136
Have a contest.

484
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:31,735
Come on.

485
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:32,495
Mr. Xie, compete.

486
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:33,416
Come on.

487
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,335
Come on.

488
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:35,095
Have a match.

489
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:36,335
He removes the jacket.

490
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:02,815
So happy.

Mr. Zheng.

Xiaohai,

539
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:33,295
you're here.

540
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:35,616
Mr. Zheng, I believe
I wasn't clear last time.

541
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,856
This time, I drew a diagram.

542
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,575
Let me explain it.

543
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:41,916
Look.

544
00:22:42,055 --> 00:22:42,815
This is the screen.

545
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:45,535
I know. I know you want
to open a movie theater.

546
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,755
I think this is a great idea.

547
00:22:49,896 --> 00:22:50,575
I support it.

548
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:52,936
Didn't Ms. Li say so as well?

549
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:55,176
Yuehai must focus
on spiritual civilization.

550
00:22:55,356 --> 00:22:55,856
Yes.

551
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:58,136
We must enhance
people's leisure and entertainment.

552
00:22:58,656 --> 00:22:59,735
So we built the library.

553
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,495
The playground is nearly done.

554
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:02,535
You know, right?

555
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:04,976
If we have the conditions
to open a theater,

556
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:06,535
I fully support it.

557
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:07,976
That's great.

558
00:23:08,335 --> 00:23:09,295
But we don't.

559
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:13,255
Mr. Zheng,

560
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:15,815
opening a theater
isn't as complicated as you think.

561
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:17,535
Look, it's actually not that...

562
00:23:17,535 --> 00:23:18,176
Listen, Xiaohai.

563
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,616
I know your ideas.

564
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:24,976
I'll keep this draft here, alright?

565
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:27,535
When Ms. Li comes back,
I'll discuss it with her.

566
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:30,595
Let's see if it's possible, okay?

567
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:31,335
Actually,

568
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:32,696
(Chats under 5 minutes)
it's possible. I...

569
00:23:33,696 --> 00:23:36,456
Mr. Zheng, you must stand up for me.

570
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:37,335
What's wrong?

571
00:23:37,335 --> 00:23:39,896
My two unfilial sons
want to kick me out of the house.

572
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,295
Okay. Please sit down.

573
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,416
Take your time. No rush.
I'll get you some water.

574
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:45,775
I'm not even dead yet.

575
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:49,376
The two of them have come
to fight over my house.

576
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:51,535
They even threw my things out.

577
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,376
What am I supposed to do?

578
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:14,055
Mr. Xie.

579
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:18,535
That's settled then,

580
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:19,416
Mr. Zhang.

581
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:21,136
Don't thank me.

582
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:22,856
I just think of you
when I have good news.

583
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:23,960
I'll let him go over.

584
00:24:24,616 --> 00:24:25,456
Okay. Thank you.

585
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:27,095
Thank you so much.

586
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:27,936
Don't cut in line.

587
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:29,055
You're leaving Yuehai,

588
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:31,775
but you should still contribute
to Yuehai in the future.

589
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:32,775
Come back often.

590
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:33,575
I will.

591
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:34,376
Develop well.

592
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:35,255
Thank you. I'm off.

593
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:36,416
Okay.

594
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:37,116
Goodbye.

595
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:37,676
Good luck.

596
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,176
Okay.

597
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,136
Come back often.

598
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:39,676
Okay.

599
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,815
Another one leaving?

600
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,456
The salt field is expanding production.

601
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,055
We really have no space.

602
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:48,535
I worry about the land issue every day.

603
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:49,696
What should we do?

604
00:24:51,136 --> 00:24:51,936
Mr. Zheng.

605
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:54,696
Why are you back?

606
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:55,555
Yes.

607
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:56,936
There's no one else?

608
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:57,880
I'm the last one.

609
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:02,616
What, Mr. Zheng?

610
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:04,696
I'm here to talk
about the theater again.

611
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:11,255
(Looks familiar. Wang Lili.)
Looks familiar. Wang...

612
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:27,575
Xiaohai,

613
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:30,936
tell me the truth.

614
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,636
Alright?

615
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:35,136
Is it really because of the theater?

616
00:25:35,456 --> 00:25:35,956
Yeah.

617
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:37,896
I really came here about the theater.

618
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:41,616
You really, really came
about the theater?

619
00:25:42,015 --> 00:25:42,735
Nothing else?

620
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:43,815
There's nothing else.

621
00:25:45,376 --> 00:25:46,896
What's wrong? Something happened?

622
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:49,235
Nothing.

623
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:50,716
Nothing.

624
00:25:50,936 --> 00:25:52,616
I was just asking.

625
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:55,775
Why are you laughing?

626
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:56,815
Nothing better to do?

627
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:57,495
Just go.

628
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:58,815
Who's laughing?

629
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,775
Here. I have things to do.

630
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:03,676
Stamp it.

631
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,535
Xiaohai,

632
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:10,575
didn't I tell you
there are no conditions for that?

633
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,136
No conditions for opening a theater.

634
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,976
Let me be straight with you.

635
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:21,495
When I said 'no conditions,' I meant

636
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,295
there's no space.

637
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:26,575
Mr. Zheng...

638
00:26:26,575 --> 00:26:29,735
I can't just give you one room
and tell you to open a theater.

639
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:30,555
Right?

640
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,696
Mr. Zheng, there is a place.

641
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:33,295
I was just about to tell you,

642
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:35,255
but then that old lady came in
and I left.

643
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:38,015
Isn't there a towel factory
on Fuyu Road?

644
00:26:38,136 --> 00:26:39,015
They're relocating.

645
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:40,095
I went there.

646
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:42,095
Their small auditorium
is actually a good size.

647
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:43,616
We wouldn't need to rebuild it.

648
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,775
A little renovation, and it's ready.

649
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:48,416
I know about that place.

650
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:49,856
The paperwork came through me.

651
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:51,095
Moving this month.

652
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:51,856
Right?

653
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:52,356
Yes.

654
00:26:52,575 --> 00:26:53,495
That sounds perfect.

655
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:56,495
Sometimes, things just depend on timing.

656
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:57,255
Okay.

657
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:58,055
That place is yours.

658
00:26:58,255 --> 00:26:58,755
Okay?

659
00:26:58,856 --> 00:26:59,356
Really?

660
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:00,216
It's settled.

661
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:01,976
Okay, settled.

662
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:02,735
Lucky you.

663
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:03,676
Work hard.

664
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:05,304
The wait paid off.

665
00:27:05,815 --> 00:27:06,976
Okay, thank you, Mr. Zheng.

666
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:07,735
No problem.

667
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,015
I'm off now.

668
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:09,595
Alright.

669
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:10,676
Okay.

670
00:27:11,535 --> 00:27:12,095
Thank you.

671
00:27:12,095 --> 00:27:12,595
No problem.

672
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:13,356
Keep it up.

673
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:14,555
I will.

674
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:25,136
Mr. Zheng.

675
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:27,055
I've agreed on a plan with Lili.

676
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,876
Really? What did you agree on?

677
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,335
We plan to build a gift city.

678
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,024
The top floor will be her studio.

679
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:34,015
The ground floor
will sell her own products.

680
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:35,095
That sounds great.

681
00:27:35,495 --> 00:27:36,255
What's the place?

682
00:27:38,495 --> 00:27:39,136
Xiaohai.

683
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:40,495
Xiaohai.

684
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:41,656
Come here.

685
00:27:45,255 --> 00:27:46,015
What, Mr. Zheng?

686
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,095
Xiaohai, here's the thing.

687
00:27:48,295 --> 00:27:51,255
Could you hold off
on building the theater for a bit?

688
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,696
I want to give that towel factory space
to Lili for her gift boutique.

689
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:57,095
Lili will open a boutique?

690
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:58,616
When did she say it?

691
00:27:58,936 --> 00:28:00,535
Last month? Or last week?

692
00:28:01,335 --> 00:28:02,495
Xiaohai, don't get upset yet.

693
00:28:02,856 --> 00:28:04,295
I know you've been here often.

694
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:06,735
But it's not really
about who came first.

695
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:08,295
That's not what I meant.

696
00:28:08,696 --> 00:28:11,255
If Lili wants that place,
I certainly have no objection.

697
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,216
It's just...

698
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:14,755
It's just...

699
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:15,775
Just what?

700
00:28:16,255 --> 00:28:17,456
A district chief from Nanzhou

701
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:19,815
shows up every day lately.

702
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:22,176
I feel like he might be courting Lili.

703
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:24,735
He proposed a move to Nanzhou
for her career.

704
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:28,856
Who's this?

705
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:31,495
He's Mr. Ye,
Chief of Nanzhou New District.

706
00:28:31,936 --> 00:28:33,696
A talent poaching expert.

707
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:36,616
Wang Lili's become impressive.

708
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,168
You're here again.

709
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,116
Here.

710
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,136
Okay, thank you.

711
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:43,255
To go to Nanzhou?

712
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:45,304
A district chief?

713
00:28:47,055 --> 00:28:48,815
He's not trying to poach her, is he?

714
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:50,495
To poach her?

715
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:55,656
I met this Mr. Ye at Lili's company.

716
00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:58,255
I heard he's trying
to recruit talent everywhere.

717
00:28:58,616 --> 00:28:59,575
No way?

718
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:01,335
I just talked with Lili.

719
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:03,055
She showed no sign of that.

720
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:05,696
Aren't you being too sensitive?

721
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:08,896
Anyway, if Lili wants that place,

722
00:29:09,575 --> 00:29:10,616
she can have it.

723
00:29:17,616 --> 00:29:18,116
Tan.

724
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:19,535
Tan, come here.

725
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:21,136
Come take a look.

726
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:21,775
What is it?

727
00:29:21,775 --> 00:29:24,216
The photo and the description.
Is this your wife?

728
00:29:26,095 --> 00:29:27,136
The age doesn't match.

729
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:28,055
It's not her.

730
00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:29,295
The age might be incorrect.

731
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:30,495
It really isn't her.

732
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:31,976
Thank you.

733
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:34,176
But there's really no need
to worry about this for me.

734
00:29:34,255 --> 00:29:35,255
I'm used to it by now.

735
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:38,015
And no news is better than bad news.

736
00:29:38,976 --> 00:29:39,476
Really.

737
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:40,295
Thank you.

738
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:45,416
Sir, I'm the secretary
of Mayor Zhao of Nanzhou.

739
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:46,575
Excuse me. I'm here to...

740
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,376
Mr. Xiang.

741
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,176
What a surprise!

742
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:52,136
Are you here

743
00:29:52,136 --> 00:29:53,335
to inspect our little place?

744
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:54,095
Mr. Zheng,

745
00:29:54,255 --> 00:29:55,055
you're joking.

746
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,815
Mr. Zhao invites you to meet
at Super Dog Restaurant.

747
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,055
Mr. Zhao is here?

748
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:00,055
That's great.

749
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:01,295
Let's go right now.

750
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:04,936
Mr. Zhao also said
Ms. Li must come along too.

751
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:08,035
Okay.

752
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:09,035
No problem.

753
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:12,696
(Super Dog Restaurant)

754
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:22,235
Come in.

755
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:24,795
Sir,

756
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:25,856
they're here.

757
00:30:32,136 --> 00:30:32,735
Mr. Zhao.

758
00:30:33,176 --> 00:30:33,735
Sir.

759
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:35,255
I've missed you.

760
00:30:35,356 --> 00:30:36,095
- Sir.
- Hello.

761
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:37,255
I haven't seen you in ages.

762
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:37,775
Yes.

763
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,136
You've put on weight.

764
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:39,636
I have?

765
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:40,575
More white hair too.

766
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:42,335
Yes, it's the work pressure.

767
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,656
Let me introduce you.

768
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:48,035
This is Ye Hongyu, District Chief
of Lishan District, Nanzhou.

769
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,376
He's the Mr. Ye I told you about.

770
00:30:50,376 --> 00:30:50,976
Decheng,

771
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:51,976
the secretary.

772
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:52,575
And the mayor.

773
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:53,976
Hello.

774
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:54,636
We've met.

775
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:55,735
Yes, that's right.

776
00:30:55,936 --> 00:30:57,495
Mr. Ye, I'm Li Qiuping.

777
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:58,376
- Hello.
- Hello.

778
00:30:59,255 --> 00:30:59,896
Come on.

779
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:00,436
Have a seat.

780
00:31:00,535 --> 00:31:01,255
Have a seat.

781
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:06,416
I've long heard that Yuehai

782
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:08,535
has a very authentic
Hong Kong-style tea restaurant.

783
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:11,815
But nobody invited me.

784
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:14,015
Sir, don't say that.

785
00:31:14,335 --> 00:31:15,616
You're the city mayor now,

786
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:16,416
a big leader.

787
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,616
It's hard to get you to come.

788
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:19,095
Yes, you're too busy.

789
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:19,696
Exactly.

790
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:20,416
Nonsense.

791
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,616
Neither of you has ever called to ask me

792
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:23,616
to come eat here.

793
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:24,956
That's not true. We did call.

794
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:25,755
Yes.

795
00:31:25,775 --> 00:31:26,575
They stopped it.

796
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:28,255
Didn't get through. Definitely.

797
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:29,456
Stop making it up, you two.

798
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:32,504
It's the weekends today.
I came myself to try it.

799
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,815
All these years,
we've never drunk together.

800
00:31:35,856 --> 00:31:36,356
Right?

801
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:36,896
Yes.

802
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:37,815
A hometown specialty.

803
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:39,535
I brought it for you.

804
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:40,696
Come on, fill it up.

805
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:41,976
- I'll do it.
- Let me.

806
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:43,535
I'll do it.

807
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:44,616
You're such a big leader.

808
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:45,856
Thank you, Mr. Ye.

809
00:31:46,335 --> 00:31:46,835
Thank you.

810
00:31:46,976 --> 00:31:47,476
Thank you.

811
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:48,136
Let me try.

812
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:48,696
I'll do it.

813
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:49,095
I'm fine.

814
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:49,856
I'll do it.

815
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:51,896
Yuehai has changed
and developed so much.

816
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:54,176
You both have put in a lot of effort

817
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:55,176
and sacrificed much.

818
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:56,416
Very good.

819
00:31:56,896 --> 00:31:57,396
Very good.

820
00:31:57,656 --> 00:31:58,176
Mr. Zhao.

821
00:31:58,696 --> 00:32:01,295
It's been several years
since you last visited Yuehai.

822
00:32:01,696 --> 00:32:02,416
You came this time

823
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:05,535
not just to bring us good wine, right?

824
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:08,495
Good wine pairs with good policies.

825
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:11,815
Mr. Zhao must have brought
some good policies for Yuehai.

826
00:32:12,295 --> 00:32:12,815
Right.

827
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:13,616
We toast to you.

828
00:32:13,616 --> 00:32:15,775
Can't I come to Yuehai
without bringing good policies?

829
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,136
You were our leader.

830
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:17,676
We...

831
00:32:17,696 --> 00:32:18,196
Right.

832
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:19,616
We couldn't be more welcoming.

833
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:24,856
You still see me that way?

834
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:27,015
You'll always be our leader.

835
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:27,976
For life.

836
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:29,896
Thank you.

837
00:32:29,896 --> 00:32:31,735
Since you still recognize me
as your leader,

838
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,495
I'll presume on my seniority once.

839
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:35,295
The thing is, I came today

840
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,495
to ask a favor of you.

841
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:40,255
Go ahead.

842
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:42,936
The two of you have achieved

843
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,335
such remarkable success
in developing Yuehai.

844
00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:47,976
You've nurtured talents like Wang Lili.

845
00:32:48,376 --> 00:32:49,255
Look at her.

846
00:32:49,775 --> 00:32:50,936
She's gained

847
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:53,856
quite a reputation
in our province, even nationally.

848
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:57,055
Moreover, Mr. Ye came
for an investigation before.

849
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:02,015
We want to recruit Wang Lili to Nanzhou.

850
00:33:09,896 --> 00:33:10,575
Sir,

851
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:12,376
in principle,

852
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:13,656
once you ask,

853
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:16,015
we should be able to discuss it.

854
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:19,575
But regarding Wang Lili,

855
00:33:21,176 --> 00:33:21,856
we must refuse.

856
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:27,936
Li,

857
00:33:28,535 --> 00:33:30,976
isn't that statement a bit too absolute?

858
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:34,055
When you entrusted Yuehai to us,

859
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:35,775
you told us

860
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,815
you would fully
support Yuehai's development.

861
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:41,856
Even after you were transferred
to Nanzhou,

862
00:33:42,575 --> 00:33:44,136
you specifically called me,

863
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:47,936
saying even after leaving,
you would still care about us

864
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:48,815
and support us.

865
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:50,656
But now you come,

866
00:33:51,055 --> 00:33:52,815
and you're undermining us?

867
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:00,376
Li, look,

868
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:02,416
from what you just said,

869
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:04,936
are you saying losing Wang Lili

870
00:34:05,495 --> 00:34:06,976
means Yuehai's development is doomed?

871
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,296
Of course not.

872
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:10,896
I just don't understand

873
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:13,175
why a big city like Nanzhou

874
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:16,695
needs to steal talent
from our small Yuehai.

875
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:25,515
Li,

876
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:27,055
mind your attitude.

877
00:34:27,296 --> 00:34:29,655
That's not how you speak
to our former leader.

878
00:34:30,552 --> 00:34:31,336
A penalty toast.

879
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:31,836
Right.

880
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:32,600
A penalty toast.

881
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,195
Sir,

882
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:35,856
please don't take
what I said earlier to heart.

883
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:38,175
I'm just someone
who speaks my mind directly.

884
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,095
I'll drink.

885
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:40,296
I'll join you.

886
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:41,456
I'll join you.

887
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:42,535
Here.

888
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:48,416
Take it easy.

889
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:54,456
Mr. Zhao,

890
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:58,376
although Li's tone was inappropriate,

891
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:02,976
she spoke what's in my heart.

892
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:05,936
There might be some things
you don't know.

893
00:35:06,296 --> 00:35:07,736
Wang Lili could start from scratch

894
00:35:08,256 --> 00:35:11,456
largely because
Ms. Li discovered and nurtured her.

895
00:35:12,055 --> 00:35:12,555
We can say

896
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:15,695
that without Ms. Li, there wouldn't be
Wang Lili's success today.

897
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:17,416
Now you come today

898
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:20,736
and plan to take her away
with just a few words?

899
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:24,535
No one could accept that.

900
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:25,995
Right?

901
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:28,655
I understand how you feel.

902
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:31,376
But for this era to progress,

903
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:33,936
you have to allow talent to flow.

904
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:37,080
Just like you and Li
were talents I discovered back then.

905
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:40,736
But I never demanded
you stay attached to me.

906
00:35:41,736 --> 00:35:42,495
- Yes.
- That's true.

907
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:42,816
Right.

908
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:43,316
Indeed.

909
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:45,936
Whether Wang Lili stays in Yuehai

910
00:35:46,736 --> 00:35:47,575
or goes to Nanzhou,

911
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:50,736
she's contributing
to the nation's development.

912
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:52,615
Yes. You're right.

913
00:35:52,695 --> 00:35:55,575
Then as leaders,
you should be more magnanimous.

914
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:58,615
I've made myself very clear, haven't I?

915
00:35:58,976 --> 00:35:59,495
Very clear.

916
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:00,615
A good point.

917
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:03,175
Alright then. Let's eat.

918
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:05,615
Sir,

919
00:36:06,095 --> 00:36:07,296
I offer this toast to you.

920
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:10,816
I want to thank you
for recognizing my worth.

921
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,655
I'll join you.

922
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:14,816
I'll join you.

923
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:31,655
But I still can't reach
your level of magnanimity.

924
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:34,456
I'm not as big-hearted as you.

925
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:44,356
I...

926
00:36:46,055 --> 00:36:48,736
About you insisting
on taking Wang Lili away,

927
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:52,896
I truly can't understand it.

928
00:36:58,055 --> 00:37:00,575
You know, people have hearts of flesh.

929
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:04,535
How could you make us this sad?

930
00:37:07,736 --> 00:37:12,215
You can't just forget about Yuehai
as you're in Nanzhou now, can you?

931
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:14,535
He won't.

932
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:25,456
Alright.

933
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,776
Stop putting Mr. Zhao
in a difficult position.

934
00:37:28,976 --> 00:37:30,936
It's hard to choose.

935
00:37:31,256 --> 00:37:32,695
Yuehai is part of Nanzhou after all.

936
00:37:33,055 --> 00:37:34,575
How could he possibly forget Yuehai?

937
00:37:36,015 --> 00:37:36,515
See?

938
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:38,495
As Mr. Ye just said,

939
00:37:38,976 --> 00:37:40,535
Yuehai is part of Nanzhou.

940
00:37:40,896 --> 00:37:43,976
So just let Wang Lili stay in Yuehai.

941
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:47,936
Let her maximize her talents
right here in Yuehai.

942
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:50,695
Yuehai's pride is Nanzhou's glory.

943
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:51,555
Right?

944
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:53,055
Zheng Decheng, stop talking.

945
00:37:55,135 --> 00:37:56,456
And you too, Li.

946
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:03,032
Ever since you started working
with Zheng Decheng,

947
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,856
how come you've picked up
all his bad habits?

948
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:06,135
Look at the two of you.

949
00:38:06,456 --> 00:38:08,015
Back and forth.

950
00:38:08,256 --> 00:38:09,575
Tears on demand.

951
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:11,456
Such perfect teamwork.

952
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:12,695
Not at all.

953
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:16,655
But is Yuehai the same
as Nanzhou right now?

954
00:38:17,175 --> 00:38:19,256
Can you send her abroad
for exchange studies?

955
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:21,976
Can you promote her creativity
nationwide?

956
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:24,296
For IP protection,

957
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:26,655
Nanzhou Patent Office has already agreed

958
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,776
to open a special channel for Wang Lili

959
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,336
to let her turn her ideas

960
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:32,615
or designs into patents

961
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,575
in the shortest time possible.

962
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:36,296
Can you do that now?

963
00:38:39,376 --> 00:38:40,015
Mr. Zhao,

964
00:38:40,936 --> 00:38:42,615
we truly can't do that at the moment.

965
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:45,296
But that doesn't mean
we can't do it in the future.

966
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:48,856
If you insist
on taking Wang Lili away...

967
00:38:50,256 --> 00:38:50,816
Mr. Zheng,

968
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,535
I'm resigning.

969
00:38:52,575 --> 00:38:53,336
I can't do it.

970
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,175
I can't do my job anymore.

971
00:38:56,135 --> 00:38:58,816
You... You...
How can you just resign like that?

972
00:38:58,936 --> 00:38:59,976
Well, if you resign,

973
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:01,135
I can't do it.

974
00:39:01,135 --> 00:39:02,336
Mr. Zhao, I'll resign too.

975
00:39:02,615 --> 00:39:04,256
What are you two doing?

976
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:05,535
We really can't do it.

977
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:07,095
Resigning together to go home?

978
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:10,736
You've got me speechless.

979
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:14,256
Ye,

980
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:16,376
wasn't the trip worth it?

981
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:18,776
You really need to learn from them.

982
00:39:19,015 --> 00:39:21,456
All this is drawn
from hands-on experience.

983
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:22,456
The essence.

984
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:24,936
But once you've learned it,
don't ever use it on me.

985
00:39:33,695 --> 00:39:34,336
Fine.

986
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:37,055
I'm not an unreasonable person.

987
00:39:37,535 --> 00:39:40,055
We'll let Wang Lili decide on this.

988
00:39:40,936 --> 00:39:41,436
Alright?

989
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:44,615
If Wang Lili
is willing to stay in Yuehai,

990
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:45,896
I won't say a thing.

991
00:39:46,495 --> 00:39:47,416
I won't pressure her.

992
00:39:47,896 --> 00:39:48,816
If she decides

993
00:39:48,976 --> 00:39:49,695
to leave,

994
00:39:50,336 --> 00:39:51,936
you two must let her go.

995
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:54,236
Well...

996
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:54,856
Okay, okay.

997
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:55,476
A leader

998
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:56,615
is always a leader.

999
00:39:56,736 --> 00:39:57,236
Right.

1000
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:58,416
- Magnanimous.
- Let's eat.

1001
00:39:58,456 --> 00:39:59,376
Just stop talking.

1002
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:01,256
The food hasn't been touched at all.

1003
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:01,936
Let me help.

1004
00:40:01,936 --> 00:40:02,896
Here, sir, have some.

1005
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:04,055
And you.

1006
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:05,736
Fish head for you. You're the leader.

1007
00:40:06,015 --> 00:40:07,135
Here. Fish head.

1008
00:40:07,456 --> 00:40:08,175
Tail for you too.

1009
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:09,495
From head to tail.

1010
00:40:09,695 --> 00:40:10,896
A leader sees things through.

1011
00:40:11,135 --> 00:40:11,635
Right?

1012
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:12,555
Look at you.

1013
00:40:12,695 --> 00:40:13,816
You have a silver tongue.

1014
00:40:14,816 --> 00:40:15,316
Come on.

1015
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:17,256
Let's not waste the fine Yuehai food.

1016
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:18,476
Let's eat.

1017
00:40:20,055 --> 00:40:20,655
Sir,

1018
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:25,095
since you've decided to support Yuehai,
let me toast you again.

1019
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:27,655
About that intellectual property matter
you mentioned,

1020
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:30,376
could you also
open a special channel for us?

1021
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,135
Aren't you pushing your luck a bit?

1022
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:36,555
Li.

1023
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:37,776
Indeed.

1024
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:39,535
You are overstepping.

1025
00:40:39,856 --> 00:40:41,376
Mr. Zhao, why don't we give it a try?

1026
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:43,015
Well,

1027
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:44,635
we won't know unless we try, right?

1028
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:45,976
That's too much for you.

1029
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:46,615
It's too much.

1030
00:40:48,495 --> 00:40:48,995
Here.

1031
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:50,736
You two drink up first.

1032
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:51,995
Alright.

1033
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:52,976
Let's finish ours.

1034
00:40:58,896 --> 00:40:59,575
How about this?

1035
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:01,936
I'll have three, and you have one.

1036
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:02,936
We'll toast you.

1037
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:03,675
Alright?

1038
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:07,296
I should transfer both of you
to the troupe.

1039
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:08,515
Come on.

1040
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:10,175
Well, Ms. Li can do that.

1041
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:11,816
She's pretty. I'm not.

1042
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:16,376
I'll write it as you said?

1043
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:24,776
You write it.

1044
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:26,856
You know Wang Lili better.

1045
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,796
Alright?

1046
00:41:28,575 --> 00:41:29,075
Okay.

1047
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:44,916
Mr. Zheng,

1048
00:41:45,175 --> 00:41:45,675
stamp it.

1049
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:47,615
You've written nothing.

1050
00:41:48,135 --> 00:41:49,416
Let Wang Lili write it herself.

1051
00:41:49,736 --> 00:41:50,976
If it's within our power,

1052
00:41:51,336 --> 00:41:53,816
we'll agree
to whatever conditions she asks for.

1053
00:41:56,175 --> 00:41:57,015
Whatever she wants?

1054
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:59,095
That's our sincerity.

1055
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:06,776
Still working?

1056
00:42:10,856 --> 00:42:11,456
Well,

1057
00:42:11,575 --> 00:42:13,976
can we really keep
a talent like Wang Lili?

1058
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:14,876
Don't worry.

1059
00:42:15,695 --> 00:42:16,575
She won't go anywhere.

1060
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:19,896
Get some rest.

1061
00:42:42,816 --> 00:42:43,456
Ms. Li.

1062
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:44,896
Li.

1063
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:49,256
How is it?

1064
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,376
What conditions did Wang Lili ask for?

1065
00:42:53,976 --> 00:42:56,495
I was planning to sign the contract
with Yang Xiaohai tomorrow.

1066
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,175
What?

1067
00:42:59,456 --> 00:43:01,736
Wang Lili has decided to go to Nanzhou.
