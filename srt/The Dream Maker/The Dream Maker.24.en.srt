Yes, aged liquor.

00:02:59,538 --> 00:03:00,038
Let's begin.

67
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:03,259
Well, the contracts in everyone's hands

68
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,459
are exactly the same as the sample
in Xuemei's hands.

69
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:07,818
We've reviewed it.

70
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:09,058
Yes, we have.

71
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:10,199
Good.

72
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:11,378
Let's go straight into it.

73
00:03:14,179 --> 00:03:15,739
We'll definitely build public toilets.

74
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:17,938
At most, we can only build three.

75
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,259
How can three be enough?

76
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:20,778
Yes.

77

Ten people are
building nine modern factories.

78
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,218
On average,
each factory employs 300 people.

79
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:26,979
One public toilet per 300 people.

80
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,098
That's not excessive.

81
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:28,699
True.

82
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,899

to waste valuable production time

- Yes.
- Yes.

Wait, Ms. Gao.

86
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,259
Why should we build toilets
for your workers?

87
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,859
We build toilets on municipal roads.

88
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:38,359
True.

89
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:40,739
I think we must build a guesthouse.

90
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,019
- Right?
- Yes.

91
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,419
You mean
the government builds the guesthouse

92
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,199
- and gets the profits?
- Yes.

93
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,058
Yes and no. No, not exactly.

94
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,498
We can negotiate this.

95
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:50,938
Yes, that's negotiable.

96
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,419
Don't forget.

97
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:52,938
Take note.

98
00:03:52,938 --> 00:03:54,859
- What?
- We also need a freight station, right?

99
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,699
Yes.

100
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,778
Freight station.

101
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,019
That's not a problem.

102
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:00,239
But the cost will be borne by you.

103
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:01,259
Forget the toilet.

104
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:02,259
Come on.

105
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:04,299
Help us widen the road a bit too.

106
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:05,498
We can't do it arbitrarily.

107
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:06,538
Look, how much

108
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,259
will it cost to widen it by one meter?

114

has borrowed several million
to build the industrial park.

115
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,379
We should work on it together.

116
00:04:22,778 --> 00:04:25,199
How can you expect us
to shoulder everything?

117
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:27,459
We can communicate about this.

118
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,178
It's negotiable.

119

Mr. Tan.

120
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,218
I've said it before.

121
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,699
We have good officials.

122
00:04:36,178 --> 00:04:36,678
Alright.

123

to the terms,

- Good.

Why?

135
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:52,978
I'll sign it first.

right?

171
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:15,459
Did you buy these cakes
with your own money?

172
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:17,939
Don't be silly.
They gave these cakes to me.

173
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,778
They said I handled the issue well.

174
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:20,778
There is one less.

175
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:22,218
Right here.

176
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:22,858
Bring it over.

177
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:23,899
Guess what?

Good.

181
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,178
They said I deserved cake
since I handled it so well.

182
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,899
I said I couldn't eat it alone
and would share the cake with others.

183
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:39,119
Take this.

184
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:41,459
Resolving disputes is your specialty.

185
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:43,999
It's a piece of cake for me.

186
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:45,178
I just resolved it

Don't waste food.

00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:55,899
You eat too.

193
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,259
It's fine, really.

194
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:58,259
What's wrong?

195
00:06:58,939 --> 00:06:59,439
What?

196
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:00,858
What happened?

197
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:01,459
Nothing.

198
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,379
If you didn't decide for yourself,
you wouldn't be Gao Xuemei.

199
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:15,418
Don't you think so?

200
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:17,059
It's fine.

201
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,619
You're you, and I'm me.

202
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:20,658
When it's your call to make,
you make it.

203
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:22,579
You don't want to?

204
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,418
Even if you don't want to, you must.

205
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:25,379
You're the boss.

206
00:07:26,298 --> 00:07:26,798
Well,

207
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,459
it's fine. I'm used to it.

208
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:30,899
I mean it.

209
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:31,978
Relax.

210
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,579
There's good news, isn't there?
Must be good news.

211
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,019
Let me ask you.

212
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:37,819
Did you
join the industrial park project?

213
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:38,639
Me?

214
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:48,538
Many hands make light work.

215
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:50,199
- I contributed a little.
- You did?

216
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:50,819
Yeah.

217
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,538
I feared you hadn't joined in.

218
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:53,939
You did the right thing.

219
00:07:54,158 --> 00:07:55,619
You must do it without hesitation.

220
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,059
You scared me.

221
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,059
Also, you need to take the lead.

222
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,819
Otherwise,

223
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:02,978
it means there's a problem
with our attitude.

224
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:04,778
I'll leave it at that.

225
00:08:04,978 --> 00:08:05,978
You make the call.

226
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:07,259
You made it.

227
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:08,619
Good.

228
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,459
Look how reasonable Xie is!

229
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:11,959
Sure.

230
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,699
Look!

231
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:13,619
Yes, he is.

232
00:08:14,418 --> 00:08:15,298
Stop flirting.

233
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:16,738
Good cake.

234
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,019
Go ahead and eat.

235
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:18,858
Have some cake.

236
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:20,098
Show me the contract.

237
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:21,499
Let me see that contract.

238
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:23,298
No need, it's signed.

239
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:24,999
Try this.

240
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,338
I won't see. I was kidding.

241
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,379
You've made the decision,

242
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:29,038
right?

243
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,139
It's right here.

244
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:31,738
On the top is the biggest deal.

245
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:32,438
(Cooperative Development Contract)
Go ahead.

246
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:34,058
Stirring things up?

247
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:35,219
I'm not looking.

248
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:37,379
Well...

249
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,139
Ms. Gao decided.

250
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:42,538
Give it to me.

251
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:48,019
How's the flavor? Good, right?

252
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:49,379
Very sweet.

253
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,259
Unexpectedly,

254
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,899
the cake is very delicious.

255
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:54,499
Very good.

256
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:55,599
Eat.

257
00:08:56,058 --> 00:08:56,558
Go ahead.

258
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:07,298
Second to last page.

259
00:09:08,219 --> 00:09:09,739
Ms. Gao's signature.

260
00:09:28,178 --> 00:09:31,219
What's wrong with you?

261
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:31,938
Feeling unwell?

262
00:09:32,418 --> 00:09:32,979
Are you okay?

263
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:35,058
I'm fine.

264
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,578
I suddenly felt a bit... Nothing.

265
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:39,019
Eat your cake.

266
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:46,158
I...

267
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:50,938
Are you okay?

268
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:57,658
Thirteen...

269
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,099
Where did the 13 million

270
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:03,058
come from?

271
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,178
A loan!

272
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,658
The town government took a loan
to build the road.

273
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:11,318
They took a loan to build the factory.

274
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,298
Good. What did you use as collateral?

275
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:18,658
Well, I have

276
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,099
mortgaged our printery.

277
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:23,099
I've mortgaged it.

278
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:27,259
What's wrong with you, Xie?

279
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:30,778
Are you okay?

280
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:32,499
Ms. Li, tell me.

281
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:34,859
Did you deliberately send me away?

282
00:10:34,979 --> 00:10:35,859
And you, Mr. Tan!

283
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,499
Are you putting on a show?

284
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:38,458
You sent me away

285
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,818
and then signed the contract?

286
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,379
No, Xie, you've misunderstood.

287
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,019
We really didn't.

288
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,979
It was just a coincidence.

289
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,259
How could we be tricking you?

290
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,979
I'm just asking.

291
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:53,298
I see. I happened to leave

292
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:55,219
while they happened to come here, right?

293
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:57,999
I'm going to the bathroom.
I need toilet paper.

294
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,219
I really...

295
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:00,938
don't feel well.

296
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,818
Listen, Xie, let me explain.

297
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,698
You can't blame anyone else.

298
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:09,178
Honestly, I didn't dare tell you

299
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:09,999
at first.

300
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:11,859
I feared you'd make a fuss about this.

301
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:12,818
Now, look,

302
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,019
you're getting a stomach ache,

303
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:14,938
feeling unwell.

304
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:15,798
Well,

305
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,139
besides, I thought as soon as you came,

306
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,499
you'd figure it out right away.

307
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,739
I didn't expect you to go off

308
00:11:21,739 --> 00:11:23,379
to the Afang Bakery.

309
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:25,759
As a result, you misunderstood me.

310
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:26,778
I'm telling you,

311
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:29,619
taking loans for business
is a common practice now.

312
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:30,658
It's really no big deal.

313
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:31,899
There's no risk.

314
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,499
We've put all our family savings in

315
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:34,578
and borrowed so much more.

316
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:36,859
We put it all in. No risk?

317
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:38,019
There's no risk?

318
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:38,818
Not like that.

319
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:41,019
Let's talk about this at home. Come on.

320
00:11:41,178 --> 00:11:41,698
Xuemei.

321
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:43,979
We're leaving first!

322
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:44,739
You stay.

323
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:45,578
All of you stay.

324
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:47,178
We'll talk right here.

325
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:48,818
Stop it!

326
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:49,538
Eat your cake.

327
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:51,178
This concerns them, so we'll talk here.

328
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:51,938
Why go home?

329
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:52,859
Are we going to argue?

330
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,058
Would we even argue?

331
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:54,739
Come on.

332
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:56,379
The town officials are right here!

333
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:57,139
We're not arguing.

334
00:11:57,139 --> 00:11:57,938
- We're talking.
- Yes.

335
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:58,899
We're fixing things.

336
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:00,499
Xie, we're leaving first.

337
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:01,619
Your stomach aches?

338
00:12:01,658 --> 00:12:02,979
I have medicine for diarrhea.

339
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:04,219
Take some medicine.

340
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,379
Give it to me.

341
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,499
- Come on.
- Here.

342
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,339
I'm killing you.

343
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:14,178
What are you doing? Get down!

344
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:15,339
Get down!

345
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:16,339
Are you crazy?

346
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:17,739
Look where you are! Not your home!

347
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:20,458
This is the town government!
Watch your manners!

348
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:22,339
S-Sorry about this.

349
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:23,038
I...

350
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:24,379
Shut up!

351
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:25,739
Don't blame everyone else.

352
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:26,739
I was rude.

353
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:29,178
I decided to burn my boats.

354
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,619
I'm telling you,
if we don't build an industrial park,

355
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:34,339
we'll be left behind by this era,
you know?

356
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:35,578
Then, why didn't you tell me?

357
00:12:36,818 --> 00:12:37,859
I'm the deputy mayor.

358
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:39,938
I'm also your husband.

359
00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:43,139
Don't I have the right
to know about this first?

360
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:44,139
If you had told me,

361
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:46,259
I might have agreed.

362
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,379
I said might.

363
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:48,739
It was all negotiable,

364
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:49,739
right?

365
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:50,698
I don't agree.

366
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:52,479
This contract

367
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:53,259
is canceled.

368
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,019
You signed this contract.

369
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,219
That's your business.

370
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:57,499
Agreeing or not is my business.

371
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:58,139
I disagree.

372
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:00,219
Xie, be reasonable!

373
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:02,219
Xuemei has made the call.

374
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:03,818
Why did you object?

375
00:13:04,298 --> 00:13:05,499
Give us a reason.

376
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:06,538
She and I are one,

377
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:07,839
right?

378
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:09,418
After all, we're husband and wife.

379
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,619
She is me, and I am her.

380
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:14,658
If I say no, it means she says no. Okay?

381
00:13:14,658 --> 00:13:17,019
Mr. Xie, I understand how you feel.

382
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,538
But we must build the industrial park.

383
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:20,599
Yes.

384
00:13:20,818 --> 00:13:22,339
We must do it! Did I say I wouldn't?

385
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:24,298
But some can do it, while some can't.

386
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:25,158
No.

387
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,099
What are you doing?

388
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,418
I've had enough of you!

389
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:33,219
Enough.

390
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,019
I'm telling you,

391
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:37,259
if you dare tear up this contract today,

392
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:39,499
from today on, you're you, and I'm me.

393
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:40,818
Go ahead, tear it.

394
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,538
I've had enough of you!

395
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:47,458
What if I tear it?

396
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:48,239
Go ahead.

397
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:57,019
Fine.

398
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:57,938
What do you mean?

399
00:13:58,278 --> 00:13:58,778
You go home.

400
00:13:58,778 --> 00:13:59,278
Back off!

401
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:00,658
I'm telling you.

402
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,259
Go home.

403
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,139
Since we moved here,

404
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:04,499
have you managed our home
and the business?

405
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:05,259
Go home.

406
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:06,058
Talk right here!

407
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:07,899
Let's make it clear here!

408
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:08,499
Talk at home.

409
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,458
Why?

410
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:10,259
Go home and talk.

411
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,499
Do you feel humiliated?

412
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:12,538
Xie Chunlai.

413
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:14,619
I've been providing you
with food, drinks,

414
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,658
clothes, and daily articles.

415
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,979
I've shown you respect
in public and private.

416
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,178
I've been quite nice to you.

417
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:21,538
How about you?

418
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:25,259
When I do business,
everyone treats me politely.

419
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,538
How dare you order me around?

420
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,818
Just because of a marriage certificate?

421
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:41,318
Yes,

422
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,619
exactly that.

423
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,339
Then, I can do without it!

424
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:20,442
(Cooperative Development Contract)

425
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:34,458
That's all for today.

426
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:36,058
We'll talk another day.

427
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:37,619
Let's go.

428
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:39,099
We're leaving.

429
00:15:39,178 --> 00:15:39,938
Xuemei.

430
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:42,038
Let's go.

431
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:42,938
Take your stuff.

432
00:15:57,938 --> 00:16:00,259
I can't believe this.

433
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:04,619
I underestimated you, Gao Xuemei.

434
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:06,339
You're really something.

435
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,219
How did you do it?

436
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,458
How could you do this?

437
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,458
At home, anything goes.

438
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:18,859
But in front of so many people,

439
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,739
you just can't disrespect me.

440
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,818
You acted without telling me first!

441
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:30,019
Very clever of you!

442
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,938
What are you doing?

443
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:32,739
What are you doing?

444
00:16:33,418 --> 00:16:34,458
Is Xuemei inside?

445
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:35,379
Yes.

446
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,778
Sounds like they're fighting.

447
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:38,778
You've gone too far!
Are you in charge of it all?

448
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:39,798
I...

449
00:16:45,658 --> 00:16:46,538
Xuemei.

450
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:49,658
Don't be impulsive.

451
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,499
Why don't you come out?

452
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:57,099
Look,

453
00:16:57,798 --> 00:17:00,558
it wouldn't be right
for either of you to hurt the other.

454
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:03,578
Honestly, Xie couldn't beat you.

455
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,738
It wouldn't be good if you hurt him.

456
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,339
So, come out and talk?

457
00:17:09,698 --> 00:17:10,738
Get out!

458
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,859
All of you, get out!

459
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:14,059
He's putting on an act.

460
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:15,139
Shameless!

461
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,539
I'm not surprised at all.

462
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:17,619
Eavesdropping on me?

463
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:18,498
Get out!

464
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,458
You scared me to death!
What are you doing?

465
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:53,139
Mr. Zheng? You finally came in.

466
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:55,379
I was holding my breath,
afraid to speak.

467
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:57,139
When did Ms. Gao leave?

468
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,698
She never showed up.

469
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,178
What? Xie, what's wrong with you?

470
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:04,258
You scared me.

471
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,059
You crazy woman!

472
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,658
I want a divorce, right now!

473
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:12,339
I'm telling you,

474
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,299
I'd rather be widowed than divorced.

475
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,579
Good for divorcing!

476
00:18:19,418 --> 00:18:20,498
Hurry up and divorce.

477
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:23,978
I wish all the homeless men well.

478
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:25,738
A real man

479
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:27,978
should live alone.

480
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:33,978
Right?

481
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:40,698
Tofu.

482
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:42,616
How are you and Sun Xiaoyan?

483
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,379
We're doing fine.

484
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:53,178
I think everyone should have a family.

485
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:16,458
Mr. Xie.

486
00:19:18,978 --> 00:19:19,579
Mr. Xie.

487
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:22,218
I've talked with Mr. Zheng.

488
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,458
We'll leave the project alone for now.

489
00:19:24,738 --> 00:19:26,978
We'll hold another meeting
to discuss specifics.

490
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:30,099
I didn't tell you
about the industrial park beforehand.

491
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:33,018
I feel I must formally apologize to you.

492
00:19:33,658 --> 00:19:34,299
I'm sorry.

493
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:36,899
I hope it won't

494
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:38,938
affect your relationship with Xuemei.

495
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,859
If needed, I'll talk to Xuemei.

496
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:44,258
It's okay.

497
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:38,238
Dad.

498
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,238
Dad.

499
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:42,899
Dad, where are you going?

500
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:44,258
Going to learn.

501
00:20:44,698 --> 00:20:45,698
Did Mom know?

502
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:48,299
Mom's eating at Mr. Dong's stall.

503
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:54,978
Mr. Xie, you're here.

504
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:56,218
Ms. Gao is over there.

505
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:57,879
Noodles.

506
00:20:58,059 --> 00:20:58,619
Okay.

507
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:11,819
Mom, you talk to Dad.

508
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,579
What's he up to?

509
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,819
He took a lot of his clothes from home.

510
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:17,178
And personal belongings.

511
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:18,859
He even took the thermos.

512
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:20,218
What happened?

513
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,379
Whatever.

514
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:22,779
I don't care.

515
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:40,018
Dad, just give in a little.

516
00:21:52,184 --> 00:21:53,912
(Just Do What You Want)

517
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:12,458
Mr. Xie, your noodles.

518
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,178
It's too late, you loser.

519
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:18,978
Sir, do you have a pen?

520
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:21,018
Yes.

521
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:53,619
Divorce agreement.

522
00:22:53,978 --> 00:22:56,339
First, the business goes to me.

523
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:58,658
Second, the money goes to you.

524
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,218
Third, Xiaoyu,

525
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:02,738
a question mark.

526
00:23:06,899 --> 00:23:08,379
Xiaoyu, a question mark?

527
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:11,458
No matter what, you're mine.

528
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:14,539
Question mark.

529
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:15,339
Go!

530
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,018
Come on!

531
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:24,079
Dad.

532
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:35,859
This won't do. It's not formal.

533
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:36,938
Tell your mom.

534
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:40,299
If she really wants a divorce,
write a formal one.

535
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:41,938
You go with me.

536
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:43,599
Dad?

537
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:45,139
Just eat the noodles.

538
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:46,359
Dad.

539
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:02,738
Eat the noodles.

540
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,059
Dad?

541
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:16,458
Are you starving?

542
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,178
Come on.

543
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:18,299
There's plenty more.

544
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:20,539
Go get some more.

545
00:24:22,178 --> 00:24:23,258
This is really delicious.

546
00:24:23,978 --> 00:24:24,478
Here.

547
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:25,958
Thank you.

548
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:26,859
Eat more.

549
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:30,258
Braised pork!

550
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:31,158
Braised pork!

551
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,139
What's the occasion?

552
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:35,018
Too much.

553
00:24:35,139 --> 00:24:36,099
There's braised pork!

554
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:37,379
Ms. Xiao must have been crazy.

555
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:37,978
Thanks.

556
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:39,099
What a surprise!

557
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:40,938
Keep your voice down,
or she'll hear you.

558
00:24:42,218 --> 00:24:43,498
Want some veggies? They're good.

559
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:45,059
The food's good today.

560
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,458
Extra braised pork.

561
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:47,619
Okay, I'll get extra.

562
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:49,698
Thanks.

563
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:52,819
Braised pork, please.

564
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,178
Okay, Dongfu.

565
00:24:56,418 --> 00:24:57,178
Ms. Sun.

566
00:24:57,458 --> 00:24:57,958
Yu.

567
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:00,938
Why are you here?

568
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:03,099
Mr. Xie asked me
to cover Ms. Xiao's shift.

569
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:07,779
What's wrong?

570
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:11,198
Well,

571
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,779
listen to me,

572
00:25:14,218 --> 00:25:15,218
you can't be here.

573
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:16,458
Why?

574
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:20,619
You're taking advantage
of the town government.

575
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:22,619
What?

576
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:29,299
You're taking advantage
of the town government.

577
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,418
The meat isn't cheap!
The government didn't take advantage.

578
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:39,718
Wait,

579
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,279
Ms. Sun, I haven't gotten my food yet.

580
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,339
Have Wu get it for you.

581
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,819
I mean, you are

582
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,178
taking advantage of the government.

583
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:57,658
I'm taking advantage?

584
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:05,458
I started prepping vegetables at three,
and service starts at five-thirty.

585
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:08,178
Two and a half hours. I haven't
even had time to drink water.

586
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:09,938
Where am I taking advantage?

587
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:12,859
Cooking here isn't volunteer work,
is it?

588
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:14,139
You'll get paid, right?

589
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:15,018
Yes.

590
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:17,218
I'm providing labor!

591
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:19,738
Getting paid for that is normal,
isn't it?

592
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:21,178
What about permanent employment?

593
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,859
I didn't bring it up.

594
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:24,779
They did mention it to me.

595
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,658
See? It's a little bit of nepotism.

596
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,498
What do you mean?

597
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:34,379
You think I came here just
to get a permanent job?

598
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,819
You're making me abuse my power.

599
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:39,738
Don't you understand?

600
00:26:40,218 --> 00:26:41,218
No, I don't!

601
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:42,738
I'm here to cook.

602
00:26:42,738 --> 00:26:44,339
How did I make you abuse your power?

603
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:45,319
Well,

604
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:47,619
if it weren't for our relationship,

605
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:49,498
would they have let you work here?

606
00:26:50,218 --> 00:26:51,299
Use your head!

607
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,458
I'm telling you, you can't work here.

608
00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:54,418
Understand?

609
00:27:09,978 --> 00:27:10,978
Why did Ms. Sun leave?

610
00:27:29,978 --> 00:27:30,478
Xie.

611
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:32,658
Tofu, I was about to talk to you.

612
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:33,619
I'll go first.

613
00:27:35,218 --> 00:27:36,539
Okay, you go first.

614
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:40,698
She can't work in the canteen.

615
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:42,379
Fire her today.

616
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:44,018
Who? Sun Xiaoyan?

617
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,579
Don't play dumb.

618
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:52,018
Why fire her?

619
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:54,658
I'm going to talk about this.

620
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,619
I tried so hard
to get her here to cook for us.

621
00:27:57,738 --> 00:27:58,658
This is a good thing.

622
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,139
Why fire her?

623
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,819
I said she can't work here.

624
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:04,418
I'm seeing her now.

625
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:05,859
If she works here,

626
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,899
it's a little bit of nepotism.

627
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:10,899
I can't make this mistake.
I have principles.

628
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:12,099
I know you do.

629
00:28:12,218 --> 00:28:12,738
But...

630
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,579
But you're not making mistakes.
What are you thinking?

631
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:17,059
Well,

632
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:17,639
listen,

633
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:18,319
she...

634
00:28:19,658 --> 00:28:20,938
Why are you using my toolbox?

635
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:23,359
Just keep it simple.

636
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:25,418
I'm in charge of the canteen, right?

637
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:28,539
So, if Sun Xiaoyan makes any mistakes,
it'll be my responsibility.

638
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:29,579
Is it clear,

639
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:30,178
isn't it?

640
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:31,299
Let me borrow this, okay?

641
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:32,658
Let me use it.

642
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:35,218
Sun Xiaoyan is my girlfriend.

643
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,978
So, before you hired her,

644
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:39,339
shouldn't you have told me?

645
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:41,139
Sure, but you wanted to speak first.

646
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,938
You only told me after hiring her.

647
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:44,859
Quite clever.

648
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:46,658
Quite clever, aren't you?

649
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:47,819
Why are you being silly?

650
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,779
She's doing well,
yet you're firing her. Why?

651
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:52,498
Can Sun Xiaoyan make her own decisions?

652
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:54,518
Can she or can't she? Answer me!

653
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:55,299
Listen to me!

654
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:56,379
You've made a mistake.

655
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:58,218
You can decide on everything, can't you?

656
00:28:58,218 --> 00:28:59,418
Like using my toolbox.

657
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:01,299
You even decided for Sun Xiaoyan!

658
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,339
She's my girlfriend.

659
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,619
How could you hire her
without telling me?

660
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:07,658
Gao Xuemei decided to build the factory.
You knew that, right?

661
00:29:08,418 --> 00:29:10,200
Yet you didn't tell me,
making me look silly.

662
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,458
You're being unreasonable!

663
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:13,039
Am I?

664
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:13,899
Two different things.

665
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:15,018
Same thing.

666
00:29:15,178 --> 00:29:16,579
You have a problem.

667
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:18,059
I just can't get through to you.

668
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:19,779
What's exactly in your head?

669
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:21,178
Unreasonable.

670
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,539
Whatever. I'm not talking

671
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:23,099
to you.

672
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:24,139
I'll find someone else.

673
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:26,178
Ms. Li.

674
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:26,859
Yes?

675
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,579
Come here.

676
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:29,379
What's going on?

677
00:29:29,379 --> 00:29:30,258
Did you hear us?

678
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:31,498
You did, right?

679
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,079
Listen,

680
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:33,899
Lin Tofu

681
00:29:35,498 --> 00:29:36,139
has no issues.

682
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:38,498
I have a problem.

683
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:40,139
It's all my fault.

684
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,139
I can't

685
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,178
manage my home.

686
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,099
I can't manage the canteen either, huh?

687
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:46,399
I'm incompetent. Fire me. Do you agree?

688
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:47,079
You...

689
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,658
Mr. Lin, what's going on?

690
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:49,559
No, I...

691
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:50,678
Well...

692
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:58,099
I disagree
with Sun Xiaoyan working here.

693
00:29:58,258 --> 00:29:58,758
Well...

694
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,539
Mr. Xie is responsible for logistics.

695
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:05,099
He can hire anyone,
including Sun Xiaoyan.

696
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:07,619
But she's my girlfriend.

697
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,099
As deputy mayor, so that looks...

698
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,258
I can't make an error of principle.

699
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,258
What error?

700
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:14,379
Explain clearly.

701
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:16,139
Mr. Lin, right now, besides you,

702
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:19,178
nobody thinks
Sun Xiaoyan is taking advantage.

703
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:21,619
Sun Xiaoyan
is an independent individual.

704
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:22,978
She's not your property.

705
00:30:23,218 --> 00:30:24,258
She's good at cooking.

706
00:30:24,498 --> 00:30:26,099
You know what? Since she cooked here,

707
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:27,992
more people have gone to the canteen.

708
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:29,539
You heard her, didn't you?

709
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:33,718
Then,

710
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:36,819
she knew she would
become a full-time employee one day.

711
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:38,299
Isn't it nepotism?

712
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,099
See?

713
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:39,899
So what?

714
00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:42,899
If she's willing to stay,
I'll give her a permanent job.

715
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:45,698
Come on.
Whoever does well will become permanent.

716
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:47,738
What does it have to do with you?

717
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:49,938
Male chauvinism.

718
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:51,178
No.

719
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:53,978
It's not acceptable.

720
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,698
Mr. Lin, you can't be so selfish.

721
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:58,819
You know Sun Xiaoyan well.

722
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:01,059
Do you think
she loves to take advantage?

723
00:31:01,938 --> 00:31:04,139
Why do you think
she manages her wonton stall

724
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:05,938
while working in our canteen?

725
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:06,738
It's exhausting!

726
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:09,059
She does it
because she knows you're unwell.

727
00:31:09,218 --> 00:31:10,738
She knows you eat meals erratically.

728
00:31:11,218 --> 00:31:12,498
She wants to take care of you.

729
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,619
Listen, when I went to ask her,

730
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:18,299
she refused to come.
She wanted to focus on her stall.

731
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:19,899
I persuaded her.

732
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:21,784
I said Mr. Lin didn't eat properly.

733
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:23,498
If she cooks, he'll have an appetite.

734
00:31:24,178 --> 00:31:24,738
Hearing that,

735
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,339
she was about to cry.

736
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,218
She agreed eventually.

737
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:29,738
Why does she work so hard?

738
00:31:30,218 --> 00:31:31,059
What for?

739
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:32,579
Isn't it for you?

740
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:34,938
How could you ask me to fire her?

741
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:35,819
You fool!

742
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:37,738
I was deeply moved.

743
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,139
You're just stupid Tofu.

744
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:41,379
Take it back!

745
00:31:41,698 --> 00:31:42,539
Knock on yourself!

746
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,359
Go on!

747
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,779
You use it!

748
00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:45,458
Use it!

749
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:46,458
Use it!

750
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,099
Take it back!

751
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:47,779
Go ahead.

752
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:52,619
Well done!

753
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:54,139
I'm praising you.

754
00:31:54,418 --> 00:31:55,059
Good for you.

755
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,379
Mr. Xie, are you resigning?

756
00:31:58,379 --> 00:31:59,339
Who said I'm resigning?

757
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:01,418
I'm doing a great job.
Why would I resign?

758
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,339
Fine, I won't fix it then.

759
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:06,899
It's okay.

760
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:11,738
It's fine if a vehicle gets old.

761
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:12,658
Just get a new one.

762
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:14,218
If a brain stops working,

763
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:16,059
it'll be a big problem.

764
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,819
What a surprise, Ms. Li.

765
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:20,119
I'm off.

766
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,379
Mom.

767
00:32:33,698 --> 00:32:35,658
What's so urgent
that you have to rush to Yuehai?

768
00:32:36,698 --> 00:32:38,579
A patient I operated on a few days ago

769
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:40,339
has some abnormal readings.

770
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:42,018
He might need a second surgery.

771
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:43,779
Am I delaying you?

772
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:45,899
No, not at all.

773
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:50,599
Mom,

774
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:53,339
when was the last time
you went to Shanghai?

775
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,258
The last time to Shanghai?

776
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:00,899
I remember before I retired,

777
00:33:01,418 --> 00:33:04,299
I went to Shanghai
to attend a conference for surgeons.

778
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:06,899
Why do you suddenly ask about Shanghai?

779
00:33:07,678 --> 00:33:09,139
Nothing, I just feel

780
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,178
I'm already over 30
and haven't even been to Shanghai.

781
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:14,339
That's true.

782
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:19,418
Why don't you take Qiuping
there for a honeymoon?

783
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:21,619
Mom, what are you talking about?

784
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:23,418
Don't play dumb.

785
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,819
You two have been together
for so many years.

786
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:29,379
Your wedding should
be put on the agenda.

787
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:31,658
Well,

788
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:33,819
we've both been extremely busy lately.

789
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:34,859
There is no rush.

790
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:38,299
Still delaying?

791
00:33:39,178 --> 00:33:40,579
How much longer will you wait?

792
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,579
I'm already retired now.

793
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,619
I've been a bit busy recently,

794
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,698
but I won't be this busy
once things settle down.

795
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:50,779
I'll have time to handle your wedding.

796
00:33:52,978 --> 00:33:54,498
You haven't seen her for a while, yes?

797
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:55,938
How about this?

798
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:57,978
Just drop me off in a bit,

799
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:01,059
and go find Qiuping to discuss it.

800
00:34:01,658 --> 00:34:03,059
No time like the present.

801
00:34:03,938 --> 00:34:06,018
Mom, just leave this matter alone.

802
00:34:06,258 --> 00:34:08,379
Qiuping and I know what we're doing.

803
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:12,339
Fine. I won't interfere.

804
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,659
(Yuehai Town Steps into the New Era)
I planned to visit you this weekend.

805
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:22,779
I didn't expect you to come today.

806
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:24,899
I've been incredibly busy lately.

807
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:28,299
Today, I happened to drive my mom here,
so I came to see you.

808
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:37,496
The town government looks really nice.

809
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:38,938
There are flowers.

810
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:42,098
I planted them.
I've been tending to them.

811
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,418
We'll live here in the future, right?

812
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:48,659
Let me show you something.

813
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:53,179
What's this?

814
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:54,779
Just open it and see.

815
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,712
(Marriage Application)

816
00:35:08,978 --> 00:35:10,138
Aren't you happy?

817
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:11,879
Sure.

818
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:13,118
Well,

819
00:35:13,138 --> 00:35:14,179
when did you write this?

820
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,779
Why didn't you tell me?

821
00:35:16,299 --> 00:35:17,739
I wanted to surprise you.

822
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:21,899
Your look tells me
it's an unpleasant surprise.

823
00:35:22,418 --> 00:35:23,219
It's pleasant.

824
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,179
It's just that I feel

825
00:35:25,219 --> 00:35:27,458
I should be the one
to bring it up first.

826
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,018
Don't be old-fashioned.

827
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:30,659
Girls can also propose marriage.

828
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,578
When I get back,
I'll write an application too.

829
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:39,699
Ms. Li.

830
00:35:41,219 --> 00:35:43,659
Isn't this Liu's house?

831
00:35:44,138 --> 00:35:45,779
Yes, she rented it to us.

832
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:47,179
By the way,

833
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,299
when will your house be built?

834
00:35:51,058 --> 00:35:52,279
Very soon.

835
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:53,299
We've been quite busy.

836
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:54,598
Okay.

837
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,259
Look.

838
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,819
Your hands have calluses.

839
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:19,018
Probably from writing too much.

840
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:46,399
Mr. Lin,

841
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:48,779
wait a bit. The food isn't ready yet.

842
00:36:49,018 --> 00:36:49,659
No, I...

843
00:36:50,138 --> 00:36:50,638
Well...

844
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:51,618
What is it?

845
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:02,978
Where's Yan?

846
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,098
She quit.

847
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:06,978
This is our new cook, Dong.

848
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:08,799
Dong.

849
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:10,328
This is Deputy Mayor Lin.

850
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:11,859
Mr. Lin.

851
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:13,279
Hello.

852
00:37:14,179 --> 00:37:14,679
Hello.

853
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,219
Finish checking it before eating.

854
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:22,938
Mr. Tan.

855
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:24,679
Tan.

856
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:25,578
Yes.

857
00:37:29,978 --> 00:37:32,138
Actually, Xie,
I wanted to discuss something with you.

858
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:33,779
Time to eat.

859
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:36,699
I know

860
00:37:37,418 --> 00:37:39,339
Dong doesn't cook better
than Sun Xiaoyan.

861
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:43,118
But she is not a terrible cook.

862
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,299
That's what I wanted to say.

863
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:45,779
To be honest,

864
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:48,399
you did a good job.

865
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:53,098
Sun Xiaoyan's cooking is excellent.

866
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:54,418
I really don't understand

867
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:56,098
why Lin must fire her.

868
00:37:57,659 --> 00:37:59,578
Missing nice food is frustrating, huh?

869
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:00,739
No.

870
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:02,458
It was a win-win situation.

871
00:38:02,578 --> 00:38:05,458
I think
Lin might just be overthinking it.

872
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:07,299
He thinks it was nepotism.

873
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:08,739
After all, it's his girlfriend.

874
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:12,219
So, Lin can still have the good food
Sun Xiaoyan makes.

875
00:38:12,418 --> 00:38:13,659
Let's not interfere, okay?

876
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:14,938
We have to respect Lin, right?

877
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:16,739
Look, it could be a win-win result.

878
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:17,498
Let's try again.

879
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:19,739
How about I talk to Lin privately?

880
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:21,538
And you talk to Sun Xiaoyan.

881
00:38:21,558 --> 00:38:22,058
You sure?

882
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:23,339
- Well...
- You talk to him?

883
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:24,618
You need to...

884
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:30,078
Mr. Lin,

885
00:38:30,618 --> 00:38:32,299
Mr. Tan wants to talk to you.

886
00:38:35,098 --> 00:38:35,598
Go ahead.

887
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:39,058
Lin, have you eaten?

888
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:40,938
I...

889
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:44,958
Well...

890
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:52,098
Why didn't you talk?

891
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:55,659
Lin acted like that.
How was I supposed to talk to him?

892
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:16,859
Yan, I...

893
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:20,498
Mr. Lin,

894
00:39:20,899 --> 00:39:22,899
you shouldn't come here anymore

895
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:25,304
to avoid misunderstandings,

896
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,179
in case I'm taking advantage of you.

897
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,159
No...

898
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:32,259
Well, Yan...

899
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:35,819
(Yan's Wontons)

900
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:37,779
Yan, I-I didn't mean it like that.

901
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:41,659
Actually, Ms. Li and Mr. Zheng

902
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:43,899
have talked to me.

903
00:39:44,379 --> 00:39:45,259
They all really

904
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:47,538
like your cooking,

905
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,018
including Xie and Tan.

906
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:55,259
Everyone in the town government
loves your cooking.

907
00:40:03,578 --> 00:40:07,018
Actually, I like your cooking too.

908
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:09,038
If you want,

909
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:10,978
keep working in the canteen.

910
00:40:13,098 --> 00:40:14,498
You asked me to quit, and I did.

911
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:16,536
Now, you ask me to go back,
and I'll do it?

912
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:20,259
No, that's not what I meant.

913
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:21,098
I just...

914
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,098
I just thought...

915
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,144
I've figured it out.

916
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:27,699
As long as your salary isn't higher
than anyone else's,

917
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:28,859
you're not taking advantage.

918
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:31,538
What do you think of me?

919
00:40:32,938 --> 00:40:34,098
You think I'm venal?

920
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:36,819
Guess how much
the town government paid me?

921
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:39,259
Cooking two meals a day
for dozens of people.

922
00:40:39,578 --> 00:40:40,498
70 yuan a month.

923
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:41,958
True,

924
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:44,018
I don't make much selling wontons.

925
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:45,699
But I don't care about 70 yuan.

926
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:50,219
I'm such a fool.

927
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:53,339
Actually, Ms. Li told me.

928
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:57,498
She said you took the canteen job
mainly to look out for me.

929
00:41:02,058 --> 00:41:03,739
Yan, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

930
00:41:10,779 --> 00:41:11,978
Liu!

931
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:13,859
My chain is off! Help me fix my bike!

932
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:14,819
Okay.

933
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:30,719
Careful!

934
00:42:32,739 --> 00:42:35,779
Hello, please page 660901 for me.

935
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,578
My surname is Li. Tell him
to call back as soon as possible.

936
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:40,779
Thanks.

937
00:42:49,018 --> 00:42:49,659
